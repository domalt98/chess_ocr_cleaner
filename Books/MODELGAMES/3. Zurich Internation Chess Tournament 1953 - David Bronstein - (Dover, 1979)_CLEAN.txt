A WORD FROM THE TRANSLATOR
Surely, this is no ordinary chess book that you hold, dear Reader. Myself, I have read chess books that were entertaining, and those that were instructive; some that were historic, and a few that were downright bad. But never have I encountered a book written with such powerful style and such obvious passion for the game. The passion is infectious. The translation you hold is the final pro duct of ten years' work and four revisions- and still, I feel that it wanted more effort • • • so you can see the fascination Bronstein's book had for its translator! If my translation can infect you, the Reader, with half of that fascination, then it will be a job well done. I must thank Jack O'Keefe for his meticulous proofreading and price less editorial work. Jim Marfia [iii]
INSTEAD OF A PREFACE
As I began work on my first chess book, I put myself mentally in the reader's place, recalling the excitement with which I used to open each new chess book, hoping to find vital thinking there, clear words, and a wondrous tale of the art of chess. I absorbed a great deal from books, and to this day I cherish the memory of the best of them. Books about chess tournaments belong to a special class of litera ture, which would seem at first blush to be rather restrictive of the author's creative possibilities, since he must write, not on themes of his own choosing, but about chess material already created. But this is not quite true. The author is free to treat the games any way he wishes, to make generalizations, and to uncover the ideas and plans actually ex ecuted, as well as those that could have occurred in the actual or some other game. The book of a strong tournament is more than just a games collection. When its participants are the world's strongest players, then the games are mutually interdependent, and brimming with ideas, which crystallize and develop as the event progresses. Thus, the tournament as a whole represents a step forward in the development of chess creativity. We may take as examples of such tournaments the events at Hastings 1895, St Petersburg 1914, New York 1924, Moscow 1935, and Groningen 1946. Be yond doubt, Zurich-Neuhausen 1953 deserves a place among them. In working on this book, I started from the premise that every full bodied game of chess is an artistic endeavor, arising out of a struggle between two masters of equal rank. The kernel of a game of chess is the creative clash of plans, the battle of chess ideas, which takes on its highest form in the middlegame. This book examines a number of standard positions which occur as a result of the collision of plans; also examined are such strategic con cepts as darksquare weaknesses, the advantage of the two bishops, play and counterplay on opposite wings, the relative strengths of the pieces, overprotection, and so forth. Such elements of the struggle as intui tion, resourcefulness, and determination are discussed too. The games of a tournament of grandmasters bring the reader into the creative circle of the contemporary leaders of chess, showing him the rise and fall of battle as well as the manner in which a game of chess is created. It is the author's intention to discourse upon the least ex plored and most interestin� stage of the game: the middlegame, and the way it is handled by today s grandmasters. That is the basic aim of this book. The author has tried to avoid weighing down his book with variations. Variations can be interesting, if they show the beauty of chess; they become useless when they exceed the limits of what a man can calculate; and they are a real evil when they are substituted for the study and clarification of positions in which the outcome is decided by intuition, fantasy and talent. Along with this, it was my hope that the player who read this book wouia raise himself thereby to a rather higher level of playing strength. The reader will see errors, too, in the games of this tournament; but he will not be too severe in his judgment of the masters if he pictures to himself the peculiar nature of the chess struggle. At the board there sits a living person, with all his everyday thoughts and worries, some times far removed from chess. While selecting his plan, or even his next move, he cannot hel� thinking about his standing in the tournament, re membering yesterday s result, looking at other games. A game is not an analysis: everything must be worked out in one's head, without moving the pieces, without consulting a book or asking advice from anyone • • • [v] The grandmaster thinks and thinks -- one last look at the clock - "Time to decide; I'11 risk it! " -- and the knight goes to eS. Of course it's easy, a whole year later, after studying all of the analyses and spendin� days on the position, to tell the reader, with absolute cer tainty: A mistake; the careful Nel was to be preferred . • . " It may be that mistakes will turn up in my analyses and evaluations as well, although I have tried to keep them to a minimum. It is my hope that the reader will be indulgent, and help me to correct them. It is with trepidation, then, that I submit my work to the judgment of the readers. I will consider my ends achieved if the contents of this book expand the reader's chess horizon, increase his mastery of the game, give him some idea of the state of the art, and help him more fully to value -- and still more to love ---the depths of chess.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
Now that my book is ready for its second edition, I would like to explain today what I had to pass over in the preface to the first edi tion four years ago. The work I submitted to the readers' judgment at that time was a work which had little in common with the commentar ies usu ally seen in the chess press. "Rotework" is a thing abhorrent to art and l it erature alike; thus, it should be still less acceptable in chess, which ac tually falls somewhere in an intermediate zone between art and litera ture. I do not wish to say anything against the numerous tournament and reference books that are being published, but for some years now a con siderable decline has been noticed in the appetite of chessplayers for this type of literature, and yesterday's insatiable demand has slack ened. Under these circumstances, how would the public accept a large and unfortunately rather expensive tournament book, such as this one? I had no wish to become a variat ions-monger; nor did I want the role of annotator-cum-guide. I felt that the author' s ideas and conclusions should form the basis of this book, w ith the moves played in each game serving to annotate them, as it were. I tried to let the book's contents display the richness and limitless expanse of chess ideas, and to let the format resemble that of a literary work. To judge from all the accepted indicators, the author appears to have accomplished his purpose, at least in part: the book sold out very quickly, and the reviews were favorable. Most valuable to me, however, were the many letters and opinions I received from readers (and I re gret not having answered nearly enough of them) . There I found, along with justified criticism of my book' s shortcomings, approval of the basic principles by which it was written. Those letters have been the finest possible reward for my labors, and I should like to take this opportunity to offer my heartfelt thanks to all who wrote me. I should like especially to thank Peter Romanovsky for his detailed review (helpful to readers and the author alike) which appeared in "Shakhmaty v SSSR". I was happy to agree to the publishers' suggestion of a second edi tionj I intended to excise all obsolete and unimportant materials, to develop other material a bit more fully, and to expand the preface to reflect the most recent developments in the world of chess. Thus, this second edition devotes a great deal less space to text, in games which did not serve my purpose of uncovering and describing the ideas of the art of chess. This applies especially to games from the later rounds, when the final standings of the tournament had already been largely determined, and the tension had slackened somewhat. Addi tionally, two or three errors in analysis, discovered by the readers and the author, have been corrected; the proofreading has been up graded, and some diagrams revised. I would like to close this segment with the hope that in the future my chessplaying audience will continue to aid the author in his work with their alert criticism, as well as their words of praise. Since this is a book devoted mainly to the middle phase of the game of chess, it might be appropriate to begin with a few words about the evolution of opening ideas and the modern openings repertoire. In former times ---shall we say, the latter half of the preceding century---a game generally opened with the king's pawn, to which Black would, in the majority of cases, reply l • • e7-e5. Such defenses as the Sicilian and the French were also employed, of course, but less frequently. With some e�ceptions, over half of the games played in any tournament would be open games, and sometimes a much greater percentage than that. At the close of the last century and the beginning of the [vii] Romanovsk alike ***** present one, the closed games for White and the semi-open games for Black became very �opular. Thus, in the Cambridge Springs tournament of 1904, the Queen s Gambit was the most common opening, with the Ruy Lopez second and the Sicilian third. The Indian defenses also began to appear in the tournaments of the 1890's and 1900's: these were the har bingers of new ideas. The 1920's witnessed the almost total disappearance of the open games, with the exception of the Ruy Lopez, from important tournaments, and the rise of the Queen's Gambit and other Queen's Pawn games. White's success with the Queen's Gambit and the Ruy led gradually to the pop ularization of the asymmetrical defensive systems: the Indian against 1 d2-d4, and the Sicilian against 1 e2-e4. This was a very fruitful period for the development of opening ideas. The victories of the young grandmasters were closely bound up with their discovery of new openings: the Nimzo-Indian, Reti's Opening, Grunfeld's Defense, Alekhine's De fense. At the strong double-round tournament at Bled 1931, which included Alekhine, Bogolyubov, Nimzovich, Vidmar, Flohr, Tartakover, S�ielmann and Maroczy, among others, 77 Queen's Gambits and other Queen s Pawn games were played; of these, White won 29, and Black only 13. In the same event, 21 games used Indian Defenses, of which White could win only 2, while losing 14. Is in any wonder that, in the era that followed, en compassing the 1930's and 1940's, fewer and fewer Queen's Gambits would be seen? The careers of many Soviet and non-Soviet players owed a great deal to the creation and development of new systems in the King's Indian and Sicilian, as well as in the Nimzo-Indian and Grunfeld Defenses. To day, one may separate all openings, Black and White, into three major groupings. In the first grouping, both sides follow classical principles, devel oping pieces, occupying space, creating a pawn center, avoiding weak nesses, etc. This is the shape of the struggle in the great majority of variations of the Queen's Gambit, Ruy Lopez, French, and some systems of the Sicilian and Nimzo-Indian Defenses. Black knows that in these variations, especially in symmetrical positions, the advantage of the first move counts heavily, and he faces a long and patient struggle for equality. He has few winning chances, but if he works hard and plays cautiously, he may get a draw. The results of the World Championship match between Capablanca and Alekhine may be taken as typical for such openings. Of the thirty-four games of that match, thirty-three opened with the queen's pawn; twenty-five games were drawn, White won six, and Black two. Masters nowadays tend to avoid such openings, shunning sym metrical setups in favor of defenses which offer counterchances. Thus we come to the second group of openings, in which one side fol lows classical principles, while the other sid e consciously flouts a few, in order to obtain active play for his pieces, or an attack on the enemy pawn center, or sometimes sim�ly for the sake of complicating. Such are the main lines of the King s Indian, Sicilian, Grunfeld and Nimzo-Indian, and some forcing lines of the Queen's Gambit. To the third group we may assign those openings in which White uses the opening phase not to occupy, but to control, the center squares, avoiding early definition of the pawn structure, and retaining maxi mum flexibility, while preparing for a war of maneuver. While this is going on, White is ready to stir up complications at an appropriate moment, or---should he secure some positional plus ---to boil the game down to a technical stage. This group comprises the Closed Variation of the Sicilian, a number of lines in the Reti, the English, the King's Indian Reversed, and a few others. It should be noted here that giving an opening a name does not auto matically set the course of the opening struggle. For example: in the Queen's Gambit, one may play the Orthodox Defense, which is a typical form of the struggle on a classical footing. But one may also playBot- [viii] vinnik's line, or the risky "Peruvian" variation, with forcing play and counterchances for Black. The Queen's Indian is not one of the symmet rical openings, but it does not give Black any real counterchances at all. And the Nimzo-Indian, one of the most outstanding and hardiest of defenses the "Hypermodern" school of the 1920's ever produced, allows a flexible transition either to positional schemes or to sharp varia tions. These changes in our conception of the opening closely �aralleled the development of chess ideas in general. The Queen's Gambit s greatest popularity coincided with the period when chess was completely dominated by the pr,inciples of the positional school. With all the good these principles have done, their one major shortcoming must be pointed out: the evaluation of positions by externals alone. In the eyes of Tarrasch's disciples --and he was the propagandist of Steinitz' ideas --such fac tors as a backward pawn, or a powerful pawn center, or an advantage in development, were decisive, both in the evaluation of one's own position and in setting up a plan of action. "If one piece stands poorly, the whole game stands poorly," said Tarrasch. The principles of the posi tional school, expressed in simple instructional form by Tarrasch, be came inviolable axioms of chess to many of his contemporaries. And thus arose the misconception, which persists to this day, of the so-called "consistent" game, in which one player carries out, from beginning to end, his logical plan, almost as if he were demonstrating a theorem of geometry. In the annotations to such an "ideal" game, one player always appears as the keeper of principle, the other as its transgressor. The "good" player then accumulates positional advantages and places them in a vault, much as if he were saving to buy a motorcycle. Having accumulated the proper amount, he then launches a combinative attack, winding it up with an instructive mate, or with a still more instructive win of the ex change. And just what, you may ask, was his opponent doing all this time? Why, gazing phlegmatically at his backward pawns and poorly-p,laced pieces, shrugging his shoulders, and then finally: "Black resigns. ' I doubt if it needs to be demonstrated that such games never occur be tween two grandmasters of equal ability, and that the annotators -- a role generally assumed by the winner -- turned what they wished to be into what actually happened. The views of the positional school held sway in chess for a long time, but their weak side came to light in the 1920's. As the Queen's Gambit began to fade from the openings lists, so the names of Nirnzovich, Reti, Tartakover and other masters began to appear more and more frequently at the top of tournament crosstables, while these players carne out strongly against one-sided understanding and exaggeration of the role of positional principles. Around 1935, the young masters of our country made their internation� al debut, with Botvinnik at their head; later, they were to advance to the forefront of the world's players. Their continuing successes gave some observers the impression of a Soviet school of chess � some sort of aggregate of identical chess ideas and views. I don't fina this to be entirely true. As a matter of fact, the Soviet family of chess masters includes players of the most diverse styles. For example, Spassky and Petrosian, to judge from their styles of play and differing conceptions of the game, are as unlike one another as were Spielmann and Schlechter; and Tal as is far removed from Botvinnik as Lasker was from Capablanca. Now, what sort of ideas characterize the 1950's? What contribution did this tournament in Switzerland make to the development of-these ideas? And what is to be the direction of further progress in chess? First, let us note the great erudition of chessplayers who have ab sorbed the experience of previous generations, allowing them now to [ix] ***** chess, find fight with still more courage, forethought, fantasy and risk -- all based on sober assessment of the pros and cons of the intended oper ation. Our understanding of positional play has matured immeasurably. Where Tarrasch taught us to avoid weaknesses in our own position while striv ing to create them in our opponent's position, to accumulate small ad vantages, to occupy open lines, and never to begin an attack without sufficient grounds, today things are sometimes done altogether differ ently. We might give ourselves weak spots and weak pawns, in order to distract our opponent; give up open lines, in order to save the rooks for other, more promising plans; or mount an attacking demonstration, in order to hide our real intentions. The number of standard defensible positions, which every chessplay- er knows he can fall back on in case of need, has also grown by leaps and bounds. We now find that many positions which were formerly consid ered lost can be defended successfully, even actively; but this requires, firstly: a tense game of calculation, and secondly: the ability to per ceive the proper moment to abandon the weakness to its fate and carry the fight to a new sector. Only now has it become clear that this was precisely Emanuel Lasker's standard approach to the game, and that one of his major advantages over his rivals lay in the fact that none of them understood it. On the other hand, this approach was hardly Lasker's only distin guishing characteristic. He was the game's great psychologist, who knew better than anyone how to make the pendulum of battle swing left, then right, never overstepping the bounds of safety himself, while impercep tibly goading his opponent over the edge. He would deliberately play second-rate moves, practically inviting his orthodox opponent to punish him. Nowadays, even this style has been analyzed and superseded. Today's players are ready at times to give their opponents what would appear to be a positional advantage from the very first moves. Clear examples of this are the positions that arise in the King's In dian after • • e5:d4, as well as the group of positions after 1 d4 Nf6
2 c4 cS 3 dS e6 4 Nc3 ed 5 cd. The Boleslavsky Variation .of the Sici
lian, with its gaping hole at dS and the hopelessly backward pawn on d6, might seem unbelievably daring, but nonetheless it withstands ev ery assault. In this book, we will find a number of such examples. The reader will also find here descriptions of the technical ways and means employed by the contemporary master in the middlegame. The concept of technique is much broader now than it was a few decades ago, andwhat was once a rare occurrence, a lucky find, is now the tool of the masses. Without technique, one cannot attain mastery of any form; it is no less impossible in chess. However, the importance of technique in chess should not be exaRger ated, either. The end phase of the game, frequently described as a matter of technique", is certainly not always that clear and simple. Thirty years ago, Capablanca was considered the greatest technical player in the world; today it is Smyslov. After analysis of the so called technical games of Capablanca and Smyslov, I concluded that they are based on the combinative element and on far-seeing and accurate an alysis, and that as a consequence their technique is of an unusually high order. The same could be said, to a greater or lesser degree, of the endgames played by man¥ grandmasters. I will mention onl¥ two here from this tournament: Euwe s against Stahlberg, and Gligoric s against Euwe. Another characteristic quality of the contemporary creative output, which the reader will note more than once in the games of this tour nament, is a readiness to react instantly to any change in the oppo nent's plans, and to make radical alterations in one's own plan, if [x] given sufficient justification. One of the most prominent -- and prom�s�ng -- tendencies which came forward in the course of this tournament was a penchant for wide-open piece play almost from the first moves. Apparently Morphy's style re tains an irresistible fascination for chessplayers in every age, and a return to this style, refined perhaps to a higher level, is the dream of all players, grandmasters included. To me, it appears that we are closer to this ideal now than we have been at any time in the past cen tury. This new tendency, whose representatives have blazed a trail through the USSR Championships, the 1955 and 1958 Interzonal tournaments, and the 1959 Candidates' tournament, is characterized by an effort to take the game out of its logical channels at any cost, redirecting it into the combinative -- or, more accurately, the calculative. The material side of the question -- a pawn more or an exchange less -- has no spe cial significance. There is absolutely no need to demonstrate the com bination's correctness in every variation. More likely the reverse may be true: in the majority of cases, it turns out that the defending side could have held out by finding a series of saving moves. But here the New Wave grandmaster trusts in himself and in his phenomenal ability to calculate a vast number of long and complicated variations. Sometimes this can give the game a very strange turn indeed. As one positional master said, "I fought him (a master of the calculative style) for thirty-two moves, and never guessed his r�ply, except once, when he had to take my queen." The foremost advocates of this dynamic style today are undoubtedly Mikhail Tal and Boris Spassky. Of course, complicating and turning the game into a war of calculation are not the only weapons in the arsenal of these unusually talented and well-rounded players. They are past masters of the techniques of positional play, conduct brilliant endgames, know the openings well, and surpass other masters precisely in their skill at giving the game a dynamic twist, making it the sort of game which is absolutely impossible to evaluate by landmarks; willy-nilly, one must then play "move by move", or perhaps even "variation by var iation". The time came for one of them to try his mettle, and the viability of his personal style, in single combat against the most powerful player of the past two decades: Mikhail Moiseevich Botvinnik. The results of that encounter and of the tournaments that led to it show, first of all, that in Mikhail Nekhemevich Tal we have the representative of a definite new direction; and second, that the existence of this direction does not by any stretch of the imagination signify an end to the kind of chess strug gle that is based not only on the computation of variations, but on logic and principle as well. The author of this book, in the course of his twenty-year life in chess, has played quite a few sharp, tense games, where he had to bal ance for a while on a sword edge; but I would certainly be the last to conclude that chess consists s olely of calculating variations. And I would hope that, rather than see the further course of chess history bear out such a conclusion, the new style of play will instead become but one of many elements in the arsenal of creative techniques that are comprised in the art of chess.

ROUND ONE
1. Szabo-Geller
(Catalan Opening) I have long suspected, when ever the books I have read began discussing darksquare weaknesses or an attack on the dark squares, that the subject under discussion was not only beyond my understan ding, but beyond the author's as well. "Certainly,", I would say to myself, "it must be true that the enemy dark squares will be weak if his pawns stand on light squares and he loses his dark square bishop. But if he then removes all of his pieces from the dark squares, what will be left for me to attack?" Such was my line of reasoning, until the day I realized that a weakness of the dark squares is also a weakness of the pieces and pawns on the light squares. Light square weaknesses are also possi ble, resulting in a weakening of the enemy pieces and pawns on the dark squares ---as occurred, for example, in the Geller - Najdorf game in Round 13. The point of an attack on the dark squares is that, by placing my pawns and pieces on the dark, I attack my opponent's pieces and pawns on the light. The Szabo - Geller game pro vides a clear example of the me thod of exploiting a darksquare weakness; and the combination which was possible after Black's 24th fairly begs to be included in a textbook, taking place as it does entirely on light squares.

Bf8-e7 Qd8:e7 Bc8-b7 c7-c5 Nd7:c5 Rb8-c8 Nd5-f6 A small but serious inaccuracy: Black removes this piece from the main theater of operations. Addi tionally, the combination 17N:b5 ab 18 b4 now becomes possible, due to the insufficiently protected rook at c8. Szabo, however, con tinues with his plan, fixing the pawns at a6 and b5 on their light squares. 16 . • Nb6 would have been much better for Black: increasing his control of c4 would have made it more difficult for White to decide. on b2-b4.

the rook: 22 Q:c8+ B:c8 23 R:c8+ NeB 24 Ne5!, and there is no stopping 25 Bc6.
22. a2-a3 Nf6-d5
Seeing that White's position al squeeze could become very dan gerous, should he succeed in oc cupying the seventh rank or in establishing his knight on c5, Geller decides to complicate (his move also stops both threats).
23. Qc3-d4
24. Nf3-el
25. Qd4-c5
f7-f6 e6-e5 A consistent, though rather un inspired, continuation. 25 Qa7! would certainly have been much prettier, retaining his hold on the dark squares while attacking the enemy pieces and pawns on the light squares. Black would be un able to smoke the queen out, since 25 .. Ra8 would obviously fail ag ainst 26 B:d5+; while after 25 .. Kf8 26 Nd3 Ra8 2 7 Qc5, the ex change of queens would bring the white knight to c5. And finally, 25 .. Rd7 brings on an elegant lit tle combination: 26 Q:b7! If Black takes the queen, then 27 B:d5+, followed by 28 ReS+ leads to the complete extermination of Black's pieces - curiously enough, all of them perish on light squares. Black may have intended to ans wer 25 Qa7 with 25 .. e4, and if
26 B:e4, not 26 ..Nf4? (which would
be nicely refuted by 27 Bf3), but simply 26.. Q:e4 27 Q:b7 Q:e2, with an unclear �arne. On 25 .. e4, how ever, White s bishop would leave the blocked diagonal for an equ ally successful career on its neighbor (with 26 Bh3). 25.
26. b4:c5
Qe7:c5 White would have maintained a clear advantage with 26 R:c5, but Szabo probably thought that his pin on the knight, combined with his threat to advance the c-pawn would assure him victory. However, Black finds the defensive maneu ver .. Rd8-d7-e7. 26.

3. Nb1-c3 Bf8-b4
4. e2-e3
Aron Nimzovich, who invented this defense, could hardly have thought that thirty years later the masters of chess still would not have solved the basic prob lem: whether �utting the ques tion to Black s bishop with an immediate 4 a3 is good or bad. Naturally, if we knew it to be good, that would render all oth er tries pointless, to say the least. 4.
5. Bf1-d3
6. Ng1-f3
c7-c5
O-O
d7-d5 Nimzovich never used to ad vance his c-pawn to cS without need; he hoped that, after he gave White doubled pawns by means of the exchange at c3, sooner or later he could induce White to play d4-d5, after which he could establish his knight at c5. A lot of water has gone un der the bridge since, and the modern master puts no great stock in that far-otf prospect of capi talizing on the doubled c-pawns. Instead, the immediate counter attack on the center with every means available has become one of the standard ideas for Black in the Nimzo-Indian.
7. o-o
8. a2-a3
9. b2:c3
10. Bd3:c4
Nb8-c6 Bb4:c3 d5:c4 Qd8-c7 Today, this position has been studied as thoroughly as were the Muzio and Evans Gambits a century ago. What are the basic features of this position, and how does the evaluation of those features give rise to the further plans for both sides? The placement of White's pieces radiates a great deal of poten tial energy, which ought to be [3] converted into kinetic-White must set his center pawns in motion, activating both his rooks and his deeply-buried darksquare bishop. The most logical plan would seem to be the advance of the e-pawn, first to e4, and then to eS, to drive Black's knight from f6 and lay the groundwork for a kingside attack. Black in turn must either pre vent the e-pawn's advance or counterattack the white pawn center, which will lose some of its solidity the moment the pawn advances from e3 to e4. In this game, Reshevsky com bines both of Black's ideas to achieve a favorable disposition of his forces, while Najdorf does not put nearly enough vig or into the execution of his plan.
11. a3-a4
Of all the possible continu ations that have been used here, this one may well be the least logical: it resolves only one minor problem, the development of the queen' s bishop- and to a poor square, at that. The pawn at cS will find defenders eas ily enough, and the bishop will find itself out of the action. That outflung pawn at a4 will not be a jewel in White's posi tion either. 11.

b7-b6 Bc8-b7 Rf8-d8 Nc6-a5 b6:c5 Bb7-e4 Ra8-b8 ( See diagram next page ) Another weak point in White's position: Black now controls b3. White cannot play 18 Rb1, and
18 Nd2 is not attractive either.

(Benoni Defense) It ' s a difficult thing to main tain obj ect ivity when comment ing on one's own games . Variat ions running in the commentat or ' s fa vor are always interes t ing , s o deta i l s f l ow quick and plent i ful from the �en ; variat ions which favor one s opponent , however , are I often unc lear as can be . For one s own m1• s tak e s , one seeks ( and general ly f ind s ) j us t ifi cation ; whi le the opponent's er rors seem so natural as to need no exp lanat ion whatever . So even bef ore beg inning to comment on my game from Round One , I fee l compe l led t o note that Black did not have a dec i s ive advantage unt i l very late in the game , a l most the very end . Psychol ogic a l ly , White ' s loss can be traced to the fac t that he mis sed the [7] turnin� point of the game at which 1t was neces sary fo� him to beg in giving serious thought t o the problem of how to get a draw . . As regard s the pure ly ches s 1c reas ons for his l os s , these I shall try t o i lluminate in my not es .

First , he undermine s the spearhead of the white pawn chain , the pawn on dS ; in add it ion , after the un avoidabl e . . a7 -a6 and b5:a6 , he obtains the good diagonal a6 - f 1 f or his bishop , which would have far fewer prospec t s along the c 8 -h3 diagonal . The two open f i les Black obtains on the queen s ide , a l l owin� him act ive play against Whi�e s a- and b-pawns , also sp eak 1n favor of the sac rifice . Nor ought we to forget Black ' s bishop at g 7 : s inc e Black intends t o l eave his e-pawn at e7 in this system, the bi shop ' s sphere of act ivity i s automatic ally increased . And f inal l y , there i s the interest ing s trate g ic idea ( enc ountered al s o in other var iat ions of the King's Indian ) of deve l op ing the queen ' s rook without moving it from its original square . Of course , the sacrifice has its def ic ienc ie s as we l l , chief among these be ing the pawn defi c i t . Shou ld White gradual ly suc ceed in overcoming a l l his d if f i cul t ies , and reach an endgame , he wi l l have exc e l l ent winning chan ces . It is for this las t reason that this variat ion was not seen in any more game s from this t our nament .

As recent ly as the 1948 Wor ld ' s Championship , the King's Ind ian f igured in on ly two game s out of f if ty . Here [11] in Zurich , one out of three game s opened with 1 d2-d4 turned int o a King ' s Ind ian , and fore ign p layers used it just as often as our s d id . The d iagrammed posit ion i s a fami l iar one to theory ; the text move is one of the lates t di scov eries . Wishing t o deve lop his bishop to e 3 , White also over protec t s his e-pawn! The knight at d4 i s temporari ly undefended , of course , and Black could win a center pawn by 12 . . Nf : e4 13 N : e4 B : d4 ; but then it would be White's turn to move , and he would se ize the key square f6 with 14 BgS Qd 7 1 5 Nf6+ B : f6

d ian" b i shop , without which a l l Ind ian conf igurations bec ome point le s s .

Qd8-a5 Nd7-b6 Bc8-d7 Stahlberg decides to rid his position once and for all of the threat of a black pawn advance to a3. This move deprives the square b3 of pawn protection, but it also strengthens the po sition of the pawn at b2 and generally of the whole constel lation a3-b2-c3. The next stage of the game - roughly to move 30- consists of skillful maneuvers from both sides, inducing weaknesses, White's preparation for e4-e5 and Black's for .. d7-d5 or • . f7- f5, and mutual prevention of these breaks. 18. 19 .

Ra8-d8 Bd7-c8 Nb6-d7 Nd7-f6 Rd8-d7 Rd7-e7 The next two moves are some what unusual, both for White and for Black: Black concen trates maximum firepower against the pawn at e4, an assault which White tries to divert by threat ening to take on d6. It is en tirely characteristic that, in order to carry out this idea, White can find no better re treat square for his central ized knight at d4, the pride of his position, than back to its original square g1, since all other retreat squares would in terfere, in one way or another, with the coordination between his pieces. This seems an appropriate time to impart to the reader the sec ret of the d6-pawn in the King's Indian Defense. This pawn, al though backward on an open file, proves nevertheless a tough lit- [12] tle nut to crack, because it is so hard to reach. It might seem that nothing could be simpler than dropping the knight back from d4, but the problem is that White needs his knight precisely on d4, where it observes the squares bS, c6, e6 and fS, and neutralizes the power of the bi shop at g7. Only after White has taken precautions against all of Black's possible attacks ( ..a4- a3, . • Bc8-e6, . • f7-f5) can his knight allow itself to leave the center; but meanwhile Black has time to regroup. So the weakness of the d6-pawn turns out to be largely fictive. Modern methods of opening play allow for many such fictive weak p,awns, but it was precisely this 'permanent" weakness at d6 which so long condemned the King's In dian to the list of dubious open ings.
24. Nf3-g1
The knight will return, five moves later, to help the pawn on e4 cross the Rubicon. The pawn could have been pushed at once, but that would have given up con trol of the fS square; Black's bishop could go there, and after 24 eS BfS, White would have had to sacrifice his queen by taking the knight at f6 with his pawn - but that would win for White . The simple 24 • • de, on the other hand, would give Black excellent play. White could have taken the a pawn here, but at too great a price: White needs his darksquare bishop as much as Black does. Boleslavsky's 24th move is an invitation to White's rook to cap ture that long-disputed point at last; after 25 • • Nb6, however, Black's knight enters c4. Stahl berg's decision is most probably the correct one: before proceed ing with the siege of the d-p,awn, he exchanges off the "Indian ' bi shops. 24.

Nf6-d7 Nd7-b6 Kg8:g7 Nb6:c4 Bc8-e6 The position appears basically unchanged, but an important event regarding ening tirely lou|-disputed has taken place: the disappear ance of the darksquare bishops, and of the pawns at c4 and d6. With the bishops' disappearance, both sides must now make some ad justments in their basic strate gies. Black, for example, must give top priority to securing his position on the long diago nal, and against the incursion of a white pawn to f6 and queen to h6. Considering the serious ness of this threat, Boleslavsky's last move was a very good one: the bishop is ready for action on the a2-g8 diagonal, and the f-pawn, by going to f6, covers the king against any attacks from the main road; the bishop replaces the pawn at f7. White, for his part, must punch a hole in this new defensive line at any cost, or else the initiative will pass to his opponent, and all the weaknesses in White's position, which were of only passing int erest so long as he was on the offensive (b3, the lack of pawn control of d3, c3 and f3 and the passive bishop at g2 �, might become the basis for combinations. 29 .

9. Geller,_Euwe
{Nimzoindian Defense) One of the tournament's best games, and the recipient of a brilliancy prize. White initia ted a powerful attack on the king by sacrificing his c4-pawn. This attack gave Geller every hope of success, provided Black held to the traditional sort of queen side counterattack. Euwe, how ever, carried out two remarkable ideas: 1) utilizing his queen side lines of communication for an attack on the king's wing, and 2) decoying the enemy's forces deep into his own rear area, with the aim of cutting them off from the defense of their king. It's a most diverting specta cle to watch White' s pieces in their frontal assault on the king, burrowing further and further, while Black is transferring his forces by roundabout routes.

A small but significant opening subtlety: Black substituted .. b6 and . . Bb7 for the more usual . . Nc6 and .. O-O; and White, who failed to notice in time to react correctly with 7 Ne2, must now spend an extra tempo preparing e3-e4. Such details should never be underestimated, but neither should they be overvalued. Occa sionally it is said that White's advantage consists of his right to the first move: should he lose a tempo, then, the advantage must necessarily pass to Black. Prac tically speaking, however, the ad vantage of playing White boils down to greater freedom in selec ting a plan to suit one's tastes; once the game has settled into its ordained track, the loss of a single tempo is not always so serious. 8.

16.. N:f6, to pin the knight af
ter all, piling up on the king with the combined firepower of queen, rooks and three minor pieces. Even now, White needs only two moves to transfer his rook and queen to the h-file, and then it might appear that nothing could save the black king. Euwe, however, is not easily fl ustered. Remember that in his lifetime he played more than seventy games with Alekhine, the most feared attacking player of (17) our time.
16. b6-b5!
The beginning of a remarkable plan. Clearly, any defensive ma neuvers on the kingside are fore doomed, since they involve pieces with an inconsequential radius of activity ( .. Rf7, . . Qe7, etc. ) . But Black does have another de fensive resource, and that is counterattack! The bishop at b7, the rook at c8, and the knight at c4 are all well-based; all that remains is to bring up the queen. The basis for this counterattack is Black's preponderance on the central squares. With 16 .. b5, Black reinforces the knight on c4 and opens a path for the queen to b6 . Still, one cannot help feeling that his operations are too little and too late . ..
17. Rf4-h4 Qd8-b6
Pinning White's queen to the defense of the d-pawn, Black prevents the intended 18 QhS. After 17 QhS Qb6 18 Ne2 Ne5, we get the echo-variation, with the white rook unable to get to h4.

Qh7:h8 Rc8-c2 Threatening mate in a few moves: 24 . . R:g2+, 25 • . Qc4+, etc. De tailed analysis, requiring more than just one week's time, showed that White could have saved him self from mate by finding a few "only" and very difficult mov es. First, he has to play 24 d5; if then 24. . Qb6+ 25 Kh 1 Qf2 26 Rg1 B:d5, White saves himself with

move is 27 Q:h6. Black would still have bishop and two pawns for his rook then, which would leave him good winning chances, considering the open position of White' s king. It goes without saying that Geller had no prac tical chance to find all of these moves over the board. [18] The analysts also showed that the . . Rf8-h8 idea was actually a little premature, and that . . Rc4 first was better. However, those who love chess will find it dif ficult to agree with this. Moves like 22 . . Rh8 are not forgotten.

e6:d5 . . ' . Try�ng to �mprove one s posl- tion, and finding the correct [19] idea to accomplish that end, is one of the bases of chess strat egy in every phase of the game. The proper move order also plays an important part, but this falls under the heading of tactical im plementation, which of course is a major determinant of the even tual success of the strategic plan. Here, White' s basic idea is obvious: he needs a good devel opment for both his bishops. He can accomplish this in two ways: either by playing a4 followed by Ba3, or by taking de be, and then playing c4. Apparently against all logic, however, White places his bishop on a diagonal which is occupied by pawns, seemingly in viting Black to play .. c4 him self, and shut the bishop in for good. Why? As it turns out, 11 a4 would have been met by 11 .. cd 12 cd Bg4, or 12 ed Ne4, attack ing the c-pawn; and 11 de be
12 c4 would allow the reply
12 . . Rb8, preventing 13 Bb2. Having played 11 Bb2, however, White can go ahead with his c3-c4, either at once or after the pre liminary 12 de be; so Black's re ply is not merely useful, but al most obligatory. The next phase of the struggle is defined by the new pawn structure: already it has much less to do with the tastes and preferences of the two players than it has to do with their choice of opening. White will set his f- and e pawns in motion, creating a passed d-pawn and combining the advance of these central pawns with an attack on the f-file. Black, with three pawns to two on his right wing, cannot do too much with them for the moment, since he must first battle the white bishop pair and central preponderance. 11.

c5-c4 Bc8-g4 Nf6-e4 Black could have altered the course of the struggle here by taking the knight: 13 • . B:f3
14. gf NhS; but he refrained
from doing so. The standard ex planation -- White would be left with the two bishops, a strong ****** pawn center, and the open g file -- could hardly have de terred him, since one bishop would be blocked by its own pawns, and the pawn center is not dangerous for the moment. If 15 e4, for example, then 15 .. Nf4 16 Khl Qh4 17 Bel Nd3

21 f3 f5 22 e5 Rad8, and the

A direct attack on the king would be Black's only possible counter, and it would have had very small chances of success, considering his re stricted maneuvering space: the pawn barriers hamper the mobility of his knights. Petrosian continues following his own line, figuring that as long as he has made no unsound moves, nor upset the positional balance, he will not risk finding himself in a losing position. 14 .

additionally, his last move helped fix the black e- and f pawns on dark squares. Still, White might have given some thought to the transfer of his bishop to a different diag onal.

Bg7-h6 h7:g6 Bb5:c4 d6:e5 Why did White sacrifice that pawn? Can't Black begin a coun terattack now? Not yet; and, meanwhile, White needs only two or three moves ---Nc3 and Rbl, for example -- to take over all the key points on the queenside, and then to pick up the c5- or the e7-pawn. The knight's poor placement at a8 helps White greatly in the execution of this plan. 27.

Taimanov saw j us t in time , however , that after 12 . . h5 ? 13 h4!, it i s not Black who has the attack , at any rate . So he increases the pres sure on e4 by means of the quiet maneuver Nb8- d7-f6 , which re sults in a s l ight advantage for Black . However , White might have cast doubt on Black ' s whole s yste m of deve lopment if he had p layed something more concret e than his c lever cas t l ing idea : that being

The out come of this game wi l l depend on whether White f inds an appro pr iate mo ment to advance the pawn to d6 and secure it there . If he can , then he wi l l have the advan tage ; if not , Black wi l l obtain good counterchance s . In my personal opinion , the sys tem looks good for Wh ite . It is pos s ible that S mys lov now shares this op inion, s ince , de spite the succe s s ful outcome of this game , he did not employ the sys tem again , e ither at Zur ich or at any other tournament thereaf ter . 8 . 9 . 10 . d4-d5

S mys lov is deal ing with a great expert on the Grunfe ld . At the Amsterdam 1950 tournament , Euwe played a s imi lar game agains t Pi lnik , cont inuing here with
10 Nbc3 . In the tournament book
Euwe no ted that the move was no t good , and recommended the con t inuat ion 10 a4 ! Na6 1 1 Na3 ed 1 2 ed Nb4 1 3 Nc3 ! Smys lov goes into the l ine nonethe less , which give s this game added intere st . Curious ly enough, in Game 129 (Round 19) aga inst Keres , Euwe played 10 Nec3 , and in his notes cal l s thi s move stronger than
10 a4 .
Both moves seem adequate to me . 1 0 . 1 1 . Nb1 -a3 12 . e4 : d5 1 3 . Ne2 - c3 Nb8-a6 e6 : d5 Bc8 - f5 ****** 1 3 aS would have been a tr i f l e more accurate , -but Euwe was ex pe ct ing the knight to go to d 7 on its own, with : 1 3 Nc3 Nb4

Na5 was only demons trated as a re sult of White ' s c l ever and by no means obvious cont inuat ion . His advan tage f inal ly bo i led down to his pos se s s ion of a strong bi shop agains t Black ' s knight in an endgame : certainly not al l that s imple , nor a l l that much ! Second ly , it ' s not c l ear how the bat t le might have gone after 13 • . Nd5 , s ince White had the secret weapon 14 N : d5 B : g5 1 5 Nb6 . If Black p lays 1 5 . . Rb8 , ins tead of taking the knight , he lose s the exchange after 1 6 N : g5 and 1 7 Nd7 ; and on 1 5 . . Ra 7 16 d5 is very strong .

Nd5 wou ld have been labe led the mis take , and 13 • • Na5 recommended instead , s ince it doe s not appear to be too dan gerous . Black ' s diff iculties appear to have another cause ent ire ly . Com pared with Black ' s p ieces , White ' s have made three extra moves ! -- both rooks to central f i le s , and the bishop to an at tacking d iag onal . If there is logic in che s s , then tho se three powerful deve l oping move s must te l l s omehow. It is a grandmaster ' s task to dem ons trate White ' s advantage , and in this case the proof was of the comp l icated combinat ive sort . Such me ld ing of logic and com binat ive powers is the hal lmark o f Bo les lavsky . 14 . d4-C:5 Na5 : b3 It is easy to see that taking the d- pawn with bi shop , knight or pawn would cost a p iec e . 15 . d5 : e6 [34] 1 5 .

For thi s game , the che s sboard becomes a batt leground of prin ciple between Smys lov and S tahl berg , who are repeat ing the ir game from the Budape s t 1950 tour nament . There , S tahlberg cont in ued with 1 1 . • Ba4 , only to d i s cove r , after 12 N : f6+ , that he could not recapture with his queen because of 13 B : a4 and
14 Qc4 , winning a pawn. S o here ,
he delays the exchange of l ight s quare bishops for two move s , but without achieving any subs tant ial improvement . White has a palpable advantage in space and complete freedom of maneuver , whi l e Black ' s bisho� rema ins under attack by White s knight and requires the queen ' s protect ion ; the b lack knight ' s movement s are quite res tricted too . Under the se circums tance s , the s l ighte s t mis step could be fatal for Black . 1 1 . 12 . Rf1-e1 13 . Ra1-d1 14 . Bb3 : a4 15 . Qe2- b5 1 6 . c2 -c4 1 7 .

Ne4 : f6+ 19 . Qb3-e3 g 7 : f6 Kg 8-g7 Smys l ov ' s logica l play has been making B lack ' s defense more and more difficul t . He cannot take the c-pawn, of cours e , because of
20 Qh6 , which leave s him no t ime
to defend the f6-pawn : for exam ple , 1 9 . . N : c4 20 Qh6 Qe 7 2 1 Nh4 , threatening 2 2 NfS and 2 2 Rd 3 . Nor does 1 9 . . Kh8 save him, in view of 2 0 Qh6 Nd 7 2 1 d5 , and the exchange of pawns brings Wh ite ' s rook to dS and thence to h5 ; or 2 0 . . Qe7 2 1 Nh4 . After the text , Wh ite must br ing his knight to g4 in order to c ont in ue his attack -- but how? 2 0 . Nf3-e5 A beaut iful move , capt ivat ing in its simp l icity : s ince the only route to g4 l ie s through e S , the knight runs ful l t i lt onto the bayone ts -- what c ould be s im pler ! The point is , of course , that taking the knight would open the door for White ' s queen and rook to set up a mat ing at tack : 20 • . fe 2 1 QgS+ , fol lowed by 2 2 Qf6+ and 2 3 Re 3 .

By this exchange in the cen ter, B lack has opened his bish op ' s d iagonal to attack the d4 square ; short ly , he wi l l a l s o attack the pawn at e4 with rook and knight . The knight ' s position ieMn'fMt on c5 wi l l be s ecured with . . aS , and this pawn may also be pushed further : to a4 , and even to a3 . For the moment , White attacks nothing , but he doe s d ispose of a s trong center and freedom to maneuver . Look at the board : White ' s piece s and pawns occupy four ranks , and Black ' s , three , with a "no-man ' s- land" between . The se geometrical features large ly reflect the character of the opening , as the oppos ing force s have not yet come into contact . White ' s further p lans are s imple : to deve lop the bishop and the queen, to connect his rooks , pre pare an attack on the weak pawn at d6 with which Black must even tua l ly sadd le himse lf in thi s de p loyment , and keep an eye on the defense of the e-pawn . The d if fer ing ways to defend thi s pawn lead to different sys tems of p lay . Qc2 would be a handy move , but this would leave the knight on d4 en prise for a moment , which Black might be able to exploit ; if Be 3 i s played f irs t , then Black has . . Ng4 . I t i s this s ort of tempo-p lay, with i t s many com b inat ive pos s ib i l i t ie s (due to the fact that a l l of the piece s and near ly a l l of the pawns are s t i l l on the board ) , that make s the King ' s Ind ian Defense such a de l ight to i t s adherents . 9 . 1 0 . f2-f3 Nd 7 -c5 Be fore leaving for thi s tourna ment , every one of it s partici pants prepared a few new sys tems , e spec ial ly in the popu lar openings such as the King ' s Ind ian, the S i c i l ian and the Nimzo- Ind ian .

Whatever White plays , the pure Samisch setup is now unattainable : for example , after 4 d5, Black is by no means obliged to fianchetto his bishop, but may play instead 4 • • Bf5 , and if 5 f3 e4. If 4 e4, Black gains a tempo for development with 4 . . ed 5 Q:d4 Nc6 , after which he may play ei ther 6 . . Be7 or 6 • • g6 .

However, White still has ways of peuxpshlo, iatnind g Black ' s early e-pawn the one Keres has in mind is 5 Bg5 , a rarely-played line which is nevertheless one of White ' s most solid pos itional ideas .

Black, of course, could play 5 . . Be7 , but that sort of development for this bishop grates on a King ' s Indian player. In that case , White would have a s im ple program: 6 e3, 7 Be2 and 8 O-O with no fear of . . e5-e4, s ince houits sqidueeenhi'ss bishop is already pawn chain. Boleslavsky, who has worked steadily and with immense suc cess at improving the King ' s In dian for Black, feels himself mor ally obligated to correct extant porpeipnaironeds ; a fdori ztzyhiis game , he has ng new line in volving the sacrifice of his queen' s rook. 5 . 6 .

Nc3-d5 g5 :h4 Qd8 : f6 Qf6 :b2 Some pieces in the King ' s In dian appear on a "special price" lis t : the darksquare bishops are at the top of that list . This means that Black has achieved something, in removing White ' s bishop while retaining his own, even at the cost of shattering his own pawns . With his last move , Black initiates his previously prepared sharp attacking line , sacrificing a rook for the attack. The attack wil l be based on the fact that the centralized knight is out of play at a8 ; the whole question is whether Black can wshorokrt upt idecisive threat s in the me it will take White to develop his bishop and get his knight back to the center. Boleslavsky had mainly consid ered the following line , in which his darksquare bishop plays the lead : 10 N: c7+ Kd8 11 N : a8 d5 !

39. Bronstein-Euwe
(Nimzoindian Defense) Generally, it makes sense to sacrifice a pawn, sometimes even a piece , in order to keep the en emy king in the center and assail it with rooks and queen. However, two general classes of such at tacks must be distinguished : in the first category, the king is kept to the e ighth rank, hemmed in by its own pawns and pieces ; whi le in the second category, the king is driven out to the sixth rank -- somet imes even to the fifth -- and attempts to find shelter on one wing or the other. ofTheth e prlaetsetnert game is an example type . The defender ' s chief resource is a cool head , and my opponent made full use of his here . At one point , I had to break off my calculations in order to ask myself : Just who is attack ing whom here? During the game, and afterwards as wel l , I was unable to shake the feeling that somewhere I had had a win. Perhaps some concrete variation did flicker momentarily through my mind , but it tarried not . . . In any event , neither I , nor the commentators ( Euwe, Naj dorf and Stahlberg) have been able to find an improvement for White, which would mean that my promising piece sacrifice was not enough for a win. Perhaps the win may yet be found in analys is ; but even if I did not get the point , I did get a lively and interesting game . 1 . d2-d4 2 . c2-c4

Bg4-f5 Both s ides have played into this l ine, which involves the sacrifice of a piece . Black weakened the long diagonal by playing 18 . . g6 instead of the more natural 18 • . fS, because he wanted the fS square kept free for his bishop ; and White is giv ing up the piece in order to get the black king out to f6 and e6 , and then assail him with all his p ieces . The battle waxes uncom monly fierce . 20 . Ne4-f6+ Kg8-g7 2 1 . Qc2-d2 At this moment , I was quite pleased with my position. In deed, after 2 1 . Kg7 : f6 Black ' s king can never get back to g7 , but must remain in the center, assailed by both rooks , queen, bishop and perhaps even, by pawns . However, my opponent s face showed no sign of despair e ither ---an object lesson for sthe young player who finds him elf in difficulties (especially when facing a mating attack) , and chokes up at once , thereby ren dering his defensive task still more difficult .
22. d4-d5
Here I examined 22 Bb2 and 22Qh6 too . The text is stronger : it re tains both those threats while creating a third : 23 d6 .
22. Ra8-d8
A remarkable move : Black brings up the last of his defensive re serves , and obviates all three of White ' s threats at a stroke. 23 Qh6 would now be met by the calm 23 • .

26. f4 : eS+ KRfd68-:de56
Having recovered his piece , White now attacks the exposed king ; however, he encounters strategical difficult ies in de veloping his attack. The king is surrounded by its own pieces , which display a sharp tendency to counterattack at the first available opportunity. The king also has many more open squares about him than would be the case if White were attacking the cas tled �osition. And finally, with White s king tucked away at h1, his own first rank has become weak. Nonetheles s , White still has one strong trump : the opposite colored bishops , which normally ensure an advantage to the attack ing s ide. It may have been this chance that White failed fully to exploit. 2 7 . Qd2-gS Ke6-d7 Black would find himself en snared after 27 . .

28. Ra1-c1
28 a4, to exploit his strate gic advantage {the darks quare bi shop) would have been stronger, and possibly decis ive : his oppo nent would have had to oppose his rook. After 28 a4, Black would be practically forced to give up the exchange ; he would get a sec ond pawn for it , but then the at tack of the queen and two rooks would have become fierce indeed : for example , 2 8 a4 Re6 29 Ba3 Qc4 30 Bd6 Re : d6 31 ed R : d6 R32: eRS ad301 ; Raorc 12. 8 • • Re: eS 29 B : e5 28. 29 .

Now he could try
31 R : f5 �f 32 Qg8 , but after
32 • . Qc6 . , this leads to a per petual .

peActt tthis point I began to sus hat Black had started to play for the win.

Bf2-g3 h7-h5 Qb6-a6 Re5-e4 One last detail , to complete the picture : neither side had more than two minutes left unt il flag fall . 35 Qg5 Ke6 looked worse than unclear, so I decided to stop tempting fate. 35 . Rf1 : fS All of the commentators gave this move an exclamation mark, s ince it was by now White ' s only means of forcing a draw. Never the less , I feel bound to admit to the reader that I sacrificed mo re from inspiration than from calcu lation. 35 • • gf 36 Rc7+ Ke8
37 Rc8+ appeared to me to be very

45 Rc8+ Kd7 46 R : c5 . Later it
was shown that not al l of Black' s moves in this line were forced, and that with exact play he could draw. Had Euwe taken the rook, there would have been no practical reason why he should lose, s ince this variation would lie , for the most part , beyond the time con trol ; however , he chose the more natural continuation. 35 . Re4 :h4 For a moment , I forgot that Black' s queen had moved to a6 , attacking the square f1, and very nearly went in for 36 R : dS+ Ke6

40. Gligoric-Szabo
(Ruy Lopez) The prime consideration in one ' s choice of an opening plan should be the harmonious devel opment of the pieces, but some times we forget about the devel opment of the queen. Since the queen is , after all , the most important and the most valuable of the pieces , the success of the whole piece configuration may depend on how well the queen plays its part . In some openings , the move a• . mcS is important not only as pawneances ntoef ra, ttacking the enemy but also in order to give the queen an exit to c 7 , b6 or aS . This applies es pecially to systems in which the bishop is developed to e7 , thus bgolnoackli:ngf ort heexaqumpeelne,' st hotehOerr tdhoia dox Queen' s Gambit , the Chigo rin Ruy Lopez, or the Class ical Variation of the French Defense . In the game Gligoric - Szabo, the development of Black' s queen became the central theme of the opening and middlegame struggle: White maintained a clear advan tage as long as the queen was relegated to the e ighth rank, and found his game s liding down hill as soon as the queen ob tained some lebensraum. 1 . e2-e4 2 .

Game 70, Averbakh - Szabo ) , s ince the bishop is more actively posted , and the queen retains the option of developing on the d8-h4 diagonal . 9 .

So he retreats the knight first . Now the e- pawn is really threatened ; but Gligoric proceeds to refute Black' s entire opening configu ration by means of a pretty and original queen maneuver, unpinning his knight and preventing Black from castling.
13. Qd1-b1
13. 14. a2-a4 Bgb45--hb45 Thus, Black has developed all of his minor pieces wel l , holds the advanced e-pawn under obser vation, and could now play 14 . .

But there i s one s ignificant piece weakness in his pos ition, and that is the queen, which is not developed , and has no good prospect of ever doing so - something which White could have attempted to exploit with 15 c4 . Whether Black takes or pushes his pawn, 16 Be4 would be White ' s reply ; and on 15 . . Bg6 , White would have traded bishops and pro ceeded with 17 Rdl . Black would then have faced some difficult problems , but 16 Be4 would not have settled the outcome of the game : 15 • • d4 16 Be4 Qd7 would pose the dilemma f or White of whether to sell his fine game for a mere pawn.

Thi s p lan can only succeed if B lack can support his pawn to a4 , but with what ? He no l onger has his l ight s quare b i shop , and hi s last move deprived h i s knight of its proper square . I t wi l l a l s o bec ome c lear quite soon that his knight cannot be maintained on d4 for l ong , and the light squares on the queens ide are under the control of White ' s f ianchettoed b i shop -- thus , Black ' s knights have no good square s . As a matter of fac t , B lack ' s knight s end up in pit iable pos i t ions . Thus , Black has no p lan with a future to it . He can make move s - s ome o f them, no doubt , wi l l be fair ly good ; he s t i l l need not lose the game , but he has a lready lost the guid ing thread , so h i s pos Lt ion is consequent ly infer ior . We recommend that the read er s tudy this game in c onj unc t i on with the Naj dorf - Ge l ler game from Round 2 8 . There B lack p layed 12 . • Rb4 ! , and f o l lowed thi s up with . .

Coldly accurate defense ! On any other retreat, as we shall see immediately, the c-pawn would not have been defended after move 16, and the king would have stood much worse bes ide s . 13. 14 . Nc6 :d8 15 . Nd8 :b7 16 . b2 : c3 Nd3 : c1+ Nc1 : e2 Ne2 : c3 Bc8-e6 This is the sort of pos ition in which White i s lost despite his being a pawn ahead . His minor pieces are scattered , his c-pawn is weak, and his rooks are subj ect to the harassment of the beauti fully coordinated black bishops . The proper move for Black here would appear to have been 16 . . Bf5 ! , keeping White ' s rooks from the b-file , and preventing them from doubling on the c-file ; he would also be threatening a check [76] from d8 at his earliest conven ience, driving White ' s king away from its pawn. White would have had to play 17 e4, shutting off his own bishop and making it that much eas ier for his opponent . After the text, Kotov manages to keep afloat with amazing skill : for many moves , he maintains his terminally ill pawn inter vivos , and eventually pulls himself nearly even. 17 . Rh1-c1 18 . Rc1-c2

He would be happy, for examp le , to be able to ar range a trade of knight for bi shop, or to clear away all of the minor pieces .

g2-g3 Bf8-g7 6 .

There are many reasons for it , chief among them the fact that the knight had no good retreat square . Additionally, Black does not lose a tempo, and he removes a strong enemy knight . If the b file is opened , the c-file is al so closed ; he may be strengthen ing the d-pawn, but he is also isolating the a-pawn, and weak- ****** ening the b-pawn by bring ing it t o c 3 and detaching it from it s pawn chain .

After the extra rest day they gave themse lve s with this e ighth-round game , Petro s ian went on to win three straight game s in good style (an excep t ional achievement by any s tan dard in such a strong t ourney ) ; ******* while Averbakh, though perhaps not quite so for tunate, sti l l fought with great verve in the rounds that fol lowed . In maj or tournaments , one must ration one ' s strength, not for the individual game, but for the entire event, taken as a whole. The history of chess ev ents - and that of many other sports as we ll - contains many [87] cases in which one of the parti cipants forged ahead at the out set, only to lose game after game towards the end ( and not against his most powerful opponents, ei ther) , finishing far behind the winners . ****** ******

And if the p in i s not broken, then White wi l l move h i s bi shop to h6 and without fur ther ado push his h-pawn ---a serious , though hard ly a fatal , threat . From a purely che s s ic viewpo int , then , the l og ical move was certa inly 7 . • d6 . [90] 8 . Bg5 : f6 9 . d5-d6 Qd8 : f6 Thi s pawn s ort ie c omb ines two strat eg ic ideas : restraint of Black ' s queens ide deve lopment , and cut t ing the communicat ions between the two wings of B lack ' s pos ition . Additiona l ly , White gains the valuable square dS for both bi shop and knight . Black ' s retarded deve lopment i s due chief ly t o the fac t that the pawn which is now nai led to d7 c loses the d iagonal c 8 -h3 , which means that the bishop now can only ge t into p lay on b7 or a6 . But 9 . • b6 is not yet p lay ab le ; f irst the knight mus t be p layed to c6 . Thus , we can deduce that Black ' s next three move s wi l l be : 9 • • Nc 6 , 10 • . b6 , and 1 1 . . Bb7 . B lack ' s queens ide p iece s can only reach the king s ide by way of the square d 8 , which puts quite a cr imp on the ir maneuver abi l ity. These are the pos it ive aspec t s of 9 d6 . There is only one nega t ive aspect : cut off from sup port , thi s pawn may d ie . Whit e ' s task i s therefore to assai l the kings ide with might and ma in for as l ong as the �awn at d6 stand s , depriving Black s king s ide o f the neces sary support of his queen s ide pieces .

On 15 • • Na5 , White c ould trade bishops and p lay his queen to d5 , with two threats : 1 8 Q : b7 and 1 8 Nf 7+ ; and on 1 5 • • Qf6 , Whi te has the choice between 16 Nf 7+ , attacking the queen and winning the exchange after 1 6 . . R : f 7 1 7 gS , or 16 gf Q : f S 17 Rh2 . 1 5 . e 5-e4 Black is not opening the h8- a 1 d iagonal in order to capture the b-pawn, but in order to a l l ow his king to hie himself to g7 , after which perhaps Black could risk capturing the knight . But now a white knight get s to f4 . 16 . Ng1-e2 Bg 7 : b2 1 7 . Ne2-f4 Whit e , in turn, a l so sacri f ice s the exchange . Couldn ' t Black take it ? That ques t i on cannot be ans wered with variat i ons . White has a myriad of appea l ing attacking cont inuat ions . To examine one : 1 7 • . B : a1 18 gf Bc3+ 19 Kf 1 i s s imi lar to what actua l ly occurred ; [91] and it would seem to me that White ' s threat s ---20 N : g6+ , 2 0 Qg4 , etc . ---would be impos s ible to withs tand , espec ial ly under tournament cond itions . Naj dorf was apparent ly of the same opinion : before anything e l se , he a ims t o shore up the key point g6 . (A note here : White ' s attack would congeal very quickly if he l imited his sacrifice to the ex chan�e : 18 Q : a 1+ ? Qf6 19 N : g6+ Kg7 . ) 1 7 . 1 8 . g4 : f5 ! Qd8-f6 Bb2 : a1 S ince White mus t attain one of the important square s ( g6 , h6 or h5 ) in any event , Naj dorf decides to take the rook after a l l , s ince thi s might later a l l ow him to g ive up his queen for two p iece s or a p iece and a pawn . On 1 8 • • gf , White would have cont inued 1 9 Rb 1 Be5 2 0 Qh5 , with a tremendous at tack .

White i s prac t ical ly advert i s ing that his attack i s intuit ive , rather than ca lculated ---other wise , why wou ld he need the e pawn? The s imp le 20 Nf4 , sett ing up such fearsome threats as 2 1 NhS+ , 2 1 QhS and 2 1 Rg 1 , s eems more ap pea l ing , yet Euwe d idn ' t p lay i t . Why ? To put i t s imp ly, Euwe did not want to g ive his opponent a choice . White ' s 2 0 N : e4 force s change: Kg7.y mat t ers : by depriving B l ack ' s queen of the square c 3 , it e l im inate s the var iat ion 2 0 Nf4 Qc3+ 2 1 Kf l -- a l though , in my op in ion , thi s would only improve White ' s po s it ion . For examp le : 2 1 • . R : f 5 2 2 Qg4 ; or 2 1 • . hg 2 2 hg R : f 5 2 3 Rh7+. But - we l l , Euwe rece ived a bri l l iancy prize f or thi s game ; the j udges were not too strict , and we sha l l not go ni tp icking e i ther . Each grand master has his own style , with its strengths and weakne s se s . 2 0 . Ba 1-c3+ White has a very strong po s i t ion , but h e is s t i l l a who l e rook down . 2 0 . • Q : f 5 was bad : White would have won right off with 2 1 Q : a1+ K : g6 22 Rg 1+ . S o f irst B lack pu l l s h i s bishop out with check , and then he takes the f-pawn , put t ing pre s sure on f2 and removing the protect ion of the knight at g6 . 2 1 . Ke 1 - f 1 Qf6 : f 5 2 2 . Ng6 -f4 B lack needs only another move or two t o stabi l ize his position and e scape with his extra rook , but the se must be good move s . Thus , 2 2 . . Be 5 would be answered by 2 3 Ng3 Qh7 24 Qg4+ Kh8 2 5 Ng6+ ; if the queen goes t o e 5 ins tead , White ' s queen checks at g4 ; and if the bi shop retreat s t o f6 , then either 2 3 Ng 3 or 2 3 Rg1+ wins . I bel ieve that Black mus t l o se here even with the best defense . ( Had he wished , White c ould have forced a draw with 22 Rg1 , after which Black mus t p lay 2 2 • • Qh3+ 2 3 Rg2 Qh1+ 24 Rg 1 Qh3+ , etc . ) 2 2 . Kg 7-h8 !

Kotov- Bronstein (King 's Indian) Everyone l ove s to at tack the king , but it i s often hard to decide on such an attack , e spe c ial ly when one ' s opponent can c ounterat tack on the oppos i te wing . The prob lem is that al though the goal o f the king s ide attack -- mate to the enemy ' s king -- i s more ent icing , it i s a l s o far more d i f f icul t to ach ieve than , f or examp le , the cre at ion of a few pawn weaknes se s by means of a queens ide attack . An attack on the king with p iece s a l one require s overwhe lming nu merical superior ity and genera l ly a few sacrifice s ; and the pawns cannot always j o in in the assau l t .

aiming at quick deve lopment and a p iece attack on the kings ide , was in vogue twenty or thirty years ago , up unt i l a game be tween Botvinnik and Alekhine , in which White p layed 7 Bc4 and won a beautiful endgame . With 7 Bc4 White emphas izes that a lthough the black knight on d 5 can con s ider i t s e l f safe from pawns af ter the exchange on d4 , it is not safe from p ieces , which means i t ' s not s o we l l p laced [100] on d5 , after a l l . However , the game Kotov-Leven f ish ( 1 6th USSR Champ ionship , Mos cow 1948 ) showed an ant idote t o

retreated his knight to b6 , and s tubbornly refused to p lay • • c S : d4 , which would have a l lowed White to open the d iagonal c 1 -h6 for his bi shop with the recapture e3 : d4 ( this was the mistake Kot ov made in his game with Bo l e s lavsky ) . And , s ince Wh i t e ' s bi shop re ma ined on b3 , he c ould not play b2 -b3 , so that his queen ' s bishop remained a c ons tant s ource of worry.

Nb8-c6 Nf6-g4 Boleslavsky repeats the l ine Najdorf so successfully employed against Taimanov (cf. Game 28 , Round Four) , but on this occasion Taimanov eschews 8 d5 , attempt ing instead to gain the upper hand by means of 8 Be3 . However , this move is so inoffensive as to place White in the defender ' s position. Further investigation of this system has shown that by playing 8 . . Re8 , Black can practical ly force a whole series of exchanges , thereby solving his defensive problem (cf . Game 107 , Reshevsky - Najdorf) . When this game was played , that im provement had not yet been dis covered. After 8 . . Ng4 9 Bg5 , Black could play 9 • • Bf6 , of fering to trade off the dark square bishops ; after the move he actually plays , White car ries out a plan which secures him control of dS and a def i nite advantage . So Black ' s 8 . . Ng4 maneuver must be con s idered not wholly satisfactory, inasmuch as he intends to con t inue with 9 • • f6 ; the same 8 . . Ng4 would be much better if Black played it in conjunction with 9 • • Bf6 . 9 . Be3-g5

White plans to strengthen his pos ition in ap proximate ly the following fash- [108] ion: Bc 1-e3-d4 , trading bishops , Nd5 , and the rooks to d1 and c1 or else to d1 and e1 . If he is allowed to carry out all this , sooner or later Black will be forced to advance the c-pawn, after which White can success fully assail the d-pawn. Black ' s counterplay is based, first and foremost , on his bi shop-pair, which enable one some times to hold a draw even in a pawn-down endgame ; and secondly , on the shaky status of the e pawn, s ince its defender will have to reckon with the pawn on g4. Let us watch now as the two plans collide , and what comes of it .

d5 : e4 Nf6 : e4 Black ' s last two move s seem incons i stent to me . By his 10th move , Black ought to have come up with some sort of plan .

If it i s to be traded , then the bi shop , not the knight , ought to have taken on e4 : it wi l l now be a long t ime before thi s bi shop can capture anything more sub s tantia l than a pawn . And if it i s not to be traded (which , to j udge f rom B lack ' s f ifth move , i s indeed h i s intent ion ) , then he ought to have retreated it to h7 on the previou s move , keep ing the pawn tens ion in the center and restric t ing the mob i l ity of White ' s d- and e-pawns -- and even of his c -pawn -- somewhat . But if , after 9 N : e4 , the dark square bishop were to retreat to e 7 , then after 1 0 Nh4 !

Here too , how ever , l ife i s no bowl of cherr ie s , s ince White ' s king , which i s the chief target of hi s as saul t , wi l l $7-g6 B?8-g7 be spirited away to the queen s ide , robbing B lack ' s pawn pre s s . . f 7 - f5 - f4 o f much o f i t s ef fect by rendering it large ly po int l e s s . Meanwhile , White has a wider cho ice of strateg ic plans . With the center c l os�d , he may at tack on the kings ide with g4 , h4 and h4-h5 etc . , or try for a queens ide break by lead ing away from his own king with a pawn attack . Bef ore dec id ing on an act ive p lan, both White and B lack engage in a lengthy war of maneuver , of the sort that occurs in many contemporary grandmaster game s . Genera l ly speaking , the ideas behind such p lay are : to f ind the be st pos s ible posit ions for one ' s p ieces , to re strict the opponent ' s ini t iat ive , to trade off one ' s own "bad" bishop for the enemy ' s "good" one , and f ina l ly , to pre pare a break . In the pre sent game , for examp le , up unt i l the 42nd move only one p iece and one pawn had been exchanged . At that moment , however , the game entered its combinat ive phase , and the reader who has fo l lowed the phase preced ing that with d i l igent attent ion wi l l be r ich ly rewarded for his pains .

White the opportunity to open the g - f ile for his rooks with a later g4 : f5 . B lack ' s cho ice in thi s game i s the end product of a bat t le of ideas of many years ' durat i on . From hS , the knight mechanical ly prevent s h4-h5 , wh ich conse quent ly renders the push h2 -h4 at least temporar ily useles s ; and on 8 g4 , then knight goes [1 23] to f4 , ha lt ing White ' s attack . 7 . .

the next day . I saw no way of improving the po s it ion of my piece s substant ia l ly ; for that matter , I had prac t ica l ly agreed to the draw with my 30th move .

Smys lov and his second S imag in, however, thought that the irmnediate 4 1 . . h4 42 Ng4 , etc . was forced for Black, and it ' s hard to say which of the two of us was r ight . When a game i s adj ourned in a comp lex po s it i on , usua l ly each s ide un consc ious ly evaluate s the po s it ion in his own favor . What conc lus ions can be drawn from this tense and intere s t ing strugg le ?

(Nimzoindian Defense) If the reader should ask which game I l iked the be s t of a l l in thi s tournament , I would have to pas s over my own two encounters with one t ime Amer ican wunderkind Samue l Re shevsky in favor of one of the tournament ' s mo st not e worthy game s from the viewpo int of its depth of concept i on, beau ty and complexity . This game has been reproduced in che s s j ourna l s in every language , and has been subj ected to d i s sec t ion by doz ens of mas ters , almos t al l of the grandma s ters , and even Botvi� nik himself - and yet we s t 1 l l cannot say with abso lute certain- [1 28] ty that the se analyses represent the f inal answer .

Reshevsky re peat s the opening he p layed a gains t Euwe , but Where Whi te was unable to summon the courage t o play 8 e 4 in that game , Keres doe s so here . 8 . e3-e4 9 . Bc 1-g5 Bc8-b7 R . G . Ashurov , a C las s - A player from Baku , has pointed out a dif ferent po s s ibility f or White here : 9 e S , and if 9 • . B : g2 , then

1 3 Qg4 with a very strong attack, which Ashurov carr ies out to mate in s evera l l ine s . True , some of the se variat ions cou ld be improved for B lack, but without a doubt he get s int o serious trouble if he take s the pawn and the rook . His bes t rep ly t o 9 e S would be to retreat the knight , when White c ould maintain the pres sure with 1 0 QhS . 9 . h7-h6 Fierce ! 9 . • d6 was also pos s ible : if 10 e S de 1 1 de , then B lack would no t play 1 1 . .

On 9 • • d 6 , White would probably have c ont inued 1 0 £4 Nbd7 1 1 Nf 3 cd 12 cd , with a much more act ive po s it ion ; s o Black prefers to force mat ters . 1 0 . h2 -h4 Cont inuing his deve lopment .

The only move : 12 • . hg lead s to 1 3 ef Q : f6 14 Bh7+ Kh8 15 hg Q : c3+ 16 Kf 1 , and White wins ; if 12 . • B : g2 , then 1 3 B : f6 gf

Rh3 : d 3 Be4 : d3 Qd 8-c7 The be s t chance to defend his d i f f icult pos it ion . In such s it uat i ons , many p layers are ready to throw up the ir hand s and play the first move that come s to mind ; but Re shevsky does not de spair . Wh ite has several means of destroying the black king ' s pawn cover . Here Kere s concocted an astound ing combinat l on , whose main variat ion runs rough ly as f o l l ows : 1 5 B : f6 gf 16 Qg4+ Kh8 [129] 1 7 Qf3 Nd7 1 8 O-O-O N : e5 19 Q : f6+ Kh7 2 0 Rd6 N : c4 2 1 Nh3 N : d6 2 2 Ng5+ !

There are certainly many other pos s ib i l i t ie s for both s ides a long the way , which no one could pos s ibly have calculated ; but the extended concept ion o f unusual beauty is a ha l lmark o f Kere s ' talent . And now the reader who would l ike to poke about with us through the byways of the se combinat ions should f o l low the ana lys is , as Nimzovich once recommended , on two che ssboards : one to make the move s of the game , and the other to examine the var iat ions . 15 .

Be7 :d6 Nc6-e7 This looks aggressive , but it turns out to be a blunder that costs a pawn. Even blunders, how ever, have their reasons some times. For this encounter, Gli goric chose a cautious opening , in which it is usually difficult to secure an advantage ; he also went in for early s implifications , resulting in a completely draw ish position. At that moment , sud denly, White began playing for a win! The logic of chess does not ptermit such things : once a posi ion of clear equilibrium has been established , it takes more than simple will-power to tip the scales . And it was not yet too late to defend the c-pawn: 15 b3 Nf5

d7-d6 Nf5 : g3 d6 : e5 There exists a widespread , and therefore dangerous , misconcep tion that the win is automatic once you are a pawn ahead . As a matter of fact , Black ' s chief ad vantage in this pos it ion lies not so much in his plus pawn, which he is still far from exploiting, as in his control of most of the center squares : d4, d5 , c5 , f4 and f5 . White has his counterchances : a queenside pawn maj ority and the d-file . How many s imilar games have been drawn because of inexact play! Smys lov, however , manages such endings with an iron hand . His plan may be divided in to the following phase s : ****** 1 . The immediate exchange of one rook, leavin9 the other to re strain White s queenside pawns and attack the c- and e-pawns . 2 . Deflecting White ' s rook to the h-f ile by the threat to cre ate an outs ide passed pawn, and then occupying the ,d-file with his own rook. 3 . Advancing the g-pawn to g4, undermining the e-pawn ' s sup port , which is the f3-pawn. 4 . Tying up White ' s pieces by attacking the e-pawn. 5 . Sending his king in to pick off the weak pawns . As we shall see, a simple win ning plan -- for a Smyslov, nat urally ! 20.

80. Taimanov-Geller
(King 's Indian) Perusal of this meaty game will acquaint the reader with two strategic ideas . As a result of the opening Black obtains the pawn configuration c5-d6-e5 ver sus c4-d5-e4 ; this ensures White greater freedom to maneuver with in his own l ines , since he has three ranks , while Black has only two . This is an abstract advan tage , of course , but it is the master ' s task to render it con crete -- that is, to find a plan wherein this wil l prove useful. It is instructive to watch as Taimanov practically clears his first three ranks of pawns en tirely, enabling him to trans fer his forces easily from one wing to the other, while most of Black ' s pieces find themselves j ostling one another on the sev enth rank, and especially on the ****** easily while eighth. And the second idea: White doub les his rooks on the b-file , but cannot turn this to account , s ince al l the good invasion squares are covered by Black' s minor pieces . White therefore stirs up some play on the other wing; harmless in itself, this play leads to the exchange of a few pieces and draws the minor pieces away from the b-file , thus al lowing White ' s rooks to invade at b7 and con clude the game within a few moves . 1 . d2-d4 2 . c2-c4 3 .

A white rook on b3 wil l control the b file and simultaneous ly defend f3 and g3 . In some variations , the rook on b1 goes to h1, and the knight on d1 may go to c3 , e3 or f2 ; meanwhile , Black' s rooks and knights have only one knight f 2; move apiece, Black ' s pieces can not use the b-file , nor can he transfer pieces to the kingside .

Before the play gets too live ly in the center, White decides to secure his king.

5 . Qd1-b3 Black needs . . c7-c5 , which White seeks to prevent by ap plying pressure against the d-pawn, thereby forcing either d. e• cfe7-c6 or . . d5 : c4. Numerous nsive tries fai led to work for Black until Smyslov worked out the plan Black employs in this game . 5 . 6 . Qb3 : c4 7 . e2-e4 dS : c4
O-O
Bc8-g4 This , with the fol lowing moves , is the Smyslov System of the Grunfeld . 8 . Bc1-e3 Nf6-d7 This apparently i llogical move has its own logic and its own history. When the system first began to be played , 8 . . Nc6 was usual here ; 9 d5 would be ans wered by the bishop capttlre at f3 , for example : 10 de b5 ! , or 10 gf Ne5 11 Qe2 c6 ! Eventually, White started to get the upper hand in this ; then Smys lov (and others) began introducing re finements . This process of "lab oratory testing" resulted in the move 8 • • Nfd7 , which combines two ideas : retaining the option of • . c7-c5, and putting pressure on the d-pawn. Now, for example , q9 u.. Nb6 is threatened , and if the een leaves the d-pawn' s pro tection, then 10 . . B : f3 followed by 11. . B : d4. There have been several tries here : 9 Nd2 , or 9 Be2 Nb6 10 Qd3 followed by long castling , which leads to a double-edged game ; or T9 hee5 , or 9 d5 , or 9 Rd1 Nb6 10 Qb3 . conclus ion was finally reached that it is better to retreat the queen to b3 before the knight chases it away. Szabo replies with an extremely acnompilicated variation involving mmediate . . c7-c5 . 9 . Qc4-b3 c7-c5 [1 42]
10. d4-d5
If the queen takes the b-pawn, Black first trades his �ueen' s bishop for White ' s king s knight , and then plays ll • . cd , abandon ing his queen' s rook; one l ine is 12 Q:a8 de 13 Q:a7 cb 14 Rb1 Nc6 , and Black has a very strong attack on the king for the ex change . The text makes it very uncomfortable for the queen' s bishop, which now has the choice of taking on f3 (which would strengthen White ' s center) or of remaining at its post , to face great peril after 11 Nd2 . 10. 1 1 . Nf3-d2 Nbe78--ea66 Black appears to be locking his own bishop in an escape-proof cell ; this is not mere whimsy, however, but the product of ana lysis which Szabo had already tested in a game from a previous tournament . For example : 12 h3 ed threatening 13 . .d 4 , and if 13 ed , then 13 . .Bf5 14 g4 c4, clearing c5 for the knight , which lets the bishop retreat ; if then 1 5 Q:c4 Ne5 is possible , and the bishop is freed once again. 12 . d5-d6 White ' s pawn has broken free of its support , and will soon be surrounded by the hostile army. Ab ufierce battle erupts around it, t one may already predict that wthheo saedvpainectaege must swing to Black, s are all developed , and who has already castled . 12 . Bg7-d4 This move is justified by the variation 13 h3 (winning the bi shop? ! ) 13 • . B : e3 14 fe Qh4 mate ! On the other hand, if White ex changes bishops himself and then plays 14 NbS , Black has the un pleasant reply 14 . • Ndc5, fol lowed by 15 . . e5 . Black ' s passed pawn on the d-file would be de fended , and therefore a �reat deal stronger than White s ; the black pieces would also be better placed .

This secures c4 for his knight and wins a tempo for castling, but it also opens the b-file . 13.

But his gf22-g3 wil l soon be followed by -f3 , and a cold wind wil l be gin to blow along the second rank, now open from c- to h-file , which will �rove most unhealthy for White s king.

White has final ly gotten what he was after : as soon as the knight reaches cS, Black ' s game wil l be nearly hopeles s , s ince White will have an extra king side pawn, practically speaking, and must eventually convert it into a win. Nevertheless, the move played gives Averbakh a problem- like save ! 40. b5-b4 41 . Rc3-c5 Once again the rook is forced to occupy the square cS where White had wanted to place his knight. 41 .

Of 43 R : c6 , of course , there follows 43 • . ba or 43 • . a3 ! , and suddenly it is Black who wins . 43 . a2-a3 Bf5-c2 The picture has suddenly al tered : the weak b-pawn has be come strong, and the "bad" bi shop now occupies a strong pos i tion. There would be no point for White in taking the c-pawn: 44 R:c6 Rhc8 45 R : c8 R : c8 threatens 46 . . Rc4, and if White brings his king up to defend with 46 Kf3 , then 46 . . Be4+ wins for Black. If the king were at f1, let ' s say, then White could get to e3 via e2 and win. Thus , the ability to note and exploit the tiniest of nuances sometimes dec ides the out come of a game . The following maneuvers can no longer alter the result . The question arises : was the win ever possible ? And if so, when did White let it slip? On move 40, instead of Nd3,
40 ReS ! should have been played ,
not allowing Black two tempi for . .b4 and . .BfS ; then, on 40 . .b4, he could have replied 41 RaS ; or if 40 • • Rhc8 41 Nd3 , and now if 41 • . Bf5 42 Nb4, or if 41 . . b4 , then 42 Ra5 , threatening 43 NcS . It seems to me that Black, in spite of all his resourcefulnes s , would have been unable to save the game then.

in some other openings as we ll. The d-pawn' s survivability de pends , first and foremost , upon the fianchettoed king ' s bishop , pwaisthsionugt which it would be a mere fancy; and secondly, upon how effective ly Black ex ploits the open lines adj oining the pawn.

White begins with the idea that a similar position - except for White ' s c-pawn at c2 - could arise in the Philidor ; there, the bishop would stand on c4 , where it plays a leading ro le in the attack on the king. Here , however, at eZ or d3 it would only interfere with the rooks ' actions on the central files .

( See diagram, next page ) Occupying d5 will be favorable for White if he can secure his knight there or if a trade of mleinavore s pieces on that square him with a tangible ad vantage .

Seeing that his queenside pieces have been hemmed in, he undertakes a kingside div ersion, aimed chief ly against the possibility of g2-g4. In a later game , he castled here and held the balance ---not because his game was good , but rather thanks to his tactical skill.

91. Reshevsky-Bronstein
(King's Indian) This game had some influence on the placement of the leaders , since I stood 1� points behind Rdeecshreeavsskeyt, haant d gaa pwtino hfaorlfmae pwooiunltd. If Reshevsky, who was undefeated so far, were to win, he would catch up to Smyslov. So it would appear that a draw suited none of us three . (All of these rum inations may be considered as part of the pregame warmup . ) The opening was a well-known King ' s Indian, with both sides striving for the initiative . The second phase (up to move 23) was mostly maneuvering ; by its c lose, a black pawn had appeared on a3, and a white one on eS. In the following phase , White tried to cash in his initiative in the center and kingside for a mating attack, inventing a remarkable combination which sacrificed a pawn, a rook, and the exchange which Black neutralized by ex changing off the enemy knight . A series of exchanges followed, which laid bare the deficiencies of Reshevsky' s pawn-pushing . Queens plus opposite-colored bishops usually means a very sharp fight . In the game ' s con cluding phase Black kept up his mating attack until the very last move , unwilling to trade queens anywhere except at b2 , which would have been hopeless for White . Even after all this , i t still seemed as though Black might not get his win. He found it , howev er, by means of a j o int maneuver by queen, bishop and pawn that left the white pieces in a state of absolute zugzwang .

It is very important that the white knight be kept out of f6. The e5-pawn could not have been taken by the bishop, since White would have replied 28 R : e5 and then taken the rook on d8 ; but now White must give serious con sideration to the defense of the e-pawn. 2298 ..

e6-f5 [152] 32 . Nc3-e4 White offers the e5-pawn. I was quite tempted to take it, meeting the obvious knight check by sacrificing my queen for rook, knight and pawn. Black ' s pieces would have acquired tremendous scope, with good prospects for the further strengthening of my position. However, Reshevsky had prepared a diabolical combination in ans wer to the pawn capture : 32 • • Q : e5? 33 R : f5 , and now: a) 33 • • Q : f5 34 Nf6+ B : f6 35 R : e8+ R : e8 36 Q : e8+ Kg7 37 gf+ bQ): e333 3• 6• gQf 34 Nf6+ B : f6 35 gf ! ! g2 -- check and mate. The beauty of this combination lies in the second line , in which White , already a rook down by move 35, captures , not the queen, but the bishop with a pawn, creating an irresistible threat of mate . 32 .

Here Reshevsky offered another draw -- and this time , I believe he meant it.

If White takes on b2 , then Black needs only to create one more passed pawn on the kingside to win; while if Black takes on e2 , the most he will ever be able to achieve will be the capture of White ' s a-pawn. But this would still not be enough to win for him, since at that moment the white king would turn up at c2 , incarcerating its colleague . 53. h7-h5 The last reserves enter the fray.

Imag ine that White has s ix or seven d ifferent con t inuat ions , and B lack f ive or s ix rep l ie s to each move ; it ' s easy to see that no genius on ear th c ould reach even the fourth move in his calculat ions .

Therefore , he dec ide s to g ive a few checks , in order to ge t the game past the 40th move and adj ourn i t . No doubt , there has to be mate in this posit ion; most probab ly, Kotov saw its bas ic out l ine s as far back as his 30th move . 33 .

Cases are known in which such pawns have defeated two rooks , or even a queen and rook ; so S tahlberg must take the b-pawn. He cannot take it with the rook , s ince af ter the last black rook is ex changed off , White p lays Rd5- b5-b6 and then queens his a pawn .

(King's Indian) I f , having cas t led , you see that your opponent has c losed the center and i s preparing a dir ect pawn st orm, then i I.

The minority at tack is not just an opening idea mo st frequent ly employed in the Exchange Var ia t ion ( ac tua l ly the Car l sbad Var iat ion) of the Queen ' s Gambit De c l ined , but a genera l strategic idea , which under the right c ir cumstances may be emp loyed at any s tage of the game , and not just on the queens ide . The po int of this attack is to g ive the opponent weakne sses in the sec tor where he holds a quant ita t ive pawn maj ority , and then to attack the weak pawns with pieces . Here the c ircums tance s are except iona l ly favorab le for a White minority attack on the queen ' s wing .

What he has accomp l ished is that White mus t now set about regrouping his p ieces toward a new goal ( as sai l ing the a-pawn) ; B lack uses thi s t ime to be the f ir s t to c reate threat s on the kings ide . 1 5 .

Taimanov-Giigoric (Sicilian Defense) The sacrifice of a pawn for the init iat ive is one of the most comp lex prob lems of che s s strategy -- and perhaps of its psycho l ogy as we l l . The pos itions that occur as the re sul t o f a sacr if ice are s o var ied that no genera l izat ions can pos s ib ly be made . Some grandmasters , pos ses s ing the facu lty of quick cal cu lat ion, not infrequent ly give up a pawn or two s imp ly to al ter the nature and balance of a po s it ion , even if thi s is perhap s not in their favor . I don ' t think thi s manner of playing has much of a future . I myse l f have sacr ificed , al l to l d , several dozen pawns , but st i l l I think that the ma s ter who sacrifices a pawn ought to have at least a genera l idea of the nature of the ini t iat ive he wi l l thereby obtain , and what sort of game wi l l ensue . Once in a whi le , a pawn mus t be given up , or even an exchange or a p iece , against one ' s wi l l - the po int be ing that any other course leads to a difficu l t po s i t ion . Playing Whi te , Taimanov sacr if iced a pawn in the open ing , but obtained no more of an ini t iat ive thereby than he might have obtained by keeping the same number of pawns as his op ponent . Throughout the game , White put himse lf through ago nie s trying to regain his pawn , but never quite succeeded ; even tua l ly , B lack ' s extra pawn went on to queen . 1 . e2 -e4 2 .

l\Jc•UAI< [207] 1 24. Smyslov- Euwe (Reti Opening) Sacrificing a pawn in order to se ize an open l ine in the center is one of the o lde s t s t rategic ideas known : i t may be f ound in the c la s s ical game s of Grec o , Morphy , Anders s en , Chigor in , Spie lmann and Alekhine . Occas iona l ly , a pawn is � iven up to obtain a l ine f or a b1shop , the mo st obvious examp l e be ing the Danish Gamb i t : 1 e 4 eS 2 d4 ed 3 c 3 de 4 Bc4 cb 5 B : b2 . The mo st promis ing sac r i f ice s , how ever , are tho s e which open l ine s f or the rooks , e s pec ial ly when thi s invo lve s a d irect attack on the king . Our forebear s knew of another Muz io Gamb it bes id e s the usua l one , ca l led the "Doubl e ( o r ''Wi ld" ) Muz io" : 1 e4 e S

gf 6 B : f 7+ K : f 7 7 Q : f3 , which is occasional ly encountered even t oday . Of c our s e , ma s ter s and grandmaster s take a rather skept ical att i tude toward such p lay , but i t has a s i zab le fol lowing among p layers of midd l ing s trength . For example , this gam· b i t was a mo s t fears ome weapon in the hands of a Moscow f i r s t categ ory p layer , Vo lodya Smir nov ( Wh o se unt ime ly pas s ing we al l mourn ) , in school and c o l lege tournaments , where he emp loyed his own ana lys e s and var iat i ons . But where pieces and pawns were former ly sac r i f iced on the second or third move , nowadays such ear ly skirmishing s in the center are avo ided . I t ' s cer tain ly not because p layer s fear r i sk -- in plain terms , the King ' s Ind ian i s a greater r i sk for B lack than the King ' s Gam b i t for Wh i t e . Neverthe le s s , not one of us is afraid to play the King ' s Ind ian , wh i l e the advo cate s of the King ' s Gamb i t grow fewer and fewer , as do tho se of the Scotch , I tal ian and Vienna Game s . The problem with a l l thes e openin� s is that after a short fight 1n the c enter , the pawn s tructure s imp l i f ie s , and the f ight which f o l l ows bec ome s f lat and feature les s . Players of our day know how to sacrifice a pawn or a pie c e as we l l as Morphy or Ander s s en d id ; but i t is a char act e r i s t ic of the pre sent s tate of the art that sacrifices must be vos tponed whi l e shie lding one s combinat ive yearnings be · category (vfriose

White has a powerful ly centra l ized knight , making a good counterwe ight to the bishop on d 7 and ready to meet a queen sort ie to aS by re treat ing to b3 . Wh ite s tarted his pawn s torm f ir st , and has a lready gotten in g3-g4 and h2 -h4 ; his own k ing pos i t ion has no weakne s se s , whi le B lack ' s pawn at g6 forms a hook for White ' s advancing army to se ize upon . Whi l e Black may be start ing h i s pawn advance later than Wh ite ' s , he a lready has a l ine open agains t the enemy king . H is central ized knight is very powerful too : it a ttacks the weak l ink in White ' s pawn chain the pawn which is , in fac t , the only support of White ' s who le chain ( and very shaky , too ! ) . Black contro l s , and may soon occupy , the important square c 4 , which carries about the s ame value as the fS s quare doe s for B lac k ; meanwhile , White st i l l does not contro l one square in the immediate area of B lack ' s king .

Af ter 12 . • Re8 13 de de is pos si ble , when the b lack rook even tua l ly goes to the d- f i le . But after thi s move it woul d make no sense at a l l for Whi t e to p l ay e i ther 13 d5 ( whi le the bi shop s t i l l s tands on c 8 ) or 1 3 de ( s ince the rook i s already on the d- f i le ) . So instead White cont inue s the tradit ional knight ' s t our , from b 1 via d2 and f 1 t o g3 •/drifirMt or e 3 . 1 3 . Nd2 - f 1 d6-d5 ! And here i s the nove l ty Kere s prepared . The pos i t ion thi s cre ates cannot be exhau s t ive ly an alyzed , s inc e every move g ive s r i se t o three or f our d i f ferent po s s ibi l it ie s , none worse than any o the r . S o a calculat ion f ive move s deep wou ld enta i l checking out around twenty thousand var iat ions , s topp ing per iodica l ly a long the way t o decide whether thi s or that intermed iate posi t ion wou ld favor one s ide or the o the r . Such a ca lculat ion cou l d probably b e performed on ly by a computer - but a computer doe s not pos se s s intuit i on . I f we try to evaluate the po s i t ion on the bas is of gene ral princ ip les , we conc lude that White has good attacking chance s : both his b i shops , both his knight s , and his queen can be mob i l ized quickly to the bat t l e f i e l d , whi le the rook hinder s the b lack king ' s f l ight . There are only two tac t ical counter chanc e s for Black that we can see : h i s que en at tacks the b i shop on c 2 , and his rook may even tua l ly threaten the whi te queen . There f ore , there has to be a l ine Wh ite can play tha t wi l l g ive the se po s s ib i l i t ie s c on crete expre s s ion. In that case , why doe s 12 . . Rd8 , and the who le var iat ion , de serve an exc lama t ion mark? I t ' s for Kere s ' a s tute psycho l ogical preparat ions . Knowing be forehand what l ine [235] was t o be p layed , he set Bole s lavsky the sort o f probl em that would be very d i f f icult to s o lve over the board .

(King's Indian) Even among the s tronge st of the contemporary master s , we s t i l l f ind the sort o f p l ayer who i s far stronger with the white p ie ce s than with the b lack. With B lack , such a player thinks about gett ing a draw from the opening move s . When he has White , certain pos i t ions inspire in h im f l ight s of fancy , and a de s ire to win at any cost ; when he has Black , the same po s i t ions seem to ins p ire nothing but bore dom, and ca lcu lat i ons aimed at "equa l i z ing" .

S ome t ime s , the opening i s sharp , and the first mis take dec ide s the outc ome . In thi s case , both s ides reveal the ir p l ans at the outset : one attacks , l et ' s say , on the king s ide , whi le the o ther doe s the same on the queens id e . Thi s has a lways been one o f the mo s t popular scenarios , in our day as much a s it was in the pas t . In the pre sent game , we mee t a new approach , one which has begun appearing re lat ive ly re cent ly in tournament s , and which Konstant inopo l sky apt lY. termed "the c la sh of openings ' . Both s ides br ing the ir troops out according to a chosen scheme , making no contact with the op po s it i on f or the moment , and in mo s t case s not cro s s ing the demarcat ion l ine be tween the fourth and f i f th ranks .

(Queen's Indian Defense) Midd legame and endgame cannot be separated , one from the other ; in the midd legame - and s ome t ime s even in the opening - the master d i scerns the out l ine s o f the forthcoming endgame . Many o f Averbakh ' s creat ions are very l o g ical and cons i s tent because he i s such a great author ity on , and enthus iast of , the endgame . Here , by move s 1 2 - 1 5 he had a l ready visual ized the c oming knight vs . b i shop endgame , and d id everything pos s ib le there after to a ssure his kni ght the be s t p o s s ible working cond i t ions for i t s s trugg le agains t the bi shop . We know the knight is s trong : a ) when the pawns are f ixed , b) when it has p o int s o f support , and c ) when the enemy pawns are on squar e s o f the same c o lor as his b i shop .

You wi l l not f ind G l igoric ' s name l i s ted among tho se who are con s id ered "main- l ine enthus i a s t s " ; tho se would be Re shevsky , Euwe and Aver bakh . For thi s game G l igoric came as c lo s e to the ma in l ine as he eve r did in the cour s e of the tournament , but he gave it a different trea t ment , more l ike a Queen ' s Gam bit : deve lop ing the bi shop at e2 , he traded o f f the center pawns so as to l eave Black an i s o lated dS-pawn . The game ' s chie f int ere s t l ie s in the ebb and f l ow of the p o s i t ional s trugg l e that revo lves around thi s pawn . Heavy-p iece f i ght ing fo r an i s o lated pawn is one o f the cen tra l e l ement s of pos it iona l p lay . Much more i s invo lved than the s imp le formula : "White at tack8 twice , Black defend s twice - and a draw is the outcome" . Woven int o the strugg le are such mo t i f s as : p inning the i so lated pawn ( should the heavy p ieces defend it from beh ind ) , a sud den switch t o an at tack on the king , or an at tempt to occupy the seventh rank at s ome point when the heavy p ieces are t ied to the de fense of the i s o l ated pawn . I s o lated pawn end ing s were p layed with great ski l l by the c la s s ic is t s Lasker , Capab lanca and Rubinstein. In the present game , G l igoric and Euwe come forearmed with the ir knowledge of the o ld ma sters ' lega cy . The reader who immerses himse l f in th i s batt le ' s fine po int s , who examines the technique s used here , and who fami l iA.r izes h j mse l f w ith the bas ic ideas behind th is type of end ing , wi l l have made a g reat s t ride forward in pos iti ona l p lav .

DRAW
168. Keres-Smyslov
(English Opening) On the eve of the 24th round , Kere s was a ha lf- po int behind Smvs l ov , but Kere s was due for his bye in the 2 5 th round . In the event of a draw with Smys l ov , he wou ld fal l e ither a po int or a po int and a ha lf be hind Smys lov , depend ing on how the lat ter scored aga inst Re shevsky in Round 2 5 . Thus , we can see the psycho l ogica l c ircums tance wh ich impe l led Kere s to try his luck with a s trange , sharp king s ide at tack , us ing only his two rooks without the aid of his pawns .

BlACK RES IGNED
[288)
171. Kotov-Giigoric
(King's Indian) In the struggle that is ches s , the blockade i s not j us t an im portant technique , but a l so one of the e lement s in the strateg ic p lan. The method s for deal ing with any enemy piece may be ranked in desc ending value as f o l l ows : capture ( or e l imina t ion) , exchange , attack , b l ock ade . The attacked piece may be defended in any of several ways : re treat is the s imp les t , but i t may a l s o be shie lded , o r the at tacking piece may be captured . The idea behind the b lockade is f ir s t t o depr ive the target piece of its mobi l i ty before actua l ly attacking it . In the mos t general sense , a blockade may be emp loyed agains t any piece , inc luding the king , but when we speak of the b lock ade in prac t ical terms , general ly it is in reference to pawns . They are the eas ie st t o blockade , and the mos t dangerous pieces when set in mot i on. Which piece s be s t f i l l the role of b lockader ? Firs t and foremost , of course , the knight , s ince whi le i t b l ocks the path of the pawn it a l s o attacks the square s d iagonal ly behind it . The bishop is also useful for thi s purpose , s ince it can pre vent the advance of several pawns s imu ltane ous ly. One may also b lockade a pawn with a pawn � but that is a double edged weapon, s ince the b l ock ad ing pawn become s b lockaded itse l f . The se are the b lockade ' s s im plest facet s ; the real ity of che s s is a great deal more com p l icated . In the Kotov - Gl igo r ic game , B lack succeeded in maintain ing a blockade of a con s iderable length of pawn chain , thereby severe ly restricting , not only the pawns , but the pieces too . Natural ly , G l igoric d id not achieve a l l thi s for nothing : it cost him a great deal of thought- and two pawns . 1 . 2 . d2-d4 c2-c4 Ng8-f6 ****** g7-g6 3 . Nb 1-c3 4 . e2-e4 s . f2-f3

(Queen's Indian Defense) Doe s White ge t the advantage from his right to the f irst move ? Every che s sp layer asks himself that que s t ion, and the answer i s not eas i ly discovered . One is forcefu l ly reminded in thi s connec tion of Vsevo lod Rau zer , one of our mo st noted mas ter- theore t ic ians , whose motto was , " 1 e2-e4 ! , and Whit e wins" . He was probab ly j oking when he said that , but every j oke con tains its share of truth . This conviction that moving the king ' s pawn f ir s t gave White the bet- ter of it , whi l e 1 d2-d4 led only to a draw , inspired Rauzer to work out amaz ing ly deep and forceful attacking systems in a number of openings : the S ic i lian , French, Ruy and Caro-Kann , and many others . Later , o f course , it deve l oped that many of his (291] wins owed le s s to the obj ec tive s trength of his 1 e2-e4 than to Rauzer ' s own creative talent , the except ional ly l ogical pat tern of h i s thinking , and the accuracy of his calculati ons . Rauzer ' s Attacks and Var iat ions l ive on, and are s t i l l emp loyed to this day , even though it i s po s s ible for B lack to defend him se l f succ e s s fu l ly agains t them. So working up forc ing l ines for use in the opening battle , a fear some weapon in the hand s o f such p layers as Morphy , Chigorin , Pi l l sbury , Alekhine , F ine and Botvinnik , i s a method that works equa l ly we l l f or White or B lack . The p layer who use s a prepared forc ing l ine may very we l l run into a f orced re futation, as in deed happened in some games from the pre sent t ournament . There i s n o playe r , pas t o r pre sent , who has never made a mis take - an axiom that ho lds j us t as true f or home analys i s as i t does for over- the -board play . Which , in turn , means that one cannot , as a ru l e , gain the advantage thi s way in the opening . S o there exi sts a d i fferent concept of opening s trat egy , which may briefly be summarized as f o l l ows : that it is not nec es sary to make the very be st move s - on ly good ones . This was the creat ive atti tude o f Lasker and Capab lanca , for examp le , and i t is Smys lov ' s too . The advantage o f the open ing , in this cas e , is unders t ood to be the right to choose a sys tem o f deve lopment more suited to the White p layer ' s taste , and which give s him the greatest pos s ible l iberty to express his creat ive abi l i ty . Stat i s tics - a sound approach to the s tudy of mas s phenomena - show that White ' s opening advan tage i s qui te real . In the var ious eras of his tory , in every strong tournament for which rec ord s were kept , White he ld a per s i s tent edge in the number of wins . Thi s advantage of White ' s should be cons idered as a ten dency , which manifests itself in the course o f dozens or hun dreds o f game s , but which has no bearing on the outcome o f any part icular game . I t wou ld be tremendous ly intere s t ing to ex- amine this tendency in hi stori cal cro s s - s ec t ion : has the per centage of games won by Wh ite increased or decreased by c om parison with what it was , say , 2 0 , 50 or 100 years ago ? One pecul iar feature should be noted : the stronger the tournament , the weaker the inf luence o f the ad vantage of the f irst move . As examp l es to demons trate this , one may c ite the 1948 Wor ld ' s Cham pionship Match-Tournament , the 1 9 5 1 World ' s Champ ionship Match ( in which White won f our game s and Black s ix ) , and a few other events . Does this mean that even tua l ly the right of the f irst move wi l l g ive no advantage at a l l ? Time wil l te l l . • • In thi s game , the reader wi l l f ind a sample of Bo les lavsky ' s we l l-prepared and accurate ly calculated opening play , f o l l owed by a natural trans it ion into a combinat ive midd l e s tage , and then an interest ing endgame which i s a win f or White .

Nf6-e4 In c ontrast to the King ' s In d ian , where the placement o f the white e-pawn makes no difference to Black , in the Queen ' s Ind ian B lack has to keep c lo s e watch on the e4 square . The difference is eas ily explained : in the King ' s Ind ian, Bla ck p laces his center pawns on d6 and e 5 , leaving his queen ' s bishop the exc e l lent di agonal c8 -h3 to work on, where as her� the queen ' s bishop is deve loped to b 7 , with a differ ent working d iagonal , a8-h1 . Con s equent ly , i t fo l l ows that the fewer pawns stand in the way from b7 t o £ 3 , the better B lack ' s prospects w i l l be . The next phase of the game could be headed , "The Bat t l e For e2-e4" , and it is Bo l e s lavsky who come s out the vic- [292] t or . Un l ike Taimanov, he doe s not forget his o ther option , that of shutt ing the f ianche t toed bi shop out with d4-d5 . 8 . Qd 1-c2 Ne4 : c3 9 .

There is an e lement o f tac t ic s here as we l l : Averbakh mus t pay c lose at ten t ion to the d iagona l c 5 -g 1 , s ince a check by B lack ' s queen at c 5 , attacking the b i shop on c4, could prove mos t unpleasant for Whi te . 1 7 .

Here , Black c ould occupy d4 with h i s knight , but he sees that this would leave him with insuffi c ient pro spec ts for the further s trengthening of his pos ition . Meanwhile , White could p lay Rab1 and b4 , etc . ; and with his b i shop working on the d iagonal h1-a8 , he could work up some ser ious threat s to Black ' s queen ' s wing . Dur ing al l thi s , practical ly the only thing the knight on d4 would accompl i sh would be to c over the weak pawn on d3 from frontal attacks along the d- fi le . Thi s is why , ins tead of the "strateg ic" • • Nd4 , B lack se lects the c omb inat ive . . Rfd8 , aiming directly at the d-pawn . 1 5 . Be3 : c5 16 . d3-d4 1 7 . Qd 1-e2 Nc6-e5 Ne5 : c4 Nc4-d6 A series of subt le changes has occurred . White ' s queen ' s bishop has migrated to c S , where it cramps B lack ' s act ivitie s . White ' s d -pawn has moved up a square , but it remains j ust as i s o lated , and therefore j us t as weak , as it was bef ore . But i s it rea l ly weak? I t is common pract ice to talk about [303] an isolated pawn ' s shortcomings and neglect i t s pos itive aspects . One such aspect is the absence of pawns on the ne ighboring f i les , which is a point for the " i solated" s ide , as long as he can bring his maj or p ieces to those f i l e s . And s o it i s here : the absence o f pawns on the c- and e - f i les i s c learly not favorable to B lack . The queen , for example , stand s quite uncomfortably at c 7 , and the far reaching power of White ' s bi shops is also making itself fe l t . Under the se c ircumstances , Black takes the only proper dec i s ion : to attack and e l iminate the d pawn supporting White ' s center as quickly as he can . 1 8 . 19 . 2 0 . a2 -a4 a4-a5 a5-a6 e 7-e6 Nd6 - f 5 Nf6 -d5 B lack mis takenly s tops half way . 20 • • b6 would have achieved both of B lack ' s goa l s by driving the b i shop from c5 and e l iminat ing the d-pawn .

185. Geller-Taimanov
(Ruy Lopez) Why i s it that today - as com pared to ten years ago , let ' s say - s o few masters wi l l go in for f ierce combinat ive at tacks , with piece sacrifice s ? More than any other reason, it i s because the art of combinat ive defense the se days has reache d such a high leve l that in the he at of the bat t le it occas iona l ly become s d i f f icul t to determine who i s at tacking whom. Of course it ' s fun to crumble the defense s of an opponent ' s king move by move , to create irre s is t ib le threat s , and to wind up the game with a mat ing at tack . But how sad it can be to end up minus both piece and attack, to s it and wonder : "How d id a l l thi s happen? Where d id I go wrong ?" Thi s i s , roughly , the psycho log ical backdrop of the Ge l le r - Taimanov game ; but at the very end , fortune favored the brave . 1 . e2-e4 2 . Ng 1 - f 3 3 . Bf 1-b5 e 7 - e 5 Nb8-c6 Bf8-b4 In the Evans Gambit , White sacrifice s a pawn in order to lure the b lack bi shop to b4 , s o that he can p lay c2-c3 and d2- d4 with tempo . Here the b ishop i s go ing to b4 of its own ac cord , and White can carry out the same idea free of charge , s o to speak. Ge l ler come s to an unexpected conc lusion : s ince he i s not required to sacrific e one of his own pawns , he take s one of his opponent ' s . 4 .

(King 's Indian) Th i s game was ident ical to the Naj d orf - Petros ian game unt i l move 1 2 : again , Naj dorf gave up his centra l pawn for the black b-pawn , and thereby abandoned the s trugg le to so lve one of the bas ic problems of the opening . But where Petro s ian, in the s ixth-round game a l luded to, immed iat e ly committed a serious p o s i t i ona l error by p laying . • c 7 -c5 and deprived his knight o f i t s best square , Ge l ler take s a les son from that game , and carries out a succe s s fu l queens id e attack here . 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 . 5 . 6 . 7 . 8 . 9 . 1 0 . 1 1 . 1 2 . 1 3 . 14 . d4-d4 c 2 -c4 g 2 - g 3 Bf 1 - g 2 Ng 1 - f 3

d 7 -d6 Nb8 -c6 Bc 8-g4 Bg4 : f3 N f 6 -d7 Nc6 : d4 Ra8 -b8 Rb8 -b4 Nd4-e6 Nd 7-e5 ! [323] In some openings - A lekh ine ' s De fense , f or examp l e , or the Grunfe ld - B lack moves an un protec ted p iece into the center to induce the hypertrophied ad vance of White ' s pawns , intend ing to attack them lat e r . Ge l ler here executes a s imi lar idea in the midd legame . He is trying to induce Wh ite ' s pawns to advance to f4 and t o b3 , which he soon acc omp l i she s . Later , he wi l l work up an attack against the pawn at b3 , f or which purpose he wi l l set h i s rooks on the b- f i le and his knight at c 5 , support ing the a pawn ' s advance to a4 . The reader should note that Petro s ian was unable t o carry out the same idea on ly because he had no p iece that cou ld contr o l the a4 square : the queen , of c our s e , is not a proper p iece for this purpo s e , and the knight need s the square c S - which , a s we saw , had be en oc cupied by his pawn . 1 5 . f 2 - f4 16 . Nc3 -d5 Ne5-d7 Rb4-b8 Despite the wh ite knight ' s threatening posture , and the rather humb le s tatus of Black ' s pawns , we c ons id er B lack ' s po s i t ion preferab l e . The knight wi l l not keep i t s p lace on d5 for very long , whi l e Black ' s pawns harbor a great dea l of potential energy . Wh i t e wi l l have trouble deve loping his rook s , and his wing attack on the king s id e has fewer prospects than Black ' s attack on the queen s ide . 1 7 . Qe2 - c 2 1 8 . Nd5-c3 1 9 .

Ne2 : c 3 Bg7 : c 3 Qb6 -a6 The s trategic idea is proper ; i t s tact ica l execut ion i s fau l ty . The weakening 25 b 3 could a l s o have been induced by 2 4 • .

This was exact ly the proper moment to answer White ' s f lank attack, in accordance with c las s ical princ ip les , with a coun ter s troke in the center : 27 • • e6 ! 2 8 g4 d5 ; now White ' s f irst at tacking wave has been beaten off , arid the b lack pawn cannot be prevented from advanc ing to a4 . 2 8 . 29 . f4- f5 f5-f6 !

ZURICH INTERNATIONAL
CHESS TOURNAMENT, 1953
David Bronstei n The book of a strong tou rnament is more than just a games collectio n . When its pa rticipan ts are the world 's strongest players . . . the toumamen t as a w hole represen ts a step forward in the development of chess creativity. We may take as exa m ples of such tou m aments the events at Hastings 1 895, St. Petersbu rg 1 914, New York 1 924, Moscow 1 935, and G roningen 1 946. Beyond doubt, Zurich-Neuhausen 1 953 deserves a place among them . David Bronstein ventured this evaluation of Zurich 1 953 j ust three years after the event , in the preface to the first Russian edition of this book. Since that time the 210 games of t h e legendary tournament have o n l y grown in stature . M ost k nowledgeable chess players now rate it the greatest tournament since World War I I , and possibly the greatest tournament of all time. For over 25 years there was no substantial account in English of this great tournament. I n the 1960s Jim Marfia, a talented amateur player, became determi ned to provide an authoritative E nglish translation of B ronstein's book, a task which occupied him for several years . The complete record of the famous Zurich I nternational Chess Tournament, 1953, is available in English for the fi rst time. Held to determi ne a challenger for then World Champion Botvinnik, Zurich 1953 attracted fifteen of the strongest players in the w orld : Sm-Yslov Geller Boleslavsky Bronstei n N ajdQrf Szabo Keres Kotov Gligoric Reshevsky Taim anov Euwe Petrosian Averbakh Stahlberg Al most all the games were hotly contested, and m any are masterpieces of the first rank. To mention Euwe-Smyslov (round 3) , Taim anov-Najdorf (round 4, w inner of a b rilliancy prize) , and Keres-Reshevsky (round 1 1 , one of the most reproduced and analyzed games in chess) , is just to touch the tip of the iceberg; there are literally dozens of memorable, innovative games in this volume, i ncluding a substantial portion by the author, one of th� game's greatest players, w ho finished tied for second with Keres and Reshevsky, behind the winner Smyslov . This book fills a significant gap in the English-language library of i nfluential chess tournament books. Advanced players, many of whom have known about the tournament for years, w ill w ant this book for the games alone . Begin ning and in termed iate pl ayers, concerned m ore im mediately with i nstruction, will find David B ronstein's annotations not only perceptive and thorough, but also a veritable textbook on how to play the m iddle game. O r iginal Dover (1 979) publication, consisti ng of an English translation of the corrected , second R ussian (1 960) editio n . 210 games i n algebraic notation . 352 diagrams. I ndex of players. xviii + 349pp. 6 1/2 x 9 1!4 . Paperbound . , ' f-l s rl4 e ISBN 0-486-23800-8 , .i, · , t e,U.s.A.
