INTRODUCTION TO THIS EDITION
eople have been asking for a new printing of Best Lessons of a Chess Coach for over a decade. I first went to Sunil and Ed requesting they make just a few minor edits, but we were soon engaged in a major re-write, going back to Ed's original transcriptions of Sunil's classes at Hunter College Elementary School and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation's Saturday chess program at the Girl Scout House in Scarsdale. For this edition, we wanted to be certain that the main theme of each lesson is clear and that we go off on fewer tangents. We also determined where additional or alternate diagrams would benefit the student. By making a slight change in lesson order, we now present a grandmaster game followed by one or more of Sunil's games where he encountered similar positions and concepts. And two additional games, originally planned for the 1993 book but left out due to page count restrictions, have been completed and are presented herein. Another change is in the presentation of the Illustrative Games. They now appear at the end of each thematic section, and include a number of modern grandmaster games. Each of these games is presented with a series of commented diagrams which follow the flow of the game and emphasize the themes. In addition, many of these games are supplemented with exercises. With the great wealth of chess now available on the Internet, something Sunil and Ed did not enjoy in the early 1990s, you can readily find these games and play them through, which we highly recommend. This book is available on the Forward Chess app which also allows you to see all the moves of a game, not just the diagrammed positions. In his lessons, Sunil makes the point that there is validity in studying games in their entirety. Rather than simply solving puzzles, studying games exposes you to many different types of positions and helps you formulate an appropriate strategy to try in your own play. In the time I have been working with Sunil, I cannot count how often people have commented that Best Lessons of a Chess Coach is among their top two or three books because of how much they learned. So, without further ado, this new edition is for them, and for the many younger generations of chess players who would love to have a lesson from one of our nation's most successful chess instructors. Turn the page, class is about to begin. Robert McLellan Editor, Best Lessons of a Chess Coach: Extended Edition 8

PREFACE
ne of the biggest stumbling blocks in the development of aspiring chess players comes sometime after they begin to play in tournaments. In the heat of competition, their minds are often plagued with questions they do not know how to answer: "Who has the better position?" "Should I resolve the tension in the center?" "Can I improve the placement of my pieces?" "What is the best way to penetrate my opponent's defenses?" Such questions cannot be answered by mere reference to a laundry list of canned precepts. Every truth about chess must be couched in context - preferably in the context of a real game. To play chess well, and to appreciate it the most, one can do no better than to study complete, well-annotated master games. This book presents a series of classroom lessons by nationally acclaimed chess coach Sunil Weeramantry, aFIDE master who is in current and continual practice. Sunil's lectures bring the reader through the entire life cycle of a game, making clear what is happening at key moments. The cumulative effect of studying these lectures is to give the improving player tools with which to win. We hope the reader will find a good amount of chess entertainment while seeing how the story of each of these games unfolds in the classroom. There is a great deal of beauty, logic, and artistry to admire and enjoy in the games and ideas presented. When Sunil lectures on the games of the great masters, one can imagine being there. When Sunil lectures on his own games, one can share the experience along with him - the excitement, disappointments, and satisfaction of a well-played game. This book is organized into four thematic sections, each containing several lessons. Each lesson presents one complete game that illustrates one or more themes. The lessons are dialogues in which Sunil frames questions for his students. You should pause to answer the questions yourself. Note that the first answer given in the text may not be the correct one. Sometimes these wrong answers provide the best opportunity for learning. Diagrams are provided to help you follow the game and visualize the possibilities, but it is also recommended that you play along on your own chess set. You will also be given exercises within each lecture. You may wish to set up the position on a board, perform your own analysis, and make notes for comparison to the answers given at the end of the lesson. Review notes are provided to reinforce the important points made during each lecture. These notes are segmented into "Themes" and "Advice." As you read these, try to recall the context in which the ideas were presented. If necessary, go back and find the relevant paragraphs. At the end of each of the four thematic sections, you will find Illustrative Games. These games highlight the themes of the associated lessons. Play through these games to get a feel for how thematic positions develop in different situations. Such pattern reinforcement is important to the development of chess skill. Preface If you should encounter chess terms you do not understand, please refer to the Glossary provided at the end of the book.

PART A
OUTPOST SQUARES
he games in this section demonstrate the establishment and exploitation of outpost squares. A piece posted on such a square exerts pressure on the opponent's position and supports the attack. d5 is an outpost Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense)
O
LESSON 1
[diagram]
HOME AWAY FROM HOME
ur first lesson introduces the idea of the outpost square as a permanent advantage that can support the steady build-up of an attack. In this game, note how Grandmaster Vasily Smyslov secures his position against counterplay before launching the final assault. This game was played in the USSR Championship in 1945. While Smyslov did not win this event, he went on to place second in the 1948 World Championship tournament and, in 1957, became the seventh World Chess Champion. There are four criteria that qualify a square as an outpost: • It should be a central square, preferably in enemy territory. • It must be safe from attack by a pawn. • It must be subject to effective occupation, preferably by a knight. • It must have an anchor. The anchor should be a pawn. Why is an outpost square important? If you can establish a safe place in enemy territory ("a home away from home"), you can use that square to launch an attack.
V. SMYSLOV - I. RUDAKOVSKY
Moscow 1945
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4
[diagram]
The Open Sicilian. A Sicilian is considered either "open" or "closed" depending on whether or not White plays the move d2-d4, opening both central diagonals within the first three moves. Every player should learn how to play the Open Sicilian. Before playing closed positions, you need the open game experience. At some point, in order to win, a closed position must be opened up.
3...cxd4
Black trades his c-pawn for White's d-pawn; this gives him two center pawns against White's one.
4.Nxd4 Nf6 (D)
Question: There is a trap in this position. Tell me what happens if White plays e5. What is wrong with this move? Answer: It moves a pawn twice. True, but it is not a loss of time, as it places the f6-knight under attack. Look for a tactical reason. Answer: Black has ...Qa5+, checking the king and attacking the e5-pawn. Right. This is adouble attack. Look for one when you see an unprotected piece or pawn.
5.Nc3 d6 6.Be2 Be7 (D)
After 9.f4
[diagram]
Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense) This variation, with black pawns on e6 and d6, is the Scheveningen Sicilian, so-called because it was first played in Scheveningen, asmall village in The Netherlands that hosted a very strong tournament in 1923. While modestly placed in terms of development, the e7-bishop protects the d6-pawn. Not every piece can go on the attack. Black hopes to complete his development, expand on the queenside by pushing his a- and b-pawns, line up his heavy pieces on the c-file, and play for an eventual ...d6-d5, using his extra pawn to strike in the center of the board.
7.O-O O-O 8.Be3 Nc6
Notice that White has placed both bishops on the same central file, leaving the other one open for his rooks. We have now reached the end of the opening. White has all of his minor pieces developed; Black has all but one. (D) Question: How should White further develop his position? Answer: Bb5. No, this is harmless. Black can easily defend with ...Bd7. If White now trades bishop for knight, Black will reply with ...bxc6, getting yet another pawn into the center. The correct move is...
9.f4 (D)
After lO.Wel
[diagram]
After 11...e5 It is extremely important to get two pawns together on the fourth rank whenever feasible. This controls the four squares in front and acts as a screen to provide maneuvering room from behind. Two pawns on the fourth can act as a screen to move pieces around. You do not have to advance these pawns - they perform a valuable function where they are. This move also creates more space for the rook on f1. And it gives you a middlegame plan: White will attack on the kingside. Always try to start an attack on the side of the board where you have more space. Once you establish a space advantage, either the kingside or queenside, move your pieces to that side of the board and conduct an attack. Pay attention to how Smyslov builds up his attack without giving Black counterplay. Comment: What about the weakness on f2? It is not an important weakness if it cannot be exploited. Your king is only as weak as your opponent's ability to attack it.
9...Qc7 10.Qe1 (D)
A key move - Smyslov creates a way for his queen to move to the kingside. You would not have thought of this without the earlier kingside expansion. This is why you must study an opening system; middlegame plans are easier to formulate when you have a thorough grasp of why each opening move was played.
10...Nxd4 11.Bxd4 e5 (D)
After 14>Sxf6 (12,fxe5 variation) After 13...Ac5 (12.fxe5 variation)
[diagram]
Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense) Question: White's bishop is under attack. How should he proceed? Answer: Trade pawns: 12.fxe5 dxe5. Then play 13.Qg3 and pin the e5-pawn. Question: So how might Black respond to the double attack on the pawn? Answer: 13...Bd6. Answer: But then White just wins a free piece with 14.Rxf6. (D) Okay, I see that the g7-pawn is pinned, but is it really a free piece? Exercise 1-1: In the variation 12. fxe5 dxe5 13.Qg3 Bd6, White can try to win a free piece with 14.Rxf6. Does this work? Analyze several moves ahead until all potential checks and captures have been evaluated. Question: We can still conclude that 13...Bd6 is not the best defense; Black has a much stronger move. What is it? Answer: 13...Bc5, creating his own bishop pin, is much stronger. (D) Bravo! If White now plays 14.Qxe5??, Black will play queen takes queen and laugh! Or, Bf14.Bxc5, then 14...Qxc5+ 15.Kh1 Kh8 stopping Rxf6, and Black is fine. Smyslov can see that the tactics with 12.fxe5 do not work, so he adopts a more strategic plan.
12.Be3 (D)
After 12.Ne3
1. Better
2. Better
White chooses to maintain the pawn structure because two connected pawns on the fourth rank enjoy a space advantage over one on the fourth and one on the third. (D) If Black initiates a pawn trade, White retains a pawn on his fourth rank against a black pawn on its third, thereby retaining a space advantage. (D) What White does not want to do is initiate the trade himself, as this will result in an equal pawn position. (D)
3. Equal
6 5 4 3 c d e f After 12,"Ne6?
[diagram]
Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense) You may be wondering, "What does all this have to do with checkmate?" Well, in chess, you fight all sorts of battles, big and small. Winning a game of chess is a matter of accumulating advantages. Do this well and eventually, you will overwhelm your opponent. There is no need to attempt a quick knockout. Black now makes an error that increases White's advantage.
12...Be6? (D)
This loses a valuable tempo and allows White to consolidate his space advantage on the kingside. Current theory recommends 12...Bd7 instead.
13.f5 Bc4
Question: Should Black have offered to trade light-square bishops? Answer: Yes. White's light-square bishop might be able to attack on the kingside. Not at all. It is better to retreat with 13...Bd7. You must distinguish between thinking ahead and merely dreaming! There really is no way for White's e2-bishop to take part in a kingside attack. Do not handicap your thinking by conjuring up threats that cannot be made. Fixed pawn chains restrict the movement of bishops. Here, White's light-square bishop is a bad bishop because its movement is restricted by its own pawns on e4 and f5. Black's light- square bishop is agood bishop because its movement is not hindered by its own pieces. In general, one does not trade the good for the bad. Nevertheless, Black is offering to trade his good bishop for White's bad bishop so that he can get his queen to c4. His idea is to put pressure on e4 and support a pawn break with ...d6-d5. This plan is ill-conceived. After 14."$xc4 After 16.Nd5 (variation)
14.Bxc4 Qxc4 (D)
Question: The contrast in the position is striking. Now who has the good bishop? Answer: White. Question: And how should White protect his e4-pawn? Answer: Qh4. That protects e4, but White must be careful about walking into a discovered attack, for example 15...Nd5. Sometimes the best course of action is to anticipate trouble before it happens. Any other ideas? Answer: Bg5. A very good move! By pinning the knight, this move does two things: itprotects the e-pawn, and it prevents the freeing move ...d5.
15.Bg5 Rfe8
Black protects the pinned piece. Question: What is White thinking about doing next? Answer: He can play Nd5. (D) Not yet. Exercise 1-2: 16.Nd5 is a blunder. Why? After 17,..Bxc2 (variation} Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense)
16.Bxf6
White has identified the potential outpost square on d5, and, even though the bishops will get traded off, he takes the knight on f6 so that he gains absolute control of the d5 square.
16...Bxf6 17.Nd5 (D)
This is a central outpost square. It cannot be attacked by a black pawn and is effectively occupied by a knight which is anchored by the e4-pawn. The knight attacks f6 and e7 on the kingside, and also exerts influence on the queenside. You do not know yet how this game will end, but what you do know is you have seized control of one great square! The knight is like a tennis player in the middle of the court: it can pivot to the right or the left. It will dominate the bad bishop. Of course, White may choose to trade off his knight at the right time, and for the right price. For example, taking the bishop on the next move would weaken Black's castled position. Question: What if Black now plays ...Qxc2 ? (D) Answer: Attack the queen with Rc1. That would cost an extra pawn after ...Qxb2. There is a better move. Exercise 1-3: Find a better move for White after 17...Qxc2.
17...Bd8
After 18x3
[diagram]
After 20...Sc8
[diagram]
This protects c7 and allows the queen to capture the c2-pawn. Smyslov now decides to take care of his queenside weaknesses. He will put a protected pawn on c3, thus stopping Black's counterplay. Then he will switch over to a kingside attack.
18.c3 (D)
Now, if 18...Bb6+, do not even consider trading the knight for the bishop. White simply moves his king to safety. Black's bishop will be stranded on the queenside and will not be able to assist in the king's defense.
18...b5 19.b3
A difficult move to find. This does not weaken c3 because that pawn is defended by the knight in the outpost. By denying Black any counterplay on the queenside, White will be free to launch a kingside attack without distraction.
19...Qc5+ 20.Kh1 Rc8 (D)
Despite occupying ahalf-open file, Black's move does little. Avoid good-looking moves that do nothing for your position. Better is20...f6.
21.Rf3
White plays a rook lift. This maneuver is one of two ways to attack the castled king. The other is a pawn storm. These two techniques do not work together. A rook lift is generally preferred over a pawn storm if both players are castled on the same side of the board. After 22...g6 (variation)
[diagram]
After 22..,gxf6
[diagram]
Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense) Compare the relative strengths of the rooks. Rooks, to be strong, must have a turning point on the file. This is why Black's c8-rook is not as well placed as it looks. White now has a number of favorable elements for a kingside attack: Black's g7 and h7 are targets, and his pieces are out of position. White is shifting his army to the kingside, and his f5- pawn is positioned to disrupt Black's defenses All this is being supported by the knight on the outpost square!
21...Kh8?
Once again, Black should attempt to slow White's attack with 21...f6.
22.f6
This pawn advance would have worked equally well on the previous move. Now, if Black replies with 22...g6 (D), White can initiate a standard middlegame checkmating pattern which forces a win regardless of Black's defense. Learn as many of these patterns as you can, as they will help you steer your attack in the right direction. Exercise 1-4: How should White proceed against 22...g6 ? There are two variations.
22...gxf6 (D)
23.Qh4 Rg8 24.Nxf6 Rg7 25.Rg3 (D)
After 25.sg3 Exercise 1-5: After 25.Rg3, White is threatening a forced mate. What are the moves?
25...Bxf6
Black takes the knight to avoid White's threat.
26.Qxf6
The focal point of the attack has shifted from h7 to g7. It is not uncommon for the focus of the attack to change as the defender begins to protect his position. When there are several weak squares around the king, they provide the attacker with multiple focal points.
26...Rg8
Note that the rook on g3 performs two functions. It attacks g7, and it also defends c3 preventing Black's queen from starting a counterattack.
27.Rd1
White activates his other rook, threatening to capture the pawn on d6 and continue on to the back rank.
27...d5 28.Rxg7 Rxg7 29.Rxd5 1-0
As White's queen protects d8, Black cannot stop White's rook from reaching the eighth rank. After 14.gxf6 (12.fxe5 variation)
[diagram]
After 16,..dxc3 (12.fxe5 variation) Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense)
ANSWERS
Exercise 1-1: In the variation 12.fxe5 dxe5 13.Qg3 Bd6, White can try to win a free piece with
14.Rxf6. Does this work? Analyze several moves ahead until all potential checks and captures
have been evaluated. (D) Answer: White does not win a free piece. Black replies with 14...exd4 15.Qxd6 Qxd6 16.Rxd6 dxc3. (D) Now White should keep the c-file closed with 17.b3. Control of the d-file gives White the advantage. 17.bxc3, on the other hand, destroys White's pawn structure and gives Black excellent counterplay against White's doubled c-pawns after ...Be6 and ...Rac8. Exercise 1-2: 16.Nd5 is a blunder. Why? Answer: 16.Nd5 loses a piece to a frequently seen combination. Black plays 16...Nxd5, protecting his bishop with his knight while simultaneously creating a discovered attack on White's bishop.
(D)
After 16>..Nxd5 (16*Nd5 variation) After 18,Sf2 (17...Bxc2 variation)
[diagram]
After 23.Rh4 (22...g6 variation) The result is the win of a piece for Black regardless of which capture White makes: 17.exd5 Bxg5 or 17.Bxe7 Nxe7. Note that this tactic would work even if the e7-bishop were not protected by the rook. Exercise 1-3: Find a better move for White after 17...Qxc2. Answer: After 17...Qxc2, the right move would be 18.Rf2. (D) This move attacks the queen and protects b2. White wins the exchange without dropping any more pawns: 18...Qc4 19.b3 Qc6 20.Rc1 Qd7 21.Nc7 forking the two rooks. Exercise 1-4: How should White proceed against 22...g6 ? There are two variations. Answer: White can answer 22...g6 with 23.Qh4. (D) After 25.Sg3 Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense) The idea isQh6, threatening mate on g7. If 23...Rg8, White wins with the queen sacrifice 24.Qxh7+ Kxh7 25.Rh3#. If instead 23...h5, White still attempts to reach h6 with 24.Qg5. Black's only way of stopping this maneuver is to play 24...Kh7. Now 25.Rh3 sets up a rook sacrifice on h5 with a mating attack. Exercise 1-5: After 25.Rg3, White is threatening a forced mate. What are the moves? (D) Answer: White is threatening 26.Qxh7+ Rxh7 27.Rg8#. This is a typical mating pattern you should familiarize yourself with.
REVIEW
Themes Making a middlegame plan (9.f4 and l0.Qe1). Space advantage in the center (9.f4). Maintaining tension (12.Be3). Bad bishop versus good bishop (12...Be6 and 13...Bc4). The outpost square (15.Bg5, 16.Bxf6, 17.Nd5). Building the attack (10.Qe1; 15.Bg5 through 21.Rf3). Preventing counterplay (18.c3 and 19.b3). Shifting focal points (23.Qh4 through 29.Rxd5). Advice Two pawns on the fourth can act as a screen to move pieces around. Always try to start an attack on the side of the board where you have more space. Your king is only as weak as your opponent's ability to attack it. You must study an opening system; middlegame plans are easier to formulate when you have a thorough grasp of why each opening move was played. Winning a game of chess is a matter of accumulating advantages. Do not handicap your thinking by conjuring up threats that cannot be made. Anticipate trouble before it happens. Avoid good-looking moves that do nothing for your position. A rook lift is generally preferred over a pawn storm if both players are castled on the same side of the board. Rooks, to be strong, must have a turning point on the file. Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian)

LESSON 2
[diagram]
KNIGHT MUSIC
n the previous game, we saw the strength of a knight that took up residence on a central outpost square, and eventually lent support to a direct attack on the king. In this game, without even launching a direct attack, a knight posted one rank deeper in enemy territory disrupts White's queenside by totally paralyzing the opposing rooks. This game was played in the U.S. Amateur Team Championship. Over one thousand players compete on 4-person teams in this annual "chess extravaganza," and they all compete in the same division. It is a great tournament, especially for young and improving players like yourselves. The best way to improve your game is to challenge more experienced players.
L. PUGH - S. WEERAMANTRY
Somerset (New Jersey) 1992
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6
This introduces the King's Indian Defense.
3.Nc3 Bg7
Black fianchettoes the king's bishop. Now White has two choices. The most common move is 4.e4, to establish the big center.1 If you are playing Black, itis all right to let White do this so long as you hit back at the right time and not let the center advance on you. My opponent chose to play more conservatively.
4.g3 (D)
After 4,g3
[diagram]
4...O-O 5.Bg2 d6 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.O-O Bg4 (D)
This is the King's Indian Defense Classical Fianchetto, Simagin Variation. It is named after Vladimir Simagin, a Russian grandmaster who was one of the trainers of Vasily Smyslov, the world champion we met in the previous lesson. This move introduces a clear strategy: Black wants to seize control of the central dark squares (d4, e5). Question: How does 7...Bg4 advance Black's plan? Answer: It targets the knight that protects the d4 and e5 squares. Exactly. White's knight on f3 is the principal defender of the central dark squares. Black's purpose in moving to g4 is not just to develop the bishop, but to eliminate this knight. Trading bishop for knight early in the game often saddles the opponent with doubled pawns, as in the Exchange Variation of the Ruy López or in the Nimzo-Indian Defense. This trade, without forcing the creation of doubled pawns, is unusual because strong players typically value bishops over knights. I have played ...Bg4 against players of various strengths. Many of them will chase the bishop away. When they do this, I smile to myself, because it shows that they do not fully appreciate the purpose of the move. My opponent chased the bishop.
8.h3
After 8.d5 (variation) Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian) This wastes a move and pushes Black to do exactly what he intended. Do not help your opponent carry out his plans! Question: What is a more constructive move for White? Answer: 8.Be3. That is a solid developing move, but it is too early to decide where to place this bishop. There are other good moves. Answer: d5. (D) Yes. Advance your pawn and chase Black's knight out of the center! This is White's best move, according to current opening theory. Black's knight on c6 does not have a good square to go to. Question: Where could the knight go? Answer: Move back to b8. That may not be so bad at all - back to b8, then out to d7. So long as the center remains closed, this loss of time is not critical. Let's look at some other choices. Answer: Knight to b4. This will be met by a3, forcing the knight to the rim on a6. The way back into the game is through c5, but this will be short-lived because the knight will again be chased by b4. If Black wishes to maintain a knight on c5, his a-pawn should already be on a5. Answer: Knight to a5. This attacks the c4-pawn, but again the knight is on the rim, and Black must be careful lest the knight get trapped. Back to the game...
8...Bxf3 (D)
After 8..Jbtf3 After 10...fixe5 (9.exf3 variation) Question: Which way is White going to take back? Answer: With the bishop, because taking with his f-pawn doubles the pawns and blocks the g2-bishop. It looks like it does not make sense to take with the pawn, but if Black does not find the correct response, itmakes a lot of sense. A long time ago I played this opening, and at the time I did not know it well. I was playing Black against an experienced master who took back with the pawn (9.exf3). I reacted incorrectly and ran into immediate trouble. Iplayed 9...e5 to break up the center. He took my pawn, and I recaptured with the knight (10.dxe5 Nxe5). (D) What I did not appreciate at the time is that Black cannot maintain a knight on e5. White would first protect his c4-pawn with 11.Qe2, then chase the knight away with f4, reopening the long diagonal for his fianchetto bishop. Despite having doubled pawns, White still has good control of the center. Getting stronger at chess is a matter of experience and study. After a loss, go back and study the critical positions. I did so and learned how to respond correctly to the pawn capture. The correct move for Black is 9...d5, threatening to trade pawns and isolate White's d4- pawn. Should White attempt to avoid the trade by playing c4-c5, the d4-pawn will still remain under pressure from the g7-bishop. (D) After 9,..d5 (9,exf3 variation)
[diagram]
After 9...M7 Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian) There are two weaknesses associated with an isolated pawn: the pawn itself and the square in front of it, which can serve as an outpost. If an isolated pawn is on its fourth rank or below, it cramps the other pieces and restricts their mobility. If the isolated pawn has advanced to the fifth rank or beyond, and is well protected, it can be strong. It becomes more dangerous as it advances. When playing against an isolated pawn, blockade it, especially with a knight. When playing with an isolated pawn, gain space by advancing it, and create piece play on the adjacent files. In this game, White played the correct way, recapturing with the bishop.
9.Bxf3 Nd7 (D)
Now we have a double attack on the d4-pawn, and it is not easy to protect it. Question: How does White protect the d4-pawn? Answer: Push it. Not this time. Question: Why isd5 no longer a good move? Answer: Black has ...Nd4. Not bad. You are moving to a center square, but you are not choosing the best square for the knight. After 10... ce5 (10.d5 variation] After 10-,.e5
[diagram]
Answer: Move the attacked knight to e5, with a double attack on the c-pawn and the bishop. Right. (D) If White protects the pawn with 11.Qb3, Black can attack it again with 11...Nb6, after which the pawn falls. Exercise 2-1: After 10.d5 Nce5, defending the pawn with 11.Qd4 would be disastrous. Why? In the game, White protected d4 with the e-pawn.
10.e3 e5 (D)
Question: What is the main point of 10...e5 ? Answer: To fight for control of the center. Question: What is Black's best move against 11.dxe5 ? Answer: 11...Ndxe5. Exactly, and again both the c4-pawn and the bishop are attacked. Question: What will Black do against 11.d5 ? Answer: Retreat the knight to e7. Correct. (D) After ll.&eS
[diagram]
Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian) Question: Now, with the center closed, how can Black create play? Answer: Pawn to f5. Yes. You must play ...f7-f5 and expand on the kingside. Let me say this again: When a single pawn is on the fourth rank, and there is a chance to get another pawn to an adjacent square, do it!
11.Ne2 (D)
An unexpected reply. White chooses to defend the d-pawn, rather than advancing it and locking the center.
11...f5
This move is normally played when the center is locked. However, it is still effective in this position because White cannot open the center in a meaningful way.
12.c5 (D)
White insists on forcing open the center. What better way to guarantee this than by creating more pawn contact? White hopes his bishop pair will come alive. This is a challenging move. If Kasparov had played 12.c5, I would probably be sitting there shaking! I would think this is some incredible move, just because of the person who played it. Well, you have to forget about who you are playing against and focus on the position at hand. When confronted with a novel or surprising move, take your time. Do not rush your reply. It is always scary to leave the security of the familiar behind you, but a chess player must have the confidence and the courage to strike out on his own. Personally, Ifind the prospect of creating something new to be quite exciting!
12...e4
I decided to block out the bishop with a gain of tempo, and then capture the pawn.
13.Bg2 dxc5 (D)
Question: What does White do now? Answer: Qb3+ recovers the pawn. Yes. This was his plan when he played c5. Of course, I'm not saying it was a good plan.
14.Qb3+ Kh8 15.Qxb7 (D)
After 15.Qxb7
[diagram]
Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian) White has succeeded in destroying Black's queenside pawn structure. Black is left with an isolated a-pawn and doubled isolated c-pawns. The c6-knight is also threatened.
15...Nb4
Black takes care of the principal threat. Question: What compensation does Black have for his shattered pawn structure? Answer: Maybe Black can trap White's queen. Good point. You should be alert to such opportunities. Even if the queen does not get trapped, it will lose a lot of time getting back to safety. Look at the placement of White's pieces. There is not a single piece that is beyond the second rank, except the queen. Remember, not even the most powerful piece can successfully tackle an entire army. Answer: The doubled c-pawn can be traded off. Right again. But Black has to be careful about the timing of that trade. If Black allows White's knight to get into d4, his light squares become vulnerable, as he does not have a light- square bishop to protect them. Question: What else does Black have? Answer: The knight can jump into d3. Exactly. Black has obtained active piece play as compensation for the structural weaknesses.
16.Qb5 (D)
After 16.Sb5 Exercise 2-2: After 16.Qb5, Black has a forced win of material. Can you find it?
16...Rb8
This does not win material, but it maintains Black's advantage.
17.Qc4 Nd3 (D)
The knight has found a home! Occupying an outpost square is a goal in itself. Black's knight on d3 neutralizes the d-file and takes away e1 and c1, disrupting White's development. Meanwhile, look at Black's rooks - they have their choice of files. Now, White should not let this knight stay on d3. However, if he tries to get rid of it with Nf4, his pawn structure will be destroyed regardless of which way he recaptures. Another idea for White is to enable Nc1 by playing Rb1 and Bd2. Black can counter by preparing the advance of his c-pawn to c4, strengthening the outpost. Then, if White ever captures the knight, Black will recapture with the c-pawn and establish a monstrous protected passed pawn on d3.
18.Qc2 (D)
After 18,Qc2
[diagram]
Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian) White retreats his queen to protect b2. I hope you have noticed that White's last five moves have all been queen moves. What started aggressively (14.Qb3+) has ended rather timidly. Do not move the queen out too early. Even the 14th move can be too early if you have not developed all your pieces. White has nothing to show for the queen's adventures, while Black has gained in development at its expense. As he is not presently under any pressure, Black has time to regroup. The next step, then, is to improve the position of the major pieces. Black's rook on b8 is already in a good position. The queen on d8 and the rook on f8, on the other hand, are not doing anything significant. Question: From a long-term point of view, where should Black's f-rook be placed to help you form a winning plan? Answer: On c6 to support the c5-pawn. He can move the rook there from f6. On the whole, a good plan, but it would be better not to block the c7-pawn. Answer: On d6. Yes, that's very strong. Playing on the d-file works, because d4 is a target. The plan I came up with, however, focused on the c-file. Answer: On c8, then after ...Nb6, Black can push the c7-pawn. Agreed. This idea looks at eliminating the weakness of the doubled isolated c-pawns. With the rook on c8, I can trade the c5-pawn, and then advance the c7-pawn. Question: But first the queen must be moved. Where should it go? Answer: Queen to g5. I considered that, but my play right now is on the queenside. Answer: Queen to e7. Yes. That is the move I played.
18...Qe7
This move helps guard e6 against a possible invasion by White's knight and connects the rooks. It fits in neatly with the plan I have already outlined. After 21.$Jxd4
[diagram]
White now thought for a long time and did what many players are guilty of doing when they cannot find a constructive plan: He pushed a random pawn.
19.a3 (D)
This looks very much like a "wait and see" move. The problem with waiting is that Black has too many options. Question: What new weakness does 19.a3 create in White's position? Answer: The square b3 is weak. Yes. Look at that beautiful square! I was sitting there thinking, "Wow - another perfect outpost!" But first things first. It is time to take over the c-file.
19...Rfc8 20.Rb1
White protects the b2-pawn in order to free the c1-bishop.
20...cxd4 21.Nxd4 (D)
Taking with the knight keeps White's pawn chain intact, but leaves his position horribly cramped. Taking with the pawn might result in its loss, but would at least open a diagonal for the dark-square bishop. Sometimes, it is better not to hang on desperately to every single pawn, but to let one go to secure active play.
21...c5 22.Ne2 c4
Now the black knight on d3 is there to stay. After 23.£Jd4
[diagram]
Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian)
23.Nd4 (D)
The knight jumps back into the center, but there is not much it can do without help from the rest of White's pieces.
23...N7c5 (D)
Question: What is Black's plan? Answer: To jump into another outpost on b3. Correct. Exercise 2-3: If White tried to pick off a pawn with 24.Qxc4, what would happen next?
24.Bd2
White finally gets his bishop out - on the twenty-fourth move!
24...Nb3 25.Bc3 (D)
White decides to block the c-file and hopes to challenge Black's g7-bishop. Instead, ifWhite trades knights with 25.Nxb3, Black recaptures with the pawn, forcing the queen back and securing another outpost square, this time on c2! Once a rook occupies that outpost, the invasion along the c-file will be crushing.
25...Nxd4 26.exd4 Qd6 27.Qd2 Bxd4 28.Qe3 (D)
Of course, the queen is safe because Black's d4-bishop is pinned.
28...Rd8 29.g4
Desperation. White has waited too long to create play. He cannot break the stranglehold. Even if White trades pawns on f5, it is Black with his superior mobility who will be able to switch his forces over more effectively for a kingside attack.
29...Rb3 30.gxf5? (D)
After 3O.gxf5?
[diagram]
Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian) White does not see Black's threat.
30...Rxc3!
This wins a piece by force by breaking the pin.
31.Qxe4 Rc2
White is down a piece for just a pawn. He resigned shortly thereafter. After ll.Bd4 (10.d5 variation)

After 17...Na3 (16...&C2 variation)
ANSWERS
Exercise 2-1: After 10.d5 Nce5, defending the pawn with 11.Qd4 would be disastrous. Why?
(D)
Answer: Black would discover an attack on the queen with 11...Nxf3+ 12.exf3 Bxd4. Exercise 2-2: After 16.Qb5, Black has a forced win of material. Can you find it? Answer: Black could have played to win material with 16...Nc2 17.Rb1 Na3. (D) Forking the rook and queen. Now 18.bxa3 Rb8 19.a4 Rxb5 20.axb5 yields Black a queen for rook and knight, but there is still a way to go for victory. Exercise 2-3: If White tried to pick off a pawn with 24.Qxc4, what would happen next? (D) After 24.Bxc4 (variation)
[diagram]
After 26. xb3 (24,Qxc4 variation)
[diagram]
Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian) Answer: Black would play 24...Nb3, skewering the bishop on c1, which is now attacked three times. The best White can do is bail out with 25.Qxb3 Rxb3 26.Nxb3. (D) White has point-count material equality, but Black is firmly in control of White's cramped position, and can continue to exert pressure with moves like ...Rc2 and ...Qc7, among others.
REVIEW
Themes Contesting the central dark squares (7...Bg4). The strengths and weaknesses of the isolated pawn (9.exf3 d5 variation). Occupying the outpost square as a goal (17...Nd3). Improving piece placement and eliminating weaknesses (discussion after 18.Qc2). Advice Fight back against the pawn center; do not let it advance unopposed. Occupy the square in front of the isolated pawn; it is an excellent outpost. When playing with an isolated pawn, advance it beyond the fourth rank and create piece play on the adjacent file. Avoid trades that increase the activity of your opponent's pieces. Do not send the queen into enemy territory without support. It can get trapped, or lose time getting out. Before undertaking active operations, improve the position of badly placed pieces. Connect your rooks; they work best together. Do not hold onto pawns at all costs; it is better to let one go to secure active play. __________

White misses the tactic. Instead, he sacrifices a pawn to trade off Black's strong light-square bishop.
15...Bxc4 16.Nc3 Qb3 17.Bxc4 Qxc4 18.Bg5 Qe6 19.Bxf6 Qxf6 (D)
After 23...Bg5 With the trade of light-square bishops and the elimination of the f6-knight, the last remaining defenders of d5 have been removed. Black can no longer prevent White from occupying this outpost. Note the similarity in strategy with Smyslov-Rudakovsky (Lesson 1).
20.Nd5
The knight occupies its new home.
20...Qh4 21.Qe2 Bf8 22.Qf1!
If White attempts to chase Black's queen away immediately with 22.g3, the queen will occupy h3, after which the only practical way to dislodge it would be to trade queens.
22...Rac8 23.g3 Qg5 (D)
The mobility of Black's queen is clearly restricted by the reach of White's centralized knight. Black should have retreated the queen to h6 immediately as 23...Qg5 loses a tempo.

This only aids White's attack.

The centralized knight exerts control on both sides of the board. In Smyslov-Rudakovsky (Lesson 1), this knight helped launch a kingside attack. In this game, White prepares a breakthrough on the queenside.

This weakens the a2-g8 diagonal.
22.a4
Black's queenside pawns are weak. Whether Black chooses to defend b5 or to trade pawns on a4, his queenside pawns will fall.

Black decides to protect his b5-pawn, but in so doing, he leaves the rook on c6 unprotected, allowing a simple winning tactic.

After 31.g5 (A3) Schlechter - John 1905 White presently occupies a strong outpost on e5 with his knight. Should Black challenge it with 18...Nd7, White will lock the position with 19.c5 and welcome a trade on e5, enabling the rook to replace the knight in the outpost.

Material is even and the pawn structure is balanced. However, White's knight is able to work closely with his center pawns, while Black's knight is somewhat awkwardly placed and cannot maneuver as well.

(A5) Tarrasch - Vogel 1910 Black is hoping to double rooks on the d-file, but White temporarily shuts down the file with a simple pawn advance, and simultaneously creates more maneuvering room for his knight.
21.c5 Kg8
Doubling rooks immediately does not work in view of Nxf7+, winning material.
22.Nc4
White picks the perfect time to switch targets. Black has great difficulty keeping his e5-pawn protected.
22...Rfd8 23.Rxd7 Rxd7 24.f3 Nh6 25.Nxe5
White has correctly calculated that he has the time to capture this pawn and bring his knight back in defense. Meanwhile, Black's knight languishes on the edge of the board.
25...Rd2 26.Nc4 Rc2 27.b3 Rxa2 (D)
Black regains his pawn, but at a considerable price. Not only does he lose control of the d- file, but he is not even able to attack either of White's unprotected queenside pawns with his rook.

he games in this section build upon the ideas of the previous section, with special emphasis on the importance of pawn structure and the role it plays in supporting the attack. They illustrate how exploiting weak squares, whether on one or both colors, allows a player to infiltrate the opponent's position and develop a successful attack.

LESSON 3
[diagram]
HIS MAJESTY ON THE MARCH
common misconception is that advancing a pawn to attack your opponent's piece is always desirable. On the contrary, such an advance may create weak squares in your own position. Every time a pawn advances, it loses control of one or more squares. Once this happens, there is no backing up to try and regain control. In this game, future world champion Alexander Alekhine is playing against Fred Yates, who had already won the British Championship four times and would go on to post two wins against Alekhine. But not this time. Alekhine cleverly exploits the weak squares created by his opponent and uses them to secure a clear path into enemy territory. This game was played in the strong London 1922 tournament, won by Capablanca. Alekhine finished second. A. Alekhine - F.D. Yates London 1922
1.d4 Nf6
A flexible move which retains many options for transposing into different openings.
2.c4 e6
Question:What happens if Black instead tries to play d5 right away? (D) After 4...±e7 After 6... c6 (variation) Answer: White will capture the pawn. Question: Yes, and what happens after Black takes back with Nxd5 ? Answer: e4 attacks the knight and sets up a strong center. Exactly. If Black does not prepare ...d5 with ...e6, he will lose control of the center.
3.Nf3 d5
Black offers to transpose into a Queen's Gambit Declined. Instead, he could try the Queen's Indian Defense with 3...b6. He could also try the Bogo-Indian Defense with 3...Bb4+, a line named after Efim Bogoljubow, an elite player in the first part of the twentieth century.
4.Nc3 Be7 (D)
The transposition into the main variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined is now complete.
5.Bg5 O-O 6.e3
This is the only logical move. White needs to activate his light-square bishop. Now Black has an important decision: should he move his knight to c6 or to d7? Let's look at 6...Nc6 first. (D) Question: If he moves to c6, itblocks the c-pawn. Why is it important for Black to be able to move the c-pawn? What is the word I am looking for? Answer: Space. Yes! Space is extremely important. Do you see how cramped Black's position is when the knight is on c6? After 6*.. bd7
[diagram]
Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined) Question: How many such squares does Black have behind the pawn line to develop his pieces? I want you to identify the squares. You should count the square even if it is already occupied by one of your pieces. Do not count the back rank. Answer: Three - d6, d7, and e7. Yes. Three squares are not enough to place all the minor pieces. Question: Now imagine that Black's c7-pawn is on c5. How many squares would he have? Answer: Five - c6, c7, d6, d7, and e7. Precisely. With a single pawn move, you would almost double your space.
6...Nbd7 (D)
Black chooses the right move. The c-pawn is free to advance as needed. Question: Of course, the bishop on c8 is now blocked. How can you fix this? Answer: Play ...b6 and fianchetto the bishop. Yes, this will also help Black support ...c5. In general, I would say that in queen pawn openings where Black has a central pawn chain (f7/e6/d5), do not place a knight on c6 until the c7-pawn has advanced.
7.Rc1
It is not hard to understand this move - White is positioning his rook for a possible opening of the c-file.
7...c6 (D)
Black decides to advance his c-pawn one square, opting for a solid pawn center. This is the most popular response to Rc1, but there is a drawback. Question: What is the issue with ...c6 ? Answer: It blocks in the bishop. Yes. It is further burying the light-square bishop. If the bishop was bad to begin with, can you see how much worse it is now? Black understands this but feels it is more important to limit White's potential rook activity along the c-file. As already mentioned, Black could fianchetto the bishop instead: 7... b6 8.Bd3 Bb7 9.O-O c5.
(D)
This position offers equal chances. The bishop is definitely more active.
8.Qc2
White doubles up on the c-file.
8...Re8
While there is a possibility that the e-file will open, the real purpose of this move is to free the f8 square. Question: How does Black intend to use this square? Answer: Move the bishop there. After 9,jNd3
[diagram]
Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined) That is possible. Perhaps Black is expecting White to play cxd5, after which he would recapture with the e-pawn and open the file. Question: How else can Black use the f8 square? Answer: He could put the knight there instead. Good.
9.Bd3 (D)
Look at the two batteries White has lined up: Qc2/Bd3 and Rc1/Qc2. See how the queen is coordinating well with the bishop and rook? White is exerting a lot of pressure along both the b1-h7 diagonal and the c-file. White is now ready to castle and his pieces are well coordinated. Black must decide how he is going to complete his development. With pawns on e6 and c6, it does not make sense to fianchetto the c8-bishop.
9...dxc4
Black chooses to trade pawns on c4 to free d5 for his knight. He waits for White's bishop to move to d3 before making this capture, in order to gain a tempo by forcing the bishop to move a second time. However, this comes at a price - Black has to trade his most advanced pawn.
10.Bxc4 Nd5 (D)
After ll...Ra5+ (variation) This sets up a trade of pieces. When in a cramped position, try to trade off pieces to ease the congestion. Question: What should White play in this position and why? Answer: Pawn to e4. It chases the knight out of the center. No. This does not work. Exercise 3-1: If White plays e4, how does Black win material? Question: What else might White play here? Answer: Knight takes knight. No. This trades off two sets of pieces after 11.Nxd5 exd5 12.Bxe7 Qxe7. Although the position is equal, this move actually helps Black achieve his goal of trading pieces, and allows him to re-establish a strong center pawn on d5. Try again. Answer: Knight to e4. Yes, this is what Alekhine plays.
11.Ne4
In Alekhine's own analysis he claims that the more accurate move is 11.Bxe7, as played in Game 11 of the world championship between Capablanca and Emanuel Lasker just a year earlier (Havana, 1921).
11.Ne4 is a new move introduced in this game. Alekhine is taking a calculated risk because
he must have been aware that the clever intermediate move 11...Qa5+ would tilt the balance in Black's favor. (D) This move forces White to move his king to f1. Although he does have several ways to block the check, all variations favor Black. The worst option is to block with Nc3. Exercise 3-2: After 11...Qa5+ 12.Nc3, how does Black win material? Yates did not find the queen check in this game. However, he did learn from his mistake, as when he found himself in this identical position four years later in a game against Grünfeld (Merano 1926), he played 11...Qa5+ and won the game. After 13...b5?
[diagram]
Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined)
11...f5? (D)
Surprised by Alekhine's novelty, Yates goes astray and makes a serious strategic error. Black appears to win a piece by chasing away one of the defenders of the g5-bishop, but this is an illusion. White simply plays the intermediate move 12.Bxe7 and saves his piece.
12.Bxe7 Qxe7 13.Ned2
Far from winning a piece, the move 11...f5 turned e5 into a powerful outpost for White. Question: How does the trade of dark-square bishops affect Black's position? Answer: Black has traded off his good bishop. All his center pawns are fixed on light squares, and the dark squares are now weak. Now it becomes clear why ...f5 is an error. Before advancing a pawn, consider its long- term consequences. Does it justify losing control of critical squares?
13...b5? (D)
Amazingly, Black repeats the same error on the queenside. Once again, he advances a pawn to chase away an enemy piece. Question: What weaknesses are created by this move? Answer: The c6-pawn becomes weak. Yes. Notice how the base of Black's pawn chain has shifted from b7 to c6. This is now a backward pawn on the half-open c-file. Avoid giving yourself a backward pawn on a file that After 15,..a5 abode! gh your opponent controls. Question: Is this the only long-term weakness? Answer: No. The c5 square is another potential outpost for White. Question: How can White take advantage of this? Give me a winning plan. Answer: White can play bishop takes knight. Black must take back with the c-pawn or lose it. Good start. That is one useful trade. Keep going. Answer: Trade the d7-knight, so the f3-knight can occupy e5. Question: How does White do that? Answer: Move the d2-knight to b3, then c5, and trade it for Black's d7-knight. That is totally the right plan. Trading knights enables you to get your f3-knight into e5. It will be a monster!
14.Bxd5 cxd5 15.O-O
White completes his development.
15...a5 (D)
Black hopes to get in ...a5-a4 to prevent White's knight from going to b3.
16.Nb3
White makes it in time.
16...a4 17.Nc5
As you can see, once you formulate agood plan, the moves come easily.
17...Nxc5 (D)
Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined) Black is hoping that trading more pieces will make it easier to hold on for a draw. This is not the case in this position, because simplification increases White's control. Even though avoiding the trade with 17...Nb6 does not solve Black's problems, itwould keep the position closed a little longer. Simplification does not guarantee equality. Question: How does White recapture on c5? Answer: With the queen. Yes. Stick with the plan. You are not trying to create a passed pawn here. You want to maintain control of the file, along with the dark squares and the e5 outpost. After the queen trade, White will double rooks on the c-file. An open file is a highway into enemy territory. When there is only one open file on the board, the player who controls it is in command of the game.
18.Qxc5 Qxc5 19.Rxc5
With fewer pieces on the board, the weakness of the bad bishop becomes even more obvious.
19...b4 20.Rfc1 Ba6 21.Ne5 (D)
White's knight has reached its central outpost and is a dominant force. Despite the open f1- a6 diagonal, Black's bishop has no constructive moves. Exercise 3-3: Should Black play ...Rec8 and attempt to trade rooks? Write down your analysis. After 23.a3 After 25.h4
[diagram]
21...Reb8 22.f3
White initiates the final plan. He will use the weak dark squares to march his king into the center unopposed, adding an extra attacker.
22...b3 23.a3 (D)
White avoids the trade and locks up the queenside pawns. The player who controls the only open file must not allow the opponent to create an open file of his own. Exercise 3-4: Should Black play 23...Rc8 and try to trade rooks now? Write down your analysis.
23...h6 24.Kf2 Kh7 25.h4 (D)
Having locked down the queenside, White turns his attention to the kingside.
25...Rf8
As trading rooks is not an option, Black is reduced to making waiting moves.
26.Kg3
Exercise 3-5: White sticks to his plan, though he could have won material after 25...Rf8. How?
26...Rfb8 27.Rc7
After 30...Ng8
[diagram]
Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined) After you establish control of a file, find the point of invasion. The most effective point will be on the seventh or eighth rank.
27...Bb5 28.R1c5
This puts pressure on the bishop.
28...Ba6 (D)
The bishop retreats. Black cannot let his rook be tied down to its defense; he will need this rook to defend the e6-pawn when it is eventually attacked.
29.R5c6
White attacks the e6-pawn.
29...Re8 30.Kf4
White's king continues its journey.
30...Kg8 (D)
Black moves his king because he is in virtual Zugzwang. One of his rooks is tied down protecting his bishop, while the other must look after the e6-pawn. Any pawn move will result in the loss of material. The only piece that can move with impunity is the bishop, but it does not have an effective move. Question: White now makes a move that further paralyzes Black. What is it? Answer: Nd7. After 34".Eg8 This move will be played, but not yet. Answer: h5. Yes. This further restricts Black's pawn moves and creates another outpost on g6 for the knight.
31.h5 Bf1 32.g3 Ba6 (D)
Question: How does White pursue the attack? Answer: He can double rooks on the seventh rank. That is correct.
33.Rf7 Kh7
Black anticipates White doubling his rooks on the seventh rank, and moves his king to be able to protect the g7-pawn.
34.Rcc7 Rg8 (D)
Black appears to be holding on, as everything is presently defended. White needs a new threat. Question: Can you find the next move? Answer: Nd7, heading for f6. Yes. After 36...ggffi Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined)
35.Nd7 Kh8
Black moves out of the pin along the seventh rank to stop White from playing Nf6+. Question: How should White proceed? Answer: Move the knight to f6 anyway. If Black takes the knight, he will be mated on h7. Very good.
36.Nf6 Rgf8 (D)
Black pins White's rook to the f6-knight, hoping to prevent Rxg7.
37.Rxg7
White sees the mating attack and continues regardless.
37...Rxf6
The only move that stops an immediate checkmate.
38.Ke5
The king delivers the final blow. It certainly helps to have the extra attacker. Black's f6-rook is now lost because if either black rook goes to f8, White delivers mate in two with 39.Rh7+ and
40.Rcg7#. Accordingly, Black resigns. 1-0

Exercise 3-1: If White plays 11.e4, how does Black win material? (D) Answer: Black plays 11...Bxg5 12.Nxg5 (if 12.exd5, then 12...Bxc1 13.Qxc1 exd5+ 14.Be2 Nf6 wins the exchange and a pawn) 12...Qxg5 13.exd5. (D)

Black is ahead three pawns and stands to win more. Exercise 3-2: After 11...Qa5+ (D) 12.Nc3, how does Black win material? After 24,£jc6 (21...Sec8 variation) Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined) Answer: If White answers 11...Qa5+ with 12.Nc3? (12.Kf1 is best), then 12...Nxc3 uncovers an attack on the g5-bishop. White cannot play 13.Qxc3 because of 13...Bb4. If instead White tries 13.Bxe7, then Black wins two pawns with the intermediate move
13...Nxa2+. (D)
14.b4 Nxb4 15.Bxb4 Qxb4+.
Intermediate moves are strong tactical resources. You can spot them if you remember that recaptures are not automatic. Note: After 12.Nc3, Black could also have played 12...Nb4, with the follow-up 13.Qa4 Qxa4 14.Nxa4 b5 winning a piece for a pawn. Exercise 3-3: Should Black play 21...Rec8 and attempt to trade rooks? Write down your analysis. Answer: No. If 21...Rec8, then 22.Rxc8+ Rxc8 23.Rxc8+ Bxc8 24.Nc6 (D) wins material as the knight threatens the b4-pawn as well as a knight fork on e7. Exercise 3-4: Should Black play 23...Rc8 and try to trade rooks now? Write down your analysis.

Answer: White continues the king march with 26.Kg3, refusing to be distracted by the mere win of a pawn with 26.Nd7 Rf7 27.Nb6, forking rook and pawn. Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined)

Simplification does not guarantee equality. An open file is a highway into enemy territory. When there is only one open file on the board, the player who controls it is in command of the game. The player who controls the only open file must not allow the opponent to create an open file of his own. After you establish control of a file, find the point of invasion.

LESSON 4

A REAL TOGETHER FEELING
awns have many functions, one of which is to provide shelter for one's pieces, particularly the king. A pawn structure that leaves your king unprotected on a set of adjoining squares of the same color, referred to as a weak color complex, can be fatal. To illustrate the danger, I will show you a game I once played in the U.S. Open. This is an unusual game to teach because there are no forcing moves, but it offers an excellent example of exploiting the opponent's errors. Chess players need to be alert as opportunities present themselves.
M. LAMON - S. WEERAMANTRY
Jacksonville (Florida) 1990
1.e4 d6 2.d4 g6 (D)
The Modern Defense, also known as the King's Fianchetto Defense: this belongs to the family of openings known as hypermodern systems, which feature delaying center-pawn moves in favor of developing bishops on the flank (the fianchetto) in order to attack the center from a distance. Notice that the e7- and d6-pawns, by reinforcing dark squares, complement the bishop's control of the a1-h8 long diagonal. As the game progresses, Black will increase this influence by putting a pawn on c5.
3.Nc3 Bg7 4.Be2 (D)
After 4.Ne2 After 5...b5 Lamon - Weeramantry 1990 (Modern Defense) This is a good move, a flexible move. It is wise not to telegraph your intentions to your opponent. With this move order, White can direct his play in a number of ways: he can bring his knight to f3 (the Classical System), set up a broad pawn center with f2-f4 (the Pseudo-Austrian Attack), or start a flank attack with h2-h4-h5 or even g2-g4 (the Bayonet Attack).
4...c6
Black delays the development of his king's knight in favor of queenside play. This is a hallmark of the Modern Defense.
5.Nf3 b5 (D)
Black goes for immediate queenside expansion to counter White's space advantage in the center. Prior to this move, White's pieces occupied four ranks while Black's only occupied three.
6.a3 a6
Five pawn moves in the first six moves of the game! Should Black not develop some pieces instead? Well, in this opening, you stake out your territory first, then bring your pieces out later. The point of ...a7-a6 is to strengthen the pawn structure in order to prepare the subsequent advance of the c-pawn. The move ...c6-c5 will challenge more central dark squares and increase the influence of Black's dark-square bishop. Naturally, an immediate ...c6-c5 fails because the pawn on b5 would be left unprotected.
7.O-O Nd7 8.h3 Qc7
Black's last two moves provide further support for ...c6-c5.
9.Be3 Ngf6 10.Qd2 O-O (D)
White has moved all of his pieces off the back rank except for his king and two rooks. Development is not complete until the rooks are connected. Question: What must Black do to complete his development? Answer: Move out his light-square bishop. Question: Where should the bishop go? Answer: Put it on b7 to control the other long diagonal. Yes. This fits in with the hypermodern strategy.
11.Rfd1 Bb7 (D)
Each player has now completed his development. This is where chess becomes difficult. Black's bishops are both fianchettoed, and they are on the outside attacking in. White's bishops are in the center, on the inside attacking out. There is no contact between the two armies at the moment, and every piece is still on the board. Question: Whose bishops are stronger? Answer: Black's. They are attacking the whole center area. Excellent.
12.Ne1
Lamon - Weeramantry 1990 (Modern Defense) White moves his knight out of the way, hoping to expand on the kingside with f2-f4.
12...c5 (D)
Black makes pawn contact first. When all the pieces are still on the board, look for a pawn trade to open lines. Comment: Why did you break with ...c5 ? Why not with ...e5 ?
12...e5 helps White. He can capture on e5 forcing Black to recapture with his d6-pawn. This
will bury the g7-bishop, and surrender control of the d-file to White's heavy artillery. 12...c5, on the other hand, allows Black to recapture with the knight, keeping the long diagonal open for the dark-square bishop and retaining a better pawn structure. Question: After 12...c5, is Black threatening anything? Answer: The e4-pawn is threatened. Yes, a very serious threat. White can stop this attack by playing d5, but the presence of pawns on c5 and b5 creates dynamic attacking chances for Black on the queenside. Nevertheless, d5 was certainly better than what was played.
13.f3? (D)
Question: White protects e4 with his f-pawn. What is wrong with this strategy? Answer: It prevents the knight from coming back to f3. He wanted to play f4, then bring the knight back. Now he can't do that. After 13...c4 (variation) Good point. He appears to have given up on the f4 idea. But f3 is bad because it restricts the mobility of both the knight and the bishop. Question: There is another serious weakness with f3. What is it? Answer: The dark squares are weak. Very good. Some people look at a chessboard and see 64 squares, while others look at a chessboard and see 32 dark squares and 32 light squares. If you are strong enough to look at a position like this and say, "Aha, f3 is bad because it weakens the dark squares around the king," then you understand the position clearly. All the kingside pawns are on light squares, so Black will try to attack the weak color complex. Question: Black could now play 13...c4 (D) and keep White's knight out of d3. Is that a good idea? Answer: Yes. It stops the knight from moving in, and also shuts out the bishop on e2. The knight on c3 cannot move either. If it goes to d5, White will lose a pawn. Well, it does take several moves away from White. Question: Now give me a reason why Black would not play ...c4 ? Answer: It weakens the dark squares on the queenside. True. I guess you'll never forget color weaknesses again! I must, however, point out that a weak color complex presents greater danger when it is in the vicinity of the king. Answer: You are giving up some control in the center. That's the right idea! ...c4 is a bad move because Black can no longer force open the center. The reason you need to open the center is to activate the bishops. As we discussed, Black's bishops are stronger because they have potential targets. Advancing ...c4 closes the position, taking away these targets. What should happen is the center must be destroyed. Trade the pawns off and free the bishops. The position then has much more potential than it would have with ...c4. You really cannot let the two white pawns on d4 and e4 continue to sit there. If you do, then the entire hypermodern strategy of playing against the center with fianchettoed bishops is ruined. Not trading pawns now would be a serious strategic error.
13...cxd4 14.Bxd4 (D)
Lamon - Weeramantry 1990 (Modern Defense) Question: The opening that started off as a Modern has changed character. What does it now resemble? It is an opening that most players are familiar with. Answer: The Sicilian Dragon. This happens quite often. You take an opening system, play it in a certain move order and transpose into an entirely different system. The c5- and d4-pawns have been traded, and now we have a Sicilian Dragon. Normally, these pawns are traded on the third move. This time it is happening ten moves later. Question: If you compare this to a normal Sicilian Dragon, Black's pawn structure is the same, but some of his pieces are on different squares. Which ones? Answer: The knight on d7 and the bishop on b7. Question: What advantage does Black enjoy that he would not normally have? Answer: Black has more space on the queenside. Yes. This is something that Black prays for in the Dragon! Answer: And his light-square bishop is very active. Very good. Question: What is wrong with White's position? Answer: White looks cramped. The light-square bishop and the knight on e1 are both useless. Question: Where is that knight normally placed? Answer: On d4. Yes, that knight is normally on d4! Question: In that case, where should the dark-square bishop be? Answer: On e3. Correct. This bishop should be behind the knight so that it is less vulnerable to attack. Question: If the bishop on d4 is traded, what are the consequences for White? Answer: He will have trouble protecting his dark squares. After 15.b3
[diagram]
Yes. White will get killed on the dark squares! This sets the course for the rest of the game. Black will go after this bishop, trade it off, and infiltrate on the dark squares.
14...Nb6
Clearly, no good player would trade this bishop for a knight. Black is planning to play ...Nc4 and annoy White's queen. White decides not to let this happen.
15.b3? (D)
When my opponent made this move, I nearly fell out of my chair! This is such a short- sighted move. White is only thinking one move ahead. This does stop ...Nc4, but the long-term consequences are considerable. Question: This move creates weaknesses that will not go away. What are they? Answer: The bishop on g7 is much stronger now. True. That bishop would be a monster if White did not have his own bishop on d4, as it would bear down on the diagonal unopposed and exploit the pinned knight on c3. Answer: You can set up a queen-rook battery along the c-file, and get more pressure on c3. Excellent. The c3 square is where the c-file intersects with the long diagonal. It is therefore a critical square. Removing its protection by advancing the b-pawn weakens both the file and the diagonal. The knight coming into c4 would have been annoying, but weakening c3 is much worse. This kind of mistake is common. Do not sacrifice long-term interests for short-term gain. Black is winning, but there is still some work to do.
15...Rac8 16.Rac1 e5 (D)
After 18,&hl
[diagram]
Lamon - Weeramantry 1990 (Modern Defense)
17.Bxb6?
This is the trade I was hoping for, but he need not have made it. Exercise 4-1: How could White avoid the trade 17.Bxb6 and not lose a piece?
17...Qxb6+ 18.Kh1 (D)
Now we come to the final phase of the game. Look at White's pieces - they are all huddled together. Contrast that with the mobility of Black's pieces. Rather than interfering with each other's movements, their freedom enhances their power. There's an interesting exercise to help you determine who controls more space. Count the number of squares your pieces are attacking in your opponent's half of the board, and compare it to the number of squares he is attacking in your half. We can count a square as many times as it is being attacked. A possible capture also counts as a square. Let's try it. Exercise 4-2: Using the position after 18.Kh1, determine who controls more space. Doing this exercise gives you a sense of mobility. The more squares you can access in your opponent's territory, the more attacking chances you will enjoy. Now, how does Black proceed? How does he penetrate White's position? I will tell you what a lot of players would do here. They would play ...Qf2, believing that the queen is accomplishing After a b c a e f g h something by penetrating into the heart of White's position. But, what is the queen threatening from f2 that it is not already doing from b6? Nothing. The best time to bring in the power pieces is when there are targets to attack. Question: So, what moves can Black play to realize his attacking potential? Answer: ...Nh5. Yes, avery good idea. The knight can then come in on f4 or g3. Notice how the queen and knight own these dark squares since White no longer has a dark-square bishop. Question: Black could use more firepower. Which other pieces could he activate? Answer: The rooks. Move one to c7 and double them up. This is a good idea, but the rooks are too far away from the action. Answer: The bishop on g7. That's the idea! This is crucial. You must understand the importance of getting Black's dark- square bishop into the game, even if that appears difficult to do right now. Think in terms of what you want to accomplish in a position. First focus on your overall strategy, then on specific moves.
18...Nh5 19.Kh2
White is worried about the knight's jumping into g3.
19...Nf4 (D)
Question: What is the value of bringing this knight into f4? Answer: To play ...Qf2, attacking g2. It is still too soon to bring the queen in. Besides, g2 is already protected. Answer: To attack the bishop on e2. I did not move the knight here to capture his bishop. Sometimes you may have friends in the enemy camp. At the moment, the bishop on e2 is my greatest friend - it gets in White's way. Right now, you could not pay me to take that bishop! Do not trade active pieces for inactive pieces. Question: What did we say Black is trying to do? Lamon - Weeramantry 1990 (Modern Defense) Answer: Get the bishop on g7 into the game. Question: Now make the connection: why ...Nf4 ? Answer: To bring the bishop to h6. Of course! We are setting up a screen so the bishop can move safely to h6. Look at which of White's pieces are on the c1-h6 diagonal. They make great targets.
20.Bf1 Bh6 21.Nd5 (D)
Question: White's last move simply delays the inevitable. How does Black reply? Answer: Bishop takes knight. Question: Excellent!...Bxd5 is absolutely the best move in the position. Why? Answer: It removes the centralized knight. Black's light-square bishop isn't doing much. Right! This bishop is not participating in the attack, so use him to remove the troublesome knight. We just said, "Do not trade active pieces for inactive pieces." The flip side is that you want to trade inactive pieces for active ones.
21...Bxd5 22.exd5 (D)
Everything appears in place for the attack, but there is one final preparation to be made. Question: What is the final piece to this puzzle? Answer: The bishop on h6 must be protected so the knight can set up a discovered attack. Question: So, what should Black play? Answer: ...Kg7. Now you are talking chess! Look how easy it is. Black wants to move his knight, so what does he do? He plays this quiet little king move which turns out to be the best attacking move in the entire game. Even the king has joined in the attack!
22...Kg7! 23.Rb1 (D)
White moves one of his major pieces off the c1-h6 diagonal, but it is too late. Question: Now we are ready for the final assault. What is the best move? Answer: ...Nxh3, with a discovered attack on White's queen. Correct.
23...Nxh3 24.Qd3 Qg1+
Black is not afraid to sacrifice the knight.
25.Kxh3 Bf4 (D)
This creates a mating net. If the opponent has an escape route, do not keep checking. Seal off the escape route first. Unable to avoid mate, White resigns. 0-1 Lamon - Weeramantry 1990 (Modern Defense) Just a glance at the final diagram should make it clear that Black's control of the dark squares around White's king was the critical factor in the game. After 18.Qhl

ANSWERS
Exercise 4-1: How could White avoid the trade 17.Bxb6 and not lose a piece? Answer: After 16...e5 (D), Black threatens the bishop on d4, which protects the knight on c3. In the game, White played
17.Bxb6 to avoid losing a piece. He could have done so without making this trade.
White just retreats the bishop to e3. After 17.Be3 Qxc3 18.Qxc3 Rxc3, the b6-knight is no longer protected, so White restores material equality with 19.Bxb6, retaining the protector of the dark squares. Exercise 4-2: Using the position after 18.Kh1 (D), determine who controls more space. Answer: For each side, we count the squares attacked in the opponent's half of the board. We count d4 twice, as it is attacked twice. So we have thirteen attacks by Black, and nine by White. That's a big difference. Black's attacking chances are better.

LESSON 5
[diagram]
ONE TO REMEMBER
am going to show a game I played during an event held in England back in 1972. This is another illustration of how to exploit aweak color complex. In the game featured in our previous lesson, Iwas able to take advantage of a weakness my opponent created. This time I had to induce the weakness. To do this, I sacrificed a rook to decoy the dark-square bishop, which is the natural protector of the weakened squares. Then I built an attack which delivered victory.
R. HARRIS - S. WEERAMANTRY
London, 1972
1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6
This introduces the Pirc Defense, popularized by the Yugoslav grandmaster Vasja Pirc. The essential difference between the Modern Defense and the Pirc is that in the former, Black fianchettoes his king's bishop before developing the knight.
4.f4 (D)
White chooses the Austrian Attack, an aggressive response to the Pirc. He is following classical principles of development by setting up a broad pawn center, while Black uses the hypermodern concept of challenging the center from afar. Harris - Weeramantry 1972 (Pirc Austrian Attack) I happen to like playing against the broad center. King's Fianchetto players get energized when they see a wall of pawns that they can target. True, the center is very strong, but so is the fianchetto. This is like two gladiators of old fighting with different weapons - one with a sword and shield, the other with a net and trident.
4...Bg7 5.Nf3 O-O (D)
There is an important alternative here. Black can hit back at the center immediately with
5...c5. This move was made popular after it was employed by Bobby Fischer in his celebrated
1972 World Championship match against Boris Spassky. It led to a hard-fought draw.
Question: After ...O-O, White has a choice of how to proceed. What moves can he play? Answer: f5. Notice that f5 would lose a pawn. Some people may argue that it is worth a pawn to break up Black's fianchetto structure. I disagree. Black can take the pawn safely with 6...gxf5 7.exf5 Bxf5 and retreat the bishop, ifnecessary, to g6 to strengthen the castled position. If White wants to play f5, the proper way to do it is to play Bd3 first to give f5 more support. Answer: e5. (D) Now, there is an interesting move. In fact, I have played this position from both sides. Black can trade pawns immediately with 6...dxe5, but this leads to a space advantage for White after 7.dxe5 Qxd1+ 8.Kxd1. The balanced pawn structure makes it difficult for Black to After 7,h4 (6.e5 variation)
[diagram]
After 5...O-O counter White's control of the center. The fact that White's king has moved does not present any danger, as queens have been traded and Black is not fully developed. The other option is for Black to accept the challenge with 6...Nfd7 7.h4. (D) Question: What is the best way to answer an attack on the flank? Answer: With a counterattack in the center. Right! The most effective way to handle a flank attack is to strike back in the center. Do you understand why? The attacker must have unimpeded movement of his pieces from one sector of the board to the other in order to reinforce the attack. If the enemy breaks through the middle, he will break the coordination of the attacking pieces. Question: Now that you understand the idea, what should Black play? Answer: ...c5. Yes. This is a very clever move. You are attacking the base of White's pawn chain and placing pawns in contact at two different points. If White takes the c5-pawn, Black takes the e5-pawn. If White takes the d6-pawn, Black takes the d4-pawn. If White does not take either, then Black takes both! First take the d4-pawn, then the e5-pawn. If both of White's pawns disappear, so does his center. To break a pawn chain, undermine the base and simultaneously put pressure at other points along the chain. Back to the game after 5...O-O: (D) After 7...Ka5 (6.±e2 variation) After 6,Jld3 Harris - Weeramantry 1972 (Pirc Austrian Attack) Question: So far, we have examined pawn advances. What else should we consider? Answer: Be2. Yes, it is time to consider some piece moves. Black now strikes at the center with 6...c5. White's best response is 7.dxc5. In this position, Black should not recapture, as moving his d6- pawn will allow White to expand in the center. Question: If Black will not recapture with 7...dxc5, how can he justify giving up a pawn? Answer: 7...Qa5 (D) pins the knight on c3 and threatens the center pawn. Excellent. 7...Qa5 is a very powerful move. Once White protects e4, Black has time to capture on c5 with the queen and maintain his d6-pawn. Most inexperienced players will respond by capturing the entire black pawn chain, continuing with 8.cxd6 Nxe4 9.dxe7 Re8. This, however, works out very well for Black. White's king is still in the center, the attack on the pinned knight on c3 is very strong, and once Black opens up the center, the influence of the fianchettoed bishop increases. Best for White after
7...Qa5 is8.O-O Qxc5+ 9.Kh1.
There is one other bishop move White might try. Answer: Bd3. By process of elimination, we have arrived at the move that was played in this game.
6.Bd3 (D)
After 7.O-O
[diagram]
Question: We have seen how 6...c5 is a good idea in response to 6.Be2. Does the same idea work against 6.Bd3 ? Answer: No, because the e4-pawn is now protected for a second time. Bravo! Once you start making these connections, you are on your way to becoming a better player. You must be able to determine if an idea is still applicable when the position has changed. Learn to appreciate subtle differences. Question: How does Black continue his development after Bd3 ? Answer: Black can play ...c6 followed by ...b5. There is a drawback to this plan. Queenside expansion is too slow. It allows White uncontested play in the center. I played...
6...Nc6
There have been more recent developments in this line, in particular 6...Na6. You may wish to examine them yourself. The point behind 6... Nc6 is to put pressure on the central dark squares, and to prepare a pawn break on e5.
7.O-O (D)
Question: What should Black play next? Answer: ...e5. Good idea. This is consistent with the idea of striking in the center.
7...Bg4
Black pursues the same idea in a different way. Pinning the knight threatens the pawn on d4.
8.Be3
White protects d4 and completes his development at the same time. Another good option is
8.e5, which appears to give White a slight edge.
Question: Now, what must Black do, before it is too late? Answer: Push the e-pawn. Push the pawn and hit the center before White plays to e5 himself! Notice how Black's last two moves (6...Nc6 and 7...Bg4) each support ...e7-e5. The knight move adds a defender, and After 8"*e5 After 10,,.£jxe5 (10,fxe5 variation) Harris - Weeramantry 1972 (Pirc Austrian Attack) the bishop move subtracts an attacker. You can already see that the battle will be over who controls the dark squares.
8...e5 (D)
A good way to break up a three-pawn center is to push the pawn that is on the same file as the middle pawn in your opponent's formation. In this way, you are attacking each of his outside pawns, setting up two trading options to break his structure. Should the opponent initiate the trade, he should capture from one side and then advance the pawn on the other side. He should not capture twice so as to ensure he is not left with an isolated pawn. Look at what happens to his center if he captures twice after 9.dxe5 dxe5: 10.fxe5 Nxe5: (D) His once-proud center is reduced to rubble. Furthermore, Black's knight on e5 is very strong because it occupies the square in front of the isolated pawn.
9.dxe5 dxe5 10.h3
White took once, but did not push the other pawn. Instead, he attacked the bishop.
10...Bxf3 (D)
After 10...±xf3 After 12, c5
[diagram]
This is not the most accurate move order. Black should have played 10...exf4 isolating White's e4-pawn. The best play would then be 11.Bxf4 Be6, with play for both sides. Note that if White first played 11.Bc5, we would transpose back into this game with 11...Bxf3 12.Qxf3 Nh5.
11.Qxf3 exf4 12.Bc5 (D)
White hopes to chase Black's rook out of f8 in order to create pressure along the f-file and particularly on f7.
12...Nh5
Surprise! Realizing that the dark squares around White's king are weak, Black protects his f4- pawn and offers to give up the exchange in order to eliminate White's key defender of those dark squares.
13.Bxf8 (D)
Harris - Weeramantry 1972 (Pirc Austrian Attack) This identical position was reached by transposition in the 1988 correspondence game N. Carlsson-M. Carlsson. In that game, Black recaptured on f8 immediately. Ichose to delay the recapture in favor of two intermediate moves that bring two black pieces into attacking position. Question: What is the first of these intermediate moves? Answer: ...Bd4+. Correct. This brings Black's bishop to a critical diagonal.
13...Bd4+ 14.Kh2 (D)
White moves his king to h2, as 14.Kh1 would allow Black's knight into g3 with check. Question: Black still does not have all of his pieces in the best attacking positions. More preparation is required. What is the next intermediate move? Answer: ...Qh4. ...Qh4 could be an important part of the attack, but, ifplayed immediately, White would try to force a trade of queens with Qg4. As a general principle, when you are defending, trade queens; when attacking, keep them on. Answer: ...Ne5. Yes. The c6-knight now joins the attack.
14...Ne5 (D)
After 16dLe7! (variation) Look at what has happened - in just a few moves, Black's pieces have taken total control of the dark squares. We could make a movie out of this - Invasion of the Dark Squares. Notice where White's dark-square bishop is while all this is going on - conveniently out of the picture. White's queen must move. If it goes to e2, Black plays ...Ng3, and the other knight comes dancing in with tempo!
15.Qd1
Black is down a rook at present. Does he have enough compensation? I spent a good half- hour trying to decide whether to take the bishop or keep on attacking. Ifelt that the attack had enough momentum and did not want to waste a tempo recapturing the bishop.
15...Qh4
Computer analysis suggests that 15...Kxf8 is stronger. Now White gets greedy and tries to hang on to all his material. Instead, he could have played the remarkably annoying 16.Be7! (D), which was pointed out in annotations to the correspondence game referred to earlier. White attempts to draw Black's queen away from its attacking position. After 16...Qxe7, White will gain time to reorganize his defense with 17.Be2. Though Black still has the advantage, the crisis is forestalled. When ahead in material, do not hesitate to give back all or part of it as needed. In the game, White did not find 16.Be7, but instead played After 16.1h6?

Now White has serious problems. See how strong the f4-pawn is? It is controlling g3, a key square. The bishop on d4 is patrolling the g1-h7 diagonal, preventing White's king from moving back there. The two knights are ready to jump into the fray. All this highlights Black's complete control of the dark squares around White's king. Meanwhile, what is White doing? The bishop on d3 isnothing but an overgrown pawn. The rook on f1 has little mobility. The bishop on h6 is still out of the game. White has no influence over the dark squares at all. When all the pawns around the enemy king are on the same color, the opposite color squares become weak. Attack on the weak color. Question: Everything is ready for the final attack. What does Black do? Answer: Play ...f5; then the knight can come to g4 with check. Your idea of protecting g4 to set up ...Ng4+ is good. However, White can simply take that pawn and refute your plan. Show me another way to get in ...Ng4+. Answer: Black can play ...f3. Excellent! This is an interference move. It interferes with the queen's protection of g4 and attempts to destroy the pawn cover in front of White's king.
16...f3! (D)
After 19,Sxg3 Black's leapfrogging knights now threaten ...Ng4+ followed by ...Ng3#. Exercise 5-1: If White plays 17.gxf3, show how Black wins.
17.Rxf3
White is still up a rook, but with Black's pieces swarming around his king, it certainly does not appear that way. Inactive or underdeveloped pieces have a way of blending inconspicuously into the background, while active pieces seem to jump right at you! Question: What should Black play now? Answer: ...Ng4+. Yes, taking the rook would be a mistake. Black's knights are much stronger.
17...Ng4+ 18.Kh1 Ng3+ 19.Rxg3 (D)
White has no choice but to take the knight. Question: What does Black do now? Answer: ...Qxg3. No. That is precisely what White is wishing for; he can then continue with Qxg4. Black has something much better. Answer: ...Nf2+ forking the king and the queen. Harris - Weeramantry 1972 (Pirc Austrian Attack) That's it. Here I was feeling quite satisfied, but White has one final trick left.
19...Nf2+ 20.Kh2 Nxd1 21.Bg5 (D)
Question: White moves his bishop out of danger and gains a tempo by attacking Black's queen. Does the queen have a safe move? Answer: No. h5 is the only square not being attacked, but 22.Be2 would trap the queen. Indeed. White thought he had caught me. It would have been a shame to ruin the game, when I was on the brink of victory, by making a careless move. Question: So, what is the winning move? Answer: ...Bg1+. Excellent. This is an intermediate move that draws the king away from the rook. It is important to not always just respond to an attack, but to look for counterattacks. My opponent's face fell a mile when he saw this!
21...Bg1+ 22.Kxg1 Qxg3 23.Rxd1 Qxg5 (D)
White resigns. 0-1 Less-experienced players should not resign at this stage; there is still some play left. However, we are both strong masters, and evidently my opponent felt that he had no real chances. White's bishop and knight are powerless against the queen. Even if White sets up a fortress, there will come a point when something will have to move and the fortress will crumble. After IZgxfj (variation)

REVIEW
Themes Weak color complexes (introduction). Broad pawn center versus the fianchetto (4.f4). A flank attack versus counterattack in the center (7.h4 variation). Breaking a pawn chain (7.h4 c5 variation). Attacking the central dark squares (8...e5). Intermediate moves to improve piece position (13...Bd4+; 14...Ne5). Giving back material to slow an attack (16.Be7 variation). Interference move (16...f3). Advice The most effective way to destroy a flank attack is with a counterattack in the center. To break a pawn chain, undermine the base and simultaneously put pressure at other points along the chain. You must be able to determine if an idea is still applicable when the position has changed. Learn to appreciate subtle differences. As a general principle, when you are defending, trade queens; when attacking, keep them on. When ahead in material, do not hesitate to give back all or part of it to stave off disaster. When all the pawns around the enemy king are on the same color, the opposite-color squares become weak. Attack on the opposite color. After 22...g6

Instead 22...Nd6 offers counterplay without weakening the kingside. For instance, 23.Bxf5 Nxf5 24.Qxf5 Ra1 creates a dynamically balanced position.
23.Bh6 Nb2 24.Rb1 Nxd3 25.Qxd3
In addition to his dark-square play, White enjoys a strategic advantage by virtue of his two- to-one queenside majority, even if that majority is temporarily restrained. Any future trade of pawns there will give White a passed d-pawn.
25...Rfb8 26.Rxb8+ Rxb8 27.Qg3 Rd8 28.Qe5 Ra8 29.Rc7 Qe6

(B2) Alekhine - Yates 1923 Although there is no longer any danger of a mating attack, Black is extremely vulnerable on the dark squares. With all his pawns fixed on light squares, there is little Black can do to contain White's dark-square bishop.
32.Re7 Kg8 33.f3
There is no need to release Black's king from its prison by capturing the e6-pawn. The move
33.f3 deprives Black's knight of the e4 and g4 squares.
33...Ne8 34.Kh2 Nd6 35.Rg7+ Kh8 36.Rd7 Nb5 37.Kg3

Bh6 Bh8 24.Rd8 Bb7 25.Rad1 Bg7 26.R8d7 Rf8 27.Bxg7 Kxg7 28.R1d4 Rae8 (D) White has total control of the d-file and a firm grip on the kingside dark squares. Black's pieces cannot access the kingside, so White can maneuver his pieces freely.
29.Qf6+ Kg8 30.h4 h5 (D)
With the pawn structure now fixed, White begins the winning maneuver.
31.Kh2!
White's king marches out to help his queen with the mating attack. The king is headed for h6!
31...Rc8
Black can mount a better defense with 31...Bc8. However, White's stranglehold on the kingside enables him to give up a rook for the attack: 32.Ng5 Bxd7 33.g4 and Black is helpless to keep his king position from being forced open.

Both sides have completed their development and Black is threatening to disrupt White's pawn structure with ...Bxf3. White's reply addresses this threat while also initiating a diabolical plan.
13.d5 exd5?
Black cannot resist accepting this pawn sacrifice.
14.Rfe1
This move exploits the dark-square weaknesses created by 11...g6. It threatens to remove Black's dark-square bishop, which is the key defender of the kingside.
14...h6
An unusual defense. Black prevents Rxe7 by breaking up White's battery.
15.Qxh6 Ng4 16.Qh4 Bxg5 17.Nxg5 Nf6 18.Qh6
This creates a mating net around Black's king.

22.Bd3 h6
This further weakens the light squares. Black's best chance to blunt White's attack is 22...f5, clearing apath for his queen to return to the kingside. On the other hand, 22...g6 fails against the sacrificial attack with 23.Bxg6 hxg6 24.Qxg6+ Kh8 25.Qh6+ Kg8 26.Nh5.

Black's king is not vulnerable despite his pawn advances because White's pieces are massed on the queenside.
19...g3!
Black sacrifices a pawn to access the dark squares around White's king.

A destructive sacrifice.
16.Kxf2 Ng4+ 17.Kg1 Nxe3 18.Qd2 (D)
After 18.Sd2
[diagram]
White had to move to safety. Black has two pawns for the sacrificed piece and must decide how to continue his attack.
18...Nxg2
Rather than capturing the rook, Black removes the one piece that is defending his kingside, and further weakens White's light squares.
19.Kxg2 d4
It is important to open the long diagonal immediately, or else White will blockade the pawn with Ne2-d4.
20.Nxd4 Bb7+ 21.Kf1 (D)
Some observers actually thought Fischer was losing, but he surprises everyone with a "quiet" move. Watch those light squares!
21...Qd7!
Black's queen takes one step forward and transfers to the light squares. White resigns. 0-1 Exercise B7-1: If White plays on with 22.Qf2, how does Black conclude the game? (B8) Fischer - Myagmarsuren, Sousse Interzonal 1967 [C00] After 22...&C3 (B8) Fischer - Myagmarsuren 1967

It is striking that all of Black's pieces, with the exception of his king, are on the queenside. The position cries out for a kingside attack.
23.Bf6!
In the previous illustrative game, Fischer sacrificed his knight for a pawn. This time, he simply puts his bishop en prise and invites Black to capture it. This, too, qualifies as a destructive sacrifice.
23...Qe8

Black completes castling by hand, but the extra moves give White the time to build a powerful attack.

Black returns to the dark squares, indicating that the earlier 16...Qc8 was strategically incorrect.

Black moves his rook to guard against the mate on g7. He cannot do this with 22...Nh5 because 23.Nf6 Qxf6 24.Qxf8 is mate.
23.Nxf6 1-0
If Black plays on with 23...Qxf6, White replies 24.Nd6, with a decisive attack on the f7 square. Black must give up the queen to avoid mate. (B10) Weeramantry - Kumar, Mallorca Olympiad 2004 [C54]

White has more space in the center and is ready to launch an attack on the weakened dark squares on the kingside.
18.h5 Bd7 19.g3 b6?
This is too slow. Black must challenge White's queen without delay by playing 19...Rfe8 followed by ...Qf8.

After 17...dxe4 Moving his h-rook up the file allows White to double rooks faster.
22...Rc8 23.Rh4 Rc7 24.Reh1 c4? (D)
Black overlooks White's threat. Clearing his second rank with 24...f5 is essential. If you have been playing over these games in sequence, you already know what is coming next... White now wins as in Fischer-Myagmarsuren (Game B8): 25.Qxh7+! Kxh7 26.hxg6+ and there is no way to avoid mate: 26...Kg7 27.Rh7+ Kg8 28.Rh8+ Kg7 29.R1h7#. 1-0 (B11) Kramnik - Van Wely, Dortmund 2008 [D30]

On the other hand, White's minor pieces have the potential to support a kingside attack.
18.c5!
This pawn advance cuts the a3-f8 diagonal and threatens to trap Black's bishop.
18...bxc5 19.a3 Ba5 20.dxc5 Qxc5?
Accepting the pawn sacrifice allows White to open the d-file and the long diagonal for his dark-square bishop. After 21...Sfb5 (B11) Kramnik - Van Wely 2008
21.b4 Qb5 (D)
The only way for Black to avoid losing a piece is to pin the b4-pawn. However, both Black's queen and his dark-square bishop have now drifted to the wrong side of the board, leaving Black's king defenseless.
22.Qg3
As Black's key defenders are now out of position, White choses to apply pressure on the dark squares. An alternative approach is to open the kingside with 22.f5.
22...Bb6
Black need not move his bishop back immediately as White's b4-pawn is still pinned. However, he does not have a good alternative. For instance, if Black attempts to protect his g7- pawn with 22...f5, White will plant his queen on g6 and Black will be unable to chase it out of this outpost.
23.Nd7
White threatens mate on g7. The attack on the dark squares has begun.
23...g6 24.Nf6+ Kf8 (D)
Black's king must abandon the kingside as he no longer has any pawn shelter on the dark squares inside the castled position. After 28.Nd6
[diagram]
25.Be5
White continues his offensive on the dark squares. He could, however, achieve the same goal with even greater effect by advancing his f-pawn to f5, opening the h2-b8 diagonal for his queen.
25...Rcc8 26.Qh4 h5
If Black plays ...Bxe3+ here, he loses any possibility of a later defense with ...Bd8.
27.Nh7+ Ke8 28.Bd6 (D)
White's queen and bishop have cleverly switched their diagonals while maintaining the dark- square attack. The new focal point ise7.
28...Rc7
Black has no choice. Unfortunately, the attempt to defend against the mate threat on e7 with
28...Bd8 fails to 29.Nf6+ Bxf6 30.Qxf6.
29.Rfd1 1-0
The threat of Nf6+ followed by the discovered attack along the d-file is too much for Black to handle. (B12) Graif - Can, Chicago 2019 [B42] This game was played by one of Sunil's longtime students, William Graif, who has been a national scholastic champion twice in the United States and twice in Canada. Even though he was on the losing end, William sent this game to Sunil as an example of enterprising play against a weak color complex.

After 2O.Bf3? (B12) Graif - Ali Maranda 2019 Black has adopted a "Hedgehog" formation where none of his pawns have advanced beyond the third rank. Despite the relative lack of space, Black's position is very solid and there are no clear targets for White to attack. Black's last move anticipates White's pawn break with f4-f5, and places the f8-rook on the e- file as a deterrent. It also frees the f8 square to enable the transfer of his bishop to g7.
15.f5 exf5 16.exf5 d5
Black shuts down the a2-g8 diagonal and gives his dark-square bishop other options for deployment.
17.fxg6 hxg6
The trade of pawns created opportunities for both sides. White's rooks are well placed on the e- and f-files and he has pressure on Black's isolated d-pawn. Black has play on the dark squares.
18.Bf4 Qc5 19.Be3 Bd6
Black chooses the sharpest continuation, leaving his queen in a potential discovered attack. His bishop, for the moment, is in a far better spot than it would be on g7, and is eyeing the h2- pawn.
20.Qf3? (D)
White moves his queen out of the pin but misses Black's threat. To keep the balance, White must play 20.h3. After 25.£rf5
[diagram]
20...Rxe3!
This powerful exchange sacrifice eliminates the key defender of White's dark squares and sets up a winning attack.
21.Qxe3 Ng4 22.Qd2 Bxh2+ 23.Kh1 Bg3 24.Re2 Nde5
Black has played a series of forcing moves since the exchange sacrifice and completely dominates the dark squares around White's king. Not only does 24...Nde5 move the second knight into attacking position, it also shields the e7 square, enabling Black's queen to relocate to the kingside.
25.Nf5 (D)
White must rely on drastic measures to survive, and sacrifices a knight in search of counterplay. The alternative 25.Nf3 is met by 25...Kg7 threatening ...Rh8+, after which Black will win material.
25...gxf5 26.Qg5+ Kf8
While this move is strong enough to win, Black also has a most unusual way of securing victory with 26...Ng6 27.Qxf5 Nh6 28.Qg5 Kg7! 29.Qxg3 Rh8 and White is helpless against the discovered check.
27.Rxf5 Qd6?
This gives back most of Black's advantage. Instead he should play 27...Re8, when 28.Rfxe5 Rxe5 29.Qxg4 is met by a crushing reply. (D) (B12) Graif - Ali Maranda 2019 Exercise B12-1: In the position after 27...Re8 28.Rfxe5 Rxe5 29.Qxg4, find a crushing move for Black.
28.Rexe5 Bxe5 29.Qxg4
White recoups his material, and even boxes in Black's king. However, Black's control of the dark squares gives him greater attacking chances.
29...Re8 30.Rg5? (D)
Just when it appears that White is back in the game, he makes a decisive mistake. He is hoping to play Rg8 and trade rooks, but he never gets the chance. The only way to put up further resistance is to play 30.Qh5 instead.
30...Qh6+!
Black's complete domination of the dark squares, coupled with his deep tactical awareness, brings the game to a sudden close.
31.Qh5
White has two other ways to meet this check: 1) If he runs away with 31.Kg1, Black creates deadly threats down the e-file with 31...Bh2+
32.Kf1 Qf6+ 33.Rf5 Qe6, winning material by force.
2) If he blocks with 31.Rh5, Black has the spectacular 31...Bg3! threatening a back-rank mate. After 32.Qxg3 Qxh5+, Black has a comfortably winning position. (31...Bd6 also wins.)
31...Qf6!
Black once again threatens a back-rank mate. Now that White's queen is on h5, White no longer has the resource ...Rg8+. Now if White brings the knight back to block a back-rank check, he runs into a problem along the h-file: 32.Ne2 Bd6 33.Ng1 is met by 33... Ke7! with the threat of ...Rh8.
32.Rf5 (D)
White blocks Black's queen, but does not succeed in eliminating all back-rank threats. After 32.2f5 abcdetgh

PART C
THE INITIATIVE
he games in this section emphasize the dynamic elements of an attacking game. The dynamic player strives to seize and maintain the initiative, and to deploy his pieces so that they are active and work well together in attack and defense. Critical elements of these games include time, space, and understanding why and when to sacrifice material. Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano)

LESSON 6
[diagram]
"SAW IT - WENT HOME"
here are two ways to play chess: you can take control yourself, or you can sit back and wait for the play to come to you. The attacking player always strives for the initiative. To gain the initiative, you make a threat that your opponent must meet. To retain the initiative, you continue to operate with threats. This game was played in 1895 by the first official World Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz. Considered the first great master of positional play, Steinitz stressed concepts such as strong squares, weak pawns, and the importance of good technique. In this game, you will see Steinitz build an initiative in the center through a series of trades, then translate it into control of a strong square. Once he establishes that control, he dominates the board. A famous story is told about this game. Steinitz was out of the room when von Bardeleben realized he was lost. He left a note saying "Saw it - went home." What made von Bardeleben give up without formally resigning was something truly amazing, as you will see. The final combination is so stunning that Steinitz is said to have been very upset when he realized he would not get a chance to play it. His only satisfaction was to show it to the spectators after the game.
W. STEINITZ - C. VON BARDELEBEN
Hastings (England) 1895
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5
The Italian Game, commonly referred to as the Giuoco Piano, is one of the oldest known openings and was played as far back as the early 1500s.
4.c3 (D)
After 4.c3
[diagram]
After 6,e5! (4...Bf6 variation)
[diagram]
White plans to extend his pawn chain with 5.d4 in an effort to seize control of the center. Black cannot do anything to stop this. Question: Even 4...Qf6, adding another attacker, is insufficient. Why? Answer: Because the queen is coming out too early and will get chased around. Yes. That's the idea. Black's queen placement can be exploited with a clever pawn sacrifice:
4...Qf6 5.d4 exd4 6.e5!. (D)
Black does not have a good answer to the attack on his queen. Any queen move that does not create an immediate threat simply allows White to gain a tempo and keep the initiative. On the other hand, if Black captures the attacking pawn with 6...Nxe5, White, with 7.Qe2, pins the knight and wins a piece. Neither active defense (7...dxc3 8.Nxe5 Bxf2+ 9.Kd1) nor passive defense (7...d6 8.cxd4) will save the piece. Black has a third option in 6...Qg6, attacking the g2-pawn. Exercise 6-1: After 4...Qf6 5.d4 exd4 6.e5! Qg6, how should White proceed? Black can also try to suppress d2-d4 with 4...Qe7 in the hope of capturing the e4-pawn with check after 5.d4 exd4 6.cxd4. Question: How would you respond to ...Qe7 ? Answer: I would castle. After Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano) Very good. After you castle, the threat of d4 is renewed. Black has to be careful because his king and queen are lined up on the same file. After 4...Qe7 5.O-O d6 6.d4, Black must not surrender the center with 6...exd4. Instead, he should hold the center with 6...Bb6.
4...Nf6 (D)
The best move for Black.
5.d4
The popularity of this move has declined in recent years. The quieter alternative 5.d3 is now preferred by leading grandmasters.
5...exd4
Question: What happens if Black chooses not to capture, and plays ...Bb6 ? Answer: White plays d5 attacking the knight, hoping to pick up a pawn. No. That move is bad on two counts. If White tries to win a pawn with 6.d5 Ne7 7.Nxe5, Black does not play 7...Nxe4, as it allows
8.Qg4. Instead Black regains the pawn with 7...d6 8.Nf3 Nxe4. (D)
The second reason d5 does not work is that it opens a diagonal for Black's dark-square bishop and blocks in White's light-square bishop. The variation diagram shows the effect d5 has on the two bishops; Black clearly comes out ahead. After 6...£jxe4 (5...Nb6 variation)
[diagram]
Short-term attacks can have undesirable long-term consequences. Question: Is there a better way to answer ...Bb6 ? Answer: Just play dxe5. Question: Of course! Can you show how White gains a clear advantage after 6.dxe5 Nxe4 ?
(D)
Answer: Qd5 threatens mate on f7 and attacks the knight on e4. Excellent! If Black now plays 7...Bxf2+, 8.Ke2 will win material and Black cannot defend both threats at the same time.
6.cxd4 Bb4+ (D)
This active bishop move is the right choice. White has two reasonable moves to block the check: 7.Bd2 and 7.Nc3. Question: After 7.Bd2 Bxd2+ 8.Nbxd2, it is extremely important for Black to find the right move. What is it? Answer: Pawn to d5. Yes. Two unopposed center pawns can advance with devastating effect. Trying to contain them with 8...d6 is too slow, and leaves White in firm control of the center. Black must break up White's connected center pawns immediately. It would have been a mistake for Black to reply to 7.Bd2 with 7...Nxe4. (D) After 7.,.Nxe4 (7.i,d2 variation) After 10...d5 (7.Ad2 variation) Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano) White now has a forcing sequence which regains the pawn: 8.Bxb4 Nxb4 9.Bxf7+ Kxf7
10.Qb3+. Black will now play 10...d5 to block the check. (D)
Question: Does White have a stronger move than capturing the knight immediately with Qxb4 ? Answer: White can play Ne5+ and get his knight to a strong square. Yes, the intermediate move Ne5+ centralizes the knight and forces Black's king to a worse square. Without this move, Black will be able to castle by hand2 by bringing his rook to e8 and then retreating his king to g8. Look for ways to prevent your opponent's king from reaching safety. One of my students was practicing this position after 11.Ne5+ against a computer, and encountered the following variation: 11... Ke8 12.Qxb4 Qg5. (D) After 12...Bg5 (7.Nd2 variation) g h After 7.Nc3
[diagram]
Exercise 6-2: In the position after 12...Qg5 in the 7.Bd2 variation, Black is threatening ...Qc1+ as well as the capture of the g2-pawn. How should White handle these threats? In the game, Steinitz played the other move.
7.Nc3 (D)
This line is now referred to as the Møller Attack, named for the Danish chess theorist Jørgen Møller who, in 1898, published an extensive analysis. White offers to sacrifice his e4-pawn; if Black accepts (7...Nxe4), White castles and gets active play against Black's uncastled king. The line is very complex, but modern theory finds that should both sides play the best moves, the fireworks will fizzle out and leave Black in a better position.
7...d5
Black declines the sacrifice.
8.exd5 Nxd5 9.O-O (D)
After ll.Qb3 (9... xc3 variation) Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano) Question: Does Black have time to win White's c3-pawn? Answer: No, it is too dangerous to grab pawns when your king is exposed. Agreed. Going for the pawn is ill-advised. 9...Bxc3 10.bxc3 Nxc3? loses the knight to
11.Qe1+. Of course, Black does not have to take twice on c3. But even a move such as 10...O-O
would give White a clear advantage due to his bishop pair and better control of the center. The other way of trying to win the pawn is even worse. 9...Nxc3 10.bxc3 Bxc3 gives White a chance to unleash a powerful attack with 11.Qb3. (D) Exercise 6-3: After 9...Nxc3 10.bxc3 Bxc3 11.Qb3, if Black takes the rook with 11...Bxa1, how does White win? Mobility generally triumphs over material when the defending king is weakened. In any event, von Bardeleben played more cautiously.
9...Be6 10.Bg5 Be7 (D)
This leads to a series of trades that enables White to create pressure along the open e-file and keep Black from castling. 10...Qd7 would have been safer.
11.Bxd5 Bxd5 12.Nxd5 Qxd5 13.Bxe7 Nxe7 (D)
Failing to castle compromises the safety of the king, especially when the e-file is open. Look at how lonely Black's king is. The piece trades have removed his defenders, one by one, and left him exposed in the center. Question: It is clear that White's pieces are more active, but what about his d-pawn - is it strong or weak? Answer: Weak, because it is isolated. Isolated pawns generally are weak because they cannot be protected by another pawn. On the other hand, if the pawn advances to the fifth rank or further, then the space advantage you obtain will give you more room to maneuver in the middlegame and compensate for the inherent weakness of the pawn. Here the isolated pawn is only on the fourth rank, but it is the only center pawn. As such, itstrengthens White's position by controlling key central squares. For the moment, the d4-pawn is strong, but it could become weak as the game continues. White needs to keep this in mind. Question: What is White's next move? Answer: Rook to e1. There is no question about that. After 14.Sei After 14...f6
[diagram]
Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano)
14.Re1 (D)
White pins the e7-knight and keeps Black's king from castling. This presents serious difficulties for Black which must be addressed immediately. Do not ignore a problem. It will not go away by itself. Question: Black must find a way to release the pin and get his king to safety. How can he do it? Answer: Play ...f6 and ...Kf7. Correct.
14...f6 (D)
15.Qe2
White increases the pressure along the e-file and threatens mate.
15...Qd7
Black defends the mate. Question: How should White continue? Answer: Rad1, supporting the isolated pawn. (D) A very good suggestion. This will help advance the pawn and create more space. After 16, adl (variation) After 16,Sacl abode fgh After 19 xc7+ (16>.Af7 variation) Exercise 6-4: After 16.Rad1, if Black continues with 16...Kf7, what should White do? Steinitz did develop his other rook, but to a different square.
16.Rac1 (D)
White chooses to exert pressure along the c-file and target the c7-pawn. Black should stay with his original plan and play 16...Kf7. Then, 17.Qc4+ could be easily handled with 17...Nd5. An intriguing option for White after 16...Kf7 is the exchange sacrifice 17.Qxe7+ Qxe7
18.Rxe7+ Kxe7 19.Rxc7+. (D)
After 16."c6?
[diagram]
Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano) Black should now centralize his king with 19...Kd6, after which White can pick up a second pawn, giving him a knight and two pawns for the rook. While this represents the same point value, it is a risky proposition. Black's king is well placed for the endgame and his rook can wreak havoc in an open position.
16...c6? (D)
Black gets distracted by the pressure on c7, and reacts with an overabundance of caution which leads to his downfall. From this point on, the game is beautifully played. Steinitz finds the right plan and executes it with astounding clarity and precision. He focuses on a weak square in Black's position, realizing that posting a knight to this square will dominate the entire board. Question: Which is the weak square? Answer: c5. A good square, but not sufficiently deep in Black's territory to cause trouble. Answer: d6. Much better, but White would have trouble supporting a knight on this square. Answer: e6. This is a lovely square; can the knight get there? You are now playing fantasy chess - pick a square and dream! So long as it is not totally unrealistic, you may have a chance. Question: Is getting the knight to e6 an impossible dream? Answer: No. Play 17.Rcd1 and 18.d5 to create a path for the knight. Steinitz goes one better. He realizes he can play d4-d5 right away. Black cannot take the pawn with the knight or the queen, so he must capture with his pawn. By sacrificing the pawn, White clears the d4 square which his knight will use on its way to e6. This kind of sacrifice is called aclearance sacrifice.
17.d5! cxd5
There is another purpose to sacrificing the pawn. Once Black captures with his pawn, d5 is no longer available as an outpost for his knight. After 18...Nf7
[diagram]
After 19., hc8
[diagram]
Look for sacrifices that improve your position while simultaneously depriving your opponent of key squares.
18.Nd4
The fantasy is becoming reality.
18...Kf7 (D)
This is the first step towards untangling himself. Black will next move the h-rook and slide his king behind it. White must attack now!
19.Ne6
Question: What is White's threat? Answer: Penetrate to the seventh rank with Rc7. Good. The knight is beginning to orchestrate the attack from its advanced outpost by supporting the rook invasion.
19...Rhc8 (D)
Black now moves his h-rook to cover the c-file so that it will not be boxed in when the king retreats. However, moving this rook over to the queenside leaves the kingside unprotected. Question: White has a move that sets up two different threats. Can you find it? Answer: Qh5+. After 20...g6
[diagram]
After 22JSxe7+!
[diagram]
Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano) This does look attractive because if Black goes wrong with 20...g6, White can take the pawn on h7. However, Black just retreats his king to g8 and he will have castled by hand! Answer: Nc5. The knight is well placed as it is. There is no reason to back it out. Answer: Qg4. Excellent! The immediate threat is to capture the g7-pawn with check.
20.Qg4 g6 (D)
Black stops the attack on g7.
21.Ng5+
White now carries out the second threat with a discovered attack on Black's queen.
21...Ke8 22.Rxe7+! (D)
This is the first move of a fascinating sequence. White makes this destructive sacrifice to strip away the last defenses around Black's king. Black cannot recapture with his queen because
23.Rxc8+ wins easily.
Exercise 6-5: After 22.Rxe7+, what happens if Black recaptures with the king?
22...Kf8
After 26...Nh8 (25...Ng8 variation) abcdefqh The only alternative. Incredibly, all four of White's pieces are threatened, and one of the threatened captures leads to a back-rank mate! White has no time to waste. He has to keep on checking. There are two distinct parts to Steinitz's combination. The key to the first part is to recognize the strength of the pin along the h3-c8 diagonal. Black's queen is pinned to the rook on c8. It can be difficult to see pins when both the pinned piece and the piece executing the pin are the same; in this case, aqueen is pinning a queen. The pin allows White's rook to walk arrogantly along the seventh rank without fear of capture!
23.Rf7+ Kg8 24.Rg7+ Kh8 (D)
Black's king can never move up a rank because White's queen will capture on d7 with check. Capturing the rook is therefore out of the question. Exercise 6-6: If Black's king moves back with 24...Kf8?, how does White respond?
25.Rxh7+
This is the point when von Bardeleben left the room, never to return! When Steinitz returned to the board, he could not contain his disappointment at being unable to complete the game. His only comfort was in demonstrating to the spectators this dazzling win:
25...Kg8 26.Rg7+ Kh8 (D)
After 29...Ne7 (25...Ng8 variation)
[diagram]
After 33.&fi8+ (25... g8 variation) Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano) We have entered the second stage of the combination. The rook has done its job in clearing the seventh rank; it is now expendable.
27.Qh4+
White's queen takes over.
27...Kxg7 28.Qh7+ Kf8 29.Qh8+ Ke7 (D)
White's queen is inching towards Black's king.
30.Qg7+ Ke8 31.Qg8+ Ke7 32.Qf7+ Kd8 33.Qf8+: (D)
Typically, amating attack involving aqueen would include sweeping moves that emphasize the long-range power of the piece. In this game, however, the queen has moved just one square at a time for six consecutive moves, squeezing Black's king to a slow and painful death.
33...Qe8 34.Nf7+
Finally, the knight springs into action setting up a forced mate.

ANSWERS
Exercise 6-1: After 4...Qf6 5.d4 exd4 6.e5! Qg6, how should White proceed? (D) Answer: White keeps up the pressure with 7.cxd4 Qxg2 8.Rg1 Bb4+ 9.Nc3 Qh3 10.Bxf7+. The bishop cannot be captured because White will fork Black's king and queen with 11.Ng5+. Exercise 6-2: In the position after 12...Qg5 in the 7.Bd2 variation, Black is threatening ...Qc1+ as well as the capture of the g2-pawn. How should White handle these threats?

White's best way to retain an advantage is 13.Nd2 Nxd2 14.Qxd2 Qxd2+ 15.Kxd2, steering the game into a favorable knight-versus-bishop ending. There is no need for White to fear losing the g2-pawn (13...Qxg2) as 14.O-O-O! Nxf2 15.Rhg1 leads to a crushing attack.

Answer: If Black takes the rook with 11...Bxa1, White wins with 12.Bxf7+ Kf8 13.Ba3+ Ne7. White has several winning moves, of which 14.Rxa1 threatening 15.Re1 is the simplest.

Answer: 17.Qc4+ forces Black to waste a tempo and retreat his king because 17...Nd5 fails to a spectacular combination: 18.Ne5+ fxe5 19.dxe5 (threatening 20.e6+) 19...Qc6 20.e6+ Ke8
21.Qxd5 Qxd5 22.Rxd5 with a winning endgame.
Exercise 6-5: After 22.Rxe7+, what happens if Black recaptures with the king? Answer: After 22...Kxe7 (D), After 24.Bg7+

Exercise 6-6: If Black's king moves back with 24...Kf8?, how does White respond? Answer: After 24.Rg7+ (D), if 24...Kf8, then 25.Nxh7+ (25.Qxd7?? Rxc1 mate!) 25...Kxg7 26.Qxd7+ wins.
REVIEW
Themes Control of the center with pawns (4.c3, 5.d4). King in the center (10...d5 11.Ne5+ variation; 13...Nxe7; 14.Re1). Isolated center pawn (discussion after 13...Nxe7). Exchange sacrifice (16...Kf7 17.Qxe7+ variation). Clearance sacrifice (17.d5). Destructive sacrifice (22.Rxe7+). Queen and knight coordination (28.Qh7+ through 35.Qd6+ mate). Advice Short-term attacks can have undesirable long-term consequences. Look for ways to prevent your opponent's king reaching safety. Mobility generally triumphs over material when the defending king is weakened. Do not ignore a problem. It will not go away by itself. Look for sacrifices that improve your position while simultaneously depriving your opponent of key squares. __________ 2 "Castling by hand" means placing a king and rook where they achieve the effect of castling even though castling itself is no longer legal. The rook can choose any square that allows the king to move towards the corner without impeding the rook's development. Weeramantry - Goldberg 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack)

LESSON 7

STRIKE WHILE THE KNIGHT IS COLD
n order to become a good chess player, you must above all understand the idea of compensation. You may sacrifice material or structure in return for time and space, with the idea of gaining the initiative. Many intermediate players are reluctant to sacrifice something of value unless they can see an immediate return, but learning to make concessions for dynamic play is part of modern chess. Even though I had not calculated each and every variation to a definite conclusion, Igave up a pawn very early in this game judging that my sacrifice would generate sufficient practical chances. As you will see, it was a matter of seizing the initiative at the proper time. My opponent, Mitchell Goldberg, is a FIDE Master.
S. WEERAMANTRY - M. GOLDBERG
New York, 1991
1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4
White plays the Grand Prix Attack, one of the so-called Anti-Sicilians which refrain from opening the center as in the Open Sicilian (2.Nf3 and 3.d4).3 This system was introduced to me during my early chess-playing days at the Geneva Chess Club. I used it for the first time, with success, against IM Werner Hug in a four-way playoff for the final qualifying spot in the 1967 Under-20 Championship of Switzerland. I was ecstatic when I won the game and the playoffs along with it. This has been one of my favorite openings ever since.
3...e6 4.Nf3 d5 (D)
After 4,..d5 Strong Weaker c d Black immediately contests the center. Instead of 4...d5, his alternatives are 4...Nge7 and
4...a6, after which White's best plan may well be to turn this into an Open Sicilian with 5.d4
cxd4 6.Nxd4. Transpositions are valuable tools for taking your opponent out of his chosen system and compelling him to play yours.
5.Bb5
This is one of the main ideas of the system. White would like to play Bxc6, doubling Black's c-pawns and hoping to use them as targets. The strategy is similar to that used by Black in the Nimzo-Indian Defense, where Black plays ...Bb4 and doubles White's pawns by taking the knight on c3. Black cannot play 5...Bd7 to avoid the doubled pawns, because this would mask the queen's protection of his d5-pawn. Learning to play against doubled pawns is important. Let's look at some typical structures. If you have a three-pawn island that includes a set of doubled pawns, the strongest formation is this: As the single pawn advances, the doubled pawns get weaker because they lose support. This is the weakest formation. Notice how a single opposing pawn cripples all three of Black's pawns. Weakest c d After 7. e2 (5...d4 variation) Weeramantry - Goldberg 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) I have enjoyed tremendous success over the years playing against this particular pawn formation in the Grand Prix. When your opponent has virtually no pawn play, it is easy to predict his plans and keep the game under control. A fluid pawn structure complicates the game and makes long-term planning more difficult. Fixed structures are easier to play against.
5...Nf6 (D)
Other moves are inferior. 5...a6 is a wasted move that simply encourages White to do what he planned in the first place. If 5...d4 or 5...dxe4, White still gets to capture on c6, weakening Black's pawn structure. As we have already examined the pawn-structure weaknesses resulting from the doubled c- pawns, let us look at the position that would have arisen after 5...d4 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Ne2. (D) After 6.d3
[diagram]
After 9.&xdl (6...dxe4 variation)
[diagram]
If White is given the opportunity, he will cripple Black's c- and d-pawns with 8.d3 and further strengthen his hold over the c4 square with 9.b3. To avoid this, Black could try 7...d3. However, after 8.cxd3 Qxd3 9.Qa4 Qb5 10.Nc3, White has excellent play against Black's weakened pawn structure.
6.d3 (D)
The common move order, which I have frequently employed, is 6.Bxc6 bxc6 7.e5. However, after 7...Nd7 8.d3 Ba6, I have had trouble with the ...c5-c4 pawn thrust. The move 6.d3 is an attempt on my part to delay Black's counterplay. After all, the c8-bishop cannot go to a6 until Black's b-pawn has moved. The only drawback to 6.d3 would be if Black decided to trade queens with 6...dxe4, a move played against me in 1992 by National Master Ralph Zimmer at a tournament in Somerset, New Jersey. Although I lost that game, Iwas quite happy with my position after 7.Bxc6+ bxc6
8.dxe4 Qxd1+ 9.Kxd1 (D) and would not mind tackling this sequence again.
Black's structural weaknesses and lack of space in the center present him with some difficulties. White should be able to exploit this despite the fact that his king is uncastled. If the above variation holds up to closer scrutiny, my move order with 6.d3 would represent an improvement. In this game, Goldberg opts not to trade queens and plays a routine developing move.
6...Be7 7.O-O (D)
Weeramantry - Goldberg 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Should Black now castle, White will continue with 8.Bxc6 bxc6 9.e5. By delaying the capture on c6, White makes the ...Ba6 and ...c5-c4 idea less effective. He would have time to play b2-b3 and better control c4.
7...Bd7
Black seeks to avoid the doubled pawns. While this position is assessed as equal, Iwas now in unfamiliar territory. This was the first time I had encountered this exact sequence. When you find yourself in a new position, you must remember to take your time and consider how the position differs from what you already know. Do not rush your reply.
8.e5 Ng8? (D)
Black should have tried 8...Ng4. Retreating the knight to the first rank should be a last resort because it will take time to get it back into the game. By inducing Black's knight to go back to its starting square, White gained a lead in development. Indeed, White has gained two tempi. But remember, an advantage in development/mobility is temporary. Given sufficient time, Black will recover. The best way to exploit the advantage in development is to immediately force open the position. Look for a central pawn advance - even a sacrifice - that changes the pawn structure. This game reminded me of one played by one of my students at the 1987 World Youth Championships in Puerto Rico. White tried to relocate the c3-knight to the kingside by moving back to d1. The moment the knight hit d1, Black advanced a center pawn. Suddenly White's After 9.f5 After 9...exf5
[diagram]
entire position disintegrated, just in the space of that one move. You will not always have a center pawn to advance, but that is what you should look for. Question: So, what's the best move? Answer: White should play 9.d4. Then, if9...cxd4, 10.Nxd4 opens the center. Yes, it does trade pawns, but does not radically change the pawn structure. Answer: Play g4 and prepare f5. You are getting close, but this does not force open the position. If the other player has already castled on the kingside, you might consider this plan. For now, it is too slow. A loss in time must be exploited immediately. Answer: Play f5 right away.
9.f5 (D)
Good timing! If White does not play f4-f5 immediately, Black will stop it with 9...Nh6 and be ready to get his king out of the center. The f4-pawn was hindering the mobility of White's c1-bishop and fl-rook. Get rid of the f4- pawn and see how these two pieces come alive! New lines of attack will open up immediately.
9...exf5 (D)
10.Nxd5 Nxe5 11.Nxe5 Bxb5
Question: After 11...Bxb5, what should White play? After 12.c4
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Goldberg 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Answer: Play 12.c4, protecting the knight and attacking the b5-bishop.
12.c4 (D)
White is still down a pawn but has two strong centralized knights and pressure on the f5- pawn. He is castled and has better development. This is the position I had envisioned when I decided to play 9.f5. I had not analyzed beyond this point because I had judged that I had ample compensation for the pawn. When analyzing long variations, understanding where to pause your analysis is important. Save time on your clock and think on your opponent's time. Now, Black must move the bishop before he can free his position. Attempting to complete his development with 12...Nf6 leads to disaster. Exercise 7-1: Find White's best reply against 12...Nf6. If instead Black plays 12...Bc6, White gains a clear advantage with 13.Rxf5 Bxd5 14.cxd5 Nf6 15.Qa4+ forcing Black to move his king and depriving him of the right to castle. So the bishop goes back to d7.
12...Bd7 13.Bf4 Be6
Question: This threatens ...Bxd5. How does White proceed? Answer: Qa4+. Good. Look for forcing moves. Black's knight and rook are never going to get out.
14.Qa4+ Kf8 (D)
After 14...Qf8
[diagram]
After 15.Nc7
[diagram]
Black has no choice but to move the king. 14...Bd7, blocking the check, loses. Exercise 7-2: If 14...Bd7, how does White win material? Black's best hope is to continue with ...g7-g6 in order to sneak his king to safety on g7. Question: How does White keep his attack going? Answer: 15.Nc7. If 15...Qxc7, 16.Ng6+ wins the queen. A pretty move. You definitely have a good tactical sense. White tempts Black's queen to capture on c7 in order to set up a discovered attack. This is referred to as a magnet combination, or combination of attraction.
15.Nc7 (D)
This is a difficult position for Black to defend. Sometimes, it may be wise to give up a little material to secure active counterplay. This is one of those positions. Black's best defense would be to abandon the exchange and create much needed space for his king with 15...g5 16.Bg3 f4.
(D)
After 16...Rd8
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Goldberg 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) White now has two choices. He can take the rook with Nxa8, or the bishop with Nxe6+. Question: Which plan would you choose? Answer: Nxa8 wins material. Your move does win the exchange, but it gives Black good compensation. After 17.Nxa8 fxg3
18.Qxa7 Bd6, Black's bishop pair becomes very active. White's knight is stuck in the corner and
his queen is out of play. Answer: Nxe6+. Yes. Taking the bishop eliminates a key defender and weakens Black's king.
15...Qd4+
Black does not find the above defense.
16.Kh1 Rd8 (D)
Question: Find the best way to continue the attack. Answer: Qd1, then move over to h5, setting up Ng6+. Redeploying pieces is often an important concept. Here it is not warranted. Look at Black's pieces: most of his army is on the kingside. Why move the queen over to the side of the board where Black's pieces are concentrated? Attack where the enemy is weak. Answer: Qb3 attacks the b7-pawn. After 18.aael After 19...Nc8
[diagram]
Excellent. This is even stronger than what I played. The point, however, is not the pawn; it is that White now threatens Nb5 trapping Black's queen. Answer: Qxa7. You would go pawn hunting in this position? This is also a strong move, and is indeed what I played.
17.Qxa7
We have already observed that Black's pieces are huddled on the kingside. The queenside pawns are left defenseless. Who says you always need a combination to win? Just queen the a- pawn!
17...Bf6 18.Rae1 (D)
This brings the last piece into the game. Unlike Black, White has achieved full development. He is getting ready to capture the b-pawn and Black cannot protect it. Exercise 7-3: If Black responds with 18...Bxe5 19.Bxe5 Qxd3, what does White do?
18...Ne7 19.Qxb7 Bc8 (D)
Question: Where should White's queen go? Answer: b6. An excellent square. Weeramantry - Goldberg 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack)
20.Qb6
The queen is perfectly placed on b6, where it applies pressure on the f6-bishop and prevents the freeing move ...g7-g6. Black cannot play 20... Rd6, as 21.Ng6+ sets up a discovered attack on the rook. At this point, the game is essentially over. Black offers no resistance.
20...Ng6 21.Nc6 Qxd3 22.Nxd8 Nxf4 23.Re8#

ANSWERS
Exercise 7-1: Find White's best reply against 12...Nf6. (D) Answer: White wins a piece with 13.Nxe7 Qxe7 14.cxb5 Qxe5 15.Re1 Ne4 16.dxe4. No better is
13...Qd4+ 14.Kh1 Qxe5 15.Nxf5, threatening both Re1 and cxb5.
Exercise 7-2: If 14...Bd7 (D), how does White win material? Answer: White wins material with 15.Nxd7 Qxd7 16.Nc7+ Kd8 17.Qxd7+ Kxd7 18.Nxa8. Now Black must play 18...Bd6 to gain back a knight for the lost rook, but White wins two pawns for it: 19.Bxd6 Kxd6 20.Rxf5 Nf6 (20...b6 21.Rd5+) 21.Nc7 Kxc7 22.Rxc5+. Exercise 7-3: If Black responds with 18...Bxe5 19.Bxe5 Qxd3 (D), what does White do? After 19...Qxd3 (18...jLxe5 variation) Weeramantry - Goldberg 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Answer: White wins with a series of checks: 20.Qxc5+ Ne7 21.Bxg7+ Kxg7 22.Nxe6+ leading to mate or to the win of the queen.

A MISSED OPPORTUNITY
his is one of the most memorable games I ever played. At one point I came up with a theoretical novelty in a seldom played variation of the Max Lange Attack. This game has been published all over the world. My opponent was the reigning champion of Germany, IM Hans-Joachim Hecht, who was awarded the GM title three years later. As a young untested player, I was terrified to face him. Even so, Iwas able to play aggressively and create good winning chances.
S. WEERAMANTRY - H. HECHT
Bagneux Open (France) 1970
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4
This game begins as a Scotch Gambit. White refrains from recapturing the pawn in order to develop more quickly.

5.O-O Bc5 (D)
Black invites the Max Lange Attack. Instead, Black could have played 5...Nxe4, the main line of the Two Knights' Defense. White can pin this knight with 6.Re1, but Black defends with 6...d5. Black's two extra pawns appear to give him the advantage. However, White now has a powerful sequence with a temporary piece sacrifice: 7.Bxd5! Qxd5 8.Nc3. (D) After 6.e5 After 7,*,dxc4 Weeramantry - Hecht 1970 (Max Lange Attack) An unusual sight: Black's knight and pawn are both pinned. Now, after 8...Qa5 9.Nxe4 Be6

6.e5 (D)
The Max Lange Attack. White has accepted the challenge. Question: What should Black do now? Answer: ...Ne4. This will run into a very uncomfortable pin after 7.Qe2 d5 8.exd6 f5 9.Bg5 Qxd6 10.Nbd2. Black's king is unable to get out of the center. Answer: ...Ng4. This move enjoyed a bad reputation for many years, but has now been rehabilitated. It is worth closer study, but that will be for another time. Answer: ...d5.
6...d5
The most reliable move. Establishing the d-pawn in the center neutralizes the attacking potential of White's c4-bishop.
7.exf6 dxc4 (D)
Both sides have just captured a piece: White has taken the f6-knight, Black the bishop on c4. After 9...mf6 (variation)
[diagram]
Question: This is trade for equal value. Has either side gained an advantage in position? Answer: Yes. Black. The c4- and d4-pawns are very strong. True, they work very well together. The d4-pawn is well protected and the c4-pawn is easily defended with ...Be6. Black's plan would be to castle queenside and eventually create a passed pawn with ...d3. Question: And, what about White's f6-pawn? Answer: It can capture on g7 and attack the rook. Yes, but Black will reply with ...Rg8 and use the g-file to attack White's king. If White keeps this pawn on f6, it will prevent Black from blocking a check along the e-file by moving a piece to e7.
8.Re1+ Be6 9.Ng5
White piles the pressure on the pinned piece. It appears that Black can defend the bishop for a second time with 9...Qxf6 (D) and eliminate White's dangerous f6-pawn at the same time. Question: Is this a good idea for Black? Answer: No. White can keep increasing the pressure on e6 with Qg4. Be careful - that exposes the queen. Black would castle kingside, breaking the pin on the e6- bishop, and if White continued with 11.Nxe6, Black would recapture with the f-pawn and open up a powerful attack along the f-file. Answer: No. After 9...Qxf6, Black loses a piece to 10.Nxe6 fxe6 11.Qh5+, winning the c5- bishop by force. Excellent. Always examine forcing moves. It will help avoid blunders.
9...Qd5 10.Nc3 (D)
After 10-Nc3 8 6 5 3 2
[diagram]
After 12.g4 (ll. ce4 variation)
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Hecht 1970 (Max Lange Attack) White brings his c3-knight into action with tempo. Of course, Black cannot capture this knight as it would cost him his queen. Black must now move his queen and keep his e6-bishop protected. The only squares that allow this are d7, d6, and f5. If Black plays 10...Qd6 or 10...Qd7, White replies with 11.Nce4, threatening the c5-bishop. Once the bishop moves, White continues with a strong attack featuring moves like fxg7, Nxe6, and Qh5+.
10...Qf5 11.g4 (D)
An obscure move that had only been played a handful of times before this game; the more established line is11.Nce4 O-O-O 12.g4. (D) In this position, Black has three choices. The first, 12...Qxg4+, loses material. Exercise 8-1: After 11.Nce4 O-O-O 12.g4 Qxg4+, how does White win material? Question: What else can the queen do? Answer: Move to d5. No, that also loses the exchange: 13.fxg7 Rhg8 14.Nf6 with a double attack on the queen and rook. Answer: ...Qe5. This is the best square. You do not have to fear a discovered attack because the e4-knight cannot cause immediate damage. After 13.fxg7 Rhg8 14.Nxe6 fxe6, White should protect his g7- After 15.i,h6 (11.&ce4 variation) After ll."@xf6

pawn with 15.Bh6. (D) There is a dynamic balance to this position. Each side has plenty to play for.
11...Qxf6 (D)
Now Black's queen can safely capture the pawn on f6. Instead of taking the pawn, the preferred move is 11...Qg6 as in Black-burne - Teichmann, Nuremberg 1896. I had come across that game in Modern Chess Openings 10th edition, which was the only book on opening theory I owned at that time.
12.Nd5 Qd8 (D)
After 14...Bh4? (variation) Weeramantry - Hecht 1970 (Max Lange Attack) It is amusing to note that Black's queen made a loop going from d8 to d5 to f5 to f6 and back to d8.
13.Rxe6+
This enterprising exchange sacrifice offers ample compensation.
13...fxe6 14.Nxe6 (D)
While Black's rooks are standing idly in the corners, White's knights have taken up menacing positions in the center. The e6-knight, in particular, is attacking Black's queen. The knights are positioned in such a way that should the queen capture one of them, the other knight will take on c7 forking Black's king and queen. Question: Where can the queen go? Answer: ...Qh4. That would be a disaster for Black. Iactually reached this position once and my opponent resigned two moves later. (D) Question: What made him resign? Answer: Play the bishop to g5. That chases the queen to h3, where it can be trapped by moving a knight to f4. Precisely. It is amazing that the queen cannot go anywhere safe, even though the entire third rank is open. After 15>Nh6 Question: Where else can the queen go, besides h4? Answer: ...Qd6. This only helps White to develop more quickly after Bf4. Exercise 8-2: After 14...Qd6 15.Bf4 Qd7, how does White continue the attack? As his queen cannot capture either knight, Black has nothing better than to retreat to d7 and concede a valuable tempo.
14...Qd7
White now plays a surprising move.
15.Bh6 (D)
This move was an over-the-board inspiration and not the result of home preparation. Remarkably, all three of White's minor pieces are hanging, yet none can be captured without Black's losing his queen to a knight fork. Although this move had never been played before, at least according to ChessBase, it turns out 15.Bh6 had been suggested by Staunton in his analysis of Steinitz - Meitner, Vienna 1860. Such chess information was not readily available to the average player back in 1970. Today, chess engines recommend 15.Ndxc7+ Kf7 16.Ng5+ Kg8 17.Nxa8 with a winning advantage.
15...Bd6
Black decides to abandon the immediate point of attack (g7) and chooses to defend c7 instead. There is a common military tactic in which an army is sometimes forced to abandon an outer area in order to fall back and regroup around a more defensible position.
16.Nxg7+
Question: How would Black have replied if White had played Bxg7 instead? Answer: ...Qxe6. Yes. Now that c7 is defended, the knight can be captured. 17.Nf6+ can be met with 17...Kf7, and Black gets two pieces for the rook.
16...Kd8 17.Nf6 (D)
After 18.Qf3 Weeramantry - Hecht 1970 (Max Lange Attack) White's knights are still in attacking positions, but they are not as well coordinated as earlier.
17...Qe7
Black attacks the f6-knight, but it is better to attack it from f7. Then, if 18.Qf3, White's f6- knight will be pinned to his queen and his overall mobility hindered.
18.Qf3 (D)
White gets his queen into action and protects his f6-knight. The queen's presence on the long light-square diagonal prevents Black from playing ...Ne5 because his b7-pawn will be left unprotected. Also, should Black pin White's f6-knight with 18...Rf8, White will secure his knight with 19.g5 and open the h3-c8 diagonal with aview to controlling the light squares. Question: Black does not have any good moves for his knight or his h8-rook. So, what can he move? Answer: Move the queen to e5, threatening ...Qxh2+ forking the king and bishop. (D) After 18...ffie5 (variation) abode f g h After 18".Nc8
[diagram]
Question: White has an unusual move to stop that threat. What is it? Answer: Bf4. Yes. The bishop cannot be taken because Ne6+ would fork Black's king and queen. Question: What if he takes the f6-knight instead? Answer: Offer the bishop again with Bg5. Exactly. The pin and fork sequence again wins Black's queen. Unfortunately, Black does not have to capture the bishop or the knight. He can retreat his queen to e7 and White will have nothing better than to repeat the position with Bh6. Therefore, Bf4 is good enough for a draw by repetition, but White can play for more. Exercise 8-3: After 18...Qe5, what should White play? After thinking for about 40 minutes, Hecht came up with a simple but effective plan that did not involve moving his queen, rook, or knight.
18...Kc8 (D)
Black quietly walks his king away from the action. His intention is to play ...a7-a6 at the first opportunity and shelter his king on a7. Once there, his rooks will be connected and his extra material will prevail.

I played the standard pattern for a smothered mate and did not consider the option of
21.Nc5+. I failed to realize the importance of keeping pressure on b7 so that Black would not
have the defensive resource that he gets later, on move 23. After 21.Nc5+ Kb8 22.Bg5 Qxg7
23.Bf6, Black will have to retreat his queen to g8. The counterattack with 23...Ne7 does not
work here. (D) White wins with the intermediate move 24.Qe4, threatening mate on b7 while still attacking Black's queen. Black cannot defend both threats.

22.Nd7+ would have given White the chance to get back into the 21.Nc5+ variation we just
discussed.
22...Qxg7 23.Bf6 (D)
23...Qg8?
Retreating the queen keeps the threat of smothered mate under control. However, Black misses the powerful defensive resource 23...Ne7. The counterattack works here because, without a knight on c5, White cannot play Qe4 to generate a mate threat on b7.
24.Nd7+ Kc8 (D)
25.Bxh8?
A horrendous move. Why trade an active piece for one that absolutely has no influence on the position? Indeed, White misses his final chance to secure a winning position. The correct move is 25.Re1. White is threatening to mate with Nf8+ followed by Re8. Black must create an escape square for his king by moving either his a- or b-pawn. Exercise 8-4: After 25.Re1 a6, what is White's best move? Black can put up more resistance with 25...b6, but White still retains the advantage after
26.Nxb6+ Kb7 27.Nxa8 (D)
After 27.&Bxa8 (25.Sei variation) After 26...-Se? Weeramantry - Hecht 1970 (Max Lange Attack)
27...a6 28.Nxc7 Bxc7 29.Re6. White delays capturing on h8 in order to set up more threats
in the center. White is winning.
25...Qxh8 26.Re1 Ne7 (D)
Black attacks White's queen, but White has one final trick up his sleeve.
27.Nf8+
Black cannot capture the queen as he would blunder into mate with 28.Re8#. Hecht, who had been looking intently at the board, raised his head and smiled. Realizing he was not about to fall for this, I extended my hand to offer a draw. After 27...Kb8, the game will end in a perpetual check. We shook hands and thus ended a game I would remember for the rest of my life. After 12...9xg4+ (ll.ftce4 variation)

ANSWERS
Exercise 8-1: After 11.Nce4 O-O-O 12.g4 Qxg4+ (D), how does White win material? Answer: White plays 13.Qxg4 Bxg4 14.Nxf7 gxf6 15.Nxh8, winning the exchange. Although at first glance 14.Nxc5 looks more appealing, that move creates a complex position where Black's pawns provide ample compensation for the piece. Exercise 8-2: After 14...Qd6 15.Bf4 Qd7 (D), how does White continue the attack? Answer: White wins material with a series of forcing moves: 16.Ndxc7+ Kf7 17.Nxc5 Qe7 18.Qf3 Kg8 19.Nxa8 Qxc5 20.Re1. Exercise 8-3: After 18...Qe5, what should White play? (D) After 18...iBe5 (variation) After 25",a6 (25,Rel variation)
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Hecht 1970 (Max Lange Attack) Answer: White can play 19.Qh3 protecting h2. Now 19...Qxf6 loses to 20.Bg5 Qxg5 21.Ne6+ winning the queen. Of course, 19...Qxf6 is not forced, but White will still secure the advantage with 20.g5. Exercise 8-4: After 25.Re1 a6 (D), what is White's best move? Answer: White's best move is26.Bxh8 Qxh8 27.Nf6+ Kb8 28.Re8+ Qxe8 29.Nxe8. White's active pieces and kingside pawn majority give him a clear advantage.
REVIEW
Themes Sacrifice of the exchange for positional compensation (introduction). Opening move transpositions and choices - Scotch Opening, Scotch Gambit, Giuoco Piano, Max Lange Attack (moves 1-5). Fighting for the center (6...d5). Attack and counterattack: piece values and the initiative (6...d5). "Monster" black pawns on c4 and d4 (7...dxc4). Doubled pawns can be strong (10.Nc3 comment). The theoretical line 11.Nce4 in the Max Lange Attack. Pseudo- (or sham) versus real sacrifices (13.Rxe6+). Strong centralized knights (14.Nxe6). The more practical approach (15.Ndxc7+ variation). Pulling the trigger too soon (25.Bxh8). Maintaining the threat versus choosing the execution (game conclusion). Advice Always examine forcing moves. It will help avoid blunders. As Black, you should always take the Scotch Gambit pawn, but you must know all the traps and gambits. In many openings, the move ...d5 can be a demanding answer for Black in the fight for the center. When you counterattack, you generally want the threat to be against a piece of greater value than the one that was attacked, else the first player to capture gets the initiative. Be alert to the common motif of a queen check on one side of the board to pick up a piece on the other side. To evaluate pawn structure, not only must you look at individual pawns and squares, but also at the pawn structure as a whole. To decide when to "pull the trigger," first examine lines thoroughly, then make a decision based on your experience and intuition. __________

White is pinning his hopes on a queenside breakthrough. Anticipating this shift of White's forces, Black prepares an invasion on the opposite wing.

Even though no pawns have been traded, Black's rooks are far more active than White's. Black already controls the d-file, and now threatens to open the h-file by further advancing the h-pawn. If White locks the position by playing 12.h4 himself, Black can paralyze White's pieces by offering the exchange with 12...Rd3. This rook cannot be captured because 13.Bxd3 is met with

Tripled isolated f-pawns should generally be avoided. However, in this case Black's open lines offer ample compensation against White's uncastled king.
10.Qb4
White attempts to generate queenside counterplay. Ironically, the safer course is to retreat his king to d1 and give up a pawn: 10...Bxf3 11.gxf3 Qxf3 12.Be2 blunts Black's attack.

It is finally time to take care of the rook.
17.c3 (D)
White's king is in a precarious position but he is hanging on. By attacking Black's knight, he hopes to secure the b5 square.

It is usually the defender who likes to trade queens. However, Black has correctly calculated that his attack will prove even stronger once White's only defender has been removed.

17.Qh5 (D)
White's king is better protected than Black's, because the h7-pawn is hard to defend. White's queen has inched its way to h5 (f2-g3-g4-h5) to target this weak pawn.
17...Qe8
Black plans to challenge White's queen by opening the h5-e8 diagonal with ...f7-f5. However, it is better to move the d4-knight away first, thus preventing White from trading on d4 and opening the d3-h7 diagonal.
18.Bxd4 exd4 19.Rf6!! (D)
After 11...e6 White finds an ingenious way to block the freeing move ...f7-f5. This rook cannot be taken because White will free his light-square bishop with 20.e5 and set up an unstoppable mate on h7.
19...Kg8 20.e5 h6
This defensive resource is available only because Black's bishop has remained on g7.
21.Ne2
White calmly moves his knight out of danger. Now if the attacked black knight moves from d6, White plays Qf5 and mate on h7 cannot be stopped. The rook on f6 paralyzes Black's defenses. 1-0 (C9) Shirazi - Weeramantry, New York 1988 [B09]

dxc3 10.gxf7+ Rxf7 11.Bc4 e6 (D) The position is complex and double-edged. White has sacrificed a piece for a powerful flank attack, but Black has actively countered in the center. White's best play at this point is to continue his kingside activity with 12.Ng5, attacking the rook and opening the d1-h5 diagonal for his queen.
12.Qxd6?!
White loses a valuable tempo by capturing Black's d6-pawn. This slows his queen down from getting over to the kingside.
12...Qb6
Black offers a queen trade while attacking b2 a second time.
13.Qd3?
White should capture on e6, allowing the trade, but shies away from it in the mistaken belief that his kingside attack will prevail.
13...cxb2 14.Bxb2 Qxb2 15.Ke2
White moves his king to protect his a1-rook, but refrains from castling as he needs the h1- rook to press his kingside attack. After 18.Radl (C9) Shirazi - Weeramantry 1988
15...Nc5
Black correctly calculates that White's threat of Qxh7+ is not dangerous and moves his knight into attacking position.
16.Qxh7+ Kf8
Both kings are vulnerable, but Black's king has better protection as his dark-square bishop protects key squares.
17.Nh4 Nc6 18.Rad1 (D)
White's rook occupies the open d-file, hoping to penetrate to d8 and create complications.
18...Nd4+
Black adopts a practical approach, blocking the d-file while attacking White's king.
19.Ke3 Qc3+ 20.Bd3
Black's double attack forces White to block the check with his bishop. Now that the d-file is no longer in play for White, Black seizes the initiative.

White chooses not to trade knights because he wants to keep Ng6+ in reserve.

After 24.Ng4 (C10) Krasenkow - Nakamura 2007 Both sides have completed their development. White has just played a discovered attack which appears to win material, as Black's queen, c6-rook, and e7-bishop are all under attack.
21...Qxf2+!!

White accepts the queen sacrifice because walking away with 22.Kh1 simply loses a piece to

15.exd4?!
There is no reason not to take the rook, after which White can maintain the balance.
15...Bc5!
Black is threatening to take the d4-pawn with check. If the bishop is captured, Black will recapture with his knight, attacking White's bishop and giving his queen access to d4.
16.Be2 (D)
After 19.Nxf8 (C11) Aronian - Anand 2013 White threatens to take the g4-knight, removing the threats against f2 and h2, but his move also blocks the queen from protecting f2. Instead, 16.dxc5 Nxc5 17.Nxf8 offers better chances. In this variation, 17.Be2 would be disastrous. Exercise C11-1: After 16.dxc5 Nxc5, show how Black would refute 17.Be2.
16...Nde5!
Fantastic! According to Anand, the sequence 16...Bxd4+ 17.Kh1 Nxh2 is refuted by 18.Ng5 preventing Black's queen from reaching h4.

Black prevents White's queen from invading his position and creating counterplay.

Black finds a clever tactic to disrupt the defense of h3 by White's queen. Such moves, known as "interference" moves, provide a powerful means to pursue an attack. The threat on h3 is renewed and White has no satisfactory defense. 0-1 (C12) Adhiban - Dreev, Wijk aan Zee 2016 [D45]

LESSON 9

PLAYING WITH A FULL DECK
aul Morphy is regarded as one of the greatest chess players in history. This memorable game was played at the American Chess Congress in 1857 at the beginning of his illustrious career. His opponent was Louis Paulsen, who was already established as a world-class player. In the game, Morphy seizes the opportunity to cripple Paulsen's pieces by taking absolute control of the center and preventing his opponent from coordinating his pieces effectively. This control ultimately translates into a decisive kingside attack.
L. PAULSEN - P. MORPHY
New York 1857
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 (D)
This is the Four Knights Game. There are three good moves for White in this position. However, 4.Bc4 is not one of them. Even though c4 is a natural developing square for the bishop, especially in double king-pawn openings, it does not work here. Question: Why isBc4 a bad move? Answer: Black's knight can take the e4-pawn. If White accepts the sacrifice, Black can regain the piece with ...d5. After 6-.,Bxd5 (4jg,c4 variation) After 6...d5 (4,jLc4 variation)
[diagram]
Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) That is correct. The key move is 4...Nxe4, a move that gives Black better control of the center in all variations. This is called the center fork trick. For example, after 4.Bc4 Nxe4 5.Nxe4 d5 6.Bxd5 Qxd5 (D), material is even, and Black has an established center pawn, while White does not. The presence of the center pawn is very important; it controls key squares and gives Black a space advantage. Black also has better mobility as both bishops have open diagonals and the queen is centralized. Alternatively, White could play 5.Bxf7+, electing to expose Black's king by sacrificing his bishop before capturing on e4. However, after 5... Kxf7 6.Nxe4 d5 (D), Black's powerful center more than compensates for losing his right to castle. Remember the center fork trick. While it does not win material, it does give you a powerful position. White chooses one of the three reliable moves. The others are 4.d4 and 4.g3.
4.Bb5 (D)
After 6.£jxe5 (5Jbcc6 variation)
[diagram]
Black's most popular reply here is 4...Bb4, which sets up a symmetrical position. If I fold the board in the center, all the opposing pieces will overlap, one on one. Symmetrical positions, if they stay that way, tend to lead to quiet games because they contain balanced pawn structures. On the other hand, assymetrical structures allow more pawn contact and thus create more dynamic play. An attempt by Black to create more active play is 4...Nd4, the Rubinstein Variation. I do not recommend this move to intermediate-level players because it moves the same piece twice in the opening. It is better to concentrate on normal piece development and to observe basic opening principles. Morphy chose a different move entirely.
4...Bc5
Question: How can White now win a pawn? Answer: 5.Bxc6 dxc6 6.Nxe5. (D) Question: Should White go for the pawn? Answer: No, because Black then has 6...Qd4, threatening both the knight and mate on f2. True, but after 6...Qd4, White can protect against both threats with 7.Nd3 (D). White would be in an awkward position because the knight on d3 blocks his d-pawn, but he would be holding on to his extra pawn. After 7.Nd3 (5JLxc6 variation) Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) Exercise 9-1: After 5.Bxc6 dxc6 6.Nxe5 Qd4 7.Nd3, if Black now tries to regain the pawn with 7...Nxe4, what will happen? Instead of 6...Qd4, Black can gain the advantage by first sacrificing the bishop: 6...Bxf2+
7.Kxf2 Qd4+ 8.Ke1 Qxe5. Black wins back the piece and also stops White from castling.
5.O-O
The better move for White appears to be the immediate 5.Nxe5.
5...O-O (D)
6.Nxe5
Question: Why is White taking a pawn that is defended? Answer: White now has the same center fork trick that we saw earlier for Black. You recognized it! Paulsen is trying the center fork trick on Morphy. It is important to recognize a pattern even when colors are reversed. If Black plays 6...Nxe5, White replies 7.d4 Bd6 8.f4!, getting his piece back with a strong center. Morphy has other ideas. Rather than take the time to capture the knight, he plays a move that furthers his development.
6...Re8 7.Nxc6 (D)
After 7/dxc6
[diagram]
After 8.Ac4 a b ed e t g h This plays into Black's hands. White should give the pawn back immediately with 7.Nf3 Nxe4. After 8.Nxe4 Rxe4 9.c3, White retains a slight advantage.
7...dxc6
This is the correct way to recapture. Question: Why is it better to take with the d-pawn? Answer: To open the d-file. You get more mobility and faster development. Question: True, but is there something else that should be noted about this move? Answer: The pawn is not capturing towards the center. Good. There is a general principle which states that pawns should capture towards the center. This helps strengthen the central pawn structure. However, there is an important lesson here: do not blindly follow general principles. There are often exceptions. Morphy recognizes that, in this position, it is more important to open up lines as quickly as possible.
8.Bc4 (D)
8.Be2 immediately would have been a better choice.
8...b5
8...Ng4 is an interesting alternative first suggested by the British chess historian Philip
Sergeant in 1916. The idea is to target f2 and h2 at the same time. The immediate threat is to Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) capture twice on f2, then pick up the c4-bishop with...Qd4+. White should counter with 9.g3, leading to a complex position. Exercise 9-2: If instead 8...Nxe4, find the best continuation for White.
9.Be2
White chooses e2 for his bishop, rather than b3, in order to add more defense to the kingside. Notice how Black's bishops are pointing toward White's king, the knight is eyeballing g4, the rook is on the e-file, and the queen is only one move away from joining the other attackers. Do you see that? White needs more resources to counter Black's pressure.
9...Nxe4
Now that White has strengthened his control of g4, Black takes back his pawn. Otherwise, White will simply protect it with d3.
10.Nxe4 Rxe4 (D)
An unusual picture. Although ten moves have been completed, it looks as though White has not made any moves. All of his pieces are still on the first two ranks. Question: How should White continue his development? Answer: Pawn to d3. A solid developing move. The simplest solutions are often the best.
11.Bf3 (D)
After
[diagram]
After 12x3?!
[diagram]
Question: White sets up a skewer. Where should Black move his rook? Answer: ...Re6, to protect the c6-pawn.
11...Re6
It is ironic that the bishop's attack forces Black's rook to a good square. Usually you do not get the chance to carry out a rook lift this early in the game, because rooks have trouble coming out safely with so many minor pieces still on the board. At the appropriate time, Black can swing this rook over to the g- or h-files to set up a direct attack on the king.
12.c3?! (D)
Question: Why does White play his pawn to c3? Answer: So he can play d4 next. Yes, this is White's plan. If he succeeds in extending his pawn chain to d4, he will take over the center. However, this move is too ambitious. White's priority should be to activate his c1- bishop with d3. In this position, the attempt to build the longer pawn chain is seriously flawed. Question: How does Black take advantage of White's inaccurate move? Answer: ...Qd3 stops the d-pawn from advancing. Excellent. We have already spoken about not spearheading an attack with the queen. Here, the queen's function is not one of attack; it is one of restriction. You may sometimes hear the After 12,"$d3 After 14.14?
[diagram]
Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) word prophylactic used to refer to a move like this. It is a move that is designed to prevent your opponent's intended move.
12...Qd3 (D)
This move is not a check. It is not a capture. It is not even attacking an unprotected piece, yet it is such a powerful move! It blocks the d-pawn, buries the c1-bishop, and paralyzes the queenside. Black's queen cannot easily be dislodged from d3, because Black is controlling the central light squares.
13.b4
Rather than playing on the queenside, White could have tried 13.Re1 seeking to free his position by trading rooks.
13....Bb6 14.a4? (D)
Continuing his queenside expansion, White threatens to trap Black's bishop with 15.a5. Again, it would be better to offer a trade of rooks with 14.Re1. White misses his last chance to challenge the center.
14...bxa4 15.Qxa4 (D)
After 15.Bxa4 After 16,Sa2? When you drive a wedge down the middle of the enemy position, his right and left flanks cannot communicate easily as the space available to shift pieces from one side of the board to the other is very narrow. Black's queen on d3 dominates this position. While White continues to expand, it is not happening in the center. Question: How should Black continue? Answer: 15...Rg6, pinning the g-pawn and threatening to capture the bishop. Not a bad move, but Morphy did not do that. The threat is too simple. There is a lesson you should learn from Morphy's games: a great attacker never attacks without getting all of his pieces out first.
15...Bd7
A simple developing move that gets the bishop out and frees the rook. However, it would have been better to play ...Bb7 to keep White's queen out of a6.
16.Ra2? (D)
What a strange square for the rook! White likely intends to challenge Black's queen with
17.Qc2. If so, he is taking far too long. He has just missed a great chance to drive Black's queen
out of d3 immediately with 16.Qa6. Question: How should Black continue? Answer: Double the rooks. After 17,Qa6 abcdefgn Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) Now you are playing like Morphy!
16...Rae8
I cannot stress this enough: attacks are much more successful with full development. Black's rooks are connected while White's are not. White is wishing that his a-rook had never left the back rank. Question: What is Black's threat? Answer: Sacrifice the queen with ...Qxf1+, and then ...Re1#. Excellent. This is aforcing sequence, and therefore clearer than playing ...Re1 first. Creating an escape square does not save White: h3 does not prevent ...Qxf1+, while g3 leaves the f3- bishop hanging.
17.Qa6 (D)
This is referred to as an X-ray defense. Like an X-ray passing through a body, its line of defense passes through an enemy piece to protect a square further along that line. Thus, White's queen on a6 is defending the f1-rook despite the presence of Black's queen on d3. Now 17...Qxf1+ 18.Qxf1 Re1 19.Bb2 is just a fancy trade. Question: Qd1 would also defend against mate. Why did White choose Qa6 instead? Answer: Because he wants to trade off queens. Yes. Qd1 does not break the bind. Unfortunately, Qa6 has come too late to be effective. This is the critical position. White is on the verge of driving Black's pieces back, but Morphy finds a brilliant move to keep his attack alive.
17...Qxf3!! (D)
After 19.&hl
[diagram]
A stunning and unexpected sacrifice! Black shatters White's castled position in one tremendous blow. When playing a destructive sacrifice, it is important to ensure there are sufficient resources remaining after the sacrifice to complete the attack.
18.gxf3 Rg6+ 19.Kh1 (D)
The concluding sequence of this combination contains a valuable lesson. When executing a mating attack, whenever possible, limit the movement of the defending king. Even though Morphy does miss a quicker win on two separate occasions, he does not let White's king slither out of the mating net. Question: How does Black continue the attack? Answer: Open the long diagonal with...c5. No, that is too slow. Remember, once you sacrifice material, it is important to pursue the attack actively and aggressively. You do not always have to capture or deliver check, but you must make moves that threaten. In order to justify a queen sacrifice, the threat must be powerful. It should be equal to or greater than the value of the sacrificed piece. Question: How can Black create a serious threat? Answer: ...Bh3. Question: That's the move. What is the threat? After ZO.Edl
[diagram]
Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) Answer: 20...Bg2+ 21.Kg1 Bxf3#. Good. That is the real threat - Black is not interested in capturing the f1-rook. He did not sacrifice his queen to win back an exchange.
19...Bh3 (D)
Attempts by White to avert mate by guarding critical squares or returning material will not work. Exercise 9-3: If White protects the g2 square with 20.Rg1, Black has two different ways to checkmate. Can you show them? Since the g2 square cannot be defended adequately, White could instead try removing a key attacker. He can afford to sacrifice the queen for the rook on g6 because he is ahead in material. Unfortunately, this attempt at defense also fails: 20.Qd3 would be met by 20...f5 re-establishing the original threat. Now 21.Qc4+ is met by 21...Kf8, after which White cannot defend against all threats. The only way for White to avert mate is to move the f1-rook and create an escape square for his king.
20.Rd1 (D)
Black now initiates a forcing sequence.
20...Bg2+ 21.Kg1 Bxf3+ 22.Kf1 (D)
22...Bg2+
Exercise 9-4: Find a quicker win for Black after 22.Kf1.
23.Kg1
Now that the f3-pawn is no longer there, Black has another chance to close out the game with 23...Be4+ 24.Kf1 Bf5!, threatening an unstoppable mate. This line provides an excellent illustration of the concept of redeployment. Black brings his bishop back along the h1-a8 diagonal to keep White's king out of h1. He then switches to a different diagonal to attack from another angle and force mate. White has no defense (25.Qe2 Bh3+ 26.Ke1 Rg1#).
23...Bh3+ 24.Kh1 Bxf2 (D)
In return for the sacrificed queen, look at the havoc Morphy is causing with his rooks and bishops! Even a cursory glance at the board shows that White's poor king has been abandoned by his army. Black's pieces are all working together in harmony and are moving in for the kill. Question: What is Black threatening? Answer: ...Bg2#. There is only one way to stop it. White has to give back the queen.
25.Qf1 Bxf1 26.Rxf1
After 26..,Re2
[diagram]
After 28...Ne3 Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) The smoke has cleared. Black is up two pawns and retains the attacking position. White's king is still in a mating net. Question: What should Black do next? Answer: 26...Re1, forcing a trade of rooks. Exchanging when ahead in material is often the winning technique, but is not always the best option. Sometimes you can win more efficiently by retaining more active pieces. Black's rooks are clearly more active. The best plan in this position is for the e8-rook to penetrate to the seventh rank.
26...Re2 (D)
A rook on the seventh rank traps a king that is on its back rank. This game is now over.
27.Ra1 Rh6 28.d4 Be3 (D) 0-1
White can no longer stop checkmate, for instance 29.Bxe3 Rhxh2+ 30.Kg1 Reg2#. It is amazing to see that, after 28 moves, White's c1-bishop is still sitting on its starting square! After 8...Nxe4 (variation)

Exercise 9-3: If White protects the g2 square with 20.Rg1, Black has two different ways to checkmate. Can you show them? (D) Answer: 1) The simplest sequence is20...Rxg1+ 21.Kxg1 Re1+ 22.Qf1 Rxf1#; 2) There is a more complex pattern which leads to mate: 20...Bg2+ 21.Rxg2 Re1+ 22.Rg1 Rexg1#. If we were to change the position in the diagram by removing the f2-pawn and the b6- bishop, Black would have to employ the second of these patterns; 20...Rxg1+ would not work because White would have an escape square on f2. It is important to learn a variety of mating patterns; they will give you the ability to close out a game successfully. Exercise 9-4: Find a quicker win for Black after 22.Kf1. (D) Answer: 22...Rg2 23.Qd3 Rxf2+ 24.Kg1 Rg2+ 25.Kf1 (or Kh1) 25...Rg1#. Perfect coordination of rooks and bishops!

A great attacker never attacks without getting all of his pieces out first. When executing amating attack, whenever possible, limit the movement of the defending king. Once you sacrifice material, pursue the attack actively and aggressively. In order to justify a queen sacrifice, the threat must be powerful. It should be equal to or greater than the value of the sacrificed piece. Sometimes you can win more efficiently by retaining the more active piece.

THREE FOR THE LADY
n important chess concept ismaterial imbalance. Some examples are rook and pawn versus bishop and knight, or (as in the following game) three minor pieces versus a queen. In both scenarios, the point count is even, but one must consider the relative values of all the pieces involved. This judgment may change at different stages of the game.
S. WEERAMANTRY - M. SCHLAGENHAUF
Harrisburg (Pennsylvania), 1977
1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 (D)
Question: We have already discussed the Pirc Austrian Attack formation with 4.f4.6 What are some other systems that White can employ against the Pirc? Answer: 4.Nf3. The Classical System. This is the most solid formation for White, quite unlike the unbridled aggression of the Austrian Attack. White is content with a modest two-pawn center (e4, d4). He places his knights on c3 and f3, his light-square bishop on e2, and castles kingside: 4...Bg7 5.Be2
O-O 6.O-O. (D)
After 6.O-O (4.?rf3 variation) After 5.Ne3 (4.f3 variation)
[diagram]
This system is a favorite of conservative players who prefer a quiet opening. Question: What other systems can White use? Answer: Be3 and Qd2 to attack the fianchettoed bishop. The Be3/Qd2 battery is a popular attacking formation against Black's fianchettoed bishop on g7. If White wishes to employ this setup, he must play f2-f3 before bringing his bishop to e3. Otherwise Black could harass the bishop with ...Ng4. After the moves 4.f3 Bg7 5.Be3 (D), Black should hold off castling in favor of immediate queenside expansion. If not, he will be subjected to a dangerous attack similar to the St. George (or Yugoslav) Attack against the Sicilian Dragon. Black has less counterplay than in the Sicilian because the c-file is closed. His best play at this point is5...c6 6.Qd2 b5 with a complex game. I chose a less popular but equally aggressive line.
4.Bc4 Bg7 5.Qe2 (D)
Question: This is an unusual move. Why does White play Qe2 ? (D) What is going on here? After 5?Ne2 After 8 h8 (5...00 variation)
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Schlagenhauf 1977 (Pirc Defense) Answer: I think White wants to push the e-pawn. Very good. There is no other reason for Qe2 except to support the advance of the e-pawn. The intent is to push the pawn to e5 without allowing a queen trade on dl should Black exchange pawns on e5. This idea works particularly well against players who blindly follow the first five moves of the Pirc formation and castle as a matter of course. Qe2 allows White to continue advancing the pawn with e6, driving a wedge into the heart of Black's position. Let me show you briefly what could happen. Iwon a sharp game against 5...O-O at the 1978 Chess Olympiad in Buenos Aires, where I played first board for Sri Lanka, my native country. This game was one of the shortest in the entire Olympiad - it lasted only twelve moves! My opponent was National Master Miguel Clua Ballague who was playing board one for Andorra. The game continued 6.e5 Nfd7 7.e6 fxe6 8.Bxe6+ (not 8.Qxe6+ as Black can free himself later with a counterattack on the queen) 8...Kh8. (D) Question: White has destroyed part of Black's kingside pawn structure. How can he destroy the rest of it? Answer: Play pawn to h4. That is what I played, but 9.Nf3 is stronger. In our game, Black did not find the best defense and collapsed quickly. After 9.h4 Nc6 10.h5, my idea was to play hxg6 and open the h-file. At the time, neither of us realized that Black could have avoided this with 10...g5!. The game continued with 10...Nxd4? 11.hxg6. Clearly, Black cannot capture White's queen with 11...Nxe2, as 12.Rxh7 is mate. Black had anticipated this line and put his faith in 11...Nf6 After 13.W15 (5.,.O-O variation1
[diagram]
After 5 .Qc6
[diagram]
to defend h7. Unfortunately for him, White continued with 12.Rxh7+ regardless. Black resigned because 12...Nxh7 would be met by 13.Qh5. (D) Black can delay mate by giving away several of his pieces, but in the end mate is unstoppable. Let us return to the original game. Black plays one of the two moves that are generally recommended.
5...Nc6 (D)
Black attacks the d4-pawn. This is the most challenging move against Qe2. The other move is 5...c6, when after 6.e5 dxe5 7.dxe5 Nd5 8.Bd2 White still enjoys a slight advantage. Question: After ...Nc6, what is White's best move? Answer: d5. Does that really make sense? You just put your bishop on c4. Why? To attack f7, right? Why do you then want to play d5 ? You are pushing apawn for no other reason than to attack a piece. The long-term consequence of this move is you shut your bishop out of the game. Before making such a move, ask yourself, "Where can the piece go?" If it can move to a better square, a centralized square, do not attack it. In this position, the knight has a good square on e5, so you do not want to attack it. Answer: Nf3. After 6...€jxd4
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Schlagenhauf 1977 (Pirc Defense) Yes, this is perhaps the most natural developing move, but Black has a strong reply in
6...Bg4. After 7.Be3 e5, Black would stop White's intended expansion and establish equality in
the center. Question: Is there a more aggressive sixth move for White? Answer: Attack the knight with e5. Good. That is the most aggressive move, and is precisely what White intended when playing Qe2.
6.e5
White attacks Black's f6-knight.
6...Nxd4 (D)
Rather than moving this knight to a safe square, such as g4 or d7, Black takes the d-pawn and counterattacks White's queen. Question: How does White continue? Answer: Ignore the attack on the queen and keep on capturing. Yes!
7.exf6
This move brings about a wild series of captures leading to an unusual material imbalance. This is a line I like to play as it involves giving up the queen for active play.
7...Nxe2
Black takes the queen.
8.fxg7 Rg8 9.Ngxe2
White has obtained three minor pieces for the queen. The point value is the same, 9 points for 9 points.
9...Rxg7 (D)
After 9...Sxg7
[diagram]
After 11.O-O-O
[diagram]
Black removes the g7-pawn because it could become a real annoyance later. At the same time, he picks up a second pawn.
10.Bh6
White needs to complete his development quickly. The bishop move gains a valuable tempo.
10...Rg8
Question: What must White do to complete his development? Answer: Castle queenside. Right. You want that rook on d1.
11.O-O-O (D)
The smoke has cleared and it is time to take stock of the position. Question: Which side do you prefer, and why? Answer: I like Black. He has two extra pawns to go along with his queen. Answer: I prefer White. His pieces are more active. Black's rooks are out of the game. There is no definitive answer. The first reaction most people have is to favor the queen. After all, it is the most powerful piece. On the other hand, three minor pieces could run rings around the queen so long as they are well coordinated. One problem is that White cannot anchor these pieces on strong central squares, as Black's pawns can chase them away. If Black succeeds in getting his king out of the center by castling long, itwill allow him to centralize his rooks. Then After 11.. .c6 After 13...Nf5?
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Schlagenhauf 1977 (Pirc Defense) the rooks will support an avalanche of center pawns, forcing White's minor pieces to retreat in total confusion. White's current edge in development gives him the initiative, but the initiative is not apermanent advantage - it does not last forever.
11...c6 (D)
Black gets ready to castle long and makes a little extra space for the queen. This move also takes away an important central square from White's minor pieces.
12.Rhe1 Qc7 13.Nd4
White's knight inches closer to Black's king. All of White's pieces are now within striking range.
13...Bf5? (D)
Black is anxious to castle and moves his bishop to clear the way. This is a mistake. The correct defense is extremely difficult for a human to find. Black should play 13...d5, and if White chooses to sacrifice his bishop with 14.Bxd5, he must not recapture: 14...cxd5? 15.Nxd5 Qd6 16.Nb5 with a crushing attack. Instead 14...g5, threatening to trap the h6-bishop with ...Rg6, lets Black maintain the balance. Without question, this is the critical position. Black is now one move away from castling. If he succeeds, he will take over the initiative. Ifelt that the weakness of the f7-pawn would buy me more time to develop my attack. However, Black's king can reach safety if he is willing to give back a little material. My instinct was that now was the right moment to strike, and I kept After 14. db5 searching for a way to break into Black's position. The winning idea hit me like a bolt from the blue! I blinked and looked again, amazed that I was staring at a forced win. Question: What is the move that, after ...Bf5, launches the winning plan? Answer: Bg5, threatening the e7-pawn. You have identified a good point of attack. Losing the e7-pawn would cause Black's defenses to crumble. Moving this pawn opens the diagonal to d8, thus preventing him from castling. Exercise 10-1: If Black meets 14.Bg5 with 14...e6, how should White proceed? So Bg5 works, but there is something more direct, more forceful, and definitely more convincing. Answer: Nd5, sacrificing a knight. Definitely direct and forceful, but is it any good? After 14...cxd5 15.Bxd5, Black seizes the initiative with 15...Qc5. Answer: Wait! After 14...cxd5, 15.Nb5 is better. Then if 15...Qxc4, White wins back the queen and comes out a piece ahead with 16.Nxd6+ Kd7 17.Nxc4. That is clever. Unfortunately, Black can refuse the second sacrifice and play 15...Qd7 instead. Sacrifices that involve non-forcing moves are difficult to calculate because they allow your opponent a wide choice of replies. A defender is not compelled to accept every piece he is offered. After 15...Qd7, White has little to show for the sacrificed knight. 14.Nd5 is incorrect. Both of your answers have focused on attacking the pawn on e7. Look for another point of attack; e7 is not the only vulnerable square. Answer: 14.Ndb5. Yes!
14.Ndb5! (D)
Using a different knight sacrifice wins by force! Now that the d-file is clear, White has a powerful attack against d6. Now we will see pins, forks, skewers, and discovered checks all rolled into one mouth-watering combination.
14...cxb5 15.Nxb5 Qb6 16.Nxd6+
After 19.Sd6+ Weeramantry - Schlagenhauf 1977 (Pirc Defense) The knight cannot be captured because the e7-pawn is pinned.
16...Kd8 17.Nxf5+
Now that Black's king has been forced to the d-file, White takes the bishop with a discovered check.
17...Kc7 18.Rxe7+ (D)
This is the third consecutive capture with check. This is the position I visualized when I played 14.Ndb5!. I did not analyze any further because I judged this as a winning position. Visualizing a sequence of moves is not as difficult as it seems. Your ability will improve with practice. Remember to pay particular attention to pieces that have been captured and to pieces that have changed position. Exercise 10-2: If Black retreats his king with 18...Kb8, what is White's best continuation?
18...Kc6 19.Rd6+ (D)
The rook skewers the king and queen. Black's king is forced to march further up the board.
19...Kc5 20.Re5+
After some thought, I opted to pursue a mating attack rather than winning back the queen. It is unusual to see elements of a ladder-mate pattern with so many pieces still on the board. Realizing that his position was hopeless, Black resigned. 1-0 Exercise 10-3: After 20.Re5+, checkmate is forced. Can you find the mating sequence after
20...Kxc4 and after 20...Kb4 ?
What is striking about this game is that Black did not appear to be in imminent danger. Suddenly there was this one little knight move and the entire position exploded. This shows how powerful three well-coordinated minor pieces can be against a queen. After 14...e6 (14.Ag5 variation) After 18.Rf6+ (14dLg5 variation)

18.Rf6+. (D)
Black cannot save himself despite having more material. For example: 1) 18...Kg7 19.Rfxd6 Kf8 20.Ne4 Re8 21.f3. White's minor pieces are stronger than Black's rooks. 2) 18...Ke8 19.Re1+ Kd7 20.Rf7+ Kc8 21.Rxc7+ Kxc7 22.Re7+ with a winning position. Exercise 10-2: If Black retreats his king with 18...Kb8, what is White's best continuation? (D) After 18*..Nb8 (variation) Answer: If 18...Kb8, White has a forced mate in six moves with 19.Bf4+ Kc8 20.Rxf7 gxf5
21.Be6+ Qxe6 22.Rc7+ Kb8 23.Rc3+ Qd6 24.Bxd6#.
Exercise 10-3: After 20.Re5+, mate is forced. Can you find the mating sequence after 20...Kxc4 and after 20...Kb4 ? (D) Answer: 1) 20...Kxc4 is met with 21.b3+ Kb4 22.Kb2 - a "quiet move" that seals Black's fate:
22...Qc5 23.Bd2+ Kb5 24.Nd4#.
2) 20...Kb4 is met with 21.Bd2+ Ka4 22.Bb3+ Qxb3. (D) Whichever pawn captures the queen, it is mate in one move: 23.axb3# (or 23.cxb3#). There is also an esthetic mate with 23.Ra5, eschewing the queen capture. Weeramantry - Schlagenhauf 1977 (Pirc Defense)
REVIEW
Themes Systems against the Pirc (discussion after 3...g6). Material imbalances and compensation (6.e5; discussion after 11.O-O-O). Pawn roller as an offensive weapon (11.O-O-O). Disadvantage of too many pawns (11.O-O-O). Temporary nature of the initiative (11.O-O-O; discussion after 13... Bf5). Pins, forks, and discovered checks (14.Ndb5). Advice Do not chase a knight with a center pawn if the knight can go to a better central square. Minor pieces are effective against the queen when they are coordinated. Pawns are an asset when they can drive your opponent's pieces back or control key squares. They are a liability when they inhibit your development. To strengthen an attack, bring in a new piece, preferably with check. The initiative is a temporary advantage. Do not waste it. Remember, not every sacrifice must be accepted. __________

better pawn structure can give you a lasting initiative and dictate the course of action. In this game, once his pawns are doubled on the g-file, Black's kingside pawns lose their flexibility. White's control of the ...e7-e5 break makes it impossible for his kingside initiative to be challenged and makes the flank attack more powerful. The outcome of this game, played against National Master Larry Tamarkin, is a reminder that chess is not just a cerebral activity, but a sporting contest as well. Iwas in a clearly winning position, but drifted into time pressure and lost on time.

This is the Exchange Variation of the Caro-Kann. There are many different variations, but you do not need to study them all just yet. You need only one line against each opening. You can always add others later.
4.Bd3 (D)
White positions his bishop on the long diagonal to h7, with an eye towards a future kingside attack. White's queen and bishop now control g4 and f5 respectively, taking away the natural After 6.Nf4 Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann) developing squares from Black's light-square bishop.
4...Nc6
Question: What is the obvious threat? Answer: To take the pawn on d4. Question: Of course. There is also a less obvious threat. What is that? Answer: Play ...Nb4 and trade the knight for White's bishop. Good. Black would love to trade off this powerful bishop. Question: Does White have a move to handle both threats? Answer: Push his pawn to c3. Correct. This builds a pawn chain and stops ...Nb4. Question: Now that we have seen the strength of c3, is there any disadvantage to this move? Answer: Yes. It takes away the c3 square from White's knight. Right. However, the positive outweighs the negative. Moves are seldom totally good or totally bad. You have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages.
5.c3 Nf6 6.Bf4 (D)
White prevents the ...e7-e5 break. Question: A general opening principle states: develop knights before bishops. Can you think of any reason why this principle is widely followed? Answer: Knights are short-range pieces, so they should be moved out early. Is it not true that you would get the knights out soon enough even if you took an extra move or two to first develop the bishops? Answer: Knights can attack center pawns. Bishops cannot. I must admit, I never thought of it that way. I suppose a bishop would have trouble attacking acenter pawn without getting captured itself! However, that is not the reason for the principle. There is one logical square for each knight in the opening - on the third rank and towards the center. Other squares are less desirable. The reason for the principle "knights before bishops" is that it is generally clear where the knight should go. It is not always clear which square is best for a bishop - it has more choices. Therefore, it would make more sense to wait and see how your opponent develops his pieces before deciding where to place your bishop. In playing Bf4, White is clearly violating this principle. Do not take any principles for granted. Examine each and every position on its own merits. There are two words that you should be wary of - one is ALWAYS, and the other is NEVER. Knowing when a principle does not apply is the mark of a good player. Here the justification for moving the dark-square bishop before either knight is quite clear.
6.Nd2 would simply block in that bishop which is needed to guard e5. The immediate 6.Nf3
would also not be successful as it allows Black to set up an annoying pin with ...Bg4.
6...Bg4 (D)
Black decides to play ...Bg4 anyway, in order to attack White's queen. An interesting alternative is to fianchetto the king's bishop with 6...g6 and 7...Bg7. Question: Blocking the attack on his queen with Nf3 would clearly ruin White's earlier strategy. How else can he handle the attack? Answer: Be2. No. There is no logic behind this move. Question: There is one overpowering reason why White should not play Be2. What is it? Answer: You have already developed the bishop to d3. Why move it back? Exactly. This bishop is on a great square. Do not retreat a developed piece without good reason. Question: Give me another suggestion that handles Black's attack. Answer: f3. Question: There is a drawback to this move. What is it? Answer: It takes the f3 square away from the knight. Question: Yes. Can you find a better move? After 10.Se5 (7".Qd7 variation) Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann) Answer: Qc2. Question: The queen-and-bishop battery on the long diagonal is strong. However, there is an even better move. What is it? Answer: Qb3. Finally!
7.Qb3 (D)
7.Qb3 seizes the initiative by threatening the b7-pawn. This is the square that was weakened
when Black's bishop went to g4 on the previous move. Black cannot ignore this attack. Question: How should Black handle the attack on the b7-pawn? Answer: Push it up to b6. No. That weakens the light squares unnecessarily. Answer: Defend it with ...Qd7. This is quite playable. However, Black has to be careful not to fall into a trap: 7...Qd7 8.Nd2 e6 9.Ngf3 Be7 (9...Bd6 is better) 10.Ne5. (D) Question: Now, should Black capture the knight or retreat his queen? Answer: Take the knight. Oops. You just fell into the trap. Exercise 11-1a: After 7...Qd7 8.Nd2 e6 9.Ngf3 Be7 10.Ne5 Nxe5, what is the trap that Black has fallen into? Exercise 11-1b: What should Black do instead? Back to the game. Defending the b7-pawn with the queen is the right idea, but not from d7.
7...Qc8 (D)
Question: Can you guess the next few moves for each side? Answer: White should bring out both knights and then castle. Black should play...e6 and ...Be7. Isn't this simple? Both sides are making natural developing moves. Chess is easy when you pay attention to the fundamentals! Your answer is exactly how the game proceeded:
8.Nd2 e6 9.Ngf3 Be7 10.O-O
To this point, both Tamarkin and I have been following a well-trodden path. The nature of chess competition has changed dramatically over the years. A sound knowledge of opening theory is essential if you are to succeed at the master level in modern tournament play. Much of the work is done before ever coming to the board.
10...Bh5 (D)
After 12.Ne5 (10...O-O variation) Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann) The idea behind playing ...Bh5 is to play ...Bg6 and neutralize White's pressure along the b1- h7 diagonal. Castling before playing ...Bh5 is less effective: 10...O-O 11.Qc2 Bh5 12.Ne5. (D) Taking the knight now would cost Black a pawn: 12...Nxe5 13.dxe5 Nd7 14.Bxh7+. With White's knight on e5, opposing bishops with 12... Bg6 will allow White to trade knight for bishop, rather than exchanging bishops. By playing ...Bh5 before castling, Black threatens to place his bishop on g6 before White plays Ne5. Should White attempt to rush Ne5, he would be saddled with an inferior pawn structure:
10...O-O 11.Ne5 Nxe5 12.dxe5 Nd7. (D)
Black now has c5 available for his knight, and he can still oppose bishops with ...Bh5-g6. Small differences in move order can have a profound effect on a position.
11.Qc2 Bg6 12.Bxg6 (D)
After 12...fxg6 (variation)
[diagram]
The trade of bishops cannot be avoided. White prefers to initiate the bishop trade in order to double Black's pawns. Question: Which way should Black recapture and why? Answer: With the h-pawn, to give the rook an open file. Question: Good. What about the other option? Answer: Capturing with the f-pawn will break up Black's pawn structure and leave him with a backward pawn on e6. Yes. It is a question of pawn structure. (D) Every time pawns break up into small groups, we refer to each group as a pawn island. The more pawn islands there are, the weaker the pawn structure. Certain squares become difficult to defend. If Black recaptures with the f-pawn, his pawns will break up into three islands. The base of the pawn chain will shift from f7 to e6, making the e6-pawn backward and vulnerable because it is situated on White's half-open e-file. On the other hand, ifBlack recaptures with the h-pawn, then f7 provides a solid foundation for the entire structure.
12...hxg6 13.Rae1 (D)
After 13.aael
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann) Question: Why should White play Rae1 when he could just as easily move the other rook over? How do you decide which rook to activate when there is only one open file? Answer: The a1-rook is not doing anything on the other side of the board. Question: True, but what about the other rook? Is it any better on f1? How is this rook going to participate in the game? Answer: You could double rooks on the e-file. If your intention is to double rooks, it makes no difference which rook you move first. Furthermore, doubling rooks is most effective when targeting a backward pawn. Doubling in this position is the wrong strategy because there is no target. Question: When I played 13.Rae1, I already had a plan for activating the f1-rook. What was my plan? Answer: To move your bishop and knight out of the way, and push the f-pawn. Excellent! Imagine for a moment that the bishop and knight have moved off the f-file and I have advanced my pawn to f4. Both rooks are now active. In the early middlegame, rooks belong on open files or behind advancing pawns.
13...O-O (D)
Now the opening is over. Both sides are fully developed. At this stage of the game, finding the appropriate long-term plan is critical. Plans do not just appear out of thin air - the pawn structure dictates the plan. Connect-the-dots The pawns establish the boundary of your territory. Your entire middlegame plan can be based upon how these boundaries are drawn. To illustrate this, let's play connect-the-dots. If these dots represent the pawns, you can see the board is divided into two triangles. White's pawn chain is pointing towards the kingside and he is clearly controlling more space in that sector. It will be difficult for Black to challenge this superiority without bringing more pieces over from his queenside. However, Black's pawn structure makes this difficult because the pawn on e6 restricts the flow from one side to the other. He has a very narrow funnel to move his pieces through. Build your attack in the sector where you have more space. If you understand this structure, you will appreciate that White has a natural kingside attack with a high probability of success. You will also realize the importance of preventing the move ...e6-e5. If Black cannot advance his pawn to e5, he will be unable to free his position. Look at the pieces White has concentrated on that square - a pawn, a rook, a knight, and a bishop. Black's pawn is not going anywhere! A remarkable feature about this position is that not one of Black's five kingside pawns can move without serious consequences. The g6-pawn cannot move without endangering the king; the pawn behind it cannot move at all; the e6-pawn is frozen in its tracks; the d5-pawn is blockaded; and if the f7-pawn moves, the entire kingside pawn structure will collapse! Once you determine that the pawn structure is not going to change, you can organize your attack more effectively. A methodical approach is essential. Start with a concept, then consider specifics. The danger of not following this order is that you will make random moves, and never put together an organized attack. First, decide which squares your pieces should occupy in order to maximize their attacking potential. Second, determine how to get your pieces to the ideal squares. Next, establish whether or not your opponent can prevent your pieces from reaching the preferred destinations. Finally, consider whether or not your opponent can ignore your plan completely and launch a counterattack of his own. If you think through these four steps and are satisfied that your ideas are valid, then go ahead with your plan. After 13...O-O
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann) Now, let's apply this process to the game position. (D) Step One... Question: Where should White place his pieces for an attack on the king? Answer: I like one knight on g5, and the other on f3. Question: That certainly brings the knights into the attack. What about the other pieces? Answer: I like a rook on h3 and the queen on h4, threatening mate on h8. Excellent. Even if this does not lead to mate, an invasion on the h-file will present many problems for Black. Question: How about the pawns? Will they be used in the attack? Answer: No. Do not push the h-pawn. It will only block the file for the queen and rook. Good. The h-file must be kept clear. What about the other kingside pawns? We have already noted that f4 is a desirable move. It not only frees the f1-rook, but also helps to control the e5 square. As for the g2-pawn, it could go to g4 to keep Black's knight out of h5. Step Two... Question: Do our pieces have a clear path to these squares? Answer: Yes. The f3-knight can go directly to g5 and the d2-knight can then go to f3. Answer: The e1-rook can go to e3, then h3. Answer: The queen can go to d3, then g3, then h4. Excellent. And we can play f4 once we move the bishop. That was easy! Step Three - can Black stop these moves? Obviously, he can try to keep the knight out of g5 by playing ...f6, but that would destroy his kingside pawn structure. He cannot prevent the d2-knight from going to f3. And, there is no reasonable way for him to attack the squares the rook will be using. That just leaves the queen. Question: Can Black stop the queen from occupying h4? Answer. Yes, because his bishop on e7 can attack h4. Question: True. Can we counter that? After 14...£sh5 Answer: Yes. That's why we want our knight on g5. Actually, the knight would be very useful on e5. We could put our bishop on g5 instead, and set up a trade of bishops to secure h4 for the queen. A key feature of this position is that Black's kingside pawn structure is fixed, thus closing the center. As a result, White's plan to move his pieces over to the flank cannot easily be disrupted. Finally, Step Four. Question: Can Black ignore White's plans and mount his own attack? Answer: Yes. He may be able to attack down the c-file. Thank you! This is his half-open file which is the logical place to look for play. Question: Which pieces are sitting on that file? Answer: The two opposing queens. Question: Right. If you see that, you will notice a tactic Black could use. Answer: He can play ...Nxd4 if White moves his f3-knight. Do you see the value of using this process? You need to follow all these steps. It is not enough to focus on your moves alone. When you play chess, you are playing two games in your head: the moves you can make, and the moves your opponent can make. Failing to anticipate your opponent's counterplay will ruin your own plans.
14.Qd3
White moves his queen off the c-file and inches it towards h4.
14...Nh5 (D)
Black is playing on the kingside, but this is not a good strategy. White's attack is too strong. Instead, Black should consider moving his f-rook away to create an escape route for his king. It is very hard to plan an active defense because Black's kingside pawns cannot move. In similar positions, acommon strategy is to expand on the queenside with ...b7-b5, ...a7- a5, and ...b5-b4, then initiate a trade of pawns on c3. This trade would saddle White with a backward pawn, which would then become a target for Black. This strategy is called a minority attack - two pawns are attacking three. Here, unfortunately, such a plan would be too slow compared to White's direct assault on the king. After 15±g5
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann)
15.Bg5 (D)
White moves his bishop out of danger and offers a trade of bishops. Should Black accept, White would recapture with his knight, paving the way for the pawn to advance to f4.
15...Qd8
Black sets up a battery attacking the bishop. Question: How should White handle the attack without changing his plan? Answer: Capture the bishop. No. It is better to support the bishop with Qe3 and let Black make the trade.
16.Qe3 Bxg5 17.Nxg5 (D)
White recaptures with his knight. By having Black initiate the trade, White has gained a tempo. Meanwhile, his queen keeps inching towards h4.
17...Qf6?
A careless move. Black probably intended 18...Qf4 to set up a queen trade, hoping to turn back the attack.
18.f4 (D)
After 18,f4 After 19.g4 Finally! So much for ...Qf4. White's pawns on d4 and f4 now have a stranglehold on the e5 square. With the center firmly under control, White's flank attack will be more difficult to repel. Question: What is the immediate threat? Answer: g4, trapping the knight. Yes. The only way to save it is to move the queen, creating a retreat for the knight.
18...Qe7 19.g4 (D)
This move appears to violate another important principle, in this case a middlegame principle: do not push the pawns in front of your castled king. Question: Under what circumstances might you be justified in ignoring this principle? Answer: When your opponent has no counterplay against your king. Question: Correct. But what would stop your opponent's counterplay? Answer: A closed center. Exactly. When the center is fluid, do not move the pawns in front of your castled king. When the center is closed, they are free to move.
19...Nf6 20.Qh3 Rfc8 (D)
After Z0,..Rfc8 After 21...Sd6 Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann) Black intends to run his king to f8 and block a back-rank check with ...Ng8.
21.Rf3
The f-rook is heading to the h-file. Using the e-rook would have been more accurate so that the f4-pawn would remain protected.
21...Qd6 (D)
This is where I lost the game. I took fifteen minutes to make my next move, even though the time control was game in thirty! There really was no need to spend so much time, because I had already seen a beautiful combination. Question: Do you see it? Answer: The queen checks on h8, setting up a knight fork on f7. Absolutely correct. Isn't this a pretty move? How many chances do you get to stick your queen right in front of the enemy king? This is an example of a magnet combination attracting Black's king into a fork. There was no need to look for something better, because this move leads to the win of a pawn and destroys Black's kingside pawn structure. Unfortunately, I was reluctant to trade queens and kept searching for a checkmate.
22.Qh8+ Kxh8 23.Nxf7+ Kg8 24.Nxd6 (D)
After 24.Nxd6 White is ahead in material and has the superior pawn structure.
24...Rc7 25.Rxe6 Rf8
Black decided not to take the g4-pawn because White would reply with Rg3, skewering the knight to the g6-pawn.
26.h3 (D)
White is up two pawns and should win easily. He simply has to consolidate by doubling his rooks and improving the position of his other knight. The wasted time on move 22 left me with only moments on the clock and we were playing without a delay. I did manage to make ten or more additional moves from this position, but my opponent hung on three pawns down in the endgame, and my flag fell! After this unhappy experience, I can give you the following advice: If you see a position where you are clearly winning, there is no need to search for the perfect move. After 10...Qxe5? (7,..Bd7 variation) Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann)
ANSWERS
Exercise 11-1a: After 7...Qd7 8.Nd2 e6 9.Ngf3 Be7 10.Ne5 Nxe5? (D), what is the trap that Black has fallen into? Answer: 11.dxe5 wins material. Black's knight is under attack, but should it take the time to move away, 12.Bb5 would pin Black's queen to his king. Exercise 11-1b: What should Black do instead? Answer: Instead of 10...Nxe5, Black can survive by retreating his queen with 10...Qc8. This loses time, but at least it does not cost him any material.

You have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages. There are two words that you should be wary of - one is ALWAYS, and the other is
NEVER.
Do not retreat a developed piece without good reason. Small differences in move order can have a profound effect on a position. The more pawn islands there are, the weaker the pawn structure. In the early middlegame, rooks belong on open files or behind advancing pawns. Build your attack in the sector where you have more space. Start with a concept, then consider specifics. Failing to anticipate your opponent's counterplay will ruin your own plans. When the center is fluid, do not move the pawns in front of your castled king. When the center is closed, they are free to move. If you see a position where you are clearly winning, there is no need to search for the perfect move.

LESSON 12
[diagram]
IT'S NEVER OVER
ou may tend to think of drawn games as dull games, but this is not always the case. Iam going to show you a game I drew that was far from dull. It is a good example of "chess as a struggle." The initiative shifts back and forth between myself and my opponent, National Master Juan Carlos Urbaneja Navarro, a leading player from Venezuela.
WEERAMANTRY - URBANEJA
New York, 1991
1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4
Another Grand Prix Attack. We first looked at this opening in Lesson 7 in my game against Mitchell Goldberg. Do you know how this opening got its name? It was used frequently by British players in the Cutty Sark Grand Prix tournaments in England in the 1970s. The inspiration, however, were the games of the Danish GM Bent Larsen in the 1960s, but he liked to play f2-f4 on move 2.
3...g6
The fianchetto formation is a popular alternative to 3...e6.7
4.Nf3 (D)
After 4".e6 (variation) After 7.Qxd4 (4...e6 variation) A common mistake in this position is for Black to reply with 4...e6. (D) Question: Why is 4...e6 a mistake? You do not have to look for an exact sequence. Think back to previous lectures and give me a general answer. Answer: It leaves holes on the dark squares. Good. I am glad you remembered about color weaknesses. By playing both ...e7-e6 and ...g7- g6, Black opens up two diagonals, but has only one dark-square bishop. He is creating weaknesses that cannot be controlled. As the game goes on, and Black gets better piece development, he may be able to cover some of the weak squares with other pieces. At this stage of the game, however, he is not in a position to do that. Question: How do you prove that 4...e6 is bad? Answer: Play 5.d4 cxd4 6.Nxd4 Nxd4 7.Qxd4 (D), preventing Black's bishop from going to g7. Your analysis is correct. In order to take advantage of weaknesses like this, you must open the position, and thus be able to target the dark squares. Instead of trading knights, Black would do better to play 6... Bg7. (D) After 7.Ndb5 (4...e6 variation) Weeramantry - Urbaneja 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Question: How should White proceed? Answer: Push e5. That will help White control the dark squares. Good. e5 is definitely part of White's plan, but there is a more important move to be played first. Answer: Be3. This is a good developing move, but is too passive. Look for a more active move. Answer: Play Ndb5. (D) Yes! 7.Ndb5 is much stronger than 7.Be3. With Black's bishop already committed to the other diagonal, he cannot stop White's knight from jumping into d6. Then e5 makes a lot more sense because it anchors the knight on an advanced outpost square. Occupying d6 would also bury Black's c8-bishop, giving White a substantial lead in development. All things considered, Black cannot use the move order 4...e6 in this opening. Back to the actual game where Black played the correct move.
4...Bg7 5.Bc4
White's light-square bishop usually goes to c4 or b5. Both moves are reliable. In general, the bishop goes to b5 if Black has moved his d6-pawn, and to c4 if he has not.
5...e6
Now ...e7-e6 is quite playable as White cannot open the position with d2-d4. After 6,f5
[diagram]
After 7..,gxf5 (6,..exf5 variation)
[diagram]
After 7.d3 (6,..gxf5 variation)
[diagram]
6.f5 (D)
This pawn sacrifice is an attempt to seize the initiative by disrupting Black's pawn structure. If Black takes with his e-pawn, White can take back without losing control of the center (6...exf5
7.exf5). It is clear that Black should not capture again with 7...gxf5 (D), because he will be
saddled with doubled and isolated f-pawns where his extra pawn would be of little use. If Black takes with his g-pawn on move 6, then White must continue with 7.d3 (D), keeping his pawn on e4 to prevent Black from playing ...d7-d5. Of course, if Black takes on e4, White will take back with the pawn (7...fxe4 8.dxe4). So long as Black has a pawn on e6, White must maintain a pawn on e4. After 9...Na5 Weeramantry - Urbaneja 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Either way, White's superior development gives him excellent compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Back to the game. My opponent did not take the pawn and instead played the move recommended by theory.
6...Nge7 (D)
Black prepares to castle and puts more pressure on the f5 square.
7.fxe6 dxe6
While this move has been played by many grandmasters, playing 7... fxe6, keeping open the possibility of ...d7-d5, is the better move.
8.d3 O-O 9.O-O
We have reached the end of the opening. There are a few pieces left to be developed, but now the fun begins.
9...Na5 (D)
Black wants to trade off the c4-bishop and double White's c-pawns. This plan is inefficient because it involves three knight moves to capture a piece that has moved only once. The extra time needed to carry out this maneuver helps White to complete his development before Black does. Meanwhile, Black's bishop is still languishing on c8, impeding the coordination of his rooks. After 10,Qel
[diagram]
After ll.dxc4 (10,,,Sxc4 variation)
[diagram]
10.Qe1 (D)
White uses the dark squares to transfer his queen to the kingside, a common plan when attacking the fianchetto. This move also avoids a queen trade should White have to recapture on c4 with his pawn. Black could continue with his plan of trading knight for bishop, but, as we will see, the doubled c-pawns actually help White, for example 10...Nxc4 11.dxc4. (D) White's c4-pawn now controls d5. As a result, his e-pawn is free to advance to e5. This clears the e4 square for his knight and strengthens the kingside attack. In addition, White will be able to use the d-file for his rook and increase his control of the center. Question: What is the best placement for White's pieces to conduct a kingside attack? Answer: Play Qh4, then Bh6. Yes. The queen belongs on h4 from where it controls the key dark squares h6 and g5. White can decide whether to place his bishop on g5 or continue on to h6 keeping g5 open for the f3- knight.
10...h6 11.Qh4 Nec6 (D)
After ll... ec6
[diagram]
After 12.Ng5
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Urbaneja 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Black challenges White's queen, hoping to dislodge it from h4. White cannot retreat his queen because 12.Qh3 will be met with the discovered attack 12...e5. However, White has a surprising move. Question: Can you find it? Answer: Bg5. If Black takes the bishop, the knight will take back, threatening Qh7#. Bravo!
12.Bg5 (D)
Amazingly, the h6-pawn does not prevent White from playing this move. The first time I used this idea was against International Master Dr. Hans Berliner, in the
1975 Eastern Open. Dr. Berliner was a former World Correspondence Champion best known as
the programmer of HiTech, which was once the strongest computer chess program in the world. If the queen moves away, then Bxh6 shatters Black's defenses and opens g5 for White's knight. Remember the squares h4, h6, and g5. They are the key to the dark-square attack against Black's fianchetto. At this point, I was walking around confident that I had this game already won. The problem with chess is, it's never over! After forty-five minutes' thought, Urbaneja came up with an ingenious defense. Question: What is Black's clever defensive maneuver? After 13...*fd4+ Answer: ...f6. In some ways this does stop the attack, but it creates a new weakness on g6. After Bxh6, Black's position is collapsing. This is a tough sequence to find, so I will give you a clue. The only way to survive the attack is for Black to get his queen to g7. My opponent just sat there until he figured it out. Icould not believe it! Answer: 12...Bd4+ 13.Nxd4. Hold on. White is not going to take the bishop. He would just play Kh1 instead. But you are right that the d4 square has something to do with it. Time for another hint. Question: What is the one move we are all assuming Black cannot play? Answer: ...hxg5. Of course. But that is a wrong assumption!
12...hxg5! 13.Nxg5 Qd4+ (D)
14.Kh1
White can also get out of check with 14.Rf2. Exercise 12-1: Which move, 14.Kh1 or 14.Rf2, gives White better winning chances?

14...Bh6 saves the day. Unbelievable! Black sacrifices his bishop to open the long diagonal
for his queen.
15.Qxh6 Qg7
End of attack. Black suffered a little damage, but he was able to regroup and defend. Now the attacker must retreat and reorganize before starting again.
16.Qh4
White does not want the queen on h3 where it would be exposed to a discovered attack from the c8-bishop. Still, it is not clear how White should continue the attack. I have a sad story to tell. This is not the only time I have had this position. A little more than a year after this game was played, I got to the same position in a thirty-minute game against five- time U.S. champion Grandmaster Gata Kamsky. Kamsky played 16...Ne5. (D) I failed to find the best continuation and ended up losing. The consensus in the postmortem analysis was that I had excellent chances had I played Rf6!. Back to the game.
16...Nxc4 17.dxc4 Ne5 (D)
After 18... xc4 (variation)
[diagram]
Question: Why does ...Ne5 make sense? Answer: It attacks a pawn. It attacks the c4-pawn and centralizes the knight. What else can you tell me about the e5 square? Answer: It is an outpost. Remember, the square in front of an isolated pawn is a great outpost. Put a homing device on that square and jump right in there.
18.Rad1
White is answering the attack on the c4-pawn with a counterattack. This developing move sets up an indirect defense to the threat of ...Nxc4. (D) Exercise 12-2: If Black tries 18...Nxc4, how does White respond?
18...f6 19.Nf3 Nxc4
Black has re-established material equality, but here comes the second wave of the attack.
20.e5! (D)
After 21,£te4 Weeramantry - Urbaneja 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Advancing the pawn sets up a discovered attack on Black's knight. If Black accepts this pawn sacrifice with 20...Nxe5 21.Nxe5 fxe5, White will either win Black's queen or deliver a forced mate. Exercise 12-3: After 20...Nxe5 21.Nxe5 fxe5, how should White continue? Of course, Black did not take the pawn.
20...Ne3
A more challenging move, Black forks White's rooks. This was not unexpected.
21.Ne4 (D)
Now you see the real point of 20.e5. It is a clearance move. If the knight reaches f6, White's attack becomes unstoppable. His last piece will have entered the fray with devastating effect. Meanwhile, Black can take only one rook at a time. Why bother trying to save either one? Leave them there and let him have his pick! Question: If Black plays 21...Nxf1, how should White reply? Answer: Just play Nxf6+. Good. This is stronger than recapturing on f1. What happens now? Answer: Black plays ...Kf7, then White checks with the other knight. Yes. 22...Kf7 23.Ng5+ Ke7 24.Qc4 gives White an overwhelming attack. After 23,.. xf8
[diagram]
Question: But, what if Black decides to return material with 22...Rxf6 instead of moving his king? Answer: White will take back with his pawn, attacking the queen. Right. Question: After 23.exf6 Qc7, how does White continue? Answer: 24.Ng5. Excellent. Black cannot stop all of White's threats. Now if Black instead takes the other rook with 21...Nxd1, White will again play 22.Nxf6+ Rxf6 23.exf6. After 23...Qh7, White simply trades down into an endgame where he can force the promotion of his f-pawn: 24.Qxh7+ Kxh7 25.Rxd1 g5 26.Ne5. Black did not take either rook. Instead, he counterattacked with...
21...g5
Now both rooks are hanging, as is the queen! In situations like this, forget about retreating anything. Press on with the attack and sacrifice the next piece.
22.Nfxg5 fxg5 23.Rxf8+ Kxf8 (D)
Unfortunately, all these moves had taken me a very long time, and my flag was hanging! I had a minute left to get to move thirty. Back then, we did not have the luxury of increment or delay.
24.Qf2+ Nf5 25.Qxc5+ (D)
After 28*. c6 Weeramantry - Urbaneja 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Now I am winning. If Black's king runs to g8 or e8, 26.Nf6+ Kf7 27.Rd8 Ne7 28.Qb5 Nc6 29.Qf1 sets up a winning discovered attack along the f-file.
25...Ne7 26.Rd8+ Kf7 27.Nd6+
Other good alternatives are 27.Nf6 and 27.Qb5. However, the text move, if played correctly, leads to a forced win.
27...Kg6 28.Qc3 Nc6 (D)
In time trouble, I missed a forced win. Exercise 12-4: Find White's winning line after 28...Nc6.
29.g4
Expecting Black to capture my rook, Itried to set up a mating net. But Black cleverly stays away from 29...Nxd8? as 30.Qd3+ leads to a mate in three: 30...Kh6 31.Qh3+ Kg6 32.Qh5#.
29...Nxe5?
This is also a losing move. Black should play 29...Qxe5 instead.
30.Nxc8?
One mistake after another! 30.Qh3 wins easily. There is no excuse for trading this powerful knight for a bishop that has not even moved. But this was the last move before time control, and After 34...Qdl+ I just could not think of anything else.
30...Qf6 (D)
I was so relieved to have reached time control that at first I did not realize the danger I was in. The position has changed, and Black has taken over the initiative. White's king on h1 is in more danger than Black's king on g6. White can no longer protect the rook and f1 at the same time.
31.Qd4 Rxc8
This rook sacrifice deflects White's rook from guarding d1. Black can now force a perpetual check.
32.Rxc8 Qf1+ 33.Qg1 Qf3+ 34.Qg2 Qd1+ (D)
35.Qg1 Qd5+ 1⁄2-1⁄2
He offered a draw and I accepted. Exercise 12-5: Instead of offering a draw, Black could have met 36.Qg2 with 36...Nf3 threatening ...Qd1+. Why not? After 14.gf2! (variation)

Exercise 12-1: Which move, 14.Kh1 or 14.Rf2, gives White better winning chances? Answer: White has better winning chances with 14.Rf2!. (D) This rook will not stay pinned once Black transfers his queen to g7 for defense: 14...Bh6
15.Qxh6 Qg7 16.Qh3. (D)
By playing 14.Rf2 instead of 14.Kh1, White saves a valuable tempo and can more quickly double his rooks on the f-file. Exercise 12-2: If Black tries 18...Nxc4, how does White respond? (D) After 23.e5 (18,..Cixc4 variation) Answer: White launches a counterattack with 19.Nxf7. Now 19...Rxf7 20.Rd8+ Rf8 21.Rfxf8+ Qxf8 22.Rxf8+ Kxf8 23.e5.

Exercise 12-3: After 20...Nxe5 21.Nxe5 fxe5 (D), how should White continue? Answer: White wins with 22.Rxf8+: 1) 22...Qxf8 is met by 23.Rd8 Bd7 24.Rxf8+ winning the queen. 2) 22...Kxf8 leads to a forced mate in 5: 23.Qd8+ Kf7 24.Rf1+ Qf6 25.Rxf6+ Kg7 26.Qf8+ Kh7 27.Rf7#.

For example: 30.Nf7+ Kh5 31.Rh8+ Qxh8 32.Nxh8 g4 33.Qg6+ Kh4 34.Qh6#. 2) If 29...Kh5, then 30.Qh3+ Kg6 31.g4 Qh7 32.Qf3 Nxe5 33.Qe4+ Kh6 34.Qxe5 with a crushing attack. Exercise 12-5: Instead of offering a draw, Black could have met 36.Qg2 with 36...Nf3 (D) threatening ...Qd1+. Why not? Answer: White turns the game around with the surprising reply 37.Rd8!, after which 37...Qxd8

REVIEW
Themes Weak color complex (4...e6 variation). Pawn sacrifice for initiative (6.f5 gxf5 7.d3). Pawn sacrifice for structural advantage (6.f5 exf5 7.exf5 gxf5). Attacking the dark squares around Black's castled king in a fianchetto formation (10.Qe1;
11.Qh4; 12.Bg5).
Accepting doubled pawns to control central squares (10...Nxc4 variation). Reorganizing the attack (16.Qh4 through 20.e5). Square clearance (20.e5). Advice Open the position to exploit weak squares. Advance a pawn to clear a square for a piece. Try approaching a target from different angles. Whenever possible, defend actively and counterattack. Sacrifice to gain the initiative. Sacrifice again to maintain it when necessary. When two pieces of the same value are attacked, it may be a waste of time to move either one - your opponent can only capture one piece at a time. Manage your time efficiently. Serious time trouble can spell disaster. __________

White goes wrong by overextending his center. It is critical to maintain the pawn on e4 in order to keep the h1-a8 diagonal blocked. Advancing the e-pawn gives Black's bishops too much scope, with two adjacent diagonals aiming directly at White's king.
19...Bb6+ 20.Kh1 Ng4!
Black takes advantage of White's overloaded queen to move his knight into attacking position.
21.Be4 (D)

[diagram]
After 22.g3 White realizes the danger along the h1-a8 diagonal and attempts to neutralize Black's light- square bishop by blocking the diagonal with his own bishop. Capturing the knight with 21.Qxg4 is not a viable option, as it permits 21...Rxd3 with the twin threats of ...Rxc3, gaining two minor pieces for the rook, and ...Rd2, targeting White's g2- pawn. Exercise D1-1: If White chooses to block with 21.Ne4 instead, how does Black proceed?
21...Qh4 22.g3 (D)
Black's pieces are well coordinated and they are all participating in the attack. It appears at first that Black's strength lies along the h1-a8 diagonal, but the concluding combination takes an unexpected turn.
22...Rxc3!!
A brilliant move. Black removes one of the protectors of the e4-bishop. He now threatens to capture on e4 and deflect White's queen from its protection of h2. The true beauty of this move, however, is that it leaves the queen en prise!
23.gxh4
Can you really blame White for taking the queen?
23...Rd2!
After 25.Bg2 After llJtg5 (D2) D.Byrne - Fischer 1956 First the queen, now the rook! Black is intent on deflecting White's queen, removing the last defender of the e4-bishop.
24.Qxd2 Bxe4+ 25.Qg2 (D)
White is forced to give back the queen, but hopes that returning the material will help him survive.
25...Rh3! 0-1
An amazing sight! The attack along the h1-a8 diagonal was merely a distraction after all. Who needs to capture the queen? The true target is h2. Mate on h2 cannot be prevented. (D2) D. Byrne - Fischer, New York 1956 [D97]
1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.d4 O-O 5.Bf4 d5 6.Qb3 dxc4 7.Qxc4 c6 8.e4 Nbd7
9.Rd1 Nb6 10.Qc5 Bg4 11.Bg5 (D)
White needs to give priority to completing his development. Keeping the king in the center when the opponent is already castled and fully developed is inviting trouble. The safer course is to play 11.Be2 and prepare to castle.
11...Na4!
A very resourceful move. Black finds a way to seize the initiative by offering to sacrifice his knight in order to undermine the protection of e4.
12.Qa3
After 17...axb6 (15.Jtxf8 variation) After 17.&fl If White accepts the sacrifice with 12.Nxa4, then Black eliminates the key pawn on e4 with
12...Nxe4, forking White's queen and bishop. Now the only way for White not to return the
extra piece is to play 13.Bxe7 which leads to disaster on the e-file (13...Qc7 14.Qa3 Rfe8 15.Bb4 Ng3+).
12...Nxc3 13.bxc3 Nxe4 14.Bxe7
It is still a mistake to open the e-file. White can resist more strongly with 14.Be3. However, Black is already up a pawn and, ironically, retains his initiative by offering a queen trade, for example 14...Qd6 15.Qxd6 exd6 16.Rc1 Rae8 17.Bd3 f5.
14...Qb6 15.Bc4
White decides that it is better to castle as soon as possible and does not go for the exchange with 15.Bxf8 as Black would then increase his advantage by entering the queen trade: 15...Bxf8
16.Qb3 Nxc3 17.Qxb6 (17.Qxc3? Bb4 pins the queen) 17...axb6. (D)
Although down an exchange, Black is winning as White has two undeveloped pieces and his rook is under attack. For instance, 18.Ra1 meets with the powerful 18...Bb4.
15...Nxc3 16.Bc5
White pins his hopes of survival on attacking Black's queen. 16.Qxc3 does not help as the pin along the e-file with 16...Rae8 is crushing.
16...Rfe8+ 17.Kf1 (D)
After 23...axb6 a b c d e t g h (D2) D.Byrne - Fischer 1956 Although he can no longer castle, White hopes to walk his king to safety. However, he is still playing with one rook completely out of play, and this allows Black to come up with a stunning sacrifice.
17...Be6!!
The power of this move by the 13-year-old Fischer has resulted in this game being dubbed "The Game of the Century." Black gives up his queen for a spectacular finish.
18.Bxb6
White accepts the sacrifice. He is still losing after 18.Qxc3. Black can exploit the pin on White's d4-pawn and reply with 18...Qxc5. Exercise D2-1: Show how Black meets 18.Bxe6.
18...Bxc4+ 19.Kg1 Ne2+ 20.Kf1 Nxd4+ 21.Kg1 Ne2+
This tactical scenario, where a king is repeatedly exposed to a different discovered check while being forced to shuffle back and forth between two squares, is often referred as a "windmill."
22.Kf1 Nc3+ 23.Kg1 axb6 (D)
Black's compensation for the sacrificed queen is clear. His bishops and rooks coordinate beautifully and control important lines of attack, while one of White's rooks is incarcerated on h1.
24.Qb4 Ra4 25.Qxb6 Nxd1 26.h3 Rxa2 27.Kh2 Nxf2 28.Re1
Twenty-eight moves into the game, White finally brings his other rook out, but it is much too late. In the last four moves, Black has picked up even more material. He now has a rook, two minor pieces, and three pawns for the queen.
28...Rxe1 29.Qd8+ Bf8 30.Nxe1 Bd5 31.Nf3 Ne4 32.Qb8 b5
Every single piece and pawn in Black's position is protected. There is simply nothing for White to attack.
33.h4 h5 34.Ne5 Kg7 35.Kg1 Bc5+ 36.Kf1 Ng3+ 37.Ke1 (D)
Fischer now finishes with a mate in five moves. When it was pointed out to him that he had a faster mate, he replied that he simply played the win he found. Exercise D2-2: After 37.Ke1, find a mate in four moves for Black. There are two ways to do this.
37...Bb4+ 38.Kd1 Bb3+ 39.Kc1 Ne2+ 40.Kb1 Nc3+ 41.Kc1 Rc2# 0-1
(D3) Bareev - Kasparov, Paris 1991 [D94]
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.Nf3 O-O 5.e3 c5 6.Be2 cxd4 7. exd4 d5 8.O-O Nc6 9.h3
Bf5 10.cxd5 Nxd5 (D) White has an isolated d-pawn. In general, the compensation for an isolated pawn lies in superior piece activity on one or both adjacent files. That is not the case here. In fact, White is slightly behind in development.
11.Qb3
White uses a double attack on the knight and the b7-pawn in an effort to force Black onto the defensive. Now 11...Nb6, retreating the knight from its blockading square on d5, would allow White to complete his development unchallenged.
11...Be6
Black elects to keep his knight centralized.
12.Qxb7 Nxd4 13.Nxd4 Bxd4
After 15...Sxb2 After 17...d?xf8 (D3) Bareev - Kasparov 1991 The previous captures have resulted in an indirect trade of Black's b7-pawn for White's d4- pawn. White has eliminated the potential weakness of the isolated d4-pawn, but only at the cost of giving Black greater piece play in the center.
14.Bh6 Rb8 15.Qa6 Rxb2 (D)
Surprise! Black concludes that his superior piece activity justifies giving up the exchange. It is precisely the creation of this type of imbalance that offers practical winning chances.
16.Nxd5 Qxd5 17.Bxf8 Kxf8 (D)
Black has a bishop and a pawn for the exchange. His pieces are exerting pressure on White's castled position and are poised to attack. He is also threatening to capture White's a2-pawn, which will further increase his compensation by giving him an outside passed pawn to go along with his bishop pair.
18.a4?
White moves his pawn to safety without realizing the serious consequences of this move.
18.Rad1 offers better defensive chances.
18...Rb3!
It is most unusual that a rook that has already penetrated to the seventh rank backs up a rank in order to create stronger threats. Indeed, switching the rook to the sixth rank proves decisive.
19.Rad1
After 12.. Axc4 This allows a quick mate, but White does not have any satisfactory alternatives. Exercise D3-1: If White tries to defend with 19.Bf3, how does Black win?
19...Rg3! 0-1
There is no way to prevent a checkmate on g2. (D4) LCZero - Stockfish, TCEC 2019 [E87]
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3 O-O 6.Be3 e5 7.d5 Nh5 8.Qd2 Qh4+ 9.g3
Nxg3 10.Qf2 Nxf1 11.Qxh4 Nxe3 12.Ke2 Nxc4 (D) This all-computer matchup features a most human queen sacrifice first introduced by world championship contender David Bronstein. Black has two bishops and a pair of pawns for the queen, as well as active play against White's exposed king.
13.Qe1 f5
Black opens the f-file in order to exploit the uncomfortable position of White's king, and immediately activates one of its rooks. Grabbing a pawn instead with 13...Nxb2? is ill-advised, as 14.Qc1! Nc4 15.Nb5 tips the balance in White's favor due to the threat of winning an exchange with Nxc7.
14.h4
Against the kingside fianchetto, the traditional attack involving the opening of the h-file is not as effective without a dark-square bishop.
14...fxe4 15.Nxe4 c6
Black attempts to open the center to gain immediate access to White's king.
16.Qd1
White dare not oblige, as 16.dxc6 Nxc6 17.Rc1 d5 18.Nc3 e4 completely shatters the center.
16...Bd7 17.Kf2 Bf5 18.Ng3 Nxb2
Taking the pawn is justified this time around: the knight can jump back with check when attacked.
19.Qb3 Nd3+ 20.Kg2 Nc5 21.Qd1 Bd7
After 22...&ba6
[diagram]
(D4) LCZero - Stockfish 2019 In anticipation of further opening the center, Black makes sure to preserve its bishop pair.
22.h5 Nba6 (D)
Black's minor pieces are working harmoniously, while White is unable to complete development because its king desperately needs to find shelter.
23.Rc1 Rf6 24.N1e2 Raf8
Black sets up a battery on the f-file and targets the f3-pawn.
25.h6
Should White play 25.hxg6, Black will capture back with the rook.
25...Bh8 26.Rf1 g5 27.Kg1 Rxh6
Black now has two bishops and four pawns for the queen. It is even ahead on the point count!
28.Ne4 Rf7 29.N2c3 Rg6 30.dxc6 Bxc6 31.Rc2
White moves its rook to a more active square and allows it to reposition itself along the second rank.
31...Bg7 32.Rd2
Exercise D4-1: If White plays 32.Nxd6, how should Black reply?
32...Bf8 33.Nxd6 Rf4 (D)
After 45.Sf2 Although White's knight is placed well on d6, Black finds an active plan to play around it. Indeed, it is critical for Black to keep generating threats against White's king so as to keep control of the position. The threat isnow 34...g4.
34.Ne2 Ba4
Another excellent example of active play. Rather than move the attacked rook, Black makes use of its control of the fourth rank to counterattack White's queen.
35.Qe1 Bxd6 36.Nxf4 gxf4+
This series of trades has increased Black's material advantage, netting two minor pieces for a rook.
37.Kh1 Bc7 38.Rh2 Nd7 39.Rg1 Bc6 40.Rxg6+ hxg6 41.Qh4
White must activate its queen and is willing to give up another pawn to achieve this.
41...Bxf3+ 42.Kg1 Bb6+ 43.Kf1 Bh5 44.Qe7 Nac5 45.Rf2 (D)
A most unusual material imbalance. White has 15 points versus 17 for Black, without either side having apiece in common except for a pawn. Although Black's king is exposed to checks by the white queen, its pieces are so well coordinated that they control critical squares and are able to contain the queen's attacks.
45...Nf8
Black gives up a pawn to improve the placement of the d7-knight. After 59.a? (D4) LCZero - Stockfish 2019
46.Qxe5
The pawn that White captures is the only unprotected piece on the board.
46...Nfe6
This knight moves into better attacking position while helping to shield Black's king from attack.
47.a4 Bc7 48.Qd5 Bg4
Black redeploys this bishop so that it has access to two different diagonals, greatly increasing its scope.
49.Rc2 Bh3+ 50.Ke2 b6 51.Qa8+ Kf7
It is amazing to see that the four minor pieces are preventing any effective coordination between White's queen and rook.
52.Qxa7 Kf6
Black moves out of the pin and frees the c7-bishop.
53.a5 Bf5 54.Rxc5
Faced with constant harassment by the bishops, White decides to give up the exchange. Moving the rook off the c-file would allow Black to capture the pawn on a5.
54...bxc5 55.Qa8 Bg4+ 56.Kf1 f3
This pawn joins in the attack and helps to weave a mating net around White's king.
57.Qh8+ Kg5 58.a6 Bg3 59.a7 (D)
White threatens to make a second queen, but it is too late. Black's pieces are poised for the final assault.
59...Bf5 60.Qh1
Promoting the pawn does not help, since the second queen is soon captured: 60.a8Q Bd3+
61.Kg1 f2+ 62.Kg2 f1Q+ 63.Kxg3 Qf4+ 64.Kg2 Be4+, after which Black will have a piece and
two pawns more.
60...Bd3+ 61.Kg1 Nd4
After Exercise D4-2: If White promotes the pawn after 61...Nd4, find a forced mate for Black.
62.Qh2
Desperation.

9.Bh4 d5 10.Rd1 g5 11.Bg3 Ne4 12.Nd2 Nc5 13.Qc2 d4 14.Nf3 (D)
The critical feature of this type of position is that one player is castled and the other is not. The uncastled player must make it a priority to get his king out of the center before the other player succeeds in blowing it open.
14...e5
Black frees his c8-bishop. He is more than happy to give up a pawn in return for active play against the uncastled king.
15.Nxe5 dxc3!
This is a long-term sacrifice of the queen. It does not lead to a forced win, but it does create a material imbalance that complicates the position and offers winning chances. Such sacrifices are extremely difficult to judge.
16.Rxd8 cxb2+ (D)
After 20.Nf3 (D5) Jinshin Bai - Ding Liren 2017 Black has achieved his goal of mounting a direct assault on White's uncastled king. The question is whether the attack is strong enough to justify giving up the queen.
17.Ke2?
White chooses to move his king. However, he should have considered giving back some material with 17.Rd2 to blunt Black's offensive.
17...Rxd8 18.Qxb2 Na4
Repositioning a knight with gain of time.
19.Qc2 Nc3+ 20.Kf3 (D)
White's king cannot safely retreat and is forced to venture out into the open. The king hunt begins.
20...Rd4!
An amazing move! Black's rook enters the attack with devastating effect. It cannot be captured, as 21.exd4 Nxd4+ falls into a knight fork. Meanwhile, there is an imminent mate threat beginning with ...g5-g4+.
21.h3
It is now too late to give back material. For example, 21.e4 Rxe4 22.Qxe4 Nxe4 23.Kxe4 f5+ still leaves White far behind in development and with a vulnerable king.
21...h5 22.Bh2 g4+ 23.Kg3 Rd2 (D)
After 26...Ng7 For the second time in the last few moves, Black's rook and knight coordinate perfectly to set up a knight fork: 24.Qxd2? Ne4+ wins the queen.
24.Qb3 Ne4+ 25.Kh4
Exercise D5-1: If 25.Kf4 Rxf2+ 26.Kxe4, can you find a mate?
25...Be7+ 26.Kxh5 Kg7 (D)
This quiet king move sets up a mating net. It takes away the last remaining safe square from White's king and gets ready to bring the a8-rook over to the kingside to deliver checkmate.
27.Bf4 Bf5 28.Bh6+
White makes a desperate attempt to block the h-file and avert mate.
28...Kh7 29.Qxb7
If White plays 29.hxg4 instead, he gets mated by a pawn! (29...Bg6+ 30.Nxg6 fxg6#.)
29...Rxf2 30.Bg5 Rh8
Plan realized! Black's pieces are swarming all over the white king.
31.Nxf7 Bg6+ 32.Kxg4 Ne5+ 0-1
It is mate in three: 33.Nxe5 Bf5+ 34.Kh5 Kg8+ 35.Bh6 Ng3#. (D6) Tseshkovsky - Kasparov, Tbilisi 1978 [B18] After 17...gxf6 After 23".Qb8

18.d5!
This is a multi-purpose clearance sacrifice. In one move, White takes away d5 from Black's knight and frees d4 for his own piece.
18...exd5 19.Nd4 Qa6 20.Kb1 Bd6 21.Qf3
Rather than trade on d6 himself, White protects his f4-bishop and invites Black to make the trade.
21...Bxf4 22.Qxf4 Ne5 23.Qf5+ Kb8 (D)
White is in complete control of the game, primarily because Black's pawns are fractured and lack mobility. The extent to which this affects the outcome becomes clearer as the game progresses.
24.f4
Although Black's knight is placed well on e5, he is unable to maintain its centralized position. White's knight, on the other hand, has a permanent home on d4. After 29...Bc5
24...Nd7 25.Qxd5 Ne5 26.Qe4 Ng4
Black threatens to fork all of White's major pieces with ...Ng4-f2, but the knight is unable to receive any assistance from the rest of Black's pieces.
27.Qe2 Qb6 28.c3 f5 29.Rhe1
There is no hurry to capture Black's weak pawn on f5. This structural weakness will not disappear. Activating one's pieces takes priority.
29...Qc5 (D)
Black momentarily protects his f5-pawn, but can do little to contest White's control of the e- file.
30.Qe7 Qxe7 31.Rxe7
The trade of queens further highlights Black's structural weaknesses.
31...Rhe8 32.Rde1 Rxe7 33.Rxe7 Nf6 34.Rxf7 Nxh5 35.Nxf5
The recent flurry of captures has clarified the position. White has an extra pawn and a clear 2-1 pawn majority on the kingside. His rook has penetrated to the seventh rank, and his knight is more centralized.
35...Rd3 36.Rf8+ Kc7 37.Rg8 Kd7 38.Rg6 b5 (D)
Black is helpless. He cannot dislodge either of White's pieces from their dominant positions. He therefore resorts to a desperate attempt for queenside play. After 13.Ne5 (D7) Weeramantry - Walton 1986
39.a3 Rd1+ 40.Ka2 Rg1 41.Rd6+
White finds a clever intermediate move that forces Black's king further away from the kingside.
41...Kc7 42.Rxh6 Nxg3 43.Nd4 Ne4 44.Nxb5+ Kd7 45.Rh7+ Ke6 46.Rxa7

9.Ngf3 Bd6 10.Bxd6 Qxd6 11.O-O O-O 12.Rae1 Rab8 13.Ne5 (D)
White's knight occupies the strong square e5 and prevents Black from executing a central pawn break with ...e6-e5.
13...Bh5 14.f4
White strengthens his control of e5 and increases the mobility of his f1-rook.
14...Bg6 15.Nxg6 hxg6 16.Qd1 b5
Unable to create any play in the center, Black launches a minority attack on the queenside.
17.b4
This strategy of handling the minority attack was popularized by former world champion José Raúl Capablanca. It is effective as long as the weakness of the backward pawn on c3 cannot be exploited.
17...Rfc8 18.Nb3
White's knight heads for c5 to shield his c3-pawn from an attack along the c-file.
18...a5 19.a3 axb4 20.axb4
The trade of pawns on b4 leaves Black with an isolated pawn on b5, which will remain a prominent target for White's light-square bishop.
20...Ra8
After 29... e8?
[diagram]
Black seeks to use the open a-file as compensation.
21.Nc5 Qb8 (D)
Black defends his b5-pawn as a prelude to doubling rooks on the a-file. The stage is set for a kingside attack by White and a queenside invasion by Black.
22.Re3 Ne7 23.Qe1 Nf5 24.Rh3
White sets up for a direct attack on Black's castled king along the h-file.
24...Rc7 25.Be2 Rca7 26.g4 Nd6 27.Qh4
Mate is threatened on h8.
27...Kf8 28.Qh8+ Ng8 29.Rh7 Ne8 (D)
As Black cannot challenge White's control of the h-file, he uses his knights to hold White's queen and rook at bay. However, this move is a mistake. Instead, he could have shut White down with 29...Ke7 30.Qxg7 Nf6 31.Rh3 Qf8. Black's control of the a-file gives him adequate compensation for the pawn.
30.Rf3
This is a good idea, but the timing is wrong as it gives Black's a7-rook a chance to leave his second rank with check. White can maintain complete control by leaving this rook on f1 and playing 30.Rh3 instead.
30...Ra1+
After 33...Ne7 (31...Qd6 variation)
[diagram]
After 32.Rfh3 (D7) Weeramantry - Walton 1986 If this were not check, White would now fork Black's king and queen with Nd7+.
31.Kg2 R8a7?
The decisive mistake. Black must protect d7 with his queen, not his rook. The a8-rook must stay guarding his first rank. Instead, Black has a remarkable defense in 31...Qd6. If White pursues his idea of tripling on the h-file in order to threaten mate by sacrificing his queen on g8, Black will simply give up the knight and walk away: 32.Rfh3 Qxf4 33.Qxg8+ Ke7. (D) Although Black is down a piece, he has enough counterplay to hold the balance. If White continues his attack by doubling on the eighth rank, Black moves his knight to c7, protecting the a8-rook and discovering an attack on White's queen: 34.Rh8 Nc7. Once the queen moves away, Black's a8-rook pins the e2-bishop with ...R8a2 and helps recover the piece. Back to the game.
32.Rfh3 (D)
White triples on the h-file and threatens Qxg8+. Black is helpless.
32...Nef6 33.Qxg7+ Ke8 34.Qxf6
This pseudo-sacrifice of the queen seals the victory. If the queen is captured with 34...Nxf6, White skewers Black's king and queen with 35.Rh8+ and comes out ahead a piece.
34...R1a2
After ll.Bg5 A last desperate attempt at counterplay.
35.Rh8 Rxe2+ 36.Kf3 Mate is inevitable. 1-0
(D8) Adams - Torre, New Orleans 1920 [C62]
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 exd4 4.Qxd4 Nc6 5.Bb5 Bd7 6.Bxc6 Bxc6 7.Nc3 Nf6 8.O-O Be7
9.Nd5 Bxd5 10.exd5 O-O 11.Bg5 (D)
White has secured a considerable advantage in space. His pieces are occupying five ranks, while Black is confined to three. The extra space gives White's pieces greater mobility. The difference in the two bishops is particularly striking.
11...c6
Black attempts to break this stranglehold by changing the pawn structure. A better option is to attack the bishop with 11...h6, setting up a simple combination should the bishop retreat to h4: 12.Bh4 Nxd5, winning a pawn.
12.c4
White fully intends to maintain a pawn on d5, preventing Black from activating his bishop along the a3-f8 diagonal.
12...cxd5 13.cxd5 Re8 14.Rfe1
White takes the first step in activating his rooks: occupy an open file.
14...a5
Black moves the a-pawn to free his rook from defensive duty, but moving it one space forward to a6 is preferable as the pawns would stay connected.
15.Re2 Rc8?
A mistake. Black should remove any possibility of a back-rank mate by playing 15...h6.
16.Rae1
The second step is now complete: White doubles his rooks on the open file. Black is now in grave danger. If White captures on f6, Black will be forced to take back with his g-pawn, exposing his king.
16...Qd7 (D)
(D8) Adams - Torre 1920 Black moves the queen off the back rank to coordinate his rooks and guard against the immediate threat. However, Black's back-rank weakness still remains.
17.Bxf6
This initiates a winning combination featuring a series of queen offers based on the threat of a back-rank mate.
17...Bxf6
Black has an interesting alternative in 17...gxf6. Exercise D8-1: If 17...gxf6, White can try to win material with 18.Rxe7. Does this work?
18.Qg4!
White offers his queen in an attempt to deflect Black's queen away from its protection of e8.
18...Qb5
Naturally, 18...Qxg4 allows a forced mate: 19.Rxe8+ Rxe8 20.Rxe8#.
19.Qc4
A second attempt at deflection.
19...Qd7
Black must maintain his queen on the a4-e8 diagonal.
20.Qc7!
Yet another attempt to force Black's queen off the diagonal. This is the most striking of the three queen offers as White's queen plants itself directly in Black's face. Still, White's queen cannot be touched.
20...Qb5 (D)
Despite White's best efforts, Black's queen still occupies the a4-e8 diagonal. White must find a new idea to avoid repeating moves.
21.a4!
The key move. Exercise D8-2: What happens if White plays 21.Qxb7 in yet another attempt at deflecting Black's queen?
21...Qxa4 22.Re4
This follow-up move is essential. If White resumes his attempts at deflection with 22.Qxa5, Black simply plays 22...Qd7 23.Qc7 Qb5, repeating moves.
22...Qb5 23.Qxb7 (D)
Black's queen has run out of squares; it can no longer protect e8. 1-0 (D9) Nakamura - Fluviá Poyatos, Barcelona 2007 [D80]

30.Bg3 Bxf3+ 31.Kh3 Bg4+ 32.Kh4 Qxe3 (D)
(D9) Nakamura - Fluviá Poyatos 2007 The first impression is that White's king is in serious danger, but a closer examination reveals that Black's threat of ...Qg5+ can be easily parried. Black has three pawns for a bishop, but his pawns are on the queenside and are not useful in attacking White's king.
33.Qb5 Qxd4 34.Qe5
White centralizes his queen and offers a trade. Black has no immediate checks.
34...Qd8
A queen trade is out of the question, for White's bishop pair will easily dominate Black's pawns in an endgame.
35.Rd2
The rook cannot be captured because of White's mate threat on c7.
35...Bd7
Black's pieces are forced to retreat even further.
36.Rd4
This move keeps control of the game and guarantees equality. However, 36.Rxd7 would generate winning chances as White's bishop pair is superior to Black's rook.
36...e6+ (D)
After 39...JU7 Black finally gets in a check. White's king has the choice of advancing or retreating.
37.Kxh5
The king fights back. White is not afraid to capture this pawn; his pieces are well coordinated and can control Black's key attacking squares.
37...Be8+?
The fact that White's king is wide open with no pawn cover mesmerizes Black into believing that he is winning. The more realistic course is to settle for a repetition with 37...Qe8+ 38.Kh4 (38.Kh6 Qf8+) 38... Qd8+ 39.Kh5 Qe8+.
38.Kh6
White's king continues to move up the board. The lack of communication between Black's queen and rook, coupled with White's control of key lines of attack, ensures that the king will be safe.
38...Qe7
Black searches for a checking square...
39.Rf4
...and White calmly shuts him down.
39...Bf7 (D)
Black shields the f8 square and prepares to check White's king.
40.Qf6
With one final move to make before time control, White misses a clear win. Exercise D9-1: After 39...Bf7, find a winning continuation for White.
40...Qf8+ 41.Kh7 Kb8 42.Rf2 e5
Black is probably quite frustrated at not finding a way to checkmate a king that appears to be defenseless. He misses the opportunity to force a draw by repetition, here and on the previous move, with 42...Rg6 43.Bxg6 Bg8+ 44.Kh8 Bf7+. As a result, White now reaps a full point, an apt reward for coordinating his pieces well in defense.

(D10) Wang Hao - Timofeev 2007
43.Qxe5
Black's queen cannot defend the mate threat on c7 without surrendering the bishop on f7. 1- 0 (D10) Wang Hao - Timofeev, Moscow 2007 [B30]
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 d6 4.O-O Bd7 5.Re1 Nf6 6.c3 a6 7.Bf1 Bg4 8.d4 cxd4 9.cxd4
d5 10.e5 Ng8 11.e6 Bxe6 12.Rxe6 fxe6 (D) White has sacrificed an exchange and a pawn to disrupt Black's pawn structure. He still retains his bishop pair and can target the e6-pawn at the appropriate time. This square is difficult to defend as Black lacks a light-square bishop. The position is dynamically balanced: superior structure versus greater material.
13.Qb3
A multi-purpose move. The immediate point is to make Black choose how to defend the b7- pawn.
13...Na5
Black finds the best reply but has to decentralize his knight. Protecting the pawn with 13...Rb8 or 13...Qc7 gives White a powerful attack with 14.Bf4. As for 13...Qd7, White has the knight maneuver Nc3-a4-c5 which, together with Bf4, exploits Black's weak dark squares on the queenside. Exercise D10-1: In the variation 13...Qd7 14.Nc3, Black can stop Na4 with 14...b5. What then?
14.Qe3
White's queen has gained a tempo on its way to the e-file. With his queen on e3 and Black's knight no longer on c6, White controls the d4 square. If White had played directly to the e-file with 13.Qe2, Black could have put pressure on White's d-pawn with ...g7-g6 and ...Bf8-g7.
14...Rc8 15.Nc3 Qd6 16.g3 g6 17.Bh3
White carries out the most direct plan for applying pressure to e6.
17...Bh6 18.Qe2 Rc6? (D)
After 18...Ec6? Black chooses to defend e6 but places his rook on an awkward square. Black should abandon the pawn and focus on counterplay. To this end, trading bishops immediately with ...Bxc1 will make it easier to play natural developing moves.
19.Bg5!
This gives White a clear advantage, as it hampers the development of Black's g8-knight.
19...Kf8
Trading bishops on g5 will simply grant White quicker access to e6: 19...Bxg5 20.Nxg5 Nf6
21.Nxe6.
20.Re1 Kg7 21.Bxh6+ Nxh6 22.Bxe6
The e6-pawn falls as expected. Furthermore, both black knights are temporarily out of play.
22...Re8
Giving up the queen to break White's control of e6 is insufficient as White will come out a pawn ahead: 22...Qxe6 23.Qxe6 Rxe6 24.Rxe6 Nc6 25.Nxd5.
23.Nxd5
White is in firm control. His pieces are well centralized while Black's are not. Both of Black's knights are on the rim, while his e8-rook is stuck behind the e7-pawn.
23...Ng4 24.Qd2
White attacks the unprotected knight on a5.
24...Nf6?
Black attempts to make an indirect trade of the a5-knight for White's d5-knight. He should play 24...Nc4 instead, after which White's advantage would not be so great.
25.Qxa5 b6 (D)
After 16...g5 abed e 1 g h (D11) Aronian - Kamsky 2008 Black relies on chasing White's queen off the fifth rank in order to regain his piece with ...Nxd5. However, he misses White's reply.
26.Nxf6!
This intermediate move preserves the extra piece, as White is threatening to regain the queen with Nxe8+ forking Black's king and queen.
26...exf6 27.Qd2 Re7
Exercise D10-2: Can Black regain the piece with 27...Rxe6 instead?
28.Kg2 b5 29.h4 h5 30.Bb3 Rcc7 31.d5 1-0

16.hxg3 g5 (D)
Control of the center is often established by occupying the center with pawns. White has achieved an ideal center with two pawns abreast on the fourth rank. These pawns are ready to advance further and gain even more space. Black, on the other hand, is reduced to token expansion on the flanks.
17.d5 Na5 18.Nd2 e6 19.c4
White strengthens his pawn structure and ensures that he retains control of the center. After 25.fxe5
19...e5 20.Bh5
By blockading Black's h-pawn, White restricts the number of pawn moves at Black's disposal. The pressure applied to f7 is an added benefit which will come into play when the f-file is opened.
20...O-O 21.f4
White attempts to force open the f-file and activate his rooks.
21...Kg7 22.Nf3 exf4 23.gxf4 g4
Black avoids opening the f-file, but surrenders a massive central pawn majority to White.
24.Ne5 Bxe5
This is the only way for Black to avoid losing his g4-pawn, but it allows White to open the f- file after all.
25.fxe5 (D)
White's center pawns look quite menacing. Even without advancing farther, they exert significant pressure on Black's position by controlling four squares on the sixth rank.
25...Rce8 26.Bf4 Bc8 27.Rc3
White executes a rook lift to enable a quick crossover to the kingside.
27...Kh7 28.Bh2
This clearance move is the logical sequel to the rook lift. White moves his bishop out of the way to allow both rooks to join the action.
28...Kg7 29.Rf6 Re7 30.Bf4 (D)
After 30.M4
[diagram]
(D12) Harper - Zuk 1971 White's control of the board is striking. He can continue to improve his position, while Black has no choice but to watch and wait. He is totally suffocated.
30...Rh8
The threat to h6 must be defended.
31.d6 Rb7 32.Rg3 Kf8 33.Bxh6+ (D)
Black resigns in view of 33...Ke8 34.e6 Rh7 35.Rxg4. 1-0 It is stunning to see the two center pawns still standing side by side, having worked their way two ranks further up the board. (D12) Harper - Zuk, Burnaby 1971 [E97]
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nf3 O-O 6.Be2 e5 7.O-O Nc6 8.d5 Ne7 9.Bd2

Black's d4-knight, on the other hand, is two ranks further up the board and within striking distance of White's king. A better alternative for White is21.Nf3, challenging Black's d4-knight.
21...Qg5
Black's queen threatens to dominate the dark squares. This is particularly effective now that the dark-square bishops have been traded.
22.Nf4 Rae8 23.Qa4
Unable to penetrate the kingside, White's queen attempts to infiltrate Black's position via the queenside. However, this queen is now separated from the rest of White's pieces.
23...Qe7 (D)
Black calmly retreats his queen to protect the a7-pawn without losing any of its influence on the kingside.
24.Nb5?
A second white piece moves over to the queenside, but this gives Black free rein on the opposite wing.
24...Nxb5
There is no need for Black to initiate the knight trade. He can start an immediate kingside expansion with ...g6-g5 instead. After 29".Ne4 After 35...h5 (D13) Karpov - Unzicker 1974
25.Qxb5 Qe3+ 26.Kh1 g5 27.Nh3 Bd3 28.Rxf8+ Rxf8 29.Rg1 Be4 (D)
This powerful pin severely restricts the mobility of White's pieces.
30.Qd7
White's queen attempts to rush over to defend.
30...Bxg2+ 31.Rxg2 Qe4
An even more powerful pin.
32.Ng1
White frees the h3 square for his queen. If the knight moves to f4 instead, hoping to open the g-file and threaten mate on g7, Black's queen can come to the rescue: 32.Nf4 gxf4 33.gxf4 Qb1+ 34.Rg1 Qxb2.
32...h6 33.h4 Rf2 34.Qh3 g4 35.Qh2 h5 (D)
Nothing can move; White's pieces are buried alive. White will soon run out of pawn moves and it will all be over.
36.b4 Rf1 37.b5 Kh8 38.a4 Kh7 39.a5 Kg8 0-1
(D13) Karpov - Unzicker, Nice Olympiad 1974 [C98]
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 8.c3 O-O 9.h3
Na5 10.Bc2 c5 11.d4 Qc7 12.Nbd2 Nc6 13. d5 Nd8 14.a4 Rb8 15.axb5 axb5 16.b4 (D) After 24.Ba7 White fixes the b5-pawn and prevents Black from gaining space on the queenside. Black's minor pieces appear to be tripping over themselves. They lack good squares and have no room to maneuver.
16...Nb7
This does not improve the position of the knight, as it has nowhere useful to go to from b7.
17.Nf1 Bd7 18.Be3 Ra8 19.Qd2 Rfc8 20.Bd3 g6 21.Ng3 Bf8 22.Ra2 c4
Black closes the position because he fears that a pawn trade will weaken the b5-pawn. However, if he wishes to adopt this strategy, it would be better to first trade a pair of rooks with
22...Rxa2 23.Qxa2 c4. With the queen as the lead piece on the a-file, Black's chances of
contesting the file are improved.
23.Bb1 Qd8 24.Ba7 (D)
It is extremely difficult for Black to dislodge this bishop. Although the bishop does not attack a specific target, it severely cramps Black's position.
24...Ne8 25.Bc2 Nc7 26.Rea1
White doubles on the a-file to ensure that his bishop can remain on a7. Having now closed down the queenside, White will turn his attention to the other side of the board.
26...Qe7 27.Bb1 Be8 28.Ne2 Nd8 29.Nh2
While Black shuffles his pieces without a clear plan, White prepares to open another front. (D13) Karpov - Unzicker 1974
29...Bg7 30.f4
White initiates the long-awaited kingside expansion.
30...f6
This dooms Black to total passivity. Although trading with 30...exf4 appears to open the position in White's favor, this trade would at least help Black to secure some active play.
31.f5 (D)
The pawn continues to advance and gain space on the kingside. The extra space allows White the luxury of maintaining tension until he can maneuver his pieces to their most effective squares.
31...g5?
Black tries to hold on by locking the pawns. As a result, he loses all flexibility and is still unable to prevent White from infiltrating his position.
32.Bc2
White realizes that the way into Black's position is along the h5-d8 diagonal, and starts maneuvering his bishop accordingly.
32...Bf7 33.Ng3 Nb7 34.Bd1 h6 35.Bh5 (D)
White hopes to make progress by removing one of the pieces that can protect Black's b5- pawn. White will then focus on the queenside again and target b5. After 43.Bg6
35...Qe8 36.Qd1 Nd8 37.Ra3 Kf8 38.R1a2 Kg8 39.Ng4 Kf8
Black avoids a trap: 39...Bxh5 40.Nxh5 Qxh5? 41.Nxf6+ loses the queen.
40.Ne3 Kg8 41.Bxf7+ Nxf7 42.Qh5 Nd8 43.Qg6 (D)
This queen penetration decides the game. White threatens to back his queen up with Ng4 and Nh5. The pressure on the f6- and h6-pawns will force Black to trade queens on g6, freeing the f5 outpost for a white knight.
43...Kf8 44.Nh5
If Black avoids trading queens with 44...Qe7, White will switch play over to the queenside again, starting with Bb6, and take control of the a-file. Exercise D13-1: After 44...Qe7 45.Bb6, Black can try to challenge the a-file with 45...Rxa3
46.Rxa3 Ra8. Does this work?
Black resigns, as he is being squeezed on both sides of the board. We are reminded of Dr. Tarrasch's famous saying that a cramped position contains the germ of defeat. 1-0 (D14) Artemiev - Hráček, Skopje 2019 [D32]

White has a strong knight on e5 against a bad bishop on c6. He has good development and is exerting pressure on f7, preventing Black from moving his knight. After 21.jif4 (D14) Artemiev - Hráček 2019
16...Bd8?
Black wants to move his rook back to f8, but cannot do so immediately as 16...Rf8 loses the a6-pawn to 17.Nxc6 bxc6 18.Qe2 with a double attack on a6 and e7. However, this move is ill- advised as it breaks the communication between Black's rooks.
17.Re3 Rf8 18.Rce1 Qb4 19.Qf5
White improves the position of his queen with a tempo on Black's rook.
19...Ra8
Black's rooks are back on their previous squares. White's centralized rooks stand in stark contrast to their counterparts.
20.Rd1
White chooses to protect his d-pawn but misses an amazing destructive sacrifice: 20.Bh6 gxh6 21.Qf4. The weakness of Black's dark squares and the fact that his dark-square bishop is poorly placed give White an overwhelming advantage.
20...Ne8
Exercise D14-1: After 20.Rd1, how does White win if Black takes the b2-pawn?
21.Bf4 (D)
White retreats his bishop and regroups in preparation for the final attack. Black's lack of development is striking. Even Black's queen is on the wrong side of the board.
21...Nf6 22.Rg3 Kh8 23.Rdd3
White moves his second rook up to the third rank. It is not often that one sees two rook lifts in the same game!
23...Be8
Black is helpless. He has nothing better than to resort to passive defense.
24.a3
Once again, White misses a destructive sacrifice, this time featuring a direct capture. Exercise D14-2: After 23...Be8, what should White play?
24...Qxb2 (D)
This move gives White another chance to carry out the same destructive sacrifice, but this time in a more spectacular manner.
25.Rxg7! Kxg7 26.Rg3+ Kh8 27.Nxd5!
The point. White undermines the knight's protection of g8.
27...Nxd5

ANSWERS -COORDINATION/CONTROL
Rotlewi-Rubinstein 1907 Exercise D1-1: If White chooses to block with 21.Ne4 instead, how does Black proceed? (D) Answer: Black plays 21...Qh4, threatening mate on h2. White now has two choices: 1) 22.h3 Rxd3!, undermining the protection of the knight. After 23.Qxd3 Bxe4, White's queen cannot guard all the threats: a) 24.Qxe4 Qg3 25.hxg4 Qh4#; b) 24.Qb3 Be3 interferes with White's defense of the third rank and forces him to give up his queen in light of 24...Qxh3#. 2) 22.g3 Qh3 (threatens ...Rxd3) 23.Bc2 Rxc2 24.Qxc2 Bxe4+ with mate to follow. D. Byrne-Fischer 1956 Exercise D2-1: Show how Black meets 18.Bxe6. (D) Answer: This leads to a smothered mate with 18...Qb5+ 19.Kg1 Ne2+ 20.Kf1 Ng3+ 21.Kg1 Qf1+ 22.Rxf1 Ne2#. Exercise D2-2: After 37.Ke1 (D), find a mate in four moves for Black. There are two ways to do this.

(D14) Artemiev - Hráček 2019 Answer: Amazingly, Black can trap White's queen with 32...Rxd6 33.Qxd6 Rd7. Note the importance of the g7-bishop, which takes away the e5, f6, and h6 squares from the queen. Exercise D4-2: If White promotes the pawn after 61...Nd4 (D), find a forced mate for Black. Answer: 62.a8Q Ne2+ 63.Kf1 Nf4+ 64.Kg1 f2#. Bai-Liren 2017 Exercise D5-1: If 25.Kf4 Rxf2+ 26.Kxe4, can you find a mate? (D) Answer: 26...Bf5+ 27.Kd5 Rd8+ 28.Nd7 Rxd7+ 29.Bd6 Rxd6#. Adams-Torre 1920 After 21.Bxb7? (variation) Exercise D8-1: If 17...gxf6, White can try to win material with 18.Rxe7. Does this work? (D) Answer: No. White is relying on Black's playing 18...Rxe7?, after which 19.Rxe7 Qxe7 20.Qg4+ would pick up the rook on c8. Instead, Black has a surprising reply in 18...Qxe7!. Now 19.Rxe7?? actually loses to 19...Rc1+
20.Ne1 Rxe1+ 21.Rxe1 Rxe1#.
Exercise D8-2: What happens if White plays 21.Qxb7 in yet another attempt at deflecting Black's queen? (D) Answer: 21...Qxe2! wins a rook. White cannot recapture. If 22.Rxe2, then 22...Rc1+ and the tables have been turned; it is now Black who delivers a back-rank mate, using an x-ray attack:
23.Ne1 Rxe1+ 24.Rxe1 Rxe1#.

[diagram]
After 14...b5 (13...Bd7 variation)
[diagram]
(D14) Artemiev - Hráček 2019 Answer: White wins with 40.Rxc4, setting up a triple attack on the c7-pawn. If 40...c5 for example, then 41.Rc3 Rg4 42.Qb8+ Kd7 43.Rd3+ Rd4 44.Rxd4+ cxd4
45.Qxa7+ and White is a clear piece ahead.
Wang Hao-Timofeev 2007 Exercise D10-1: In the variation 13...Qd7 14.Nc3, Black can stop Nc3-a4 with 14...b5. What then? (D) Answer: White sacrifices his knight with 15.Nxb5. After 15...axb5 16.Bxb5, White threatens to attack the pinned piece with Ne5. Black's best defense is 16...Rb8, but 17.Bxc6 Rxb3 18.Bxd7+ Kxd7 19.axb3 leaves Black down a pawn and without any development. Exercise D10-2: Can Black regain the piece with 27...Rxe6 instead? (D) After 27...Exe6 (variation)
[diagram]
Answer: No. After 27...Rxe6, Black runs into a pawn fork: 28.Rxe6 Qxe6 29.d5. Black cannot escape with ...Rc1+ or ...Qe1+ because the white queen on d2 controls both squares. Nor does pinning the pawn along the d-file help, as White's knight protects his queen. Karpov-Unzicker 1974 Exercise D13-1: After 44...Qe7 45.Bb6, Black can try to challenge the a-file with 45...Rxa3
46.Rxa3 Ra8. (D) Does this work?
Answer: No. White wins a piece with 47.Rxa8 Nxa8 48.Bxd8. The black queen is overworked: it cannot recapture on d8 without abandoning the protection of g7. Artemiev-Hráček 2019 Exercise D14-1: After 20.Rd1 (D), how does White win if Black takes the b2-pawn? After 23...Be8 After 27...Ng8 (variation)
[diagram]
(D14) Artemiev - Hráček 2019 Answer: If Black plays 20...Qxb2, White wins with a long forcing sequence in which every one of his pieces is involved: 21.Rb1 Qa3 22.Nxc6 bxc6 23.Ne4 (discovering an attack on the queen)
23...Qxa2 24.Nxf6+ Bxf6 25.Bxf6 gxf6 26.Rg3+ Kh8 27.Qxf6#.
Exercise D14-2: After 23...Be8, what should White play? (D) Answer: The destructive sacrifice 24.Rxg7 is deadly. After 24...Kxg7 25.Nc6 Bxc6 26.Rg3+ Kh8
27.Be5, mate will soon follow, for example 27...Qe7 28.Qg5 Rg8 29.Qxg8#.
Exercise D14-3: After 27.Nxd5, Black can try to defend with 27...Ng8. How should White continue? (D) Answer: White sets up a bishop check on e5 by removing the f7-pawn as a potential blocker:
28.Nxf7+! Rxf7 29.Be5+ Nf6 30.Nxf6 Bxf6 31.Qxf6+ Rxf6 32.Bxf6#.
Glossary
GLOSSARY
Active defense: When the defender chooses to employ a counterattack as a defensive technique rather than set up passively and attempt to cover his weaknesses. Active piece: A piece that is developed and is actively participating in the conduct of the game. Active pieces provide the basis for attack. Advantage, material: A preponderance in piece value of one side over another. See point count. Advantage, permanent: An advantage in material or pawn structure. Such advantages tend to be lasting. Advantage, positional: An advantage in time, space, mobility, pawn structure, or the control of critical squares. Advantage, temporary: An advantage that may gradually disappear during the course of a game, such as a lead in development. Back rank: The first rank for each player. The back rank becomes vulnerable late in the game if the rooks do not provide adequate coverage. Backward pawn: A pawn that constitutes the base of a pawn chain and whose forward movement is controlled by one or more enemy pawns on adjacent files. It is weak because it cannot be protected by other pawns. The weakness is significant only when it is subject to a frontal assault. Bad bishop: A bishop that is hemmed in by its own pawns. This occurs as the result of pawns on the color of the bishop's diagonal being immobilized by enemy pawns or pieces. Base of a pawn chain: The rearmost pawn in a chain is referred to as the base. It is the weakest link because it is not defended by another pawn. Battery: A lineup (on a single file or diagonal) of two or more pieces that move the same way, usually directed at a critical point in the enemy position. For example, the battery Qc2/Bd3 directs a two-piece attack against the h7 square. Bind: If a player is so constrained by enemy pieces that he finds it difficult to make useful moves, he is said to be "in a bind." See squeeze. Blockading square: The square directly in front of an isolated or backward pawn. The blockading square can also serve as an outpost square because a piece on that square cannot be chased away by pawns. Break: A pawn move that offers to trade pawns in order to increase control of space or free a cramped position. Broad pawn center: Three or four center pawns abreast. Indicates very aggressive intentions. The player facing such a center must play to restrain it and break it up. Also called "the big center." Buried piece: A piece that is hemmed in by its own pieces and pawns, and will have trouble finding a way to play an active role. Such a piece can also hinder the development of other pieces. Castle long; castle short: Castling on the queenside; castling on the kingside. Center break: A situation in which two or more pawns abreast on the fourth rank are attacked by an enemy pawn that seeks to disrupt this formation. Center fork trick: A series of moves in which one sacrifices a knight for a center pawn, knowing that the sacrificed piece will be recovered by a pawn fork and the opponent's central pawn structure destroyed in the process. Clearance move: A move that frees an occupied square for use by another one of your pieces. The new piece can put the vacated square to better use. Closed center: A center which is locked or fixed. See locked center and fixed center. Closed game: A game in which the center is closed. The piece that has the best mobility in such positions is the knight. See closed center. Combination: A precisely calculated sequence of forcing moves that leads to a permanent advantage. Compensation: What one gets in return for giving up something of value. One may sacrifice material or accept a structural weakness such as doubled pawns. Compensation for such sacrifices consists of acquiring an advantage of a different nature. Connected rooks: Two rooks on the back rank are connected when there are no other pieces between them. The power of the rooks is greatly enhanced in such situations. Consolidate: Sometimes it is necessary to "put one's house in order" before continuing with active operations. Consolidation may consist of adding extra protection to critical pawns or squares, improving piece placement, or taking care of king safety. Coordinated pieces: Pieces are coordinated when they work in concert, either to defend or to attack. They may protect each other, complement each other in attack, or supplement each other by covering a large number of critical squares. Dark-square bishop: The white bishop that starts on cl, or the black bishop that starts on f8. They always travel on dark-colored squares. Decoy: An offer of material in order to induce an enemy piece to change position. Destructive sacrifice: A type of sacrifice where you destroy the pawn cover or other piece protection around the enemy king. It usually signifies a point of no return. Development: Moving a piece out early in the opening to a square where it will play a more active role. Discovered attack: When a piece moves out of the way to expose an attack by the piece it was masking. Discovered attacks are dangerous because the piece that moves away can do so with impunity. Double attack: When a player makes two simultaneous threats, it is referred to as a double attack. It should be distinguished from a fork in that both attacks need not threaten the immediate capture of material. See fork. Glossary Doubled pawns: When two pawns of the same color occupy squares on the same file, they are said to be doubled. They are generally weak because they lack mobility. However, they can also be useful because they permit the use of an adjacent file. Draw: A tie game (neither player wins). A draw awards a half-point to each player and is scored as such when (1) there is insufficient mating material; (2) there is a stalemate; (3) a three-fold repetition of position is claimed; or (4) there is mutual agreement. Draw offer: A offer which, if accepted, ends the game and splits the point. The proper way to offer a draw is to say "Draw?" and make your move before starting your opponent's clock. You should not make a draw offer when your opponent is on the move. Dynamic play: Play is said to be dynamic when there are frequent structural changes that require a continual revision of strategy. This is usually brought about by tactical threats or significant changes in pawn structure. Exchange, the: The trade of a minor piece for a rook. The player who trades the minor piece is said to "win the exchange." Exchange sacrifice: This occurs when a player willfully gives up a rook for a minor piece in return for some form of compensation. See compensation. Expansion: Expansion increases the space that is directly under one's control. It is achieved by pushing pawns forward in an attempt to enlarge the boundaries of your territory. Fianchetto: The development of a bishop to g2, b2, g7, or b7. An Italian term that means "on the flank." Fixed center: A center which is occupied by multiple pawns and where some opposing pawns block each other. Pawn movement ispossible but not without being subject to capture. See closed center. Fixed pawn structures: Pawn structures with little or no mobility. The lack of pawn play makes it easier to predict strategy. Flag, hanging: The red flag on an analog chess clock is lifted slowly by the minute hand when a player has three minutes left to complete the moves needed to reach time control. When it reaches the final seconds, it is said to be "hanging." When it falls, the game may be forfeited. Flank attack: An attack on either the kingside or queenside. A flank attack has a greater likelihood of success when the center is closed. Fluid pawn structure: Pawn structures where further pawn movement is likely. Strategy is difficult to predict because changes in pawn structure often entail changes in strategy. Focal point: A weak square in the vicinity of the king which is targeted by the attacker and which the defender will find difficult to protect. The presence of more than one focal point makes an attack stronger. Fork: A form of double attack whereby a single piece threatens two pieces simultaneously. Frontal assault: A direct assault on an enemy pawn located on the same half-open file as one's heavy pieces. GM; IM; FM: Grandmaster; International Master; FIDE Master. Titles awarded by the Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE), the governing body of international chess competition. Good bishop: A bishop that is not hemmed in by its own pawns; a bishop with adequate scope. Half-open file: A file on which only one side has pawns. Such a file is closed to one player, open to the other. The player to whom it is open can amass heavy pieces on it and attack the enemy pawns. Hanging piece: A piece that is left unprotected and is subject to immediate capture. Hanging pieces will ruin the best strategy! Heavy pieces: The rooks and queens; major pieces. Sometimes called heavy artillery. Hypermodern strategy: A system of development that concentrates on controlling the center from a distance, rather than occupying it early with pawns. Inactive piece: A piece that is not actively involved in the conduct of the game. Initiative, the: The prerogative to control the course of action. To gain the initiative, you make a threat that your opponent must meet. To retain the initiative, you continue to operate with threats. Interference move: A move that obstructs the line of attack of an enemy piece. Isolated pawn: A pawn that stands alone without friendly pawns on adjacent files. It is generally weak because, like the backward pawn, it cannot be protected by other pawns. It is particularly vulnerable if it is subject to a frontal assault. Knight on the rim: A knight that is placed on the a- or h- files, or on the back rank. Unless it is performing aspecific task, its future is "dim." It may get trapped, or have trouble getting back to a centralized position. Light-square bishop: The white bishop that starts on f1 or the black bishop that starts on c8. They always travel on light-colored squares. Locked center: A center which is occupied by multiple pawns and the opposing pawns are interlocked. No pawn movement is possible. Magnet combination: A sequence of moves in which a winning attack is set up by drawing a piece to a vulnerable square. This is often done with a sacrifice. Also known as a Combination of attraction. Major piece: A rook or a queen. See Heavy pieces. Maróczy Bind: When White sets up a formation with pawns on c4 and e4 against the Sicilian Defense, he is said to have a "Maróczy Bind." The pawns suppress Black's freeing maneuver ...d5. This formation was introduced by the Hungarian grandmaster Géza Maróczy. Mating pattern: A move sequence in the middlegame or endgame that contains a recognized pattern for executing checkmate. Minor piece: A bishop or a knight. Glossary Minority attack: Attack by a pawn minority against a pawn majority, usually on the queenside. The idea is to force a pawn trade that leaves the opponent with a weakened pawn structure. Mobility: Being able to move. Time and space are two essential components of mobility. Open file: A file that is not occupied by pawns of either color. Major pieces have good mobility when placed on open files. Open game: Positions that are characterized by few center pawns and many open lines. They usually arise from openings where White begins with 1.e4. Long-range pieces have good mobility in such positions. Outpost: A safe square near enemy territory that is protected by one's own pieces and is subject to effective occupation. Passed pawn: A pawn that is unopposed by enemy pawns on its own file and the two adjacent files. Such a pawn is a candidate for promotion. Pawn center: Commonly refers to pawns that may occupy any of the four central squares (d4, e4, d5, e5). Pawns on adjacent files are also considered to be part of the center if they are connected to pawns that occupy these squares. Pawn chain: Two or more pawns of the same color standing adjacent on a diagonal. Only the rearmost pawn in the chain is not protected by another pawn. See base of a pawn chain. Pawn contact: Opposing pawns are in contact when they can capture each other. Maintaining pawn contact maintains the tension in a position, keeping open more options. Capturing resolves the tension. Pawn island: A cluster of pawns of the same color that is separated from the next pawn by at least one open file. The more islands, the weaker the pawn structure. Pawn storm: The action of advancing one or more pawns against the enemy king with the intent of breaking up his pawn cover. It is commonly used when the two players are castled on opposite sides of the board. Pin, absolute: A tactic whereby a piece is attacked and rendered immobile because moving it would expose the king to check. Pin, relative: A pin wherein the pinned piece may elect to move but its movement would lead to a loss of material or other unfavorable outcome. Point count: The prescribed value of each piece: Q=9, R=5, B=3, N=3, R=1. An advantage in the point count denotes superiority in material. Position: The disposition of the pieces on the chessboard at any given time. Positional mistake: A mistake that has no direct tactical consequences but still leads to a disadvantage by surrendering control of critical squares, losing time or space, or incurring structural weaknesses. Positional sacrifice: A sacrifice that yields no immediate tactical gain but still leads to a positional advantage. Quiet move: Sometimes played during an attacking sequence, aquiet move does not contain an immediate threat but sets up another, more aggressive move. Quiet moves can be the most deadly moves of all. Rating: The measurement of a player's performance, calculated by a generally accepted formula administered by an official organization such as FIDE (the Fédération Internationale des Échecs) or the United States Chess Federation (USCF). The USCF rates its players on a scale from 0 to 3000 (or more). A typical novice rating is 1000; a master rating is 2200 and higher. Redeploy: To maneuver a piece so that it has access to another square, file, or diagonal where it will be more effective. Restrain: To control the movement of enemy pieces in order to prevent them from getting active play. Rook lift: A maneuver that involves moving the rook off the back rank and up a few squares. The intent is to swing the rook over to another file so that it may assist in an attack without being impeded by its own pawns. Running: Moving the king rapidly from one sector of the board to another in order to evade an attack. Scope: The scope of a piece refers to the number of squares it has access to. A piece hemmed in by its own pawns is said to have limited scope. Sector: One way to look at the board is to divide it into three sectors: the queenside (a-, b-, and c-files), the center (d- and e-files), and the kingside (f-, g-, and h-files). Learning to focus on each sector separately will help to formulate strategy. Skewer: A tactic whereby an enemy piece that stands in front of another along a rank, file, or diagonal is attacked and thereby compelled to move. This exposes the piece behind it to capture. Space count: A numerical system whereby the number of squares that each player attacks in the other player's half of the board is counted. A square may be attacked more than once. Each time it is attacked, one point is allocated. The player who is ahead in the space count has greater mobility. Squeeze: The exploitation of a bind by gradually increasing the pressure on an opponent's position. This is accomplished by creating new threats until the defender is unable to meet them all. Strategy: Formulation and execution of a long-term plan, designed to improve one's position. Symmetrical pawn position: A position in which the pawns on both sides are on the same files. Symmetrical position: A chess position in which, if the board were to be folded in the center, all opposing pieces of the same kind would overlap. Symmetrical positions tend to lead to equality, unless the player on the move can find a way to break the symmetry advantageously. Tactic(s): A mode of action characterized by the use of threats to win material or to checkmate the opposing king. They are said to be "the means to an end" - the means to realize the culmination of a strategy. Tempo: A unit of time in chess. The plural is "tempi." The best method for gaining time is to develop with a threat. Glossary Tension: A position in which pieces and/or pawns square off against each other without capturing. In such positions, good nerves and exact calculation are essential for survival. Theoretical move, or "theory": A move recommended by one or more authorities on the theory of best opening play. Transposition: A transposition occurs when a position (usually an opening position) is arrived at through a different order of moves than normal. The player who is alert to possibilities of transposing to favorable opening positions has an extra weapon at his disposal. Trap: A sequence of moves that relies solely on tactics and frequently disregards strategic considerations. Traps usually succeed when one is not alert. They seldom work against the more experienced player. Value, dynamic: The value of a piece in a given position. This may be lesser or greater than the static value. Value, static: The given value of a piece. See "point count." Zugzwang: A situation in which the requirement to move on a player's turn can only result in a worsening of the player's position.
