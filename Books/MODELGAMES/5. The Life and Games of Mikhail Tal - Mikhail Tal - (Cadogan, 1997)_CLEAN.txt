Index of Opponents Index of Openings 6 7 8 Editor's Foreword Mikhail Tal was a remarkable man. His brilliant successes in the years leading up to his World Championship victory excited the chess world; his very name be came synonymous with brilliance and attacking flair. 'Misha' had a warm and engaging personality without a hint of malice. His en thusiasm for the game he loved was unquenchable. In his later years he was af flicted by severe health problems which would have crushed a lesser man, but he never complained about his difficulties and continued to play chess right up to his death. Misha hated to postpone a game; even if he had to slip out of his doctors' grasp, he would try to make it somehow. Despite his fragile appearance, his at tacking powers and astonishingly quick sight of the board remained intact. My last visit to him was in May 1992, just after he had returned from Bar celona, his last major tournament. He 'showed' me his fine win against Lautier, but was so weak that he had to lie on his back and dictate the moves and analysis 'blindfold' to me, while I played them over on a board. He died on 28th June 1992, and the chess world is a much poorer place for his absence. I was delighted to be asked by Cadogan Books to work on a new edition of his classic book The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal, which covers his career up to 1975 . This is one of those rare chess books which is not only splendidly instruc tive, but also conveys a real impression of the author's personality. There was relatively little for me to do apart from convert the moves to alge braic notation. I corrected some obvious misprints and errors (the incorrect dia gram for the game fragment on page 61 and the missed mate in one in the analysis of game 90 are typical examples). In some cases there were errors caused by mis prints, for instance the accidental omission of moves. I have corrected these with out comment Gust as an example, I have mentioned one as a footnote on page 1 50). Likewise, in about 20 academic cases, I have tidied up the end of a variation. I do not doubt that Tal would have agreed to these changes had he still been alive to go over the proofs. If there was any doubt about the analysis, or if the change was in any way significant, my remark appears as a footnote. To avoid confusion, I should explain that footnotes which are marked 'Editor's note' and 'Translator's note' are transcribed from the RHM edition. The unattrib uted footnotes are mine and appear for the first time in this edition. John Nunn Chertsey, June 1 997 Acknowledgements The chess world owes Cadogan Books plc a debt of gratitude for undertaking the monumental task of bringing this classic work by Mikhail Tal back into print. Since being first published in 1976 by RHM, and never reprinted due to the sub sequent collapse of the publisher, a whole generation has grown up who have never even seen a copy. Yet The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal is quite probably the greatest chess book ever written. I am sure that everybody involved in the in itial edition will be delighted that Tal's masterpiece is once again available to lov ers of chess world-wide. In this respect we must thank David Levy (the original editor), and everyone else involved in RHM's pioneering original edition. All of the game annotations are by Tal himself, except for games 8, 1 1- 1 3, 16- 1 8, 23 and 29 (done jointly by Tal and Koblents, his Latvian trainer) and games 87, 88 and 92 (done jointly by Tal and Kirilov). For this marvellous new algebraic version, Grandmaster John Nunn spent weeks transcribing the material from descriptive notation, checking the text and deciphering unintelligible variations. Ken Neat (who did so much fine translation work on the original version) has retranslated games 33 and 34 from Russian es pecially for this edition, and has also fully updated Tal's tournament and match record.

1 My First Steps
Dialogue between a chess player and a journalist (instead of an autobiography) Dramatis personae: A CHESS PLAYER. Mikhail Tal A JOURNALIST. Who knows, perhaps alias ... JOURNALIST. Well now, 'Shall we begin ? '. Did you think, on first sitting down at the chessboard, that you would at some time play a match for the World Championship? Incidentally, what do you recall of your first game ? CHESS PLAYER. Did I think . . . Probably not. Matches for the World Cham pionship are fairly rare events, and from the physical point of view it is simply not possible for many chess fans to take part in them. I say fans, because, after all, even professionals are chess fans. But about my first game. When one of us first plays chess, he is like a man who has already caught a dose of microbes of, say, Hong Kong ' flu. Such a man walks along the street, and he does not yet know that he is ill. He is healthy, he feels fine, but the microbes are doing their work. Something similar, though less harmful, occurs in chess. You have just been shown that the knight moves like the Russian letter r, the bishop diagonally, the castle (note, the castle, not the rook) in a straight line, while the queen (once again not the fyerz1 , but the queen !) - likes her own colour. You lose the first game. But at some time, if your father or elder brother or simply an old friend wants to be kind to you, then you win, and as a result feel very proud of yourself. A few days pass, and suddenly you involuntarily begin to sense that, without chess, there is something missing in your life. Then you may rejoice: you belong to that group of people without a natural immunity to the chess disease ... This is the way we all begin. And then - the same road; for some it is smooth, for others less so. But when you sit down to play a match for the World Cham pionship, then sometimes you recall that first game. I lost my first serious game. To my cousin. And when, for the first time in my life, I fell into 'scholar's mate' , it was a real tragedy, because at that time I 'Fyerz', derived from Indian, is the special Russian chess term for the queen - Translator's note.
18 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
considered myself to be an experienced player. The fact is that my elders were ex tremely kind, and while learning I had many more 'victories' to my credit than de feats. And then this tragedy. The first in the whole of my 10 years ... Then, for some completely different reason - it seems that I wanted to join a drama group - I entered the Riga Palace of Pioneers. In the corridor I suddenly noticed a sign on one of the doors: 'Chess Section' . Excellent! , I thought. I' ll go in and say to the man who is helping the others that my feelings have been hurt, and he will teach me and show me how to win. I went in. I wasn't shown anything straight away, but I stayed. I stayed, and be came fascinated, perhaps because I was very fortunate with my first chess teacher. His name, Yanis Kruzkop, will not be familiar to many chess players. But he has done a great deal for chess, since in all his pupils he has implanted, to put it stylis tically, a whole-hearted love for the game. After a few months of lessons I began winning against my elder brother. But - what a terrible thing - in doing so I did not feel any particular satisfaction, for I saw that he was not playing well. The time had come to seek stronger oppo nents ... JOURNALIST. Would you recallfor us, please, all your first games; the first in a tournament, the first against a master, the first to appear in print. CHESS PLAYER. Of course I first played against a master in a simultaneous display. The young master Ratmir Kholmov, who had just made a very successful appearance in the 1 947 International Chigorin Memorial Tournament, came to Riga, and therefore we were all highly intrigued. I won in, as it then seemed to me, combinative style.

At that time I had a fourth category rating, obtained at the Pioneers' Palace. It was a pretty low rating, but according to some unofficial data I was considered to be a promising player, and was allowed into the Championship. I started very well: three out of three. But then for the first, and, unfortunately, not the last time, I had to go directly from the tournament to hospital on account of scarlet fever. And on the same day that this occurred, a mass match over 100 boards was held in Riga between adults and young players. I played somewhere around board 45, and an indication of the way I was feeling can be gained from the fact that I was mated as White in about 8 moves. Incidentally, it was one of my three starting wins which first appeared in print, in the All-Union youth magazine Zatyeynik. Tal - Leonov Riga Junior Ch Semi-final, 1949 19 .l:r.f6!

Well? Did you cut the article out? CHESS PLAYER. No, I didn't- but I was very pleased with it! JOURNALIST. And had you reached the level where you would dream about games or adjourned positions? CHESS PLAYER. This happened to me even a little earlier, in 1947, and turned out excellently! In one of the innumerable tournaments at the Pioneers'
20 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
Palace I adjourned a game against Krapivner, a second category player, in what I then considered to be a hopeless position. That evening I tried everything I could in the position, for the resumption was the following morning. I could find noth ing, and so I decided that I would go in and resign. But during the night I dreamed about some unintelligible idea connected- I remember this clearly- with the ad journed game. On resumption I thought for some 10 minutes, and found it! But then, unfortunately, I dropped below 'that level', and never again in my life have I dreamed about an adjourned game. Then, by-passing the third category, I succeeded in gaining the second cate gory rating in my next tournament, and I now began to take a real interest in chess. And if we are still talking about 'firsts', then I must recall my first departure from Riga to the 'International', as we then proudly considered it, Tournament of Pio neers' Palaces of the three Baltic Republics. We had to travel to Vilnius, the capi tal of Lithuania. Our team was the youngest there. I, for instance, was only 12 years old. And in my first game against the Estonians my opponent was a very adult-looking 1 6-17 year old. Evidently the Estonian players had come only to win, which would ex plain the fact that their team was not altogether made up of Pioneers. And it was not at all surprising that the Riga team took last place, while on second board I scored only one point out of four. But it was this point that proved decisive, since I won against the Estonian player, and as a result the home team took first place. Probably because of this, for the first time in my life, I was awarded the prize for the most interesting game of the event, although I was highly sceptical about my creative success. The prize- a luxurious edition of Aleksei Tolstoy's book Peter the First - was very fine, but terribly heavy. And when it was presented to me, it seemed only slightly easier to drag it back to the table where our team was sitting, than it had been to win the award-winning game ... In the next year, 1949, I took part in official All-Union events for the first time, when I played for the Latvian youth team in the Championship of the Soviet Un ion. Incidentally, during the six years that my age allowed me to take part in youth events, I progressed from the last to the first board in our team. In my first game - it was in the match with Byelorussia- I won, but this success proved to be my only one. I recall a curious encounter from the tournament with the Lithuanian candidate master Mendeleevsky, which at one point shook my youthful belief in the irreproachability of the elite. The point is that a year earlier in the Match-Tournament for the World Cham pionship, Botvinnik had sacrificed a pawn in the Slav Defence, and had won very nicely against Euwe. At that time I frequently played this opening, and during the game I established the fact that Mendeleevsky and I were conscientiously My First Steps 2 1 following the steps o f Botvinnik and Euwe. In addition, I recalled very well that the theorists had condemned the pawn capture, and had recommended another move instead. In particular, Botvinnik had stated this in his notes to the game. And at the board I thought for a very long time, trying to disprove Botvinnik, be cause I thought to myself: surely Euwe, such an expert on theory, couldn't have made a mistake. In the end, 'boldly' following the Dutch Ex-World Champion, I also obtained a lost position, and lengthy thought led to my first loss on time and, thank God, this was the only one in all my years of chess. JOURNALIST. Does this mean that your 'single combat' with the World Champion began at this point? Or should account be taken of the summer of 1948, when you set off with a chessboard to play against Botvinnik, who had ar rived on holiday ? CHESS PLAYER. This story is widely known, and I always smile, however many times I hear it. But it is evidently time to explain that it is merely a story. It is true that Botvinnik, after winning the World Championship, took a holiday by the sea at Riga. I knew about this and wanted to play against him, but there the truth ends. When I told my family of my intentions they gently dissuaded me from issuing a challenge to the World Champion. But then your journalistic col leagues heard about it, and immediately 'placed' a chessboard under my arm, sent me off to play Botvinnik, and- how can there be any intrigue without women! introduced into the act a woman, who barred my way at the World Champion's door. In the following Youth Championship of the country I was already playing on a higher board for Latvia, and on this occasion I was taught an instructive lesson. We had to play a preliminary match with our contemporaries from the Russian Federation, for which we travelled to Yaroslavl. My opponent was a strong player, the very likeable Victor Golenishev, a future master. Our first game progressed with changing fortunes, and was adjourned in an ending slightly inferior for me. But analysis disclosed that I could obtain by force a position with a knight against two bishops, and nothing else on the board. Only relatively recently, eighteen months to two years previously, had I learned to give mate to a lone king with two bishops, and, naturally, did not sus pect that, having a knight, I would face any difficulties. Therefore, when this po sition was reached, I began trying to catch my opponent's eye, expecting an offer of a draw. But play went on, and still no offer, and after 10-12 moves I began to sense that it was not at all so simple. In the end I lost the game, and only managed to gain my revenge 11 years later in my second match with Botvinnik, when I won a similar ending (17th Match game, 1961- Translator's note).
22 The Life and Games ofMikhail Tal
A striking example of the benefit of youth tournaments! On that occasion, in Yaroslavl, we did not reach the final. But in the following year, as a result of a very interesting trip to Kishinyev- I had never before been so far away from home, and people looked at us as foreigners- we reached the final, since we defeated the Moldavian lads. There I played what was evidently the first successful ending in my life. Everyone thought that the bishop ending where I was a pawn up would be a draw, but we managed to find an interesting bishop ma noeuvre which gave White a forced win.

But here, taking into account the team's interests, our captain advised me to play quietly and reservedly. The results were immediately apparent! In the very first round, playing White in a well-known variation of the Caro-Kann Defence, I sacrificed a pawn according to theory - I considered that I had the right to do this- but then the normal continuation of the attack was to sacrifice two further pawns, and, in some cases, a rook. Bearing in mind what my captain had said, I began looking for a peaceful solution to the position, got into time-trouble and lost. This hap pened every time that I attempted to play reservedly and accurately. It was only when my opponents themselves thrust wild complications upon me, and I could not avoid them, that I was successful. My First Steps 23 Besides, I already considered myself to be quite an experienced player. At the end of 1950 I had made my debut in the adult Championship of Riga. In the quar ter-final I scored 12112 out of 13, and reached the first category norm, then from the semi-final I went through to the final. I finished the Championship with 9 points out of 19, somewhere in the region of 11th-14th places. However, it was something else that was rather curious. There were two masters playing in the final - Alexander Koblents from Riga, my future trainer, and, hors concours, the Muscovite Evgeny Zagoryansky, to gether with five candidate masters and 13 first category players. Against the mas ters I scored 1112 points, and was pleased with my defence of a difficult position against Zagoryansky. My score against the candidates was 3112, but against my fellow first category players- 4 out of 12! Nevertheless, I got through to the Latvian Championship, although this was my fourth tournament in a row and perhaps a little more attention should have been paid to my school work, especially since the third quarter of the school year was finishing. The tournament began not at all badly for me. In the first round I saved my game against Strautmanis in a way that I liked then, and still do- I fell into a trap, so as to then catch my opponent in it. I got into a difficult position as Black, but then found a combination, apparently overlooking a tactical blow, but in fact win ning my opponent's queen for rook and bishop by force. The game finished as a draw. In the second round I fairly quickly defeated the Liepaya player Gravitis, but then in the third round came a tragedy which thoroughly upset me. In my game against the candidate master Zhdanov I played, as I still consider, quite well. As Black in the Marshall Attack I carried out a fairly interesting combina tion. I allowed my opponent to obtain a second queen with check, but when he did this, it became clear that his position was quite hopeless; then, in an elementary won position, thinking that I could win just as I pleased, I simply blundered away a piece. There was still a draw to be had, but I completely went to pieces at this sudden turn of events, and lost the game. Following this I lost several more games, practically without a struggle, so that about six rounds from the finish I was firmly seated in one of the bottom places. But towards the end the spring holi days began. School gave me, as it were, time out to regain my strength, and in the remaining games I gained some five points, so that for the second successive time I shared 1 1th-14th places with 9 points out of 19. JOURNALIST. Were you thinking at this time about your chess future; not about the World Championship title, of course, but at least of the title of mas ter?
24 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
CHESS PLAYER. I'm afraid that this may now sound coquettish, but at that time I simply played chess and gained pleasure from it. JOURNALIST. But surely you wanted to do battle with famous players? CHESS PLAYER. Yes, of course, I very much enjoyed doing so. Even at that time I was occasionally able to do this, though only in simultaneous displays. My first such encounter was with Keres, our neighbour from the north, our idol. He came to give a simultaneous display against us, and although he was en gaged at that time in the battle for the chess crown, I considered it unethical to play against him in a normal display. I was, after all, a finalist in the Latvian Championship, a solid first category player. So I put my name down for a display with clocks, which Keres gave on 10 boards. He suffered two defeats- at the hands of future grandmasters Gipslis and my self. And I was very pleased with this game, not so much because I won, but more because I defeated Keres in the Botvinnik Variation. I thought that psychologi cally this would be a terrible shock for him, since Keres and Botvinnik were al ways considered to be, as it were, fundamental opponents at the chessboard. Time passed. Paul Petrovich and I played together in tournaments for several years. Once I asked him whether he remembered our first encounter. Yes, he replied, in Tallinn, in the match between Latvia and Estonia. No, I told him, earlier, in Riga, in a simultaneous display. Here Paul Petrovich admitted that he had completely forgotten this game - and I had thought that a defeat in the Botvinnik Variation would remain in his memory for ever ... In the following year, 1952, once again in the Latvian Championship, I ac quired that very nice habit, which is still with me, of losing my first game. Since this occurred in the opening 1 e4 e5 2 ti:lf3 tbc6 3 i.d3(??) ti:lf6 4 c3 where I was playing Black, I was upset and gained a further two noughts almost straight away. Then things turned for the better, I finished up in 7th place, and inflicted the only defeat on the Latvian Champion Pasman. In the Youth Championship of the Country our team had its usual troubles, while I was also concerned about the problem of my further education. I finished school at the age of fifteen and a half, since previously I had been accepted di rectly into the third year. I sent my application to the Law Faculty of the Univer sity, but they pointed out to me that I would finish University when I was 20, and according to the law I could be a Public Assessor, or fulfil certain other juridical functions, only from the age of 21, so after University I would have a year of en forced idleness. Then special permission was received from the Ministry in Mos cow, from which it appeared that I had the right to study at the Philological Faculty. I heard about this during the Youth Championships. I loved literature My First Steps 25 and had nothing against the idea. I flew home, passed the exam, and registered. Towards the end of the same year, I played for the first time in an adult team- 'Daugavi'- which took part in group two of the USSR Championship. Inciden tally, an amusing incident occurred there: I played a game, the result of which I do not know to this day. It was in the final round. I got into a bad position, but on resumption succeeded in confusing matters, and my opponent, losing his head in time-trouble, began to repeat moves. The repetition was somewhat veiled, but the same position oc curred three times. In accordance with the rules, I did not make my 55th move, but called the chief controller, and asked him to record the draw. But my oppo nent, in a very loud stentorian-like voice, said that I was a boy, that I had no idea of what was meant by repetition of position, and showed the controller his scoresheet. The controller took a quick glance, said that there had been no repetition, and told us to play on. My opponent emerged from time-trouble, then realised his ad vantage and won. Later I went up to the assistant chief controller, and asked him to explain things. We quickly set up the position, and decided that the repetition had occurred. What was I to do? Shortly afterwards, while I was wondering whether or not to submit a protest, the chief controller came up to me with tables in his hand, and began trying to persuade me that the game was of no great impor tance, that all the same our team would take third place, that all the same I would not win the individual tournament on my board, so that on the whole there was no point in creating a fuss. He went away, whereupon the other controllers came up and said that the chief controller had offended them, and that I should submit a protest. So I wrote one out, but then our train left, and therefore to this day I do not know the control team's decision. JOURNALIST. And who was the chief controller? CHESS PLAYER. Is it important? On a couple of subsequent occasions he was the chief controller of tournaments where I was playing. And both times, for some reason, I forgot to ask him what had been the result of that game ... But, to be honest, I very quickly forgot about it. Especially since I soon gained my first real success: in the Latvian Championship I took first place. Mind you, I couldn't avoid doing so. The point was that from 1951, each year for a period of five years, the Championship of the Republic was won 'according to tradition' by a first-year student from the U Diversity. In 5 1 Pasman from the Faculty of History, in 52 Klyavin from Physics-Mathematics, in 54 Klovans from the Faculty of Eco nomics, and in 55 Gipslis, so that when in 1953 I was the only first-year in the
26 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
Championship, victory came 'of its own accord'. I played well, although I lost to the master Koblents in a game which he remembers to this day. In that game I played the opening badly, but then he missed a tactical stroke, and in addition had very little time left on his clock, but here, in his time pressure, I played 'a tempo', and lost my queen. With his flag raised, Koblents made his 39th move, got up and prepared to walk away, thinking that the control had been reached. I warned him that he was mistaken. Koblents was most mistrustful of my words, but all the same he sat down and made another move a few seconds before the fall of his flag, whereupon I resigned. He then checked his scoresheet, found the mistake in it, and 'began to respect' me. By the way, at that moment we two were the only real challengers for first place, but then the Maestro, as Koblents was called by everyone, dropped back somewhat ... Youth as a whole did well in the tournament, so that when, in the autumn, after the Youth Championship of the Country where I succeeded in playing the fairly lively game against Birbrager given here, we set off for the Adult Team Champi onship of the USSR, the Latvian team appeared unexpectedly young, with 16 year-olds Tal and Gipslis, and 17 year-old Klovans. Only our leader, Koblents, and one other player, could be called experienced fighters. It was to Koblents that the witty Lithuanian master Vistanestskis addressed himself- 'What are you do ing? It is after 1st September, and time for children to be at school, and you are making them play chess!' Taking into account our previous rather poor perform ances, few saw us as potential finalists. We played with great enthusiasm, and not only reached the final, but even took fourth place there, ahead of the weakened, but nevertheless formidable, Ukrain ian team. On the third board Klyavin played splendidly, and as a result gained the master title. I also reached the master norm, but the All-Union Classification Committee considered it inexpedient to give the title straight away to two mem bers of the same team (and on board 2 I had gained less points than Klyavin). In stead I was granted the right to play a qualifying match with the then practically permanent Champion of Byelorussia, the master Vladimir Saigin. From the team tournament, the game with Korchnoi sticks in my memory; it was our first game. We played each other twice, but it was our first encounter in the opening round of the semi-final which so affected the score between us, which, as is well known, is not at all in my favour. Before the start of play I was naturally nervous: at that time Korchnoi was al ready considered to be a certain candidate for the grandmaster title. In an Alekhine Defence I obtained the better position, then saw a chance to increase the pressure, and a forced variation. I went in for it and ... adjourned the game with a minimal My First Steps 27 advantage for my opponent. On resumption I defended stubbornly, but all the same resigned towards the end of the first hundred moves. There was some con solation in the fact that in the final Korchnoi finished below me. JOURNALIST. At that time you were already having to play fairly important, and sometimes decisive, games. How did you manage in them ? CHESS PLAYER. At that time not very well, especially in team events when I was tortured by a sense of heightened responsibility. I tried to restrain myself, but to play 'not your own game', to play against yourself, is always difficult and un pleasant. Later, within eighteen months to two years, I began to succeed in deci sive games, perhaps because I realised a very simple truth: not only was I worried, but also my opponent. The year 1954 began for me with my first tournament game against a Grand master, none other than Keres. We travelled to Tallinn for the traditional friendly match, in which there was normally a hard battle on the men's boards, while on the two women's boards the ladies from Estonia always defeated ours. For some reason I, and not Koblents, was on board one, and when it became known that Keres would be playing, my team-mates gloomily joked that the number of our ladies' boards had become three: boards nine, ten and one. The surprises, some of them really touching, began as early as the station in Tallinn, when among those there to meet us we saw Keres. We, who were mainly lads, were taken in his car to the hotel, and for literally each of us he found a friendly, welcoming smile. The first round was played that evening. Our game began with the King's In dian Defence, and I remember that on the 6th move I had a strong urge to ex change queens. However, I did not want to play openly for a draw, and later I realised that I would have been unlikely to gain one against such a virtuoso as Keres. At a later stage I played sharply, Keres seized the initiative, and I admired the way that, in time-trouble, he left himself literally 3-5 seconds for his last move, and, having worked everything out, captured my piece, not fearing the series of checks which then commenced. Of course I lost the adjourned game, but I drew the second as Black, finding an unexpected move in a somewhat inferior ending. JOURNALIST. But all the same, you were a candidate master, whereas Keres was number two or three in the world. Wasn 't it frightening ? CHESS PLAYER. No, it was very interesting. JOURNALIST. And have you never been afra id of anyone ?
28 The Life and Games ofMikhail Tal
CHESS PLAYER. Before a game with Korchnoi, for instance, or with Spassky or Keres, against whom the score is clearly not in my favour, I might be nervous, feel uncomfortable or even afraid, but on sitting down at the board, I would forget about everything: I would become engrossed in the game. JOURNALIST. Did you ever head for a dra w from the very first move ? CHESS PLAYER. In all my life, only once. In the 1955 USSR Team Champi onship Semi-final, playing White against Korchnoi, after the moves 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5, I captured on d5. I was terribly ashamed, and from that time I swore: to play for a draw, at any rate with White, is to some degree a crime against chess. After the team match, the Latvian Championship was held. I was 'physically' unable to win it, since I was now in my second year of study, and I shared second and third places with Gipslis. Then in the summer I played the match with Saigin. At that time, in testing us, the Chess Federation was rather careful in its choice of examiners for those seeking the master title. It may be recalled that, a few months before becoming a Grandmaster and a candidate for the World Championship, Petrosian played such a match, as did Kholmov a little later. My match with Saigin proceeded in a very lively fashion. To this day the im pression has not left me that at some point the Byelorussian master simply felt sorry for me, and played the last few games at only half strength. The first game, which was very interesting, ended in a draw. Just at that time we were studying the so-called Belgrade Gambit, and in the Pioneers' Palace we rehearsed the most interesting and head-spinning variations. Of course, the decision to make this opening my main weapon as White against Saigin was clearly attributable, in the main, to the fact that I was only eighteen years old. In the second game I was a little careless in the opening, and lost in 17 moves. I won the third with roughly the same 'speed'. Then came a series of draws which we each secured in turn. The best game of the match was the eighth, which is given here, and which I won, but the tenth also sticks in my mind. In it the pieces were so amusingly placed, that you might have thought that it was being played by beginners! (see diagram on next page) 26 i.f4 ll':lfd7 27 i.e3 "fic7 28 "fia5 i.xc3 29 bxc3 l:ta4 30 "ili'b5 l:te7 31 l:ta1 i.a6 32 "fic6 "fixc6 33 dxc6 ll':lc5 34 l:txa4 ll':lbxa4 35 i.xc4 i.xc4 36 ll':lxc4 ll':lxc3 37 l:ta1 ll':l5a4 38 i.d4 ll':le2+ 39 !ittn ll':lxd4 40 :Xa4 ll':lxc6 41 l:ta6 l:tc7 42 ll':lxd6 b2 43 l:tb6 ll':lb4 44 l:txb4 l:tcl+ 45 !itte2 b1"fi 46 l:txb1 l:txb1 47 ll':lc4 If2.1h. The eleventh game could have been fatal. My opponent, who was coming back My First Steps Saigin - Tal Match for the title of Soviet Master (JO), Riga 1954 into the match, attacked. I defended, and by a simple exchange could have left myself with essentially an extra rook. To my misfortune, the idea of a fantastic ally beautiful win came into my head. I played for it, the situation grew tense, both kings were threatened with mate, and suddenly I discovered that the whole point of my combination lay in the move ii.f8-g5(!! !). Since bishops don't move that way, I had to resign. It was here that I had the unsubstantiated feeling that Saigin was not especially pleased with such a win, and that he played the next two games as if he were feel ing guilty. I managed to win them and this terminated the match ahead of sched ule, although we also played the final game. JOURNALIST. Two questions occurred to me in connection with this. All these attempts of yours to find more complicated wins have cost, and still cost you, more points than perhaps anyone else in the world. Surely life must have taught you something ? CHESS PLAYER. Yes, it probably has. Nowadays, in my opinion, this hap pens less frequently, but, you see, sometimes an idea occurs which is so interest ing that it proves stronger than me. I can recall the game with Veltmander from the match Russian Federation-Latvia, 1955, and that with Sveshnikov from the 1973 USSR Championship. But perhaps it is not worth recalling them? JOURNALIST. Yes, it is! CHESS PLAYER. Then concerning my game with Veltmander: he gave a last, dying check. I could have moved my king to b2, after which mate in three was in evitable, but from the aesthetic point of view this for some reason appeared unat tractive to me. I allowed him some play, and with difficulty gained a draw. An unpleasant situation arose, for I was simply unable to explain to my team-mates
30 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
what had happened. True, in my heart I remained faithful to myself, and only re gretted the fact that I had miscalculated. Otherwise everything would have been fine! JOURNALIST. The second question: when you were not awarded the master title, but it was suggested that you play a match, were you offended? CHESS PLAYER. Oh, no ... You see, I was so cocky that I thought that if there was to be a match, then I would win it. From the other events of that year I should like to mention the Youth Team Championship of the Country. I had by now ascended from last to first board in the Latvian team, and here I played for the first time against the leader of the Len ingrad team, Boris Spassky. The board one tournament was highly respectable: apart from Spassky and myself there were future Grandmasters Gufeld and Liber zon, and International Master Bagirov. Spassky and I had our own special race: he scored 7112 out of 9, and I half a point less, but I succeeded in carrying out a com bination, the idea of which I found pleasing: Tal - Visotskis USSR Youth Team Ch, Leningrad 1954 21 tDd5 This looks like an oversight. 21 ••• cxd5 22 \i'xd5+ li:Jf7 23 \i'xa8 .tc6 24 .tb6! ! axb6 25 l:tcl .txa8 26 l:txc7 l:tc6 27 :c1 :Xc7 28 :xc7 Black cannot complain about the material situation, but now all his pieces are badly placed. ••• tDcd6 29 lLld2 .tf8 30 .tc4 b5 31 .te6 �g7 32 a4 �6 33 i..xf7 lLlxf7 34 axb5 i..b4 35 tDc4 g4 36 l:ta7 gxf3 37 gxf3 i..xe4+ 38 fxe4 tlJgS 39 b6 i..cS 40 :a6 tlJe6 41 b7 1-0 The year was concluded at home, in Riga, by the Team Championship of the Country, only this time for adults. Here for the first time I won against a Grand master, the USSR Champion Yuri Averbakh. After this, still a candidate master, I My First Steps 3 1 drew a couple of games, and then received notification that I was a master. This change evidently had a bad effect on me, for towards the end I lost more games than I won or drew. 1955 was notable for my debut in the USSR Individual Championship. Before this there was, as usual, the Latvian Championship, but I was somehow living in anticipation of greater things, and regarded it as just an ordinary tournament. Be sides, the first-year student was not I, but Gipslis, and this explains everything! Therefore in the USSR Team Championship - there is no longer any need to distinguish between Youth and Adult, as my chess youth was over- I played on board 2, and the tournament was the first in which I went through without a defeat. JOURNALIST. Were you pleased by this? CHESS PLAYER. I was always indifferent to it. What did please me was the fact that I saved a very difficult ending against Lipnitsky.

The 'quarter' in which I played was called the Baltic Zonal Tournament, and was strong enough: the chess players from the Baltic and Byelorussia have always been, as they say, 'in the public eye'. Four of the eight een competitors subsequently became Grandmasters. Incidentally, it was there that for the first time in the All-Union arena (in the Latvian Championship it had

already happened once) I played a tournament game with a representative of the fairer (also sometimes called the weaker) sex: the USSR Ladies' Champion Kira Zvorikina scored one point; fortunately, it was not against me that she won. From the creative point of view, the tournament began very productively for me. Even all the draws- and in the first seven rounds I had as many as five- were at times simply head-spinning. Then came a decline and two highly annoying de feats, one of which occurred in the game with Lein, due to an incident which for me was atypical. He had very little time remaining, and, thinking over the prob lem of how to realise my advantage most quickly, I forgot all about the clock. Suddenly I saw the controllers approaching. 'What, have they never seen time trouble?', I thought, and accidentally glancing at the clock, noticed that my flag was about to fall, while Lein's minutes remained intact. In some 40 seconds I suc ceeded in making all 15 moves to the control, but in my haste the path I followed was not at all the one over which I had been thinking for so long. Be that as it may, but some 6 or 7 rounds before the finish my chances of suc cess had practically disappeared. In addition, my next three games were with my colleagues from Riga, all of whom were above me in the tournament table. How ever, sport is sport, and it was necessary to 'step over their dead bodies'. The end ing with Gipslis proved especially interesting. From the start my opponent played openly for a draw, knowing that this would not satisfy me. What was I to do? It would be suicide to rush into the attack against White's solid position, and after thinking over one move for 1 hour 40 minutes (! !), I voluntarily went into a diffi cult, perhaps even lost ending. On the other hand, the resulting position de manded energetic action on Gipslis' part, but he was unable to re-adjust, and Black obtained a counter-attack. In the adjourned position I succeeded in finding a study-like win.

At home, in Riga, the Semi-final proved a great surprise to me. Grandmaster Boleslavsky was playing there, as well as strong and experienced masters such as Furman and Korchnoi. Against the latter I had a considerably inferior individual score. Trying to 'win one back', I lost to him from a better position on the eve of the Semi-final in the Russian Federation-Latvia Match, and then again in the Semi-final. Up till then I had scored roughly 50% against him as Black, but would systematically lose to him as White. Psychology clearly played its part! Then, in such a strong tournament as this, I managed to assure myself of first place with one round to go. Several games are worth recalling, the one with Lebe dev, for instance, where I more consciously repeated the stratagem which had proved itself in the game with Gipslis. Here is a more 'traditional' game: Tal - Solovyev USSR Ch semi-final, Riga 1955 w 40 :Xg7+ l:txg7 41 .tg6+ �g8 42 'ifxh6 'ii' e7 43 .th7+ To see whether Black will move his king to f8, when 44 l:tg6 decides. 43 •••�h8 44 .tg6+ 'ili>g8 45 �cl White's attacking pieces are ideally placed, but he cannot make progress without a pawn breakthrough in the centre; it is for this reason that the king advances.

Game 1 Tal (12 years) - Zilber (15 years) Riga 1949 French Defence Every experienced chess player (and I, unfortunately, have every right to be considered one) is familiar with that strange feeling which he has when he sits down to annotate his early games. On the one hand, he plays through them with a sort of tenderness, just like an adult watching a film taken by his parents of his early years or even months, or looking through the fading photographs from a family album; on the other hand, whether he wants to or not, on almost every move his hand all but stretches out to attach a question mark. On the whole, I do not like an notating other people's games. The point is that I consider that it is very difficult to penetrate into a player's thinking, to guess the direction of the variations thought out by him, and therefore it is better to direct one's at tention towards one's own games. I prefer to make my annotations 'hot on the heels', as it were, when the for tunes of battle, the worries, hopes and disappointments are still sufficiently fresh in my mind. Much as I would like to, I cannot say this about these few games which will be given below. In fact, if the annotator should begin to use phrases of the type: 'in reply to ... I had worked out the following vari ation .. .', the reader will rightly say 'Grandmaster, you are showing off', since the 'oldest' of these games is now more than 25 years old, and even the 'newest' more than 20. Therefore, I would ask you not to regard the fol lowing 'stylised' annotations too se verely. The game given below was played in the Championship of the Rig a Pal ace of Pioneers, just at the time when the 'Golden Age' of young Latvian chess players was beginning. If I re member correctly, A. Gipslis and Y. Klovans, who were to become quite well known masters within a few years, played in the Palace, while I was making my usual unsuccessful at tempt to obtain first category rating. On looking through the following game, it will be easy to see why this attempt was unsuccessful.

However, in the present case I don't consider that any detailed analysis of the opening system is necessary. 7 dxc5! This continuation is possibly the strongest rejoinder. If we use the 'ret rospective method', it can be supposed that the white player (who at that time already had a reputation as a tactician) simply did not care for the prospect of the queens being exchanged at some stage (after the capture on d4). 7 .•• i.xc5 8 lbe4 lbge7 Because of the unpleasant threat of the knight's intrusion on d6, Black cannot keep his bishop. 9 �g5! I like this move even now; it em phasises the bad position of the black queen, while keeping the bishop under attack. 9 . . . 'iVg4 While there is no denying that this is a clever reply, 9 ...b6 was neverthe less the lesser evil, although even in this case after 1 0 lbxc5 bxc5 1 1 'ikd6 Black's position is unenviable. 10 1i'd3 b6 (D) The inclusion of the moves 1 0. .. lbb4 1 1 1i'e2 would not help Black.

Such a critical assessment is by no means a sign of the sceptical atti tude of a venerable Grandmaster to his young inexperienced namesake. If I w had had to annotate this game 25 years ago, the verdict would have been the same. It is difficult to believe that White should miss the chance to win the game immediately using 'arith metic': 1 1 h3 'ikf5 (1 l...'ikxg2 1 2 lth2)

The opponent is still blissfully un aware.

No doubt the idea of placing the bishop en prise appeared so tempting that other possibilities did not occur to me (unfortunately, this disease from my youth sometimes recurs even now). On the other hand, if this is the case, then the question arises as to why did White not play i.f6 a move earlier, when at any rate it was less risky. I am absolutely sure that my op ponent's reply came as a surprise to

In the first place, the di agonal is opened for White's bishop, and in addition the black pieces are denied the use of the important e5- square.

Underestimating the enemy's threats was a sin of Zither's even in youth. It appears that now was the last chance for Black to move his king away. After 20 . . .'it>h8 the advantage is still with Black. In this case White evidently does best to continue 2 1 ltlxf7+ (the following spectacular line fails: 2 1 h5 ltlh4 22 l:txh4 'ii' xh4 23 l:td8 i.e6 ! ) 2 1 . . .l:txf7 2 2 i.xf7 i.b7 (the attempt at counter-attack 22 . . .

higher than the number 'found' . I can not say this about myself. Very often carelessness or indifferent technique has prevented me from achieving vic tory in positions which one can confi dently regard as being won, but there have also been a number of examples of a different sort. From my very first steps in chess I have been an 'opti mist' . I think that the reader will al ready have realised this, after playing through my game with Zilber. The ex ample given below is of the same type. On this occasion, it is true, the ratings of the players were higher - both had first category. Moreover, if one looks ahead, the following games come to mind: the 3rd and 4th games with Smyslov in the 1 959 Candidates Tour nament, the 3rd and 17th games from the first match with Botvinnik (inci dentally, the second of these is the most similar to the game which the reader can now see), and the game with Portisch in the 1964 Amsterdam Interzonal. This list could easily be extended if one so desired. There is no doubt that my oppo nents in these games had every justifi cation for complaining about their bad luck. I hope, however, that I in some way 'contributed' to this bad luck.

3 �c3 �6 4 f3 My opponent was very fond of ac cepting pawn sacrifices. Thus he regularly chose the McCutcheon Vari ation of the French Defence. He would capture the pawn on c3 and be prepared to defend for a long time for the sake of it. In view of this, White's choice of opening seems to me to be unfortunate, especially since, as is shown by the further course of the game, he has no feel for this variation. 4 ••• dS A characteristic analogy. At roughly this time V. Korchnoi was not infre quently trying to vindicate this idea. 5 fxe4 dxe4 6 i.c4 Not without justification, theory considers 6 i.g5 to be the strongest move in this position.

Game 3 Tal - Pasman Latvian Championship 1 953 Sicilian Defence The game given below was played in the tournament which brought me my first really important success. There was always a very tense struggle for the Latvian Championship, and to take first place in it was a far from easy matter. Running ahead a little, I remember how in 1 9S 8 the twice Champion of the USSR M. Tal had to be satisfied with third place in the Championship of the Republic. How ever, in the 19S 3 Championship I was the undisputed favourite. This had nothing to do with chess strength - at that time I had first category rating, while there was one master and about 1 44 \i'g7 ! wins at once, e.g. 44 . . . \i'gS 45 g3+ �h5 46 li'h7+ li'h6 47 l:.e5+.

10 candidate masters in the tourna ment, or, to express it in the modem way, my individual rating was far from being the highest. Simply, com mencing in 1 95 1 , there was an unwrit ten tradition in our Championships that the winner should be a first-year student. In 1 95 1 it was M. Pasman, in 1 952 Y. Klyavin, and in 1 953 I was the only frrst-year taking part. Following the same tradition, the next year Y. Klovans took first place, and then A. Gipslis. I succeeded in repeating my achievement in the Championship only 12 years later, when the tradition had been forgotten, and young players did not in general reach the final of the Championship of the Republic. My opponent was one of the strongest players in Latvia, and had al ready successfully competed in the USSR Championship Semi-final. M. Pasman likes to play to a clearly de fined positional plan, and so it was with particular pleasure that I strove in this game for tactical complications, reckoning that only in this way could I hope for success.

In view of the threat of 25 g7 +, Black has no time to capture the mo mentarily enlivened bishop.

This is the position that White had in mind when he made his 2 1 st move. It seemed to me that it would not be easy for Black to co-ordinate the ac tions of his knights (at any rate, in the game Pasman did not succeed in doing this). Now, for instance, 27 ... 'iWdl + 28 �h2 'iWd6 fails to 29 g8'iW+ .l:.xg8 30 .l:.t7+. 27 . . . e4 28 l:tf5 is also bad. The refutation of White's idea lies in the move 27 . . . Wi'e6 ! .

29 'ili'g6+ 'itg8 30 h6 A rather curious position has arisen. Black is in an unusual form of zugzwang : his knights are tied to de fending each other, while his queen is forced to guard the square t7.

Thus, for instance, in preparing for a game with Fischer (up till 1 972), one could have no doubt that, in reply to 1 e4, the Najdorf Vari ation of the Sicilian Defence would definitely be played. This was con firmed by literally all the American Grandmaster's games, beginning with childhood competitions. Karpov, from his early years, has had a marked an tipathy to Indian set-ups, and in reply to 1 e4 normally chooses l .. .e5 (more rarely l . . .c5). Other players, such as Spassky, Korchnoi and Larsen, regu larly vary their openings as they think fit. The game given below is one of my first attempts at playing a compli cated opening system, with which subsequently certain theorists even as sociated my name. Up till 1953 I nor mally adopted the Slav Defence, the Nimzo-Indian and the King's Indian, less frequently the Dutch, and very rarely the Griinfeld. As far as I re member, in one of the issues of Shakh maty v SSSR at that time, the game Boleslavsky-Nezhmetdinov from the Championship of the Russian Repub lic appeared, in which Black treated the system with 2 .. . c5 in very interest ing fashion. This game appealed to me, and I began occasionally, and then fairly regularly, to adopt it in tourna ments.

Two years later, in the USSR Team Championship (this time for adults), the Uzbekistan player played the open ing very accurately, and I think that it was he who introduced a continuation in one of the topical variations, which is even nowadays considered to be the strongest. A further 1 0 years passed, and once again, also in the US SR Team Championship, I succeeded in winning a game which was not with out theoretical interest (though not as a result of the opening). To return to our first encounter, it should be noted

It was in this way that R. Nezhmet dinov developed his queen's knight (to be fair, in a different position). Nowadays it has been known for a long time that Black obtains a com fortable game by continuing 9 . . .a6 1 0 a 4 i..g4, exchanging o ff White's po tentially strong knight (which could otherwise move to d2 and then c4 ). In particular, this has been confirmed by several of my games (e.g. Mititelu Tal, Reykj avik 1 957 and Donner-Tal, Zurich 1 959). 10 lbd2 lbb4 Strictly speaking, the knight is badly placed on this square, as would be emphasised by the retreat of the bishop to b1, after which Black cannot play 1 1 . . .a6 because of 1 2 a3, while the fact that White's e-pawn is de fended frees his king's knight to con tinue the manoeuvre begun with his tenth move. 11 .te2 .:te8 12 a3 In the light of what was said earlier, it must be concluded that 1 2 f3 is stronger. 12 lba6 13 l%e1 (D) A loss of time - the knight on d2 is still 'occupied' .

The move made by White turns out to be a blank shot. 16 ... a6 17 llJxc7 17 llJa7 would have been more con sistent. True, after 17 . . . i.b7 1 8 llJc6 i.xc6 19 dxc6 d5 ! Black's position appears to me to be quite acceptable. 17 .•• 'flixc7 It becomes clear that White is un able to prevent the intended advance of the b-pawn. True, as it turns out, this figures only as a threat until the very end of the game. 18 l:[a2 White moves his rook out of range of the dark-squared bishop, and pre pares to meet 1 8 . . .b5 1 9 axb5 axb5 with 20 b4. Although Black has a very comfortable position in this case (20 .. . c4 ), I decided to attempt to ex ploit the fact that my opponent was somewhat behind in development, and so initiated play on the kingside, reck oning that the move . . .b5 would not run away. 18 ••• 'flie7 19 f3 A clever trap.

O n closer inspection, however, it turns out that after 22 llJe4 ! i.xe1 23 i.g5 White gains the advantage. But both 19 . . .b5 and the move made by Black are quite good. 19 ••• 20 ttJn llJhS fS The absence of White's rook from the first rank gives Black additional chances along the e-file, and therefore White must avoid it being opened. 21 i.d3 f4 These days I would have preferred 2 1 .. .i.d4+ or, if you will excuse the repetition, 2 1 .. .b5. 22 g4! When I made my previous move, the remainder, as I recall, seemed per fectly clear: 22 . . . i.e5, 23 . . .g5 and so on with a mate, but White introduces certain obstacles. 22 ••• i.d4+ The exchange on g3 followed by 23 . . . i.h3 would have been quieter, and, possibly, stronger, but Black felt obliged to take immediate action. 23 'iii> hl!

This would appear to be the first occasion on which I made a positional sacrifice of a queen for a knight. 29 lNxf3 i.xf3 It is easy to see that Black does have certain compensation. Both his bishops have taken up threatening po sitions, and at the first opportunity his knight will come into play with great effect. The most immediate and trans parent threat is 30. .. lle5 and 3 1 ...lNg3+. It is against this that White's next move is directed. 30 h4 After the conclusion of our game, it naturally became the subject of a lively discussion, in which both the members and the trainers of the youth teams took part. Unfortunately, I can not remember all the variations which appeared as a result of this analysis, but apparently the conclusion was reached that Black had not risked a great deal. Now, however, I am not nearly so confident about the irre proachability of Black's operation. Thus 30 i.d2 deserves serious atten tion, aiming to eliminate as quickly as possible the enemy's dark-squared bishop. The line 30 ... lle5 3 1 h4 i.xg2+ 32 c.ttxg2 f3+ 33 c.ttxf3 11f8+ 34 c.tte2 is not dangerous for White, since his king finds safety on the queenside.

And yet, how many times does it happen that, in a completely won posi tion, a blunder radically changes every thing that only a minute previously had seemed absolutely clear. Looking back on my tournament career, I can recall a number of such extreme oc currences. The most recent of these was in the 42nd USSR Championship, when I allowed undivided first place to slip from my grasp. It was in my game with Vaganian. The exchange and a pawn up, I feel puzzled: why does my opponent continue playing? One slight mistake, a second, more serious one, yet another, and the miraculous happens - I have to agree to a draw. By all accounts, it is a premature weaken ing, a laziness which suddenly occurs at that moment when there is only a little more to do, and is one of the in nate short-comings of a player which reveals itself fairly frequently. The fol lowing game serves (more accurately, could have served) as evidence of this.

6 d4 Young players are very fond of try ing to catch their opponents in pre pared variations. At the time of this game I used to carefully follow chess periodicals, and in the magazine Shakh maty v SSSR (of the existence of oth ers I had no suspicion) I saw some analysis, if I remember correctly, by G. Geiler, in which the author showed that after 6 . . .exd4 7 e5 lt:le4 8 lt:lxd4 lt:lc5 9 lt:lf5 O-O 10 'ii' g4 g6 1 1 i.h6 l:te8 ( l l .. .d5 12 lt:lxe7+ 'ii' xe7 1 3 i.xf8 'iii xf8 ! was only written about later) 12 lt:lc3 lt:lxa4 1 3 lt:ld5 ! White obtains a most dangerous attack. It was this variation which served as my guiding star. Alas, my opponent, a player from an older generation, did not subscribe to the magazine. 6 exd4 7 eS lt:ldS 8 lL\xd4 The other possibility here is 8 c3 but after 8 ... lt:lb6 White has to demon strate that he. has any advantage. 8 lt:lxd4 9 'ii' xd4 lt:lb6 (D) 10 'ii' g4! ? Thus and only thus ! I had not yet got as far as realising that after 10 i.b3 O-O 1 1 i.f4 White's position is clearly preferable. Meanwhile the 'non-theo retical ' 7 . . . lt:ld5 had to be refuted, and w if, in order to do this, one had to sacri fice a piece, all the better. As 10 . . .O-O is ruled out because of 1 1 i.h6 I con sidered that the gift had to be ac cepted. Strictly speaking, this is not quite so. 10 ...g6 was possible, although in this case it is difficult for Black to complete his development after 1 1 i.h6. Straume chooses the strongest move. 11 ikxg7 12 i.b6 lL\xa4 l:[f8 White's plan is perfectly clear: to capture the h7-pawn, and, 'keeping in reserve' the possibility of capturing the rook, quickly develop his pieces, preparing in some cases the advance of his f-pawn. Black must aim rapidly to mobilise his queenside, so as to evacuate his king there at the first op- portunity. 12 . . . dS Black's forces are seriously re stricted by the white pawn on e5 . In view of this, 12 . . .d6 deserved consid eration, even though this opens the My First Steps 5 1 central files. However, the move made by Black should not be criticised. 13 'ili'xh7 i.d7 But this is too quiet. Black develops his pieces in the wrong sequence. White's task would have been much more difficult in the case of 1 3 . . . 'ii' d7 with the unpleasant threat of 14 ... 'ii' f5 .

Riga receives the par ticipants in a most important event - the Team Championship of the USSR. Petrosian, Taimanov, Averbakh, Kor chnoi and other experienced players lead their delegations. It is easy to imagine the apprehension of a young player, finding himself for the first time in such company. Not long be fore this I had succeeded in winning a classification match for the title of master against the Byelorussian player V. Saigin by 8-6, and although for mally I took part with the 'rank' of candidate master, the decision was ex pected to arrive literally at any day. It is quite natural that the 'Daugava' team did not place great hopes on the results of its leader. That is how it worked out in the end - a win in the first round proved to be the only one. Every player has his memorable games and tournaments. Without doubt, the first board tournament in Riga was the strongest I had played in, and the game given below was my third en counter with a grandmaster (if, of course, you do not include fairly suc cessful performances against them in simultaneous displays). In the spring of the same year I had been fortunate enough to play against the then legendary Keres in Tallinn,

On this occasion the Moscow Grandmaster chooses a little- 1 e4 2 lbf3 3 tLlc3 eS tLlc6 It was by no means a striving for a draw which caused White to choose this move, which enjoys such a peace ful reputation. For all my shortcom ings, I can truly say that only once in my life have I played for a draw with White - against Korchnoi in the 1955 USSR Team Championship: 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 . I achieved my goal, but only with great difficulty. I wanted to try out, against a strong player, a sharp variation, known to theory as the Belgrade Gambit. 3 lLlf6

5 lbd5 This variation, or, more correctly, one of its branches: 5 . . . tLlxe4 6 'ili'e2 f5 7 i.f4, was one of the hobbies of the chess section of the Palace of Pio neers.

2 A Young Master
1956 began with my first appearance in the Final of the USSR Championship, which on this occasion was unfortunately rather weakened. At that time all our leading players would normally take part in the Championship, but this was the year of the Candidates Tournament, and so all those seeking the chess crown, with the exception of Spassky, preferred to rest. I started well; in particular, one of my victories, that over Simagin, appeared in all the chess periodicals, although there was only one move in it which proved dif ficult. w Tal - Simagin USSR Ch, Leningrad 1956 Black is trying to drive the knight away, but White does not even think of re treating: 12 &i)xf7 �xf7 13 f5 dxe5 14 fxe6+ �xe6 15 ltb1! ! It was after finding this move in his preliminary calculations that White decided to sacrifice the knight; on 15 . . . 'fia6 there can follow 1 6 1i'g4+ �d6 17 dxe5+ �c7 1 8 i.f4 and on 15 ...

It was here that the one-sided nature of my play revealed itself. Instead of a quiet, purely technical realisation of my advantage, I decided to include my king in the attack, planning to march him along the route gl-f2-g3-h4-h5-g6. In the end this was successful, but on the way Simagin could have gained a draw. A Young Master 61 In the sixth round came the important encounter with Spassky. It was clear that on his 'home ground' (the Championship was held in Leningrad) it was Boris who had the support of the spectators; I did not like this, and I played somewhat strangely: first limply (in the opening), then over-sharply (in the middlegame). Spassky won very 'cleanly' . After this my play deteriorated. I won one game, drew a few, and lost one, but there were practically no good games. I say practically, because in the final round I nevertheless succeeded with a rather complicated combinative attack. Tal - Tolush USSR Ch, Leningrad 1956 15 .1Lb5!?

Following the tournament, the reviewers considered that a share of 5th place was not bad for a fust appearance, but I myself was dissatisfied. Since the Cham pionship, as has already been said, was weakened, and since the competitors were, in the main, winners of the Semi-finals like myself, I had hoped to do better. In the first instance, in the creative sense. Thus, for instance, in my game against Taimanov, an extra piece proved insufficient to win: I was deceived by the 'shuffling' of the pieces. Although similar 'presents' were also made to me, one forgets about them, whereas one remembers one's own mistakes for a long time ...
62 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
Soon after the Championship I had my first trip abroad. With the USSR Stu dent Team I set off for the World Championship in Sweden. There were a great number of new, colourful impressions, plus the special character of the 'Little Olympiad' - everyone was young and good-humoured, and got on well together, while the language barrier was overcome 'from the first move' - all this sticks in my mind for ever. From the point of view of the result, our team, which consisted entirely of fu ture Grandmasters, won easily. I was awarded the prize for the best result on board 3. Of interest was my game with lvkov, which is given here. The year 1956 ended somewhat dramatically. Despite a poor result in the match between Latvia and Estonia, I was considered favourite for the USSR Championship Semi-final in Tbilisi. I will not now undertake to explain what was at the bottom of it, but the tournament turned out to be extremely difficult for me. After 12 rounds my column of the tournament table showed one win (and good ness knows, the victory was not exactly convincing in an ending with four queens against Kasparian), two zeros and nine ( ! !) draws. In addition, the defeats were extremely vexing, being the result of bad blunders. The one thing that cheered me up was a stubborn and successful defence as Black against Korchnoi in our game from the 12th round. Once again around the hundred-move mark ( !), the game ended in a draw, and even now I do not know whether it was to this that I owed my spurt at the finish: 6 out of 7. As a result I succeeded in 'catching hold' of the last step on the finalists' train departing for Moscow. However, it is not impossible that a part was played by a conversation with my trainer Koblents, who was appearing in the same Semi-final. He had played well in these 12 rounds to be amongst the leaders, and I jokingly said to him: 'Don't be upset Maestro! We will still be going to the Final together, only this time I will be your second' . Towards the end Koblents faded, and in the Final 'tradition was maintained' . On to January 1957 . The Championship of the Soviet Union was a strong tour nament and very interesting indeed from the creative point of view. I do not say this because I succeeded in winning, but because that is how it really was. Tolush, for instance, gave several brilliant examples of attack; the experienced Bronstein and Keres played with enthusiasm; and it was here that the normally reserved Petrosian demonstrated that he was able - and how ! - to pl!iy 'open' chess. He lost several (for him) games, but was able to win even more. I also succeeded in winning several interesting encounters. Contrary to normal practice, the start of the tournament went well for me: the game with Aronson is given here. Then I won three further games in a row, including A Young Master 63 one against the previous year's Champion Taimanov, and my first ever game against my idol Bronstein, whose play has always been for me an example, and if you like - a yardstick. The fourth victory, against Bannik, continued the gallery of my games, already quite long, where my opponent set a trap and I fell into it, but in doing so I continued the variation for a further few moves, which allowed me to find a 'hole' in the trap. I dropped my first half point in the fifth round, and, of course, it was in my game with Korchnoi, while in the sixth round I was drastically punished by Nezh metdinov for incorrectly assessing the position. The following could have been my best game in the Championship. After in teresting complications this was the position reached: Tal - Antoshin USSR Ch, Moscow 1957 I sacrificed the exchange: 25 l:.xb2 ltJxb2 26 1i'd5+ �h8 27 1i'd4 l:.xd7 28 'ii' xd7 l:.g8 29 ltJgS h6 30 tiJf7 + 'ii? h7, and here I thought that in the variation 3 1 'ii' f5+ g6 3 2 'ii' d7 gxh5 3 3 lDg5+ �g6 34 'i'e6+ �xg5 35 g3 h4 3 6 f4+ 'ii? h5 I could not play 37 g2( ! ! !)-g4, because Black would take en passant. About the fact that the pawn was already on g3, and that the mate by 37 g3-g4 is quite legal, I somehow forgot. After the game (not having found a mate, I quickly won back the exchange and agreed a draw) this was naturally pointed out to me by Geller, Bronstein, and someone else, and then I really went to pieces. There followed four draws in a row, which is nothing to boast about, and then a game against Boleslavsky ad journed in a poor position, which in the end I lost. By the adjournment day my mood improved significantly, for I succeeded in winning an interesting game against Petrosian. Then things got better. I managed to defeat Keres (the game is given in the book), who was leading at the time, in

positional style, which was a surprise even to me, and went ahead together with Bronstein. In the following round, the 17th, I played a game which brought me half a point, enormous satisfaction, and a special prize. Tal - Aronin USSR Ch, Tbilisi 1957 Queen's Gambit

Greatly inspired, in the next round I sacrificed a piece against Gurgenidze and won in 27 moves, then there followed two draws, so that before the last round three of us were sharing first place: Bronstein, Tolush and myself. My last round opponent was Tolush, while Bronstein had to play Kholmov, against whom 'by order' no one won at that time, so that a draw would assure me of a share of first place. I'll go back just a little. In the penultimate round I had drawn with Kholmov as Black, while my opponent needed to win in order to reach the Grandmaster norm for the second and last time. He tried very hard, but around move 30 the position had become so simplified that I allowed myself to begin peace negotiations. Kholmov very sharply rejected the offer and sank into thought for an hour, during which time I began imagining all sorts of terrible things. Then he raised his eyes from the board, said 'Draw ! ' , and we began analysing. To the question, what had he been thinking about for so long, Kholmov replied: 'About how I will win to morrow as Black against Bronstein .. .' JOURNALIST. It is perhaps not convenient to interrupt you at such a crown ing moment, but I would, nevertheless, like to know whether extraneous thoughts ever enter your head during a game ? CHESS PLAYER. Oh yes ! For instance, I will never forget my game with Grandmaster Vasiukov in one of the USSR Championships. We reached a very complicated position where I was intending to sacrifice a knight. The sacrifice was not altogether obvious, and there were a large number of possible variations, but when I conscientiously began to work through them, I found, to my horror, A Young Master 65 that nothing would come of it. Ideas piled up one after another. I would transport a subtle reply by my opponent, which worked in one case, to another situation where it would naturally prove to be quite useless. As a result my head became filled with a completely chaotic pile of all sorts of moves, and the famous 'tree of variations' , from which the trainers recommend that you cut off the small branches, in this case spread with unbelievable rapidity. Then suddenly, for some reason, I remembered the classic couplet by Korney lvanovich Chukovsky: Oh, what a diffi cult job it was To drag out of the marsh the hippopotamus. I don't know from what associations this hippopotamus got onto the chess board, but although the spectators were convinced that I was continuing to study the position, I, despite my humanitarian education, was trying at this time to work out: just how would you drag a hippopotamus out of a marsh? I remember how jacks figured in my thoughts, as well as levers, helicopters, and even a rope lad der. After lengthy consideration I admitted defeat as an engineer, and thought spitefully: 'Well, let it drown ! ' Suddenly the hippopotamus disappeared, went from the chessboard just as he had come on - of his own accord ! Straight away the position did not appear to be so complicated. I somehow realised that it was not possible to calculate all the variations, and that the knight sacrifice was, by its very nature, purely intuitive. Since it promised an interesting game, I could not re frain from making it. The following day, it was with pleasure that I read in the paper how Mikhail Tal, after carefully thinking over the position for 40 minutes, made an accurately calculated piece sacrifice. To return to the Championship; the last round game, taking into account the fact that I was White and that my opponent was the uncompromising Tolush, was bound to be a fighting game, and that is how it turned out.

My father died, and for several months I was out of sorts. Even my final state exams were put off until the following spring. I returned to chess only in the summer, when I played in the World Students' Championship in Reykjavik. The USSR had a formidable team: two Grandmasters plus several strong masters, so that there was essentially no battle for the cup. I played well, and one of my games, that with Kolarov, is given here. Two further team events followed: the Championship of Europe, and a semi tourist, semi-serious trip to Italy, which was absolutely unforgettable. At the 12th Olympiad in Moscow the previous year, the Italian team had invited us to play a series of friendly matches. I hope that they will not be offended if I admit that, even at the board (we were, after all, barely adults), we were thinking of how we would wander around Venice, touch the stone of the ancient Coliseum, and visit La Scala and St. Peter's Cathedral. Nevertheless, we played assiduously, winning all five matches. One of the games was rather unusual. Before the start of play my opponent, the master Sabadosh, a charming, kind man already advanced in years, came up to me and said that he had to his credit draws with Alekhine, Lasker and Euwe. In my youth ful ignorance, I did not realise that this was a veiled offer of a draw, and since I had a cold, in reply I asked him to excuse me for the fact that I would spend as lit tle time as possible at the board, so as to avoid infecting him. Indeed, I used only 7 minutes on my clock, but this was enough to win the game. To the credit of Sig nor Sabadosh he was not offended, and when, being unable to attend the banquet, I was lying in my hotel room, he sent me wine, fruit, and, as a souvenir, a fashion able tie of unbelievable colouring. When I returned home, the doctors established post factum that I had been suffering from pneumonia. JOURNALIST. And didn ' t your new title protect you ? CHESS PLAYER. The title was indeed new. During the Championship of Europe a FIDE Congress was held, and our Federation proposed me for the title of International Grandmaster. The formal grounds for this were clearly inade quate. In the first place I was not an International Master, and secondly I had not A Young Master 67 reached the Grandmaster norm in an international tournament. Against this, the argument was put forward that I was the USSR Champion, and had won the title in a very strong tournament. The decision taken by the Congress was truly Solo man-like: I was 'exchanged' for L. Evans and A. Bisguier, who had failed to make the norm by something like half a point, and we all three were raised to the rank of Grandmaster. The following year, 1 958, found me both at home, and away: the Champion ship of the Soviet Union was held in Riga. JOURNALIST. Is it better to play on your home ground or not? CHESS PLAYER. For footballers it is without doubt an advantage. Everything is familiar, and they have the support of the fans, but in chess it is by no means cer tain. On the strength of my experience, I can say: it is good to be 'at home' when one is playing well. If things are not working out so well, playing at home is more difficult. In addition, the Championship was a Zonal Tournament, so that I was therefore making my debut in the battle for the World Title. JOURNALIST. Were you planning to repeat your success, or ... ? CHESS PLAYER. That's it - 'or' . I didn't think especially about first place, but with the tournament being the Zonal, Koblents and I made plans for me to fin ish in the first four so as to go forward to the Interzonal. JOURNALIST. Do you still set yourself targets, and plan your results ? CHESS PLAYER. Only very relatively. Usually I leave this to my second, or my wife. They suggest to me a schedule, or, more accurately, three: a maximum programme, a minimum, and a so-called realistic programme. The maximum is nothing but wins, the minimum is a little over 50% (where defeats are not in tended !), while the realistic programme is somewhere in between. So, it was festival time in Riga. Apart from the usual spectators, my pupils were also watching the play. I was in my probationary period at school, and the class to which I taught literature consisted almost entirely of fanatical chess play ers. JOURNALIST. Is it true that they once played chess during one of your les sons ? CHESS PLAYER. On this occasion you are right. When I first went into this class, there was a board with the pieces set out on the window-sill. I decided that this must be a new form of 'boot-licking' before the teacher, and, casting a profes sional glance over the board, I saw that White could give mate in four moves.
68 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
Then I committed a pedagogical mistake, turning my back on the class for two or three minutes while following a pupil who I had called up to the blackboard. When I turned round again to face the rest of the class, I saw that the position on the board had changed, and that White no longer had even an attack, never mind a mate in four. It was clear that the combatants preferred play to study. Having es tablished who the players were, I severely demanded that the lads give me their mark books, which, as it happened, were simply lying on the teacher's desk. At the end of the lesson I returned them, and said: 'Let's come to and understanding: chess and studying don't go together! ' 'Black' silently took back his mark book, but 'White' asked for my autograph. And in his mark book I had to write: 'Failed to find a mate in four during a litera ture lesson' . After this we became friends. In the Championship I began with a game against Tolush. A hum of expecta tion greeted our appearance on the stage: our game from the last round of the pre vious year's Championship was still in people's minds. On this occasion Tolush was in poor form, and played badly. But I found, as early as the third round, that the battle promised to be very difficult for me also. Against Boleslavsky in the King's Indian Defence I employed one of my rare opening innovations, quickly won a pawn, and obtained good winning chances. All I had to do was to make one prophylactic move, but this seemed fainthearted to me. I immediately occupied an open file with my rook, and Black's pieces came to life. At some point I considered that it was too early to offer a draw, but when I actually decided to speak, I saw that it was already too late. JOURNALIST. Your second successive defeat against Boleslavsky ... if some one defeats you. does this tend to repeat itself in subsequent games ? CHESS PLAYER. It is more accurate to say that this happens after a defeat in the first game. In such cases there is indeed an unpleasant tradition of things being repeated. JOURNALIST. What in general do you think about the problem of re venge ? CHESS PLAYER. There is an old Russian proverb: 'The father hit his son, not because he gambled, but because he tried to win back his losses.' In principle, striving for revenge - chess revenge ! - is a good intention, but when it becomes an end in itself, and this has often happened to me, then you lose your sense of re ality and of objectivity in assessing a position, and instead of revenge you have quite the opposite. I have no doubt that this is what explains, for instance, my catastrophic score against Korchnoi. A Young Master 69 JOURNALIST. But in that case, wouldn 't it be more sensible to forget the past, and begin each game with the score at nil-nil? CHESS PLAYER. Of course it would, but emotions arise of their own accord. Let us return to the Championship. Next I won a game against Averbakh, which is given here, and which provoked great arguments until the theorists showed that my piece sacrifice was inadequate, and that by an intermediate move White could have kept his material advantage. JOURNALIST. Just a minute! How was it that you sacrificed a piece, without special justification, against a Grandmaster? What were you counting on ? CHESS PLAYER. The point is that all leading Grandmasters have a chess 'character' , which is well known. Averbakh likes, and always heads for, positions where the situation is absolutely clear. Indeed, in our game this psychological trait manifested itself completely. On the very next move, in an attempt to clarify the situation, Averbakh simply returned the sacrificed piece. I do not know whether he did this deliberately, or whether he overlooked something and the game immediately transposed into a position of a clearly defined type, with Black having an extra pawn. Objectively speaking, the position could still have perhaps been held, but by now Averbakh was already in time-trouble, and he overlooked a little tactical stroke which led to great material losses. The sacrifice would have had no chance at all against players such as Korchnoi or Kholmov, who readily go in for sharp complications with the aim of keeping material which has been sac rificed against them. JOURNALIST. So you wouldn 't have taken such a step against them ? CHESS PLAYER. At any rate I would have thought about it longer, since at the board I could not see a direct refutation of the sacrifice. Of the other encounters, I recall very well the one with Petrosian. I obtained the better position, but it was here that I realised that I still had much to learn in the way of strategy. The exchange sacrifice offered by Petrosian was at the same time both the strongest and the only move. Today, I would have declined it without hesitation, thus keeping the initiative, but on that occasion I won the exchange, and . . . adjourned the game in a critical position. On resumption I slipped out, not without the assistance of my opponent. JOURNALIST. This was an example of Petrosian 's famous sense of danger. How well is it developed in your case ? CHESS PLAYER. Not at all, I'm afraid. I still don't understand how I have been able to go through certain tournaments without defeat.
70 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
The middle of the tournament turned out very badly for me. After refusing a draw, I blundered in the game with that same Korchnoi (there you are, trying for revenge !), and then this was repeated in my game with Bannik, against whom I had a clean score up till then. True, in this case there were 'collaborators' in my defeat. I caught a cold, had a slight temperature, and was given an injection of an tibiotics. However, the nurse made a mistake, and gave me a sedative. My friends noticed that during the game (it took place on the day for adjournments) I was not my usual self. I didn't walk about at all, but all the time sat at my table, looking at the board with a melancholy gaze. I also played very limply. I got into a bad po sition, then Bannik made a hash of things. The game became level and I began to wonder whether I shouldn't try to win. I forgot about everything else, including my clock. It was only the demonstrator's stare that warned me that I had only a few seconds remaining and I seized the nearest pawn and pushed it forward, thus compromising my whole kingside. I lasted as far as the time control, but no fur ther. After this I found that my score was down to 50%, with almost half the tourna ment over, and with very little to hope for. Perhaps it was this that allowed me to begin playing easily and calmly. I won several games in a row, and then Polugaevsky and I played a semi-dramatic, semi comic game. In the time-scramble I lost part of my advantage, and in the ad journed position was a pawn up, but whether this was sufficient to win was not clear. In addition, we did not consider Polugaevsky's sealed move at all, which was to move his king towards mine. The game continued, and then the moment arrived when I had to either ex change rooks and straight away agree to a draw, or else for no reason at all give up two pawns. I was very angry, partly because the previous day my opponent had offered me a draw in an inferior position, and partly because I had failed to guess his sealed move; without really thinking, I chose the second path, whereupon it took desperate efforts on my part to gain the draw. Even so, my fight to reach the top four and the Interzonal was going well. To wards the finish the pace of the leaders had slowed considerably, and after a win in the penultimate round, I went ahead together with Petrosian, with Bronstein half a point, and Averbakh and Spassky a point behind. One of us had to go ! The piquancy of the situation was increased by the fact the last round pairings were Petrosian-Averbakh, myself against Spassky, and Bronstein-Korchnoi, so that no-one ventured to predict the results. It turned out that, of the three games, only one was to be decisive. My rivals quickly agreed draws, whereas Spassky and I were engaged in a battle not for life, but to the death. Strictly speaking, a draw would have suited me: firstly, this A Young Master 7 1 would have enabled me to share first place, and secondly, I was playing Black. But Spassky had no desire at all for a play-off match with Averbakh for fourth place. The result was a sharp variation of the Nimzo-Indian, then at some point Spassky did not play as energetically as was possible and an equal position was reached. When I offered a draw, he refused. This was possibly because he had a score of two wins and two draws against me, but it seemed to me that Boris knew about my carefully-guarded secret - I was still unwell. Be that as it may, but I immediately made a bad move, and got into difficulties which grew and grew. Somewhere before the time control I could have gained a draw by going into a rook ending a pawn down, but instead I chose a heavy-piece ending where my king was in danger. We analysed until five o'clock in the morning. There appeared to be no direct win for White, but my position was highly unpleasant. Then my second sent me off to sleep for about three hours: the resumption was in the morning, at nine. My difficulties began while still on the approach to the tournament hall. De spite the fact that it was a weekday, there was a mass of fans around the entrance, and it was practically impossible to fight one's way through. My pupils, who had simply skipped their lessons, were also gathered there. The game was resumed. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Petrosian in a new suit, white shirt and tie, apparently all ready for his interview as Cham�ion. In the small buffet behind the stage Spassky was feverishly drinking kefir - it seemed that he too had only slept a little. For the fust six moves or so a forced variation was followed, and then up to a certain point Spassky played very well; only six months later was it found how he could have won. In over-the-board play, after a sleepless night, he was unable to solve this difficult problem. In addition, he was not in the best of moods - in the penultimate round he had suffered a defeat. After we had played about another fifteen moves there were still only two pos sible results: either Spassky would at any moment force a draw, or else he would convert his advantage into a win. Even so, my position was improving 'inch by inch' , and finally White was faced with a choice: he had to force a draw, or else the position would become more complicated, and the number of possible results would be increased to three. Spassky did not force a draw, but after a couple more moves, with both kings now under fire, he offered one in a somewhat changed voice. To be honest, I was embarrassed. In the first place, I had always held a certain sympathy for Boris. Secondly, I very much wanted to play in the lightning tournament which was just A sour milk product, similar to yoghurt - Translator 's note.
72 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
about to begin. However, everyone, myself included, had been greatly carried away by the game, and besides, to agree a draw would have been unethical from the chess point of view: for the first time in the game I had the chance to play for a win, and it was just now, and not a minute earlier, that the game would have been concluded. All this flashed through my mind for 30-40 seconds, and then I declined the of fer. Immediately I saw how Spassky, who always plays, I would say, with theatri cal calmness, began to get nervous. It became clear that it was now difficult for him to decide on the correct continuation, and indeed it was all over within five moves, with my king, which had broken out of captivity, taking part in the execu tion of his white colleague. JOURNALIST. In short, if he had agreed to a draw yesterday, you would have agreed today ... CHESS PLAYER. Exactly ! JOURNALIST. I realise that an enemy in life, and an 'enemy ' at the board are diff erent notions, but do any human feelings towards the opponent - respect, en mity, liking - have an influence on the course of a game ? CHESS PLAYER. Naturally ! Although sometimes in a strange way. For in stance, neither Spassky nor I have the slightest willingness to play against oppo nents for whom we have a feeling of enmity, whereas Botvinnik and Korchnoi try to rouse this feeling in themselves before a game. Strange though it may seem, it was after our tragic encounter in the Champion ship that Boris and I became friends. He put himself in my place, and realised that it was not personal enmity towards him that caused me to reject his offer of a draw. I think that he would have done the same, if he had been in my place. The result of this game proved to be a surprise to everyone: to Averbakh, who had been hoping against hope for a play-off match with Spassky, to Petrosian, to Spassky, and, for all my optimism, to myself. JOURNALIST. And how did the fans react? CHESS PLAYER. They went wild ! Even so, it is always more difficult for me to play in Riga than anywhere else. What I have in mind is the Championship of the Republic. If, to the rest of the world, I was already twice USSR Champion, International Grandmaster and so on, to my colleagues at home I was still the same Misha. Therefore I could not ex pect any special deference at the board, and in the Latvian Championship two months later I only took third place. In fact, I obtained the highest percentage of A Young Master 73 points in all my appearances in the Championship, 16 out of 19, but two others scored 1 7 ! The fate o f the tournament was decided by an incident which can only be called an anecdote. Before my game with Gipslis I was preparing for my Univer sity State Exam in Russian. This included Old Church Slavonic, Old Russian, Dialectology, and God knows what else, and so I was surrounded by some ten ki los of specialist literature. But suddenly the door bell rang, and the postman ar rived with, besides the rest of the mail, the latest issue of Shakhmatny Bulletin. I decided that fate itself was calling on me to relax, so I lay down in a hot bath and began reading the magazine. Straight away I came across an article by N. Krogius on a topical variation of the Sicilian Defence. At that time I readily played this line both as White and Black, and here I suddenly read: 'Recently Black has fre quently adopted the new continuation ... e5 ' . There followed two games, one of which Black won, while the second was drawn. That's excellent, I thought, I'll have a quick draw in this variation with Gipslis, and then return to Philology. As if it had been pre-arranged, inside 5 minutes we had played the moves of the variation given in the article, but when I made the 'recommended' move ...e5, a thought suddenly struck me: but what if White plays simply 1.c4? Gipslis, how ever, did not give me time to torture myself mentally, but straight away made this move. The game continued for the full five hours, after which I had a hopeless posi tion, and all that I achieved was an adjournment. The following morning I passed my exam, but resigned the game, whereupon we began analysing it. The first question that Gipslis asked was: 'Didn't you get the bulletin then?' 'Yes, why shouldn't I have?' Here he took the bulletin out of his briefcase, showed me the move ...e5, then turned over a page ( ! ), whereupon I read the very first line: 'However, by answer ing . . .e5 with 1.c4, White sets his opponent difficult problems.' Since then I have never prepared for a game while lying in a hot bath. However, there was no real need to feel distressed. Shortly after this I went away to the south on the insistence of my doctors, who had detected some mysti cal (as it turned out) spots in my lungs, and after I had been detained for a couple of weeks in a sanatorium, Koblents arr ived, and we began making unhurried preparations for the Interzonal Tournament. Then a telegram from our Chess Fed eration arrived: 'We would very much like you to play in the World Students' Team Championship, only in the most important matches' . I was really pleased. I was bored with the resort, and I felt fine, so I flew straight away to Moscow. True,
74 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
the most important matches proved to be all ten, and I enjoyed playing them, while for the right to play the tenth game, Spassky and I drew lots. Incidentally, on this occasion the main burden was borne by the top two boards, and when the following year Boris and I did not take part, our team dropped back, thus suggesting that the problem of preparing our young players was problem number one. A successful solution was found two years later. Game S Khasin - Tal USSR Championship, Leningrad 1956 Sicilian Defence

Game 10 Koblents - Tal Training Game, Riga 1957 Dutch Defence The Three Rooks' Sacrifice Very often, while delivering lectures, I have to answer certain questions: 'Could you explain how you prepare yourself for tournaments?' or simi larly 'What is the best way to prepare for important competitions?' I have to say at once that ready made formulae do not exist. The only possible solution, which must be strictly kept in mind, is that one should al ways be conscious of one's individual style and consider future plans to de velop it. Twenty years ago Botvinnik pro posed his own system to help develop ing chess players in their preparation.
78 The Life and Games ofMikhail Tal
In his system, great attention was drawn to two points. Firstly, theoreti cal preparation: mainly analysis of specific variations, and secondly, psy chological preparation. It is interest ing to note that Botvinnik owned files containing the games of all possible future opponents. Botvinnik would also give great importance to his physical preparation for important tournaments. Nowadays, with the considerable improvement in chess standards, this system is somewhat out of date. For example, it is not quite clear whether it is correct to play intensively in tour nament after tournament. Botvinnik's answer is 'no' and he also confirms this by not playing too often. On the other hand Grandmaster Gligoric plays very often and I have to add that, even by doing so, he never loses his good form. One other question: 'When ought one experiment?' It is no secret that most competitions are aimed at quali fication or are held for some other important competitive reason, and a tournament's narrow frame of calcula tion does not allow the chess player to use his full imagination - it is not easy to play in a style which one would use in a practice game. In this last sen tence we perhaps discover the answer to all our previous questions ! ? Indeed, when chess players meet in training games, which do not decide qualification or other achievements, they can try out some of the most in teresting or dangerous variations, and it is up to the opponents to decide either to disclose the results or to keep them to themselves for a 'fight night' surprise. I would like to draw readers' atten tion to the following practice game, which I played with my trainer Kob lents.

It is possible that many chess play ers will say: 'Of course this must be a training game' - indeed, in tourna ments the Dutch Defence is not used very often. However, in this game we wanted to check on Soviet Master Ilyin-Zhenevsky's suggested plan for this defence, and because of the result I am not going to give my signature to a document agreeing to stop playing the Dutch Defence forever. 3 lbf3 lbf6

7 lbc3 'ili'e8 8 l:lel The idea of this move, followed by e4, was suggested by Steinitz a long time ago. Recently the game Keres Simagin brought a great win for the Estonian Grandmaster. 8 • • • 'ili'g6 At frrst it seems that this move does not counter White's plan. In the above mentioned game Black played the usual 8 . . . 'ili'h5 and after 9 e4 fxe4 1 0 lbxe4 lbxe4 1 1 :xe4 lbc6 1 2 i..f4 A Young Master 79 found himself in a very difficult posi tion. If Black wanted to prevent e4 he would have chosen between 8 . . .d5, when 9 cxd5 exd5 10 'ii' b3 c6 1 1 e4 ! is good for White, and the more logical 8 . . . lLle4. However, it is interesting to mention that this move was used in one of the games from the Latvian Championship semi-final which fin ished surprisingly quickly: 9 'iWc2 'if g6 10 lLlxe4 ?? fxe4 1 1 lLld2 e3 ! and White resigned because he must lose a rook.

12 Ae3
This move stops Black's freeing manoeuvre . . . e5 . After the game my opponent showed me this interesting variation: 12 . . .e5 13 dxe5 i.g4 14 exd6 i.xd6. One may get the impres sion that Black's initiative is worth a pawn, but then would follow 15 c5 ! i.e7 1 6 b4 i.f6 17 i.b2 ! - an interest ing repetition of the combinative theme. Now it becomes clear that the rook's task lies on the third rank. The same rook also had a very ac tive life in the variation we played in the game. 12 i.f6

would follow 2 1 i.e3 . On the other hand a distinct weakness now appears at f2, and as a natural reaction to the text-move I had the idea of checking the tempting sacrifice of the rook: 20 ..

It is easy to see that White cannot interpose by 22 i.f4 because of 22 .. . i.d4+ with mate to follow (23 <it>f3 i.e2 mate}, and after 22 i.f3 would come 22 .. . i.d4+ 23 <it>g2 i.fl + ! So White is left with only one move: 22 <it>g 1 i.d4+ 23 <it>h 1 and although Black has a very active position, we can describe it as one which promises a lot but gives very little. However, Black's text-move looks very promising. 20 • • . a5 21 111 a4 Again the only move.

This move, in place of the usual 1 l .. .'iVc7, has recently become more and more popular. The Geller-Aver bakh game, played a few rounds ear lier, showed that the normal move 1 2 tlJbd2 i s not dangerous for Black. 1 22 .l:tad l wins a piece. Therefore, in the present game I wanted to try out a dubious idea involving an immediate flank blow.

Both white pawns are weak, but in one move only one of them can be cap tured. After lengthy reflection Geller decided to leave White with the less easily defended d-pawn.

In order to reach his respective goal, each player needed to win; this 1 26 .. . l:e4 !, and only then taking on d6, wins for Black at once.
2 Victory would give Tal clear first place; Spassky needed to win in order to make cer
tain of qualifying for the Portorof Interzonal - Translator's note. A Young Master 97 left its stamp on the course of the game. The opening was played rather unusually by both sides. Spassky and I in turn offered pawn sacrifices, and then Black offered the exchange, although this sacrifice also remained 'behind the scenes' . On the 23rd move I considered the position to be sufficiently simple and level, and I offered a draw. White decided that he could, without risk, continue the struggle, and perhaps he was right. In any case, it was I who committed the first mistake, after which Spassky seized the initiative. He conducted the mid dle section of the game superbly and at the adjournment Black's position gave serious call for alarm. Play was to resume in twelve hours' time. One can easily imagine how I ana lysed the adjourned position, together with my trainer A. Koblents. At about five o' clock in the morning the analy sis was terminated for 'technical rea sons' (one of the analysts fell asleep). Nevertheless, when I went along to the resumption, I considered that the game should finish as a draw. That is how it should have been. For a long time Black maintained the equilib rium, though it is true that, in order to do this, he had to find a number of dif ficult moves. The strength of one of these was evidently underestimated by Spassky, who, by inertia continued playing for a win in a now level posi tion. Now the advantage was on Black's side, and his counter-attack became ir resistible.

3 ltlc3 j,b4 4 a3 In preparing for this game we con sidered the moves 4 j,g5 and 4 e3, which Spassky usually adopts as White.

Be sides this, it is to Black's advantage to exchange off the white knight, which, as practice has shown, plays a very ac tive role in the attack on the kingside. One only has to recall the wonderful game Botvinnik-Capablanca (AVRO 1 938), where White sacrificed his knight on h5 , or the Kotov-Unzicker

encounter (Stockholm 1952), in which a blow by this knight at g7 concluded the struggle. 1 1 f3 Keres points out that White could have won a pawn by 1 1 'ii' a4 �aS 1 2 �xe4. This i s true, but after 12. . . �xe4 1 3 i.xe4 l:c8 Black quickly re-estab lishes material equality, maintaining a good position. 1 1 �xe4 �xe4 1 2 i.xe4 i.xc4 1 3 f 3 was possible, with an unclear position. 11 ... i.xc4 After 1 l . . .exf3 1 2 'ii' xf3 i.xc4 1 3 �f5 O-O 14 e4 White would have a very dangerous initiative. 12 �r5 After 12 fxe4 d6 1 3 'ii' f3 O-O (weaker is 1 3 . . . l:c8 14 �f5 O-O 1 5 'ii' g3 �e8 16 e5) 14 e5 (otherwise it is difficult to activate White's pieces) 14 ...dxe5 1 5 'ii' xc6 exd4 Black would obtain a strong attack on the white king, which is caught in the centre.

3 T he Road to the World
Champions h i p The Interzonal Tournament was now approaching; incidentally, this was the first individual international event in my career. The conditions in the tournament were rather severe. For the first time, the rule came into force that, from any one country (read - USSR!) no more than two (at first), and then no more than three (as was decided after 12 rounds) players could go forward from the Interzonal to the Candidates Tournament. Therefore, each of the Soviet quartet was required not only to win, but to come ahead of at least one of his compatriots. In short, only 1 st-3rd places guaranteed success, compared with 1st-6th places for the remaining contestants. Jumping ahead a little, I would like to say that on this, my first visit to Yugoslavia, I played well, and this happy tradition has continued ever since: I frequently visit this country, which is so hos pitable to chess players, and regarding my results in tournaments and matches (touch wood !) as yet I have no cause for complaint. Great interest was also roused by the debut in the international arena (as far as the World Championship is con cerned) of the youthful (if one can consider a mere 15 year-old to be a youth) Robert Fischer. Shortly before the Interzonal he stopped off in Moscow for the first, and unfortunately as yet the last time, but there he only played a few light ning games. He was often asked to give interviews (at that time Robert would still agree to this), and everyone was startled by the fact that Fischer, answering ques tions quite freely, said that on the whole he would have expected to take first place, but that this would be difficult, since first place could be taken by Bron stein. As far as I am aware, this is the first and last time that Fischer voluntarily put someone else ahead of himself. However, Fischer had no doubt at all that he would finish in the first six. 'But how will you do this' , correspondents asked him. 'Very simply. I reckon that I have to find five opponents against whom I can win. This means that I will win five games, and draw the rest' , Fischer replied. 'And suppose you lose to someone?' 'That's nothing to worry about; then I will have to win six games.' At first it seemed that this was nothing more than youthful bravado, since in the early rounds Fischer played badly. At the start he drew with Neikirch, having had the inferior position as White as early as the 14th move. Two moves later the Bul garian Champion unexpectedly offered a draw. When the journalists asked him why he had done this, Neikirch replied:
106 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
'It was somehow embarrassing to win against the lad, on my return home to Bulgaria they would laugh at me.' Following this, Fischer won a lost game against the little-known master Fuster and, within a day or two, in crushing style ... lost to Benko. From then on, amaz ingly, the young player improved literally with every round. The draw brought him up against all our players somewhere in the middle of the tournament. His first opponent was Bronstein, then Averbakh, myself and Petrosian. All four games were very tense, and our players were by no means peaceably inclined, but nevertheless all the games were drawn. My encounter with the American Cham pion was fairly sharp. A roughly equal position was reached, but I very much wanted to avoid drawing with this boy, so I played riskily, after which Fischer gained a dangerous attack. Then he made a mistake, and with an unexpected move I seized the initiative. At this point Fischer offered me a draw, but I de clined. He was in time-trouble, and, with literally only seconds remaining on his clock, on the 39th move found the only reply, a very strong one, which enabled him to maintain the equilibrium. The game was adjourned, but the following day I myself offered a draw, since it was clear that neither Black nor White could win. Before this I had managed to start the tournament fairly well, but then there fol lowed a highly annoying defeat at the hands of Hatanovic. In a fashionable vari ation of the Sicilian Defence I played very carelessly in the opening, and went to win a piece, but this turned out to be a variation prepared by my opponent. I am not especially accustomed to defending, and although I obtained excellent draw ing chances thanks to my opponent's mistakes, I nevertheless lost. Therefore on the following day I went along to play Filip in the mood 'win or bust' . In a sharp position I decided on a piece sacrifice, which, if declined, would lead to a slightly inferior position for Filip, while its acceptance would have unpredictable conse quences. It would appear that the sacrifice was not 100% correct, but before mak ing his move and capturing the piece, Filip offered me a draw. I realised that there was something in the character of the position that my opponent did not like, so I declined the offer, and in the subsequent confusion somehow outwitted him. It was at that time that the following phrase originated, addressed by one of the spectators to my second: 'If Tal has an open file, then there will be a mate ! ' . Al though to be honest, it should be said that in this particular game there was no great likelihood of a mate. In the middle of the tournament there came a sort of pause of three successive draws, and, reckoning that I had no right to such 'peace fulness' (although all three games were quite hard fought), in my game with Rossetto I declined a draw in a position which was perhaps even rather dubious. This affected my opponent, who proceeded to lose in the concluding stage for no particular reason. Then came a win over Benko, and I established myself in The Road to the World Championship 107 the leading group. I could. be fairly sure of my entry into the Candidates Tourna ment. It was the two final rounds, in which I met in turn the young Western players Panno and Olafsson, which proved to be decisive as regards the winner of the tournament. I was leading, since Larsen, angered by the loss he had suffered at my hands the previous day, had played with great enthusiasm against my nearest rival Petrosian, and had defeated him. Then came the ordeal of the last two rounds. The game with Panno gave me enormous satisfaction, and it was later awarded the prize for the most interesting game of the tournament (it is given here with notes). However, it was adjourned in a highly complicated position, and we racked our brains for a long time, trying to find a way to win. Tired, I decided to have a quick draw with Olafsson. In my youthful ignorance, I never considered that my opponent might play for a win. Once again I played the opening very light-heartedly, quickly exchanged sev eral pieces, but failed to make an accurate, very essential move. I offered a draw immediately after this. Olafsson declined. Only then did I look more deeply into the position, and realised that my offer of a draw had been somewhat tactless. In short, my opponent adjourned the game in a completely won position. The games were to be resumed the following day. A win against Panno was considerably more doubtful than a defeat against Olafsson. We put the game against the Argen tinean Grandmaster to one side, and began looking through the possibilities in the quiet, dull rook ending against the Icelander, every minute becoming more and more convinced that things were very, very bad. In the end we hit upon an idea which at first sight seemed completely absurd, whereby I simply moved my king away from the enemy passed pawn, but where we found some ways for my opponent to go wrong. In the alternative case my op ponent would have to demonstrate some elementary technical knowledge, whereas here I could lose much more quickly, but Olafsson would also have the chance to make a mistake. Koblents and I showed our analysis to Lev Abramov, the leader of our delega tion, and asked him what he, a chess master, would do in such a case. He unhesi tatingly opted for the second possibility. The game with Panno was the first to be resumed, and it ended surprisingly easily, since Panno had considered his posi tion to be lost, and had not analysed it very carefully. After this, employing my not very great acting talent, I resumed my game against Olafsson, and tried to play as confidently as possible, especially since Olafsson, as was his habit, had thought for a long time over his sealed move - 45 minutes - and had relatively little time left. Of course, in normal circumstances this would have been sufficient to win, but Olafsson also became nervous. When I led my king away from his pawn, he
108 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
sank into thought, and used up a further six minutes. His first move was correct, his second also, but on the third move he went wrong, and a drawn position was reached by force. After this the question of fust place was essentially decided. JOURNALIST. Didn 't such a meteoric rise frighten you to some extent? CHESS PLAYER. To be honest, I thought that everything was going quite nor mally, and besides, I have always been of the opinion that, of the two evils - un der-estimation and over-estimation of one's own strength - the former is much the more harmful. Almost directly from Portoroz, we set off to the Olympiad in Munich. Petrosian and I were making our debuts in the role of reserves, although certain of my friends said that to some extent this belittled the achievement of twice winning the Championship of the Soviet Union. However, I was very well aware that Botvinnik, playing on board one, and Smyslov on board two, and Keres and Bronstein had given a great deal more to chess than had Tal or Petrosian, and so, as far as I was concerned, this team order was the only one pos sible. Besides, I had never played against Botvinnik or Smyslov, I had once come ahead of Keres by half a point, which does not mean a great deal, while Bronstein had always been my idol. At the Olympiad, Petrosian and I had a comparatively easy task, since at that time the class of play of our opponents on the bottom boards was not especially high. We both made a pretty good score. A couple of games stick in my mind, and especially the one with Trifunovic, which was very interesting. When, prior to the match, the Yugoslavs were deciding who to put up against Tal, they chose the 'old fox' , as Trifunovic was called by the Yugoslavs themselves, a highly tenacious player, stubborn in defence although insufficiently aggressive. I played this game with great enthusiasm, for I realised that to win against Tri funovic was a problem of, so to speak, increased complexity. In addition, he very much wanted not to lose. After the game, TrifunoviC's colleagues came up and congratulated him on the draw, since at one time his position had appeared some what dubious. He replied: 'Yes, I got a draw, but it wasn't at all easy' . Seventeen years later, in the International Tournament at Las Palmas, I was playing against the Yugoslav Grandmaster Ljubojevic, who in 1975 was of roughly the same age as I had been in 1958 ! In this game I got into a difficult po sition, but then after highly interesting complications it ended in a draw. This time the other players came up and congratulated me on my good defence, and I quite involuntarily repeated TrifunoviC's phrase: 'Yes, but it wasn't at all easy' . JOURNALIST. Did you think in Munich that you might possibly have to play a match against Botvinnik? The Road to the World Championship 109 CHESS PLAYER. Not really. The Candidates Tournament was due to take place a year later, and it seemed a long way off, but I gained great pleasure from watching the play of the World Champion. JOURNALIST. Did you examine it closely ? CHESS PLAYER. No, no, not specially. Simply for the first time I was on the same stage where the Champion was playing, and was present when he was ana lysing. This made a great impression on me, almost as if I were an amateur. 1959 began, as was the tradition at that time, with the Championship of the So viet Union. I set off for Tbilisi 'burdened' by having been twice USSR Champion. I realised perfectly well that it was somewhat unusual and 'improper' for one player to win the Championship twice in a row. I further realised that, on this oc casion, the other contestants, even without themselves suspecting it, would form a sort of coalition against me, for to become Champion for the third time running would be simply too much. The effusive Mark Taimanov even stated that if this should be possible and should happen, he would give up chess. Thus, by not tak ing frrst place at Tbilisi, I performed a good deed for chess ... I arrived late in Tbilisi. My first round game, against Taimanov as it happened, was postponed. My frrst result in the table was the traditional nought, obtained in my game with the young player Yukhtman, who played the Scotch Gambit against me. In striving for more than equality, I at some stage overestimated my chances, and came under an attack which my opponent conducted very accu rately. As I have already said, this type of defeat acts as a spur to me, and in the next two rounds I defeated Polugaevsky and Geller, in two very interesting games. Then came draws with Keres and Lutikov, and a win against Krogius, whereupon I had to play Petrosian, who had begun the tournament highly successfully, and was playing with great verve. Tbilisi was after all the town where he had been born, and the town where he had grown up; on his 'home ground' he very much wanted to win. As usual, he did not lose any games, but he won more often than in, say, the Championship of the previous year. However, our game was post poned due to his being unwell, and this somehow affected me, for I realised that the encounter was very important in the battle for the leaders' jersey. In the fol lowing round I received a most unexpected stroke of fortune. The master Nezh metdinov, who always played against me with great relish, once again conducted the whole game splendidly, and obtained a completely won position, but then made a bad blunder, and lost. This victory did not give me any particular pleasure, and although I then defeated Averbakh, I had the feeling that retribution was not far off. I even appeared on Georgian television and said that I was unaccustomed l lO The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal to the idea of being the potential leader after the tenth round, and that to be honest, I was afraid it would not continue for long. That is exactly what happened; retribution came the following day. Exploiting my over-active play, the young player Gufeld, who had apparently always held me in respect and even a certain trepidation, on this occasion was in a very aggres sive mood. We castled on opposite sides and I was happy about this until it be came apparent that his attack was developing significantly faster than mine. Some five rounds before the finish, Petrosian and I played off our postponed game, which, like the majority of the ones we had played previously, ended in a draw. The decisive role, which ensured that in this Championship I essentially took no part in the struggle for first place, was played by an episode which oc curred when the adjourned games were played off. At that point I had accumulated three adjournments: against Gurgenidze, Vasi ukov and Spassky. In the last I had a certain, perhaps even decisive, positional ad vantage in the endgame, but I fully appreciated that physically it would be simply impossible to analyse all three positions, especially since in all three a hard fight was in prospect. After finding out from a control colleague in what order I would have to play off the games, and having made sure that, except in extreme circumstances, the game with Spassky would be played off last, I considered it my duty to warn Boris that I would do everything possible to ensure that our game was not re sumed that day. He fully understood my position, and agreed, especially since he had only one game adjourned. We arr ived for the resumption. There was a slight complication in that Vasi ukov, whose game with me was due to be played off second, first had to play Lu tikov. I sat down against Gurgenidze, and apologised to my opponent, saying that I was going to play very unhurriedly, since I did not want our game to end before Vasiukov finished his game with Lutikov. With an unexpected move, which had been found literally an hour before the resumption, I succeeded in quickly obtaining a decisive advantage against Gur genidze. I attempted not to force matters, while maintaining my advantage, espe cially since in the adjourned game with Vasiukov my knight was much stronger than his bishop, and the character of the position was such that my knight could roam all round the board before I had to undertake decisive action. Thus the pos sibility of the game with Spassky being resumed appeared to be ruled out. Then Lutikov reached a position with king, bishop and knight against Vasi ukov's lone king. I thought that their game would be over at any minute, so I forced matters, and Gurgenidze resigned. But at this point Vasiukov, in his game against Lutikov, continued calmly and imperturbably seeking the only legal move The Road to the World Championship 1 1 1 with his king. The controllers waited for the customary 1 5 minutes, and then be gan looking for Spassky, but he had taken me at my word, and had not arrived for the resumption. The control team began discussing the matter. One of the control lers suggested that the Lutikov-Vasiukov game should be interrupted, but this would have meant helping Lutikov to find the winning method, although only formally, since the strong master was well familiar with the technique of mating with bishop and knight against a lone king, and it was Vasiukov who was drag ging things out. The formal point of view nevertheless prevailed. Spassky was found somewhere, and we sat down to resume our game. It was not at all surpris ing that within some 20 minutes I made a mistake, and now Spassky gained the advantage. Even so, the game finished in a draw, which gave Petrosian the chance to consolidate his position as leader. My traditional loss to Korchnoi in the penultimate round allowed Petrosian to practically assure himself of first place. In the final round all three contenders for the medals drew their games. The result was gold for Petrosian, and silver for Spassky and myself. Personally, I didn't feel that I could complain about the result although, for some reason, it was considered by some that a share of second and third places was practically a failure for me. Then I returned to Riga where, within some four to six weeks, the Latvian Chess Olympiad took place. The tournament was run on the Swiss System of which I had the most unhappy memories, since three years previously I had suf fered a failure in such a tournament. In addition, I very much wanted my trainer, Koblents, to take part in this tournament, since on the whole he appeared in im portant events rather rarely. I did everything I could to talk him into it and I even said that if we had to play each other, and I had White, then I would offer him a draw in advance. I don't think that it was particularly because of this, but, be that as it may, Koblents agreed to play. Starved of tournament chess, he played with great relish, and after five rounds we had drawn away from the other competitors, and headed the tournament table with five points each. We naturally met in the sixth round, with Koblents having White. A familiar situation, wouldn't you agree? Let anyone who has never in his life acted in this way cast stones upon me, but if the Maestro had offered me a draw before the game, it would have been in stantly accepted. However, Koblents kept quiet, and the game began in fairly se rious fashion. I chose the French Defence, with which I have never been particularly successful, and obtained a dubious position, which around move 16- 17 became lost, and everyone realised this. At this point, when it was his turn to move, Koblents offered me a draw. The position was such that he could himself force perpetual check, or could slowly and surely convert his advantage into a 1 12 The Life and Games ofMikhail Tal win, or else he could app�ently win immediately, but here he would fall into a trap. I could not agree to a draw in a lost position, since I have never been disposed to accepting charity, and I thought to myself: 'If he is really offering me a draw, then he will give perpetual check' . So I left it up to him to make the choice. Such 'independence' on my part apparently annoyed my old colleague, and af ter a few minutes' thought the Maestro very emotionally (outwardly at any rate) carried out the winning combination. In doing so he fell into the trap, about which I have already spoken, and soon an endgame, slightly favourable for me, was reached. A draw could have been agreed, but now it was I who felt offended: after all, the Maestro had spurned perpetual check. After the game had been adjourned, contrary to tradition, we sat in opposite corners of the hall, eating our sandwiches and analysing the same position, but exchanging light-hearted comments. On re sumption I managed to win around move 75. Koblents understood the course of my thoughts, and realised that I had acted, as it were, according to the highest principles. Soon after this a tournament began which was organised to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the Zurich Chess Club, one of the oldest in Europe. This was my first individual international event, not connected with the battle for the World Championship. I travelled to it with Grandmaster Keres, whose company I have always found enjoyable and relaxing. Play came easily to me in Zurich, although in the first round I suffered my 'traditional' defeat, on this occasion at the hands of the Swiss master Bhend. Keres jokingly reassured me, saying that I had lost to a player who was practically a compatriot. The point was that not long before the tournament, at the International Festival for Young People and Students in Mos cow, Bhend had met a Russian girl and had married her. After my initial misfortune, I succeeded in winning four games in a row in fairly entertaining style, with tactical blows of the sort that so appeal to fans. In cidentally, it was in Zurich that I first came across a system of material stimula tion for results. The prize-money awarded to the participants for the number of points gained was unusual: in cash terms, two half-points were not equivalent to the same point gained by means of a win and a loss. If the many years have not af fected my everyday memory - as yet I cannot complain about my chess memory ! - a draw was 'worth' 25 francs, and a win 60. There was even a consolation of 10 francs for a defeat. I don't think that it was this that so affected play, but there were very few draws, at any rate quiet ones. Indeed the draw which everyone had predicted be tween Keres and Tal only came after I succeeded in escaping from my opponent's highly unpleasant grip. The Road to the World Championship 1 1 3 Then, in the seventh round, came a game which I enjoyed, as did the specta tors, and even, it would seem, my co-author Keller. I will give it without notes, since the variations left behind the scenes are numerous and complicated.

Well, you see, I did not want to give a faulty analysis, and to work through it to the end is, I'm afraid, hardly possible. 1 14 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal So, after 1 1 rounds I had 9112 points, and it seemed that the battle for first place was decided, since my closest pursuers were some one and a half points behind, and I felt that I was playing well. Perhaps it was this that caused me, in a winning position against Barcza in the 12th round, to play, for the umpteenth time, 'bril liantly' - and for the umpteenth time I was punished. My opponent found a sim ple refutation of the piece sacrifice, and I had to force a draw.

The Road to the World Championship 1 15 Immediately they were all alongside me: Gligoric, Keres, and also Fischer, whom I had to play at the finish. Nevertheless, before the last round I had main tained a lead of half a point over Gligoric, and one point over Keres and Fischer. On the previous day the American grandmaster had played recklessly against Keller, and the Swiss player had won, while as Black I had defeated Donner in the then rarely-played system 1 d4 l2Jf6 2 c4 c5 : Donner - Tal Zurich, 1959

Now only Gligoric could catch me, and for a further twenty moves he tried to win an ending with rook and bishop against Kupper, who had a rook and knight. Even so, this game also ended in a draw, and so Gligoric and I finished up, as in the Interzonal Tournament, with half a point between us. Fischer shared 3rd and 4th places with Keres, and he began to be talked about more and more. So, everything seemed fine. We returned home to join the Latvian team, which was preparing somewhere by the sea in Riga for the USSR Peoples' Spartakiad, when I had my first attack of kidney trouble. The doctors were unable to say any thing definite immediately, but suggested that in any case I shouldn' t play in the Spartakiad. I realised that it would not be easy for me there on top board against Botvinnik, Spassky, Geller, Keres, Boleslavsky and others, but I decided that my participation would to some extent help the team. Although I took last place (for the first time in my life!) in the team leaders' tournament, scoring 2112 out of 8, I nevertheless succeeded in saving a few points for our team in analysis, so that the lads considered that I had been justified in playing. 1 16 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal I realised, as early as the preliminary group, that I could not hope for much. I had only just sacrificed a knight on g7 against Keres, when I had a recurrence of the attack, and straight away the game ceased to be of interest. The following day exactly the same happened, and I am still sorry about this game: it could have been one of my best. Here is the second half of it, Spassky was White.

Can you name for us your best game ? CHESS PLAYER. As long as I am alive - no. 1 17 JOURNALIST. I recall that 10 years ago, you said that you were intending to play it every time you sat down at the board. CHESS PLAYER. Did I? Well, in principle that's true. Only, nowadays I would say: 'today I may play my best game' , and not 'I must play' . After these en counters I restrained my appetite for chess, trying to equate my needs with my possibilities. Nevertheless, I prepared carefully for the first game in my life with Botvinnik. However, instead of him, the Moscow reserve Vasiukov turned out and, as a result of this, it was Smyslov who suffered 'on the rebound' . I was ex pecting Botvinnik to play the Caro-Kann Defence, and the position which Smys lov and I were to reach in the second cycle of the coming Candidates Tournament in Yugoslavia was already standing on a board in one of the rooms of the sky scraper 'Ukraine' hotel, during the Spartakiad in Moscow. In all the remaining games from the Spartakiad, except one, I quickly agreed a draw, but I lost to my old 'enemy' Nezhmetdinov at the very moment when, in a slightly better position, I decided that it was time to win something back. The rest is understandable, After the Spartakiad in Moscow, the usual open lightning championship of the city took place for the prize donated by the newspaper Vechernaya Moskva. I al ready had experience of lightning tournaments and readily played in them, not unsuccessfully. On this occasion, in the heat of the battle - and a tournament of five-minute games with 24 participants lasts for about 6 hours - I had a new at tack. After losing some ten games, and dissipating the whole of my plus score, I took a flight to Riga, and within 2 hours was already in one of the clinics there. The next morning they operated on me, and took out ... my appendix. The most amusing thing is that, for several years after this, my attacks of kidney trouble ceased ( ! ), and I found out that the first operation had been ineffective only when I had my diseased kidney removed. I was allowed 10 days to recover, not by my doctors, but by the International Chess Federation: the Candidates Tournament in Yugoslavia was about to start. My friends arranged for my luggage to be taken to the airport, and then Grand master Averbakh (at first he was my only second; Koblents arrived somewhat later) and I, together with Keres, Petrosian, Smyslov and their seconds, set off for Bled. I was not much troubled by the effects of the operation, apart from in a purely mechanical sense; during a game I did not feel inclined to stroll about, and I was unable to walk quickly. I was able to devote myself to the battle, and in round one 1 18 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal the first game of my life against Smyslov was adjourned in a position that I con sidered drawn, despite the fact that I was the exchange down. Then I won against Gligoric, and after this I played Keres, not even suspecting that the result of this meeting could be of great significance. Who thought that it was the future win ners who were playing? In this encounter I at first succeeded in outwitting my formidable opponent in tactical complications, but then, rejecting the simple in favour of the complex, I first of all gave up my advantage, and then lost the game.

Taking into account the loss of my adjourned game against Smyslov, my tour nament position - one point out of three - was not very prepossessing, especially since my failure against Keres had been rather annoying. Our game had apparently so exhausted Keres that the following day he played passively and lost against Petrosian, who thus became the leader. As White against me, Petrosian did not force matters, and after defeating the remaining for eign contestants, I finished the first cycle amongst the leaders. The second cycle went roughly the same way, except that, in addition, I suc ceeded in winning a game against Smyslov that was important for my frame of mind. As you will recall, it was here that exploded the mine intended for Botvinnik The Road to the World Championship 1 1 9 in the USSR Peoples' Spartakiad. However, the attack itself, and the sacrifices in this game - which won the brilliancy prize - were pure improvisation. The game provoked a great deal of interest (it is given here), and every morn ing for at least three weeks the leader of our delegation, Grandmaster Ragozin, would exchange variations with the well-known Yugoslav journalist, master Vuk ovic. Vukovic would come up with a refutation of the combination, and Ragozin, the next day, would respond with an improvement for the attack. In the end they came to the conclusion that White had sufficient pressure for the piece. Such play so appealed to me, that I decided: everything is possible ! A coup�e of days later, in my game with Keres I suddenly saw a fantastic possibility of sacri ficing two pieces: a knight on b6, and a bishop on d6. I carried out the plan, ran up against a simple refutation, and continued to resist, prompted only by emotion, since I could have resigned much earlier.

However, my optimism remained high, since I considered that I had been un fairly punished for an original idea. After a further three wins in a row, it was clear after the end of the second cycle that if nothing extraordinary happened then either Keres or I would be the winner. The tournament moved on to Zagreb, but before this, a lightning event was held in Bled. I succeeded in winning it, but what sticks in my mind is something else: a unique oversight. I cannot recall the exact position, but the mechanism of the blunder was as follows: 1 20 The Life and Games ofMikhail Tal Averbakh - Tal Bled Lightning It was Black to move. Averbakh offered me a draw, but I decided to play on. I saw that I had to defend against the threat of 2 .txh7+ and 3 1i'xd5. So I defended by l ... h6???? As you will have guessed, Averbakh replied 2 .th7+, and didn't of fer a draw again. I will jump ahead a little. During the Candidates Tournament, two further lightning events were held. I took first place in both of them - in one, after a play off match with Matulovic. Before the play-off Matulovic demanded that we should share the prize, irrespective of the result. I did not object, although the prize that the organisers had put forward was a single air-rifle. In addition. it was not of the double-barrelled variety. I began the third cycle sharing 2nd-3rd places with Petrosian, but it was al ready clear that Tigran was fading a little. As usual, he underestimated his chances, and was clearly happy to fight for a place not higher than an honourable third. From this cycle I must again recall in particular the games with Smyslov and Keres (the encounter with Fischer is given here). In the first of these my opponent was obviously intent on gaining his revenge for the game from the second cycle, and besides, it was clear that the players from the older generation who were fighting for the crown did not especially want to allow a young upstart into their midst. Up to a certain point Smyslov played the game brilliantly and completely out played me, while in addition I had only 2-3 minutes left for some 15 moves. I had nothing to lose, there was no time for hesitation, and I attempted only to compli cate my opponent's task in any way possible. Then, with my flag horizontal, and a further four moves still to make, Smyslov ran into almost the only 'swindle' I had managed to think up. As I later found out, he had seen my rook sacrifice on g 1 , but not on h l . The Road to the World Championship 1 2 1 Smyslov i s normally imperturbable at the board, but here, after my 39th move . . . l:th 1 +, his face changed, and after thinking for some three minutes, he made his reply and slammed his clock with furious force. Some of the pieces fell over, but, contrary to my normal practice, I first gave check with my rook on g1, pressed my clock, and only then began to restore order on the board. White could no longer escape from perpetual check. On the same day, Keres blundered in his game with Fischer, and I drew level with Paul Petrovich, and then after the next round, when I won against Gligoric, I went into the lead for the first time. The next game, with Keres, thus took on an even greater significance. Before going in for some forced complications my opponent offered me a draw. I re called the two games I had already lost to him in the tournament, and besides, I was-playing Black, and was leading him by half a point. Thus a draw was desir able on all accounts, except one: the position was highly interesting and I did not want to part with it. The subsequent play was very lively, and although I got into time-trouble (by the way, when I am in form, I even now do not worry about the consequences of time-trouble), I managed to win. JOURNALIST. In the majority of cases you decline when you are offered a draw. Do you take time to consider the suggestion, or, like a charger, do you straight away 'snort' defiance at the sound of the bugle? CHESS PLAYER. Alas, that is normally what happens. I will even let you into a small 'trade secret' . When I am offered a draw around move 15, while the posi tion is still 'flavourless', and there is no real fight going on, then I am more in clined to agree, but later I more often decline. So, the third cycle went highly successfully for me: apart from the draw with Smyslov I shared the point only with Petrosian, and won the rest of my games. I am now prepared to admit that in the 3rd and 4th cycles Petrosian and I did not re ally play. This was a negative reaction to the practically unanimous comments in the press after our game from the second cycle. We had played seriously but then read the following opinion, which was not exactly complimentary to us: 'Of course, Tal and Petrosian are friends; there is nothing one can do about it, all their games finish in a draw' . This angered us, and we decided: 'Right, we'll show them how to really draw without a fight! ' Over our next game we spent a to tal of 5 minutes, not more. I set off for the fourth cycle in Belgrade with a lead of 1 112 points. Taking into account the fact that in my two most important games, with Smyslov and Keres, I had White, I assumed that this lead should suffice. 1 22 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal However, I am unable to win a tournament without any adventures. They be gan with the game against Smyslov, where I needlessly threw myself into the at tack, ran up against an excellent defence, then half-blundered, half-sacrificed a piece, and only in the time-scramble managed to win after a blunder by my oppo nent on the 40th move. In the following round Smyslov was this time 'on my side' , and defeated Keres, and since I won against Gligoric, I was leading by 2112 points with five rounds to go. I had only to draw with my closest pursuer Keres, who at that mo ment was already resigned to taking second place, and victory was in the bag. I re alised this perfectly well, but as White nevertheless decided to attempt, if possible, to make the score in our individual match 2-2. Here I found out, for the first time in my life, that to play simultaneously for two results (no one plays de liberately for a loss, as far as I am aware) is not possible. I began with the intention of playing a complicated positional five-hour game, but then a couple of times I had a certain change of heart, and Keres very keenly sensed this indecision on my part. From around move 15, he himself began playing for a win. From inertia I avoided exchanges on a couple of moves, and when I made up my mind to play only for a draw, it proved to be too late. This win gained Keres the prize for the 'Best Game' . Two rounds later, the distance between us had narrowed to one point, and in the penultimate round I had to play the quite revitalised Fischer, who up till then had capitulated in all our three games. Afterwards I was told that Bobby had sworn in public to at least exact his revenge at the finish, so as to have the last word. In preparing for the game we decided that I should play the normal Sicilian De fence with ... d6 and ...a6, and as regards the sacrifice of White's e-pawn, we care lessly waved our hands and said 'Oh, take it! ' So I took it, although I was unprepared, subsequently made a couple of mistakes, and felt myself to be on the very, very edge of the abyss. Especially since Fischer was playing very keenly and accurately, while Keres, 'scenting blood' , had as Black set himself to do everything he could to crush Gligoric. In short, everything pointed to the fact that the question of first place would be decided in the last round, or even after it. However Fischer, not wishing to remain a pawn down for long, hastened to re establish material equality, and in doing so lost a part of his advantage. On the 1 8th move I was faced with a choice: I could either go into a slightly inferior end ing, or else I could accept a piece sacrifice, thereby subjecting myself to a very strong attack. I could not see a forced mate, it is true, but perhaps only because I wasn't looking for one. If l had been playing White, I would have considered the attack to be decisive. The Road to th� World Championship 1 23 Nevertheless, I chose the second path, and within three moves the following famous position was reached. Fischer - Tal. Candidates Tournament, Bled 1959 It is famous, because it was here that a widely-known psychological duel took place between us. Every player has his own habit: one will first make his move and then write it down, while another will do things the other way round. Incidentally, in recent years Fischer has actively objected to this 'other way round', expressing the opin ion that a scoresheet is not a black-board for writing down exercises. However, in our game Fischer first wrote down the move 22 l:lae1 ! , without doubt the strong est, and wrote it not in his usual English notation but in European, almost Rus sian ! Then he not very deftly pushed the scoresheet towards me. 'He's asking for an endorsement' , I thought to myself, but how was I to react? To frown was im possible, if I smiled he would suspect 'trickery' , and so I did the natural thing. I got up and began to calmly walk up and down the stage. I met Petrosian, made some joke to him, and he replied. The 15-year-old Fischer, who was essentially still only a large child, sat with a confused expression on his face, looking first at the front row of the spectators where his second was sitting, and then at me. Then he wrote down another move: 22 'ifc6+?, and after 22 ... l:ld7 23 l:lael+ i.e7 24 l:.xf7 'it>xf7 25 'ilt'e6+ <i!tf8! 26 'ifxd7 'ifd6 I held on to my extra piece and adjourned the game in a won position. When I later asked Fischer why he hadn't played 22 l:lae1, he replied: 'Well, you laughed when I wrote it down! ' After this, my second made me give my word to offer a draw in the last round on move 12. At that time my score against Benko was 5-0, and the idea that he might refuse the draw somehow never occurred to me. JOURNALIST. Especially after the performance with the glasses ? 1 24 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal CHESS PLAYER. Yes, of course! In the third cycle, when we sat down at the board Benlco, who had earlier suspected me of hypnotising him, took out of his pocket a pair of dark glasses and put them on. This 'innovation' , like any that the opponent knows about beforehand, was met by a 'counter-stroke' . I had bor rowed some enormous dark glasses from Petrosian, and following Benko I straight away put them on. Not only the spectators laughed, as well as the other participants and the controllers, but also Benko himself. Unlike me, however, he did not remove his glasses until as late as the twentieth move, by which time his position was already hopeless. So in the last round, after playing g4 on my 12th move, I kept my word and of fered a draw. Benko silently made an answering move, very quickly blundered, and got into a lost position. On the 2 1 st move I could either give perpetual check, or else go into a completely won ending with two extra pawns. I gave perpetual check, and with the quick temper of youth explained my deci sion to the journalists as follows: 'When I want to win against Benko, I win; when I want to draw - I draw' . Today I can only request indulgence, taking into account the fact that I was then only 22 years old, but I should say that from the psycho logical point of view it would have been easier for Benko if I had won that game ... Only after this, on the initiative of the journalists, did I begin thinking about the match with Botvinnik. Before the match there was one more tournament: the first International Tour nament in Riga, held under the slogan 'The Baltic is the sea of friendship' . JOURNALIST. But was it sensible for you to play in it? After all, there was less than six months to go before the match. CHESS PLAYER. In the first place, it would have been rather awkward for me to decline to take part in Riga. Secondly, Koblents and I decided that I should try to 'cover up' in the opening, especially as Black against 1 d4. In addition, Koblents set me a purely 'academic' task: to play somewhat passively in the opening, so as to become accustomed to defending. This was the general aim. We did not set a goal as far as the result was con cerned, and it is doubtful whether this would have helped, for the winners, Spassky and Mikenas, played very, very well. A certain consolation was provided by the prize for the best attack in the tournament (this game with Johannessen is given here) and my result in the traditional lightning tournament: l 6lf2 out of 17. Of course, I am only joking. Seriously speaking we were happy with the creative results of the tournament as one of the steps in our preparations for the match. The Road to the World Championship 1 25 I spent the last few days of the year in Vilnius, and I could not decline an invi tation from our Lithuanian neighbours to give a simultaneous display, where I was confronted by almost entirely first category players. The display concluded with an honourable result for me: + 19 - 1 =6. Then the year 1960 arrived, but before leading the conversation on to the two matches for the World Championship, in which I happened to be a participant, I should like to tell you about an episode from the distant past. It is about how M. Tal was sent out of the class. Autumn 1 945 : A singing lesson for the 5th year of the 77th Riga school. Be hind one of the desks, two boys are intently turning over the pages of the chess bulletin 14th USSR Championship (this was my first encounter with chess litera ture). The 'studying' proceeded according to the principle: the less comprehensi ble, the better, since symbols such as e4, lLlf5 etc. were at that time like some kind of hieroglyphics to me. However, one thing was perfectly clear: there was a string of 'ones' against the name of Botvinnik. Carried away by what we were doing, we made perhaps the first blunder of our chess careers: we 'overlooked' a question by the teacher. The retribution was swift and severe. All my generation - lads who had first learned chess in the immediate post-war years - had their idol. He was, of course, Mikhail Moiseyevich Botvinnik. Many were supporters of Keres, many wished Smyslov success, but they, and others, admired the first Soviet World Champion. In 1 948 I also achieved some success in the field of chess - I reached fourth category rating. It is very possible that I played a little worse then than I do now, but my self-importance was no less. When, in May, Botvinnik was proclaimed World Champion, I was truly delighted, and yet somewhere inside of me there was a slight doubt: how could this be, after all he had never played me? ! Years passed. Schoolboys became students, fourth category players become candidate masters, but the idol remained the same. I must repeat that until the last round of the 1959 Candidates Tournament, the idea that I would at some time be playing a match for the World Championship with Botvinnik never entered my head. Now the moment had arrived. Game 2 1 3 �bS a6 Tal - Panno 4 �a4 lLlf6 Portoroz lnterzona/ 1958 5 O-O �e7 Ruy Lopez 6 l::t el bS 7 i.b3 d6

This opening system has been de veloped by Bulgarian players. Black's idea is to create counterplay immedi ately on the queenside. After the natu ral 1 1 tLlbd2 exd4 1 2 cxd4 d5 Black has no difficulties. The exchange in the centre 1 1 dxe5 tLlxe5 12 tLlxe5 dxe5 1 3 'ilfh5 gets White nowhere af ter 1 3. . . 'ii' d6 (Fischer-Tal, Portoroz 1 958). 11 i.e3 exd4 White was planning, after exchanges on e5 and b6, to seize the important central square d5 . Black's move is in accordance with the strategic plan mentioned above. 12 cxd4 tLlaS This is stronger than 1 2. ..d5 (Tal Antoshin, 24th USSR Championship). After 1 3 tLlc3 dxe4 14 tLlxe4 White held the initiative. 13 i.c2 c5 14 eS! (D) Evidently the only move which en ables White to hinder his opponent's plans. After both 14 tLlc3 tLlac4 1 5 i.c1 cxd4 16 tLlxd4 i.f6 and also 14 dxc5 dxc5 1 5 'ii' xd8 .l:.xd8 1 6 b4 tLlb7 (or 16 . . . tLlac4) Black's position is preferable. The move in the game caused Black to sink into thought. An hour later there followed: 14 • • • dxeS! Panno avoids the various traps. Tempting was 14 ... tLlac4 15 exd6 'ii' xd6 but then White has the strong reply 16 i.g5 ! Similarly, after 14. . .cxd4 1 5 i.xd4 the black knights are removed from the main theatre of events. 15 lLlxeS tLlbc4 16 'itfd3 White is not satisfied with a draw: 1 6 'ii' h5 g6 1 7 tLlxg6 fxg6 1 8 i.xg6 hxg6 19 'ii' xg6+ �h8 and 20 i.h6 .l:.g8 21 1i'h5 fails to 2 1 .. .1i'e8 .

It turns out that after 1 9 'ii' xb3 .Bf6 20 lLlxc4 bxc4 2 1 'ii' xc4+ �h8 White experiences considerable difficulties. 20 lLla3 appears strong, but this move is also not especially unpleasant for Black. White decides on a complicated combination, the consequences of which were difficult to assess. 19 • • • lLlxa1 20 lLlxd8 Ji.f5 On 20 ... .Bxd8 White could not con tinue 2 1 dxc5 because of 2 1 . . . .l:ta7 when the black pieces become active.

The point is that the knight on a1 is out of play, the oppo site-coloured bishops assist White in his attack against g7, and the knight on c4 can be driven away. Besides, in some cases he can capture the pawn on c5 . Bad is 23 . . .cxd4 24 b3 d3?, in view of 25 'ii' g4. 23 • • • .l:txd4 24 'ii' g4! As later becomes clear, this is much stronger than 24 'ii' g3. 24 .Bg6 25 'ife6+ .tr7 26 'iff5 lLlc2 After 26 . . . .Bg6 White is not forced to take the draw. Instead he has the following combination: 27 l:xg7+ �xg7 28 .Bh6+ �xh6 29 'ii' xf8+ with 30 'ii' xc5+ and 3 1 'ii' xd4. Black hastens to bring up his re- serves.

Besides this move, Black could have played 27 ... l:d 1 + 28 �h2 lLld2 and White is faced with a choice - whether to go in for the highly unclear complications of 29 h4 lLlfl + 30 �h3 or to play simply 29 .Bxd2 .l:txd2 30 1Wxc5 , when despite Black's material advantage his position is inferior since his pieces are disunited. 28 .l:txg7+ Here this combination does not win, since the rook on d4 is defended. 28 �xg7

For the time being White refrains from castling, considering his primary task to be the exchange of Black's dark-squared bishop. This could of course have been prevented, for exam ple by playing 7 . . .h6 8 We 1 <l;h7, but Black decided to carry out a pre-con ceived plan. 7 8 'ii' cl 9 i.h6 10 i.xg7 11 ll:ld5 ll:lh5 f5 ll:\c6 <l;xg7 f4 In the absence of dark-squared bish ops, this pawn set-up favours Black. 12 'ii' c3 i.e6 13 ll:lxr4 Apparently a surprising move to make; in the given position, however, it is completely justified, since Black cannot give mate along the resulting open g-file, but is more likely to him self be mated. 13 • • • lLixf4 I spent some time considering the exchange sacrifice 1 3 . . . l:.xf4 1 4 gxf4 lLixf4.

After this outwardly strong move Black obtains a dangerous attack. White should have castled queenside. 1 30 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal 16 • • • ltld4! 17 e3 In the case of 17 ltle4 Black was planning to sacrifice the exchange by 17 ... .l:.xe4. After both 1 8 i.xe4 .l:.f8 19 f3 'ii' f4 and 1 8 dxe4 l:lf8 1 9 f3 'ii' f4 20 �f2 'ii' xe4, Black's initiative would more than compensate for White's in significant material advantage. 11 • • • :xn 18 exd4 (D) On 18 ltlxe6+ there would have fol lowed 1 8 . ..

It is curious that after the game my opponent demon strated this variation, asserting, how ever, that it was unsound, since in the final position White can castle. At the time I agreed with him, spent some time worrying about this oversight, but then remembered that the white king had already 'been for a walk' . With his move in the game, the Ital ian player sets a trap: 1 8. ..exd4 1 9 'ii' xd4. 18 ••• .i.g4 After this move it would appear that the white king, trapped in the centre of the board, must quickly perish. Lago finds an interesting defensive possibil ity. 19 i.f3! .l:.xf3 Here I thought for 40 minutes. This is probably the only way to keep the advantage. In the case of 19 ... .i.xf3 20 �xf2 .i.xh 1 + 2 1 �g1 exd4 22 'ii' a5 b6 23 'ii' b5 c6 24 'ilfa6 the maximum that Black can count on is a draw by per petual check. The immediate capture on d4 leads to roughly similar results after 20 'ii' a5 . Variations involving the sacrifice of the rook, for instance 19 ... .i.xf3 20 �xf2 l:lf8, are refuted by 2 1 .l:.hfl . I also considered the bold 19 . . .h6, but this is refuted by the pro saic 20 dxe5 dxe5 2 1 .i.xg4 hxg5 22 O-O-O 'iff4+ 23 �bl .

Until recently White used to castle queenside in this position. Then the endeavours of certain 'Sicilianites' , among them the Kuibyshev master, began to disturb the balance in this variation. The move in the game has been tested only on a few occasions, and as a rule has brought White suc cess.

Be sides, in a number of variations the black queen threatens f2. However, this continuation also has its draw backs, the chief of which is the remote ness of the queen from the kingside. One gains the impression that here, as in the Rauzer Variation, White gets a comfortable game. 13 dxc5 As practice has shown, it is less promising to block the centre. In this case White's threats, associated with the exploitation of the f5-square, are somewhat problematic. 13 dxc5 14 lL!n i.e6 15 lL!e3 l:tad8 16 1i'e2 g6 17 lLlg5 c4 Now it is unfavourable for White to exchange on e6, since his forces will be tied to the defence of f2. If White attempts to play for an attack by 1 8 'iff3, then Black replies 1 8. . .h6 1 9 lL!xe6 fxe6, and White is unable to ex ploit the weakening of the enemy king's position.

After the move in the game, 21 b3 is now a real threat. True, White had to reckon with 20 . . .�d4? 2 1 cxd4 exd4, when his pieces present an excellent target for the black pawns. Against this I had prepared the variation 22 �d5 i.xd5 23 exd5 d3 24 'ii' xe7 dxc2 25 i.e3 ! (25 �e6+ <it>g8) 25 . . .cxb1 'iiV 26 i.xb6 'ii' f5 27 �e6+.

I was therefore fascinated when after the game my opponent suggested the original continuation 26 .. .�b4 ! ?. However, chess would be too beautiful a game if such moves were to work.

However, a tournament encoun ter is only one of a variety of chess art forms. Analysis of opening variations, chess compositions, correspondence chess, and many other elements must be considered when we talk about the art of chess as a single unit. I have permitted myself this intro duction in order to emphasise the thoughts that overtook me at the be ginning of last year. The well-known Stockholm newspaper Dagens Nyhe ter invited me to play a game by tele graph with the Swedish Grandmaster Stoltz. If I had declined this invitation I would have lost the joy of taking part in a game against a player with an in teresting, sharp, combinative style (let me remind the reader that the Swedish grandmaster has won many beauty prizes for tournament games). I would also have missed trying out my powers in a thoroughly strange field. Correspondence chess is differ ent from other chess forms in certain characteristic respects. A player is not handicapped by the same time-control (although in correspondence chess there is occasionally a time forfeit in fact, through the fault of the postal service) and he can calmly analyse the developing position in domestic sur roundings undisturbed by the ' Sword of Damocles' on the chess clock. In order to give as true as possible a picture of the contest, I have used telegrams received from Stockholm and a diary written on the specified day. 22nd March A telegram received from Stock holm with the suggestion of playing 1 3 8 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal this game. Simultaneously a newspa per proposed that the opponents choose their opening variation to make the game as interesting as possible. What should I choose? After a little thought I decided on one of the sharpest Sicil ian Defence variations. And so the duel of the correspondence game has begun.

In front of you is the position I of fered my Swedish opponent. If I am not mistaken the press published only one game with this variation: Spassky Boleslavsky, 25th US SR Champion ship, Riga 1 958. Boleslavsky destroyed the uninvited guest with the f-pawn and was forced to struggle for a long while: 15 ...fxg6 16 h5 gxh5 17 l:txh5 �f6 1 8 l:tg5 �5 19 'it'g2 etc. Apart from anything else, this vari ation was employed again in a training game Tal-Koblents, which in my view is rather interesting. I am using this opportunity to show it to the reader. Tal - Koblents Training Game, Riga 1957 15 • • • hxg6 This looks very risky but it is possi- bly the most powerful.

17 l:txh5 lbf6 18 l:th1 d5! Not only opening up lively play in the centre, but also covering the queen's path to h2. In order not to hand over the initiative, White decided on yet an other pawn sacrifice. The Road to the World Championship 1 39 19 eS! lDxeS It is of course obvious that 19 ... 'i!i'xe5 20 i.f4 'ii' f5 2 1 i.d3 would be bad for Black. 20 i.f4 i.d6 21 'fi'h2 c;#i1f8 22 'fi'h8+ lLlg8 Possibly better would have been 22 .. .fl;e7, but on the other hand the game continuation develops into a most rare position after the following forced moves. 23 l:lh7 24 i.h6 25 i.xbS! 26 l:lg1 fS l:ld7 l:lf7 l:la7 (D) The white pieces occupy rather un comfortable squares. The square g7, the key to Black's position, is pierced but it does not yield. If Black were to strengthen his forces and go over to a counter-attack, then White's main forces would only be able to send a telegram of sympathy to their king. Thus White has to play very energeti cally. 27 lLld4 Introducing one more piece into the attack, at the same time putting the square e6 under control. In this way, if there were to follow 27 . . . 'i!i'b6, then White would win at once, employing a move characteristic of chess prob lems: 28 i.d7 ! ! Instead, Black finds an imaginative idea: to sacrifice a piece in order to strengthen the square g7. 27 ... lLlg4!! 28 fxg4 i.eS Weaker would be 28 .. . i.f4+ 29 i.xf4 'i!i'xf4+ 30 'it>b1 11t'xd4 3 1 l:lgh 1 with the threat of 32 'ii' xg8+. Now, in the case of 3 l . . .l:lfb7 White has the very strong move 32 i.e8 while on 3 1 ...l:lfe7, the quiet 32 g5 is decisive. It seems that Black has reached his goal. He is a piece down but White has three pieces threatened. One gets the impression that Black has taken over the initiative. Nonetheless, within White's reach there is a combination which would give him victory. It seems to me that such a combination is used here for the first time. 29 lLlc6! What a pity it would be to part with the beautiful knight - but the bishop on e5 is Public Enemy Number 1 . White is paying no attention to the rook on a7. 29 ... i.xc3 Foreseeing, after 30 bxc3 axb5 3 1 lLlxa7 'iba7, the coming counter-at tack. After 30 bxc3, also possible would be 30 ... l:lb7.

30 i.e3! Again attacking, and once again not the rook but the square c5. The threat is i.c5+ with mate in a few moves.

The Swedish grandmaster chose a third variation which looks very interesting. Ignoring the advance of White's pawns, Black quietly prepares a counter-attack. 15 ... lDc5 Seemingly Black wan� to manoeu vre this knight to a4 and its neighbour from c6 to c4 via e5, or straight to b4. That is why White has to speed up. 16 gxf7 + 'l;xf7 17 i.h3 White is mounting pressure on the e6-square. The semi-open g-file also favours White's attack. It would be interesting to know in which way Grandmaster Stoltz wants to counter attack on the queen's flank. It seems at first that 17 .. . lDe5 would be necessary but after 1 8 i.d4 lDc4 1 9 'ir'g2 White would be first to gain the initiative. Now White's position does not look bad. A telegram is sent - I wait for the answer. 17th April Grandmaster Stoltz answers 17 ... lDa4 At the moment nothing is threat ened and White can ignore this move. Black could also play 17 . . . lDb4 with the threat . . . lDxa2+, but continuing simply 18 �b1 White would stand well because then ... lDa4 can be met by lDxa4 when White wins a pawn. Now White's task is to find the Achilles' Heel in Black's position. Seemingly it is not the square g7, for with ... i.f6 Black can cover the threats easily. That is why I decided to start an attack with my f-pawn. 18 f4 3rd May It looks as if Black is in a very ag gressive mood. 18 ... lDb4 (D) The Road to the World Championship 141 This uninvited guest appears un pleasant, but what is Black really threatening? On 19 ... lLlxc3 20 bxc3 lLlxa2+ 2 1 �b2, the result is the loss of a piece. I can not see any other threats. In that case ... 19 fS Best for Black now would be the continuation 1 9. . . i..f6 20 fxe6+ �g8 but after 21 i..d4 I prefer White's posi tion. The impression is that White has gained the advantage from the open ing. Still, let us see what the next tele gram will show. 7th May 19 . . . eS A mov� which, to tell the truth, I did not expect. The first natural reac tion of any chess player would be 20 lbd5, but here we see the advantage of correspondence chess; without hurry ing, it is possible to analyse the vari ations arising from this move. So 20 lbd5 lLlxd5 2 1 'ii' xd5+ �f8. How to continue the attack? Black is preparing, with . . . i..b7 and . . .d5, to open up play in the centre. White can take the rook by 22 Rxa8 and after 22 ... i..b7 23 'ii' a7 l:.a8 White has the interesting tactical idea 24 lLld4, and with the threat 25 lbe6+ White saves his queen. There is only one question: is that good enough, because after 24 ... exd4 25 'ii' xd4 i..f6 26 'ii' xd6+ 'ii' xd6 27 l:.xd6 i..xb2+ 28 �b1 i..xe4 the posi tion is very sharp and Black's initia tive looks dangerous. White can also gain the exchange in a different way by playing 22 f6 and after 22 ... i..xf6 23 'ii' xa8 i..b7 24 'ii' a7 l:.a8 25 lLlc5 lLlxc5 (or 25 ...dxc5 26 l:.d7) 26 i..xc5 dxc5 27 l:.d7 'it'xd7 28 'ii' xa8+ i..xa8 29 i..xd7 i..xe4, Black, with two pawns for the exchange, can hope for a good endgame. So 20 lLld5 does not give any solu tion to the problems of the position. It is interesting to note that Black's threats are still very mild - he cannot take the pawn on a2, because he would be in danger of losing the knight. Should White not exploit this fact? Thus I got the idea of playing 20 lLlxa4. The complications which would follow look very promising for White. Black's answer is forced because 20 ...bxa4 2 1 'ii' xb4 loses the pawn without compensation. That is why Black has to play 20 .. . lLlxa2+ 2 1 'iii> b 1 bxa4. By analysing this position I found that White has two squares for his knight: either a1 or aS. On a5 the knight is not safe but on a1 it looks
142 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
uncomfortable. Analysis shows that White can choose the first and more active continuation. So I send the telegram to Stock holm. 9th May I offered the variation: 20 tma4 tma2+ 21 <i'bl bxa4 22 &Lla5 1 1th May This time the answer was not unex pected, 22 . . .d5 does not work because of 23 �xa2 dxe4 24 li'c3 . Now Black is trying to catch the knight on a5 by playing ... 22 . . • l:r.b8 (D) Now we see that White, by continu ing 23 <i>xa2 l:r.b5 24 b4, can keep an extra piece, but then he has to be ready for the possibility 24 ...d5 . My wish was to win the game in a more com fortable way. That is why I looked for other possibilities. One variation would be 23 <i>xa2 l:r.b5 24 c4 l:r.xa5 25 li'b4 threatening 26 i..b6. The same move decides after 25 ...d5, but Black can find counter play by sacrificing the exchange with 25 ... l:r.c5 ! 26 i..xc5 dxc5 27 \i'xa4 l:r.d4 28 l:r.xd4 cxd4 ! (28 . . .exd4 would be worse because of 29 e5). I am sure that in a tournament game White would choose this variation, but the proverb 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush' does not apply in correspondence chess. Once a posi tion like this has arisen one should be able to find something better. Analysis showed that White has one powerful continuation: 23 li'dS+ �f8 24 �xa2 Black has two possibilities. It will be interesting to see which he will choose. 16th May 24 • • • \i'xc2 Black is unable to avoid the tempta tion to threaten mate in one. To be truthful, no better was 24 .. . l:r.b5 be cause of 25 \i'c6 \i'xa5 26 f6 and White wins another piece. The continuation in the game is sharper, but now White's only task is to be a little careful. However, he has a very simple move. 25 l:r.d2 Here I want to note that this last part of the game we played at the time that I started to play in the International tournament at Zurich. One evening I The Road to the World Championship 143 was analysing a completely lost ad journed game against the Swiss Mas ter Bhend and then the telegram arrived. 18th May 25 ... 26 �a1 l:.xb2+ 'ii' c3 With the aim of creating some com plications after 27 llxb2 a3 28 i..c1 axb2+ 29 i..xb2 1i'f3 . However, White has a much simpler continuation which decides the game at once. 20th May 27 'ii' d3! Black has to resign (1·0), as the ex change of queens cannot be avoided. I must report that I played this game with great pleasure, and on the whole it changed my sceptical view of correspondence chess. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Game 27 Kupper - Tal Zurich 1959 Sicilian Defence e4 c5 lDf3 d6 d4 cxd4 lDxd4 lDt'6 lDc3 a6 �g5 e6 f4 b5! This incisive move is not often used in tournament play. It owes its origin to the Russian master Shaposhnikov. The theoretician sees it as advantageous to White, but having lost the first round in the tournament I decided to ignore theory and endeavoured to force a sharp and complicated battle. 8 'ii' f3 After this move Black overcomes his opening difficulties. Much better would be 8 e5. It is interesting to note that at the 26th USSR Championship Nikitin, playing against Polugaevsky, also did not continue with 8 e5 and Black quickly took the initiative.

However, it is interesting to note that Fischer has prepared this narrow repertoire very well. Many chess play ers were surprised when after the game Fischer quietly explained: 'I had already analysed this possibility' - in a position which I thought was not pos sible to foresee from the opening.

O-O
eS �bd7 Knowing the United States Cham pion to be a player with chess princi ples (not to say dogmas), I had no doubt that one of the variations of the King's Indian Defence would be played in our game from the third cy cle. It will not be out of place to recall that the majority of Fischer's defeats in the Candidates Tournament were the result of him repeating the same, and to a considerable extent, inferior opening systems. Of course, one cannot place an opening such as the King's Indian Defence in such a category, but from the results of this tournament it can be concluded that Grandmaster Petrosian, possibly without himself realising it, has placed King's Indian players in a very difficult position. If I remember correctly, he first adopted this system in his game with Suetin from the 25th USSR Championship, when he spoke very modestly about its value, saying that its main advan tage was that Black did not obtain ac tive play. Many games have now been played with this system. Black indeed does not obtain active play, but White does, and what play ! It seems to me that Black's last move is inaccurate: after 7 ... �a6 8 i.g5 h6 9 i.h4 W'e8 1 0 �d2 �7 White must either allow Black to ad vance ...f5 without great loss of time, or else play g4, as occurred in the game Tal-Vasiukov (USSR Peoples' Spartakiad), which at least gives Black some compensation. 8 ... h6 9 i.h4 a6 The continuation 9 . .. g5 10 i.g3 �h5 which, incidentally, occurred in the game Smyslov-Benko from the third cycle, appears to be an over strong measure, since sooner or later one of the white knights establishes itself on the obligingly created post at f5. Besides, it is not in the style of the youthful but cautious American The Road to the World Championship 155 Grandmaster to decide on such a con tinuation without extreme necessity.

1 2. .. f5 would clearly be a mistake because of 13 exf5 when Black is forced to take with his rook ( 1 3. . .gxf5 14 i.h5) . In our game from the first cycle 1 2. .. �g5 was played, and then Black advanced . . .f5, but did not ob tain an attack, since his knight turned out to be 'under the feet' of the storm ing pawns. To be fair, it should be mentioned that White's play was still further im proved by the author of the system, Petrosian, in his game with Gligoric from the final round. In the present game Fischer chooses the most dogmatic, but also very slow, continuation, involving the exchange of the dark-squared bishops. This con tinuation, I recall, was recommended by Grandmaster Averbakh in an article devoted to the tournament in Portoroz, and one must suppose, for this reason, that it was familiar to me. After the game it was revealed that the young American had spent 1 0 hours analys ing this variation. Alas, this did not improve the variation, but it did leave Fischer tired. 13 i.xf6 14 �b3 15 'ii' d2 16 'ii' e3 �hxf6 "i/e7 �h7 16 l:.ac l was possibly more accu rate, for the moment not determining the position of the queen.

I thought that Black was bound to play 20 .. .�e5, on which there would probably have fol lowed 2 1 l:ae1 followed by �d4, gradually preparing a king side attack. Fischer, in his turn, captured on c5 without hesitation, evidently thinking
156 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
that White had overlooked this, and that, with an extra pawn, he would have no difficulty in defending him self. I thought for a long time over my next move, which apparently further convinced Fischer of the correctness of his judgement. 21 i.d3! White spent his time deciding be tween the continuation in the game and the variation 2 1 bxc5 lLlxc5 22 l:lac l i.d7! 23 'fixc7 l:lac8 24 'ikf4 lLlxb3 25 axb3 l:lxc3 26 l:lxc3 'ii' xe2 27 l:c7 'fle7 28 d6 'ili'e6 when, despite the active placing of the white pieces, there is apparently no decisive continu ation. Now, however, White's threats become considerably more concrete in character. 21 •.• cxb4 After his previous move this cap ture could be readily expected. Upon the conclusion of the game it was sug gested that the attack could have been beaten back by 2 1 . . .1i'g7. The fact that this is not quite so, is illustrated by the following line: 2 1 . . .'flg7 22 i.xf5+ 'it>h8 23 lLle4 lLle5 24 lLlg3 lLle7 25 l:lae 1 and if 25 . . . i.xf5 then 26 'ii' xeS while on 25 ... lLld3, 26 lbe7 is possi ble. 22 l:lae1 'flf6 This is the decisive error. 22 .. .

4 World Champion
Soon after my return from Yugoslavia, I met Botvinnik in the Grandmaster room of the Central Chess Club, and we began 'discussing' the conditions for the match. I have put the word in inverted commas, because at that time, although I had behind me some experience of match play (against Saigin in 1954), I never theless did not expect that it would all be taken so seriously. There was in fact no discussion between us, and indeed, there could not be; I fully relied on Botvin nik's experience, and the majority of the details of our meeting have slipped my memory. I recall just one point: the World Champion persistently argued the ne cessity for having two envelopes when a game was adjourned, so that the loss of one (and such a thing can happen even in a World Championship Match) would not be so serious. Two envelopes- that means two scoresheets, on each of which one has to write down a secret move (preferably the same one on each sheet), and since at that time (and even now) I could not cope with carbon paper, the whole procedure of the sealed move seemed to me to be made doubly crucial (perhaps because of this, in our first match I had only to fill in the envelopes - it was always Botvinnik who sealed) . It is both pleasant and complicated to recall the 1960 match. Why it is pleasant, the reader will, of course, realise perfectly well; the difficulty lies in the fact that all that I can say concerning it has evidently been written in my book on the match. Nowadays I sometimes turn over the pages of this book, and try to estab lish to what extent it was written by a youthful hand (to express it somewhat deli cately) . At any rate, my next book about a match for the World Championship will be more 'adult' . I have to admit to the reader that my frame of mind prior to the first game was not particularly optimistic; there was good reason for this. The fact was that in the preceding years I had developed the 'nice' habit of beginning a tournament with a loss. The 25th USSR Championship, the International Tournament in Zurich, the USSR Peoples' Spartakiad, and finally the Candidates Tournament - I think that this list is quite sufficient. Besides, this had become so ingrained in me, that the result of the first game did not come as a surprise either to me, to my oppo nent, who turned up for the game to receive his 'due' point, or to my friends, who began listening to chess reports and buying bulletins only after the second round. One of my friends (I don't know whether he was being serious) suggested that I should simply not turn up for the start of the match, but should join in at the World Champion 161 second game. Who knows, I might have followed his advice had it not been for an old story which accidentally impressed itself on my mind. It is well known that in train crashes it is the rear coaches that come off worst. At a meeting where the question of eliminating the cause of such calamities was being discussed, a wise old signal operator suggested: let's just uncouple the last coach, and let the train go without it. As you can see, these two solutions are almost equally profound .. No doubt because of this, we arrived in Moscow on time. If there had been some discussion as to whether to begin the first game at all, how to begin it we knew beforehand. At the conclusion of the Candidates Tournament in Belgrade, a Yugoslav radio commentator had asked me: 'What will you play on the first move of your first game with Botvinnik?' I then promised to begin by moving my e pawn, and, of course, I did not want to break my word for no special reason; be sides, the move 1 e4 is not bad in itself. The match began very well for me. Koblents and I had guessed which opening variation the World Champion would choose, and although Botvinnik had pre pared an innovation, I was well familiar with the character of the position. I won after a short, sharp skirmish. After the seventh game my lead had increased to three points, but the chess content of our games in no way corresponded to the re sults. The positional advantage gained by Botvinnik as a result of deep, well thought-out play, was in many cases beyond dispute, and only time-trouble er rors, and, to a greater extent, excessive caution in time-trouble, told on the result. Sensing this disparity, I played the eighth game, I would say, excessively reck lessly: if I was going to be punished it would serve me right, while if chess injus tice was to triumph once again - well, as compensation I would have one more point. At first the eighth game developed along familiar lines. By move 15 Botvinnik had a positional advantage, by move 20 an extra pawn, and by move 25 both the one and the other. However, by move 30 the position had become significantly sharper. After a further few inaccurate moves on White's part, the following posi tion was reached (see diagram overleaf). Amazed by his good fortune, Black confidently made what he thought was the winning move 34 ... l:tbc8. There was no time to be amazed for long, since I had only some thirteen minutes remaining on my clock, and Botvinnik three. There followed at rapid speed 35 �aS i.xe2 36 l::. xe2 �xc3 37 l::. xc3. This already came as something of a surprise to me, but it wasn't yet time to become despon dent. 37 ••• l:txc3 38 �xb7 l::. exe3. Having accurately (as I then thought) worked out a forced eight-move variation, after 39 .:.Xe3 l::. xe3 40 �xd6 l::. d3 I went for a smoke behind the stage, (during the first match I was an amateur smoker, so to
162 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
Botvinnik- Tal Moscow Wch match (8), 1960 speak, and could happily go without a cigarette for the full five hours) being in no doubt that the game was decided, since in reply to 41 b7 Black wins by 4 l....l:.b3 42 lLlf7+ �h7 43 lbd8 a5 44 d6 a4 45 d7 a3 46.!Dc6 a2. Half-way through the cigarette it all became clear. By means of a simple transposition of moves - 41lLlf7+!- it is White who wins, since on 4 l.. .'li>h7, 42 d6 is decisive, while if 4 l...'li>g7, then in the variation given above on move 46 White moves his knight away to e6 with check. Arriving back home, Koblents and I spent a few minutes convincing ourselves that further analysis of the adjourned position was unnecessary, and then played through the game. At this point I was in a reasonable mood: one could quote vari ous proverbs appropriate to the incident, such as: 'One must reap where one has sown' etc. Then we reached the position given in the diagram, and almost imme diately various unrepeatable words were uttered. We had both noticed that, by continuing 34 ... l:lec8 instead of 34 ... l:lbc8, Black would have won instantly. It is hardly worth mentioning the fact that I never closed my eyes that night. Forgotten were all the 'presents' received earlier; my heart was tortured by the thought of this scandalous injustice. Early next morning there was a knock at my door, and my second came in. It was clear that he too had not slept well. Smiling, he ex tracted from his briefcase some fresh tomatoes and a cucumber. We breakfasted, phoned a few friends, and went for a walk around Moscow. Then I dropped in for a moment to the chess club, made sure that Botvinnik had sealed 4 l.!Df7 +, and in the evening we went to the theatre. (For a long time I was reluctant to talk about this incident, although I am sure that it demonstrates very clearly the mastery of Koblents as a trainer.) The following game, the ninth, was Botvinnik's best achievement in the match. In his preparations he had succeeded in rendering harmless an apparently very dangerous piece sacrifice, and at the board he exploited my positional errors with World Champion 163 meticulous accuracy. The middle third of the match was extremely hard fought, and its result ( + 1 -1 =6) fully reflects the character of the struggle. Here fatigue was beginning to have its effect (grandmaster draws in the 13th and 14th games), while a change of opening from 1 e4 brought me success in the 11th game. Dur ing this time the two perhaps most interesting drawn games were played (the 1Oth and 12th) . Despite the difference of two points after the 16th game, it was not at all easy to predict the result of the match. It was without doubt the seventeenth game which proved decisive, for once again I 'sowed', and should have 'reaped', but a fatal blunder by Botvinnik in time-trouble led to the World Champion's defeat. By winning the 19th, which is my favourite game from the match, I succeeded in increasing my lead to 4 points. Tal- Botvinnik Moscow Wch match ( 19), 1960 Dutch Defence

164 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
JOURNALIST. This is the game that you like the most, but which move do you remember best of all from this, the most important match of your life? CHESS PLAYER. I think the 12th move of the seventeenth game, which I have already mentioned. Tal- Botvinnik Moscow Wch match (17), 1960 12 f4?! 'Horrible', 'anti-positional', 'unbelievable' etc., etc. - this is how all the com mentators, without exception, described this last move by White. One might think that the player with White was completely unfamiliar with any elementary book on chess, where it is written in black and white that one really can't make a move such as 12 f4, since it weakens the dark squares, leaves the bishop at g5 out of play, and puts in jeopardy the already compromised position of the white king. I don't think that the reader will consider me immodest, if I say that all these con siderations concerned me during the game. Nevertheless, the fact remains: the horrible move 12 f4 was made. Why? I will now try to briefly explain the course of my thoughts during the eight minutes that I spent over my 12th move. I first of all established that White has no trace of an opening advantage. Nevertheless, by 12 'ifd2 White could have steered the ship towards the drawing haven, which would probably not have been far off. Although it may sound silly, during such an important game I suddenly began to be bothered by the question: 'Will my wife and I manage to get to the cinema or theatre?' In fact White has little choice in this position: his bishop is attacked and any re treat by it is inconsistent; the exchange on f6 is devoid of any positional sense, de fending the bishop by 'ii' cl is very passive, and the move 12 f4 is simply bad. Thus it is the drawbacks to all the possible moves which are most apparent. Fi nally my wandering gaze settled on the move 12 f4. At first I became somehow embarrassed, for the drawbacks to this move are more obvious than to any other World Champion 165 one, although in the given position there is no move without its drawbacks. Less apparent are the advantages of this move, but they do exist, although not in a purely chess sense. In the first place, the move 'demands a refutation' which should be accompanied by the possibility of a double-edged, tactical struggle, and this, to judge by Botvinnik's style in the match, would be undesirable for him. Secondly, the weakening of White's position can only be exploited by an under mining of the centre, and after moves such as ...c5 or ... e5 the power of the white bishops will be significantly increased. Finally, Black can attack White's kingside only by castling queenside, but then White can set in motion his queenside pawn mass. Perhaps Black should simply have replied 12 ... O-O, but this is after all not a refutation . JOURNALIST. And Botvinnik's best move? CHESS PLAYER. Probably the 23rd move in his best game, the ninth. Tal- Botvinnik Moscow Wch match (9), 1960 The apparently modest move 23 .• JU8!! enabled Black to carry out the ma noeuvre ... tbg4 and ... tbdf6, after which it became clear that the black piece was stronger than the three white pawns. However, I have already mentioned this ear lier. I will add that Botvinnik went on to win on the 58th move. Shortly after the match there was an interesting friendly match in Hamburg between the USSR and West Germany. At that time I was an object of enhanced interest to the press, but to be honest, this had never particularly bothered me, and I soon became accus tomed to it. And the match was also significant for the fact that, for the first time, I officially began to smoke. I made my first contact with cigarettes during the Candidates Tournament. As you will recall, I made a poor start and for a short time I became depressed and my post-operation stitches began to pull unpleasantly. Here, one of the journalists,
166 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
after making a professional assessment of my condition, offered me a cigarette. I tried one, it worked, and I even liked it. I took to smoking in my room, and since I finished in first place I did not think about the harmful effects of tobacco. At home I systematically began to 'borrow' the odd couple of cigarettes from my un cle. During the match with Botvinnik I was already smoking openly, but for some reason not during the game - I didn't feel I wanted to. On the way to Hamburg I warned my fellow smokers Geller and To lush that if I should show any weakness during play and ask them for a cigarette, they should refuse to give me one. Then came the first game, against Lehmann. Round about move five he put his hand into his pocket, brought out a cigar, and began puffing away at it. I held out for another ten moves, but then the board began to rock slightly in front of me. 'In search of counterplay' I turned to Geller and Tolush, but they simply spread their hands: 'Misha, you yourself asked us not to give you any' . I dashed into the bar and bought a packet of untipped 'Camel' . Since there is a saying that you are not a smoker if you smoke other people's cigarettes, but only if you smoke your own, it was in Hamburg that I became a smoker. In general I was happy with the way the match went. The spectators followed me intently, and, encouraged by their interest, I had but one draw in eight games. JOURNALIST. By the way, how in general are famous players affected by their surroundings? CHESS PLAYER. Here everything depends on the individual. Fischer, for in stance, is abnormally sensitive to the slightest noise in the hall, but it is very dif ficult to sit watching in the hall without stirring, and without exchanging opinions with your neighbour. I myself am sometimes a spectator, and I know that it is so. Therefore I understand perfectly well how Fischer, Botvinnik, and many others players find it very difficult to force themselves to concentrate fully, one hundred per cent, under such conditions. Then there are other players, among them Spassky, Korchnoi and myself. For us it is simply boring to play in an empty hall. When we appear on the stage, we are artistes. The only difference is that chess has its own specific form. You your self are the composer of the 'song', you are the singer, and you are the critic, and a very harsh critic, because you wish without fail to refute the ideas and plans of your 'fellow composer' . When we are playing and there is a hum in the hall, some of us are annoyed, justifiably so, for it is indeed somewhat distracting. With me it is just the opposite, provided only that I am in good form. When things are not working out for me I also get annoyed. I am probably a little jealous if the spectators react noisily to a move made on a neighbouring board or by my opponent, and not by me. Then I World Champion 167 notice that there is a noise in the hall. When I am in good form, it is not a noise, but a reaction from the hall. Something altogether different! The remainder of the year, from September onwards, was spent resting, during which time I worked on my book about the match with Botvinnik. During the Olympiad in Leipzig there was also a happy event: my son was born. At the Olympiad my play was, on the whole, successful. The game with Fis cher is given here, and I gained the impression that it was only after this encounter that he began to 'respect' me. JOURNALIST. How did it happen that it was in this Olympiad that you were second in the tournament on your board, and failed to win it? CHESS PLAYER. Indeed, it was Robatsch who won, playing in the second fi nal group. I deprived myself of first place in the final round. This is how it hap pened. The Olympiad ended on the day before my birthday and I wanted to be free at the finish. Therefore I agreed with my fellow team members to play through the 'middle game' of the Olympiad without a break. However, the day be fore the last round, for strictly private reasons, the captain of our team asked me to play. I 'threatened' him that I would lose, and I carried out my threat, although God knows, I didn't want to. It was just that the English master Penrose played the whole game very well. It turned out that the Olympiad did not conclude my chess year. When I re turned to Riga it was suddenly suggested that I should play a radio match with the strongest young players from Czechoslovakia. At first I readily agreed, but later I regretted this somewhat - after all, to play on 20 boards against present-day Grandmasters such as Hort, Jansa and their colleagues demanded time, and preparations had to be made for the return match with Botvinnik. After travelling to Prague to conclude the radio match, I ceased to regret it, this time for good: the trip proved to be most pleasurable and entertaining. Besides, it was not without its amusing little misunderstandings, caused by the fact that our intermediary, a cor respondent of Czech radio in Moscow, had only a very sketchy knowledge of chess. Thus, for instance, in one of the games, after 1 e4 eS, I sent the move 2 tLlf3, and in reply received the suggestion that I take it back. If I were to insist on it, my youthful opponent courteously warned me, then on 2 f3(???) he would play 2 ... i.c5. Nevertheless, I think that the two sides were about equally satisfied with the score of + 1 1 =9. Then came a small New Year Tournament in Stockholm, one of the steps in my preparations for the match.
168 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
JOURNALIST. Botvinnik considered this appearance of yours to be unneces sary and ill-advised. CHESS PLAYER. On that basis, the same could have been said about the tour nament in Riga before our first match. The point is, most probably, that the win ner is not criticised whereas the loser is always wrong. True, Koblents and I never considered ourselves to be specialists in the art of preparation. The Stockholm tournament was not one of my most difficult, although its short length made it all the more important not to lose. The game against Unzicker is given here, and the analysis of my adjourned game with Book was of interest.
B
Tal- Book Stockholm, 1961 I had no doubt that Black would have sealed 41 ... �e7. The resumption proved unexpectedly easy for me, since on 42 �f2 Black replied 42 ... a5?, and after 43 �e3 a4 44 bxa4 i.xc4 45 �d4 i.fl 46 g3 �d6 47 tLle4+ �c6 48 tLlg5, he re signed (1-0).

The plausi ble 50 M leads surprisingly to a draw, and I think that the drawing method should be of interest to study composers: 50 ... a5 51 ltlc5 �c3 52 �d l (D).

Now the natural 52 .. .�d4 loses to 53 ltle6+ �e4 54 ltlxg7 �f4 55 g5 hxg5 56 h5 �e5 (or 56. . . g4 57 h6 g3 58 �e2) 57 ltle8 !

After 50 h3 none of these variations arises. One disagreeable event which, it is true, came after the finish of the tourna ment, was a recurrence of kidney colic in Moscow, just before the flight to Pra gue. At first it was bearable but I returned from Prague under medical supervision after lying there in hospital for several days. From Prague they even sent their medical diagnosis to Moscow, whereupon our Chess Federation began consider ing the question of deferring the match. I was asked to send a letter to the Presi dent of FIDE with preliminary evidence from a doctor commissioned by my opponent. To me this all seemed to be very complicated and rather insulting, and I preferred to play. Besides, my participation in the first match had itself given me enormous satisfaction, and I was even waiting impatiently for the second encoun ter. When I meet chess fans, I often have to answer a ticklish question: what do you think of return matches? As it happened, the honour of 'closing this page of FIDE' fell to my lot. What would it have cost the International Chess Federation to take the decision to abolish return matches a year earlier?!
170 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
I had no doubt that Botvinnik would utilise his right to a return match. There was also no justification for doubting that he would be excellently prepared, espe cially after his splendid performance at the Olympiad in Leipzig. Not long before the start of this, we once again met in Moscow to discuss the conditions for the match. On this occasion there was indeed a discussion - I had after all become more intractable by a year. In particular, the question of where the return match was to be held was heatedly discussed. In Riga they very much wanted to see, if not the whole event, then at least half of it. One of the points in the regulations an nounced by FIDE (in 1960; subsequently I somehow never came across them again) was that the match should take place in the World Champion's home coun try. Botvinnik, on the other hand, expressed the following point of view: the return match should, as far as possible, be an exact copy of the first match, though of course it was not essential that the result should be the same. Since we were un able to come to an agreement, we decided to ask the opinion of the FIDE Presi dent F. Rogard. Unfortunately, I arrived a few days late in Leipzig (not long before this, the car in which I was travelling to the Crimea skidded into a ditch, and a wheel and two ribs were damaged), and during this period Mr Rogard had had time to listen to my opponent, agree with him, and depart. So once again it was Moscow in the spring. The controllers were our charming old friends StAhlberg and Golombek, while Euwe also arrived for the start. The draw was held in the 'National' hotel, and on the following day the first game was played, with Botvinnik White. The character of the first game showed that my opponent was in every way ex cellently prepared for the match. From the opening Black obtained a very good game. Despite the early exchange of queens, the position reached was of a clearly middlegame character, but the then World Champion decided to play solidly. Gradually the position became level, then it was Botvinnik who obtained a slight advantage. Not anticipating such a turn of events, Black played the ending uncer tainly, and although the game was adjourned there was no need for a resumption. By my win in the second game I succeeded in levelling the score for the last time in the match. In the Caro-Kann Defence Botvinnik introduced a very important innovation, which neutralised the very system which, during our preparations, we had decided to make our main weapon against l . . . c6. For a long time Black had a good position, but in the time-scramble I managed to 'outwit' my opponent and, after a sleepless night with Koblents, I won the game on resumption. Here, inci dentally, for the first time I sealed a move (for the return match the two envelopes had been abolished). Beginning with the third game, Botvinnik took the lead. In the fourth and fifth games I managed to extricate myself, the sixth was a quiet World Champion 171 draw (evidently the only one in the whole match), and then in the seventh came a further telling blow.

What was char acteristic was the following: prior to the return match I had never before adopted this system, and it could have been expected to have some surprise value, since in our preparations the possibility of the Siimisch Variation had been taken into ac count. However, White's tenth and eleventh moves (undoubtedly planned before hand by Botvinnik) showed that my opponent had studied not only everything that had already occurred, but also everything that might occur.

Alas, this hope was not destined to be fulfilled. It began when I caught a bad cold, and was forced to take two consecutive rest days. There was a great temptation to use the whole limit, but in the end I decided to save one rest day, just in case. This was perhaps a mistake. Literally straight from hospital I attempted to
172 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
play aggressively, and for this I was essentially unprepared. Botvinnik easily par ried Black's attack, and soon achieved both a positional and a material advantage. Black's one achievement in this game was to make it last for 73 moves. Events developed similarly in the following game. My fully viable 'reserve' variation against the Caro-Kann (3 e5 i.. f5 4 h4) was thoroughly spoiled by my poor 9th and lOth moves. Botvinnik quickly obtained the better ending, and all my tactical tricks proved fruitless. In the eleventh game came the opposite extreme. It is difficult to explain by anything but demoralisation my decision to play the Slav Defence, for almost the first time in my life, almost imploring my opponent to exchange on d5, and, with a lead of three points, let me off with a draw. Botvinnik fulfilled the first part of this programme, but for some reason he considered his lead to be insufficient, and he adopted a continuation for White which he had prepared some 15 years before our game. Black was unable to find the correct rejoinder, and soon after the open ing the game transposed into an ending highly favourable for White. Today I realise that a difference of four points essentially signifies the end of a match. At that time I did not realise this, and I battled on with, I would say, con siderable optimism, which was reflected to a certain extent in the statistics of the match. Things were apparently alright with my 'forwards'- I managed to win five games (six in 1960)- but my defence ... the ten defeats tell the whole story. In some g�es I would allow Botvinnik to slip out, in others he would do the same to me, but my opponent approached closer and closer to the 12112 point mark. On losing in the eighteenth game, after which the score became 11112-5112, I was al ready prepared in the following game to congratulate Botvinnik on his overall victory. It was just at that time that my old friend, International Master (now Grandmaster) Padevsky arrived in Moscow from Bulgaria, having already pre pared an article on the return match (more accurately, the title of the article was: 'The king is dead, long live the king!'). We went to the nineteenth game together, and outside the Estrada theatre came across a large number of vehicles: the News reel and Central Television organisations had sent their correspondents along to cover the anticipated coronation. It was evidently this circumstance that thor oughly aroused me, and I played the 19th game as though to spite the press. Botvinnik -Tal Moscow Wch match ( 19), 1961 King's Indian Defence

174 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
adjourned position proved to be more accurate than that from Botvinnik's cele brated laboratory. Once again some illusory hopes appeared. In his article 'Analysis or improvi sation' , written soon after the match, Botvinnik said that he had been very tired, and that if the 20th game had turned out unfavourably for him, it was not clear how the match would have ended. This is, of course, an exaggeration, but in any event the 20th proved to be a record game, both in the number of moves ( 120 !), and in the number of man-days. It was twice adjourned, and twice resumed. At first the game was adjourned in a position where I knew there was a win, but we were unable to find the most accurate plan. On the resumption, after only 4 moves, Botvinnik played a line which we had not foreseen. The game began to look drawish, but then it was Black who made a mistake. After 88 moves the game was once again adjourned. The preceding games, played in a continuously tense atmosphere, had evidently exhausted both players. At any rate, on returning to the hotel after the first resumption, I simply did not have the strength to con tinue analysing. The game appeared to be won, but during the next two days we were unable to discover anything new. Perhaps therefore, when I once again took my place on the stage, I failed to notice the expressive faces of the stage atten dants, who had heard from Botvinnik that his position was hopeless, nor did I pay any attention to the absence of my opponent's traditional thermos, and even failed to take into account the distressed shaking of his head. By finding a clever idea based on a stalemating possibility, Botvinnik suc ceeded in saving the game. This finally settled matters. There has been a great deal written about the result of the return match. Of course, I do not consider that I played better in this match than at any time in my life, but I can assure the reader that my preparations for the second match were no less, and in no way inferior, to those for the first match. Meanwhile, so many rea sons have been found to explain the fall after my ascent, that I myself would like to try my hand in this field of journalistic solidarity, as it were. I have managed to find two reasons: the reader can judge for himself how seri ous they are: (1) During the 1960 match, Botvinnik and I lived in adjacent rooms in the 'Moscow' hotel. Before games, my second would make his protege happy by singing Neapolitan songs. This inspired me, but in all probability demoralised Botvinnik. During the return match Botvinnik did not stay in the 'Moscow' hotel. (2) By the eighth game of the return match I finally succeeded in selecting a 'lucky' pencil. Alas, after winning, I left it on the tabl�. When, a week later, I re turned, the pencil had gone (perhaps an unknown supporter of Mikhail Moiseye vich had taken it) . I did not manage to find an adequate replacement. World Champion 175 This is all, as they say, 'journalism' . Seriously speaking, I was quite unpre pared for the change which had taken place in Botvinnik. He arrived for the 1961 match extremely self-disciplined and aggressive, readily going in for a stormy position if it looked favourable for him, which he had not done in 1960. In the main one must look to the form of the winner to find an explanation for the result of the match. In conclusion, I should remark that the defeat did not provoke a crisis in my game, although I have read this on a number of occasions. Three months later I succeeded in taking first place in a strong tournament. This was the tournament in Bled, but before this I made my debut as Ex-World Champion in the European Team Championship at Oberhausen. Of the chess events I should mention the game with Toran given here, and the last time (for the moment!) that I adopted the French Defence, against Portisch, which led to the score between us becoming 1-1. But now about Bled, the 'Tournament of the Century' , as it was called at the time. Once again the familiar town, the same hotel, though a different tournament hall which had only just been built. The majority of the competitors were Grand masters. I was evidently still very conservative, for my first result to appear in the table was a nought. After adjourning my first game against Ivkov, I then went down without a fight against Fischer. About once a year I used to write down one move, and then make a different one, and on this occasion, as a result of such a transpo sition, I had a difficult position as early as the 6th(!!) move, and by the lOth or 12th a lost one. In this tournament I realised that the two matches with Botvinnik had not been altogether to no purpose, since along with sharp games I succeeded in winning several by purely strategic means, 'a la Botvinnik' . The most important of these was the encounter in the last round with Najdorf. At this point I was leading Fis cher by only half a point. JOURNALIST. One question in passing. When everything is going well for you, and then suddenly the tournament situation becomes critical, how does this affect you ? CHESS PLAYER. It becomes more interesting and I even begin to get nerv ous, which is also good. During a tournament a player has no right to be a mummy, but the nervousness must come from inspiration and not from a shaking of the knees. It was especially interesting on this occasion, for Fischer, who was my rival, demonstratively took Najdorf aside to prepare him for our game. It was quite
176 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
clear: Najdorf was being initiated into the secrets of an interesting variation of the Sicilian Defence, which Fischer systematically and successfully later adopted as Black. On the evening before the game, the Soviet Grandmasters were with Gligoric in the hotel bar, when Fischer came up to the table and confidentially informed me: 'You will lose tomorrow to Najdorf. But on the whole you haven't played badly, and I have no objection to sharing first place with you, so I won't win against Ivkov.' I did my best to dissuade Robert, but he stuck to his opinion. The following day I played a completely different variation against Najdorf. Fischer came up, saw what was happening, and frowned ... Tal- Najdorf Bled, 1961 Sicilian Defence

On the return journey, Keres and I had to 'jump out' of the plane, which stopped off at Kiev on the flight from Belgrade to Moscow. There we ran to catch the Kiev-Rig a flight, and the following day were already at the board in the semi final of the USSR team tournament. Although there were only three rounds of the tournament remaining, for me it was still the start ! And so, inevitably giving in to the mysterious force, I straight away lost to the candidate master Barstatis ... This was followed by a quick draw with my flight-companion Keres, and then I managed to celebrate my son's first birthday with a victory over Averbakh (see diagram on next page).

But before this fi nal took place, the fate of the individual USSR Championship gold medal was to be decided. This Championship went so badly for me, that during it I was even reminded of my tournament position in the quarter-final at Vilnius. Perhaps this was because, in my game at the start with Bagirov, a kind of psychological change took place in my conscious mind. My opponent was in severe time-trouble. I had a winning po sition, and I saw a sharp but convincing enough way to win. Just here the thought entered my head that, in our second match, Botvinnik had many times ignored my time-trouble, and had played somehow exaggeratedly calmly. So I set my king off on an unnecessary journey, whereupon my astonished opponent gave several in stant checks, reducing his time deficit with every move. My king crossed half the board before I realised that in the place he was heading for he would be mated. There was no way back, and Bagirov forced perpetual check. Although only half a point had been lost, which over a distance of 2 1 rounds is almost insignificant, the 'favourable wind' had also died down. As a result, in the subsequent rounds, there followed one draw after another, including some that were pretty annoying. In the diagram on the following page, in order to carr y out my intended combi nation, I had to lure the white bishop out to h3, where, incidentally, it would oc cupy an apparently more active position. I thought for a very long time, trying to choose between the moves 16 ... :td7 and 16 ... :td6. I finally decided that the first of these would too 'crudely' urge White to play Ji.h3, and settled for the latter.
B
The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal Vasiukov- Tal USSR Ch, Baku 1961 Later I found out that such a lengthy consideration had prompted my opponent to overestimate his position: he decided that Black must be experiencing difficul ties.

World Champion 179 As a result of all this, after 10 rounds I had scored two wins and 8(! !) draws, and taking into account the furious pace set by Spassky I was already unable to compete for first place. Realisation of this naturally did not improve my frame of mind, and in the middle of the tournament I very quickly dissipated my '+2', los ing to Bronstein, and, in crushing style, to Nezhmetdinov. It was this second game that shook me up. Returning to the hotel with Poluga evsky, I even bet him that I wouldn't draw a single one of my remaining games. There were six rounds to go, and Lev was surprised. 'What do you mean, you won't have any more draws?' 'Well, I just won't ! !' 'What, are you intending to lose them all?' 'No!' I won my bet, since my score in the concluding rounds was +5 - 1 =0 ! The overall result was not so terrible: a share of 4th-5th places with Vasiukov. Later it was simply annoying to read in the press that Tal had played badly, whereas Vasi ukov had achieved a great success. Game 33 Tal - Botvinnik Moscow W eh match ( 1 ), 1960 French Defence
1 e4 e6
Was this a surprise? In my opinion, no. At any event, when we were pre paring for the match, my trainer Alex ander Koblents and I had considered the adoption of the French Defence to be a very real possibility. Although in his second match with Smyslov ( 1957) this opening did not prove par ticularly successful for Botvinnik, the fact that he adhered so exceptionally to his creative principles gave every reason for thinking that he would not give up further tests of the French De fence, which had brought him so many glorious victories. The last 'French' game of theoretical significance was played between Gligoric and Petro sian in the Candidates Tournament (1959) , and brought success in the opening to White. It stands to reason that we had studied this game, and were not averse to a repetition of the opening moves. Since it was also ob vious that Botvinnik too had exam ined this game, in the opening of our very first encounter there began an un usual psychological duel. Before my second move I thought for a minute, remembering the numerous branches of this opening, and trying to guess which one my opponent had decided to choose. 2 d4 3 tt:'!c3 d5 .tb4 The French Defence is one of the most complicated openings. For a long time the opening was thought to lead to a complicated manoeuvring 1 80 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal game without any immediate clashes, but by the efforts of Soviet theorists, in particular Rauzer (for White) and Botvinnik (for Black), ways were found of greatly sharpening the posi tion. In the variation adopted by Botvin nik in this game, Black parts with his dark-squared bishop, which weakens his kingside to a significant degree. As enduring compensation for this he gains pressure on White's somewhat compromised queenside. Many games begun with this opening have shown that, if White does not succeed in quickly taking the initiative, the weak nesses in his position will tell sooner or later. For this reason White players now aim to force events, in order to hinder the consolidation of the oppo nent's forces. 4 e5 5 a3 c5 .txc3+ Botvinnik chooses his approved continuation. It is interesting to note that, in sev eral games from his 1954 match with Smyslov, he retreated his bishop to a5 . Grandmaster Smyslov does not like long forcing variations in the opening - after 5 . . . .ta5 6 b4 cxd4 in the first and third games he continued 7 l'Llb5, hoping in quiet play to exploit the ac tive placing of his pieces. It has to be assumed that Botvinnik considered this variation to be perfectly accept able for Black, since in the ninth game of the same match he again played 5 . . . .ta5, but this time (after home preparation) Smyslov chose the sharper 7 'iWg4 ! ?, and after 7 .. . l'Lle7 8 bxa5 dxc3 9 'ii' xg7 l:.g8 10 'ilfxh7 l'Lld7 (10 ... l'Llbc6 is much more active) 11 l'Llf3 l'Llf8 12 'it'd3 'iVxa5 13 h4 ! he gained a significant advantage and won brilliantly. Botvinnik again em ployed this variation in a game with Unzicker at the Amsterdam Olym piad, 1954. However, on this occasion he did not 'squander' his kingside pawns, preferring the more cautious 7 .. .'�f8. but in this game too he gained an indifferent position from the open ing. It was evidently because of 7 'ilfg4 that Botvinnik gave up 5 ... .ta5, al though even here the last word has certainly not been said. From this point of view, the game Matanovic Mititelu (Zonal Tournament, Budapest 1960) is of great interest. It should be mentioned, incidentally, that in re cent times the move 'iWg4 has become something of a 'visiting card' for White in the French Defence, in cases where he is striving for the maximum from the opening. 6 bxc3 'W/c7 (D) This move also has an interesting history. 6 .. . l'Lle7 looks more flexible, since the king's knight has to be devel oped on this square, whereas in some cases the black queen can occupy a5, and later a4. With the thematic 7 'ilt'g4 White again provokes complications, on which chess theory has not yet given a final evaluation. If my mem ory does not betray me, the last time World Champion 1 8 1 Botvinnik played 6.Ji)e7 was in his game with Alexander (USSR-Great Britain Radio Match, 1947) . The Eng lish master continued 7 1W g4 cxd4 8 1Wxg7 l:.g8 9 'ii' xh7 'ii' a5 1 0 llbl and after a complicated struggle he won the game. Later grandmaster Geller suggested the even stronger continu ation 8 .i.d3, and he successfully em ployed it to gain a brilliant win over Sokolsky ( 1 8th USSR Champion ship) . In recent times the efforts of Black devotees in this variation have been aimed at improving the defence with 7 ...O-O or 7 ... �f5. Botvinnik aims for immediate play in the centre. w 7 1Wg4 'There is nothing new under the sun' . This variation too has occurred in several of my opponent's games. After 7 �f3 the play would have been complicated enough, but insuffi ciently sharp. For the moment White is threatening to destroy Black's king side. 7 ••• fS 7 . . .�e7 8 1i'xg7 llg8 9 'ii' xh7 cxd4 would merely have led to a transpo sition of moves. Now the idea of Black's 6th move becomes clear - the g7 -pawn is defended. Since the en passant capture 8 exf(j �xf6 would merely have confirmed the well known rule, which features in all chess prim ers - that it is unfavourable to develop the queen at the start of the game - White, naturally, continues ... 8 1Wg3 CDe7 With this last move Black empha sises that he is not at all afraid of the capture on g7. To avoid this he could have first exchanged in the centre: 8 . . .cxd4 9 cxd4, and only then played 9 . . . CDe7, after which 1 0 1Wxg7?? loses to 10 . . . llg8 1 1 'ii' xh7 1i'c3+. In particular, this is what Botvinnik himself played in his game with Reshevsky (Match-Tournament for the World Championship, 1 948) . White continued 1 0 i.d2 O-O 1 1 i.d3 b6 12 �e2 i.a6 13 �f4 and obtained a good attacking position. Later, it is true, Botvinnik succeeded in repelling the attack with accurate defence and even in winning the game, but even so there are few players to whom the resulting position appeals, since White acquires an appreciable positional plus: his dark-squared bishop, which for the moment is operating only on one di agonal, can make its way via d2 to b4, where it will be much more actively placed. 'The last of the Mohicans' trying to uphold this variation with Black is 1 82 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal now a gifted young player from East Germany - Reinhardt Fuchs. He has twice employed this continuation against Soviet players- with Spassky in the Student World Championship in Varna ( 1 958) and with Vasiukov (Gotha 1 957), but both times he was crushed in about 25 moves. 9 'ili'xg7 In the 14th game of his match with Botvinnik (1957) , Smyslov avoided the complications by playing 9 Ji.d2. In this case Black developed his forces as in the above-mentioned game with Reshevsky, and gained a good posi tion thanks to the passive placing of White's queen's bishop. I am con vinced that, if White wants to gain an opening advantage, he should on no account reject this type of double edged continuation, which is always the most critical and usually the strongest. 10 'ili'xh7 11 'iti>dl!? l:.g8 cxd4 Twenty years ago a chess commen tator would have been horrified by such a move. At the very start of the game the white king voluntarily em barks on a journey. Now, however, few are surprised by this eccentric con tinuation. For the moment White pre fers to camouflage his plans for the development of his king's knight, re taining the option of it going either to e2 or to f3, and he also leaves clear the fl-a6 diagonal. For the moment the loss of the right to castle is not important, since, firstly, the opponent's pieces are insufficiently developed, and sec ondly, at e8 the black king too is not very comfortable. As far as I recall, the only game in which 1 1 'iti>dl (recommended by Euwe, incidentally) has been tested was the above-mentioned Gligoric-Petrosian game. The Soviet grandmaster contin ued with the straightforward 11 ...�bc6 12 �f3 �xe5, and after the very strong move 13 Ji.g5 ! he ended up in a difficult position (13 ... �xf3 fails to 14 Ji.b5+ ! ) . The possibility of signifi cantly strengthening Black's play had not escaped Botvinnik's keen analyti cal searching. 11 ••• Ji.d7 (D) A very cunning move, by which Black hopes to exploit the offensive power of the queen at c7, in order to emphasise the vulnerable position of the white king. The pieces have to be developed in any case, but first it is best to bring out the bishop. If White now plays 12 �f3, then after 1 2. .. Ji.a4 World Champion 183 13 �d3 'ifxc3 his position immedi ately becomes critical. In the event of 12 lLle2 Black can again continue 12 .. .�a4, with the unpleasant threat of 13 . . .d3 . It is apparent, therefore, that the move l l . . . �d7 simultaneously pursues two aims: a strategic one the completion of development and queenside castling, and a tactical one - a blow against c2. If White does not want to come under a strong attack, he must play very actively. There is a ba sis for this. With 7 .. .f5 Black has rid himself of his f7-pawn, the guarding of which is an unpleasant role often undertaken by the king itself, but on the other hand he has weakened the h5-e8 diagonal, which exposes the king and deprives any black pieces that end up on this diagonal of 'mate rial' support. In addition, the white queen can now return home with gain of tempo. 12 'iVhS+ lLlg6 If 12 .. .C�'d8, to avoid the pin, I was in tending 13 �g5, aiming for an attack. With the move played Black launches a 'trial balloon', to see whether White will be satisfied with a draw after 13 'ii' h7 lLle7 14 'ifh5+. 13 lLle2 (D) Clearly, such an agreement to a draw would have been a humiliating creative defeat. It would have signi fied an admission that I was rattled after my opponent's very first innova tion. With his 13th move White strives to exploit the pin. For the moment he is threatening 14 lLlf4, and if 14 .. .�f7. then either the quiet 15 �d3 or the sharper 15 g4. Now it is Black who has to worry about his king. Botvinnik spent more than half an hour consider ing his next move, from which it can be concluded that not all the subtle ties of the variation had been taken into account in his home laboratory. 13 . . . 'ifxe5 14 cxd4 or 13 . . .dxc3 14 lLlf4 �f7 15 �d3 (much stronger than Vukovic's recommendation 15 'ili'h7+) with a number of unpleasant threats (possible, for example, is the variation 15 . . . lLlc6 16 �xf5 exf5 17 e6+ �xe6 18 'ili'h7+ l:tg7 19 'ifxg7+ !) could not in any way satisfy Black.

Black takes the op portunity to restore with gain of tempo the connection of his queen with the kingside, but in so doing he drives the white king to e1, where it is consider ably more secure. Things would have been much more difficult for White after the sim ple 14 .. . lbc6 followed by queenside castling. The white king, whose de fences on the queenside are very shaky, would have had to waste a tempo on moving to the opposite flank via el. After 14 ... lbc6 I think that Black would have had very real compensa tion for the two sacrificed pawns.
15 Re1 (D)
15 'it'xe5 It is quite understandable that Black should try to regain at least part of the sacrificed material, but with this move he loses a great deal of time. 15 . . . lbc6 would have been more in the spirit of the chosen plan. Here, it is true, this move is less strong, since White can continue 16 f4 O-O-O 17 Ji.d2, and then gradually free his kingside pieces. Sooner or later Black would have to sacrifice a knight on e5 . The sub sequent events are difficult to antici pate, but at any event Black would have held the initiative. 15 . . . Ji.b5, sug gested by the Czech master Podgorny, looks tempting, but with 16 Ji.g5 ! Ji.xd3 17 Rd2 White seizes the initia tive. 16 ..i.g5! The main task now facing White is to keep the black king in the centre. In this case the loss of the e5-pawn will be to his advantage, since he may be able to create dangerous threats on the open e-file. It is this factor that gives rise to White's unusual plan, involving the 'lateral' development of the rooks. 16 ••• lbc6 The attempt to fight for the initia tive by 16 .. .f4 does not work in view of 17 d4 'ili'f5 18 lDxf4 'ii' c2 19 lbe2.

Not in order to try and realise the extra pawn (although this too plays its part) , but with the aim of bringing the World Champion 185 king's rook into play as quickly as possible in anticipation of events com ing to a head in the centre. Slower continuations allow Black, by playing .. .t'iJce7 and preparing queenside cas tling, to obtain a dynamic position. Now, however, there is no time for 1 8 . . . tlJce7, since White simply ex changes on e7 ( 1 9 i.xe7 'if'xe7) and by continuing 20 'ii' g5 takes the play along very prosaic lines.

Game 34 Botvinnik- Tal Moscow Wch (6), 1960 King's Indian Defence Although it had given me a one-point advantage, the start of the match had not completely satisfied me. In the last four games my opponent had been able to direct the play along his fa vourite channels and had invariably held the initiative. To expect that I would be able to continue gaining draws after prolonged defence would have been highly frivolous. Therefore we decided at all costs to change the character of the play. Once again the already tiresome question was on the agenda: which opening to play? Both the Nimzo-Indian Defence and the Modern Benoni had in general not produced the desired effect. There re mained one more double-edged open ing - the classical King's Indian Defence, and it was this that we chose. A definite role in this was played by the fact that against the King's Indian Botvinnik usually chooses a rather old-fashioned continuation with the fianchetto of the king's bishop, which, in my opinion, does not give White any opening advantage, and avoids the fashionable lines (the Samisch and Petrosian Variations) which are con sidered White's most dangerous weap ons. The very first moves conftrmed the correctness of our assumption. 1 c4 This, along with 1 d4, is Botvin nik's favourite move. The aim of it, in particular, is to avoid undesirable opening lines, such as the Nimzo-In dian Defence, for example. Thus after
1 c4 �f6 2 �c3 e6 White can, say,
continue 3 �f3, delaying d2-d4. In the event of l.. .e5 a Sicilian Defence arises with colours reversed, where the extra tempo naturally plays an im portant role. By maintaining the sym metry with 1. . .c5 Black can take play into the English Opening, but it is well known that Botvinnik plays it in mas terly style with both White and Black. 1 88 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal After a little thought, Black decided to make a move that leaves the question open. 1 . . . �6 2 lbf3 To some extent White declares his intentions. He emphasises that he does not intend to play the Nimzo-Indian Defence, nor in the King's Indian De fence to play the sharp Siimisch Vari ation, in which, as is known, a basic element of White's play is the prop ping-up of his centre by f2-f3. At the same time Botvinnik avoids a vari ation that was popular in the recent past - a branch of the English Open ing which was still possible after 2 lbc3 g6 3 g3 i.g7 4 i.g2 O-O 5 e4 d6 6 lbge2. White follows up with d2-d3 and then, depending on which black pawn takes part in the battle for the centre - . . . c5 or . . . e5 - he begins at tacking it either in the first case by a2- a3 and b2-b4, or in the second case by f2-f4. However, experience has shown that Black's control of d4 gives him a quite comfortable position, and in par ticular Smyslov scored a very logical win in the first game of his match with Botvinnik in 1957. Botvinnik tried this variation again with White against Gurgenidze in the 2nd USSR Sparta kiad (1959), but in this case too Black gained satisfactory play from the opening. Now, however, this variation is not possible, since White has developed his king's knight at f3. 2 ••• g6 The King's Indian Defence has an interesting history. It received wide recognition some twenty years ago. Before that the opening was only em ployed from time to time and, so to speak, spontaneously. In particular, such a set-up was chosen long ago by Chigorin, but White's superiority in the centre, the apparent passivity of the bishop at g7, running up against its own pawn at e5, and Black's cramped position did not inspire much confi dence. In the late 1930s a group of Ukrainian players led by Konstanti nopolsky, Boleslavsky and Bronstein set about making a detailed study of this rejected opening, and gave it a second wind. Which chess enthusiast is not familiar with David Bronstein 's virtuoso combinations in his games against Pachman and Zita (Moscow v. Prague match, 1946), in which the 'in active' bishop at g7 carried out its de structive work? For this, it is true, Black sacrificed 'only' a rook. Which chess enthusiast has not been enrap tured by the brilliant ideas of the King's Indian devotees' 'younger brother', the Odessa grandmaster Yefim Geller, in whose hands this opening has be come a formidable weapon? New systems of development for Black appeared, and the move . . .e7- e5 ceased to be obligatory ; in many games Black attacked the centre with . . .c7-c5, or sometimes altogether avoided moving his c- and e-pawns, preferring piece pressure on the centre with . . . lbc6 and ... i.g4. The idea of World Champion 1 89 immediate counterplay on the queen side with ... a7-a6 and ... b7-b5 also ap peared. As a rule, Black was able to carry out all these ideas most success fully with the white king's bishop at g2, and so players of the King's Indian for White also began employing other set-ups. They revived the Siimisch Variation, which usually leads to a very sharp battle with castling on op posite sides, where White tries to demonstrate that the move ... g7-g6 significantly weakens Black's king side. Initially this variation brought White some success, but by the efforts of faithful King's Indian players (in particular Geller and Gligoric) suffi ciently effective antidotes were found. Grandmaster Tigran Petrosian in turn suggested a very dangerous idea, in volving the development of the bishop at g5 (from where it hinders Black's counterplay on the kingside}, followed by the advance of the white pawns on the opposite wing, with the aim of opening lines. For the moment the last word for Black in this variation be longs to the talented Ukrainian master Leonid Stein, who played ... h7 -h6 be fore i.g5 and thereby nipped White's idea in the bud, true, at the cost of a tempo. All the same, recent events have shown that the fashion for the King's Indian Defence has begun to pass, and even such devotees as Petrosian, Bronstein and Geller have frequently chosen other set-ups. Per haps this has happened because its novelty has faded, perhaps because White's play has become more pur poseful, but in any case it is far too early to write off the King's Indian Defence, since, even if does give White a slight advantage, Black achieves just as viable a position as in any other opening. 3 g3 4 i.g2 5 d4 i.g7
O-O
White gradually determines his pawn configuration. Here or a couple of moves later he still had the possibil ity of playing d2-d3, giving the game a closed character. It must be assumed that Botvinnik did not want to define the play so sharply, since in this vari ation White gains the initiative on the queenside, but Black gains a counter attack on the kingside. My opponent probably did not want to allow such a possibility right from the opening, es pecially since several recent games, the most memorable of them being Pirc-Boleslavsky (US SR v. Yugosla via, Leningrad 1957), have confirmed its effectiveness. Now Black has to de cide which variation to choose. He can switch to the Griinfeld Defence with 5 ... d5, but I have only played it very rarely and feel insufficiently at home in these positions. The attempt to switch to a symmetrical set-up with 5 ...c6 fol lowed by ... d7 -d5 leads to a dull game with a slight advantage for White. 5 . . . d6 6 ll:lc3 ll:lbd7 Another committal move. Black demonstrates his intention to play the
190 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
King's Indian in its 'original' form. This was the variation used when it began being played in important tour naments. In many games I have pre ferred the set-ups with 6 ... c5 and 6 ... lLlc6. The continuation chosen here has occurred much more rarely in my games, and we assumed that Botvin nik would be correspondingly less prepared for it.
7 O-O eS
8 e4 c6
The most flexible. Black does not object to the closing of the centre, since in this case his knight obtains a comfortable post at c5 and, in addi tion, with the centre closed his hands are freed for play on the kingside - his knight moves from f6 to e8 or h5, making way for the f-pawn. The im mediate capture on d4 promises a defi nite advantage for White, who gains more freedom in the centre and on the kingside. 9 h3 In many games Botvinnik tried to demonstrate that this move, defending the bishop at e3 against attack, is a waste of time, and he preferred the im mediate 9 Ji.e3, but in the 14th game of the Botvinnik-Smyslov match ( 1954) Black found a convincing reply to this move-order. He played 9 ... lLlg4
10 Ji.g5 'it'b6! 11 h3 exd4 ! 12 lLla4
'it'a6 13 hxg4 b5 14 lLlxd4 bxa4 15 lLlxc6 'ili'xc6 16 e5 'it'xc4 17 Ji.xa8 lLlxe5 and in a sharp battle Smyslov gained the advantage. The prophylac tic move 9 h3 is after all necessary. White's plans include the harmonious development of his pieces in the re gion of the centre, and if sooner or later he should succeed in forcing the opponent to exchange on d4, he will gain the opportunity to exert pressure on the weak d6-pawn. Black has usu ally based his counterplay on the long range bishop at g7, but with careful play White is able to neutralise it. Such a course has occurred many times in games where Black has exchanged immediately on d4 or continued 9 ... a5 and . . . l:r.e8 . Black's difficulties in this variation prompted him to begin searching for more active continu ations, one of which (incidentally, also of Ukrainian origin) is the text-move. During recent years 9 ... 'it'a5, with similar ideas, has also become popu lar, but since I had already employed this move in tournament games, I did not want to repeat it in the match. 9 • • • 'it'b6 (D) Black immediately begins action against d4. Now he is threatening a World Champion 191 familiar combination, namely 1 0 ...exd4 11 tLlxd4 tLlxe4 ! At the same time he sets his 'sights' on the c4-pawn (by 10 ... 'ii' b4) . Thus if White wants to maintain the tension in the centre, he has to reckon with numerous counter ideas by Black. It should not be for gotten that in some cases (after an eventual ... tLlg4) the queen at b6 can create threats to the f2-pawn. Our choice of opening proved psycho logically successful. Botvinnik again avoids double-edged tactical continu ations, and prefers the immediate clos ing of the centre, hoping to gain time by attacking the queen. The other way of relieving the tension in the centre, 10 dxe5, gives White little- Black ob tains a comfortable outpost at d4, and the queen can return to its usual posi tion at e7 via b4. 10 dS 11 cxdS cxdS tLlcS The first virtue of the plan selected by Black is evident: his knight has oc cupied an active position and is al ready attacking a pawn. 12 tLle1 (D) During the game I assumed that this was a theoretical innovation. More common here is 12 .l:.e1 or 12 tLld2, in order to transfer the knight to c4 with gain of tempo. In this case, however, Black retains freedom of action and can initiate play both on the queenside by preparing . . .b7-b5 and ... .i.a6, and on the kingside by advancing ... f7-f5. Later, however, I learned that 12 tLle1 had been played by Petrosian in a game with Shiyanovsky in a USSR Championship Semi-final (Kiev 1957) which he won quickly (true, the vir tues of the move 12 tLle1 were nothing to do with this) . White does not intend to tolerate for long the 'annoying' knight at c5 and prepares to exchange it. The role of the piece that will gain a tempo is assigned to the bishop at c l. Neverthe less, 12 tLle1 has the drawback that White loses a certain amount of time and the opponent is able to complete his development unhindered. This is precisely what Shiyanovsky forgot to do in the above-mentioned game, de ciding instead to try and conclude matters immediately with an attack on the kingside. 12 .i.d7 13 tLld3 Botvinnik is of the opinion that fre quent appearances in tournaments are not so essential. Of course, the meth ods of working during a preparation period are a matter of taste for every
192 The Life and Games of Mikho.il Tal
player. At the same time, modern chess has now reached such a high level that knowledge and ability alone are insufficient. Every game demands an enormous output of nervous en ergy, and therefore regular (more or less frequent) participation in compe titions is necessary for a player to keep in form. The text-move, or, more pre cisely, the time spent on it, demon strate that Botvinnik had not played competitive chess for a long time. On the quite obvious and undoubtedly strongest continuation of the manoeu vre begun with the previous move, did he really have to spend ten minutes out of his overall budget of two and a half hours? How many times has a player lacked precisely these ten min utes at a decisive moment! 13 l£Jxd3 14 'i!i'xd3 :t'c8 (D) The critical position. Here Black spent a long time deciding which plan to adopt in the middlegame. He wanted to play ... f7-f5, which gains in strength with the pawns at h3 and g3, since White's kingside is to some ex tent weakened. However, the straight forward 14 .. . lNh5 does not achieve its aim in view of 15 .te3 'ii' d8 16 1i'e2 !, and now after 16. ..f5 17 exf5 Black has to reconcile himself to a position- ally difficult game after 17 .. . .txf5 . I did not want to prepare . . . f7-f5 by 14 ... tLle8, as I was afraid that the queenside would be inadequately de fended. Nevertheless, a more detailed analysis shows that this continuation deserved serious consideration. After 14 ... tLle8 15 �e3 'ii' d8 for the moment White cannot create any real threats on the queenside, and ... f7-f5 can be played without hindrance. Whether this continuation gives anything real after, for example, 16 .l:tacl f5 17 exf5 gxf5 18 f4- that is another question. All the same, the bishop at g7 comes actively into the game. Black (also partly on psychological grounds) de cided for the moment to play on the queenside, and then, having dulled the opponent's vigilance, to advance ... f7- f5 at a convenient moment. I have to admit that at this point I was already seized with the idea of the knight sac rifice at f4, which, however, was still very hazy. Black moved to c8 with his king�s rook, firstly, to keep his a7- pawn defended, and secondly, to show White that he was not even thinking about the kingside. 15 .l:tb1 A highly revealing manoeuvre. White takes the opponent at his word, World Champion 193 and also concentrates on queenside play. He intends .i.e3, but with this aim the immediate 15 'ii' e2 was also possible, which at the same time would have prevented . . . .!bh5 followed by . . . f7-f5. The position of the rook at b1 will later give Black a very important tempo. 15 ... .!bh5 Now the opponent can also be dis turbed on the other wing. lt transpires that, for the advance of the f-pawn, the support of the rook is not after all so necessary. 16 ..te3 'it'b4 Naturally, 16 ... 'ii' d8 would not have been in the spirit of the position, since in this case the switching of the king's rook to c8 would have lost its point. White could have played 17 lbb5, forcing a favourable exchange. For the moment Black adheres to the plan al ready mentioned - obvious play on the queenside and latent play on the kingside. 17 'ii' e2 . The threat of . . .f7-f5 has become unpleasant, because the white f-pawn is tied to the defence of the g3-pawn, and in addition, after the opening of the diagonal for his bishop, Black's pieces on the queenside would be very appropriately placed. It becomes evi dent that 15 l:tb1 was inaccurate - White has lost an important tempo. 17 ••• .l:.c4 (D) The line 17 .. . f5 18 exf5 .i.xf5 19 l:tbc1, conceding the e4-square, would have been positionally unjustified. Black decides to advance ... f7-f5 when it is more effective, and now the knight sacrifice at f4 becomes more and more of a reality. It was with the aim of preparing the sacrifice that Black chose his following move, which seems completely natural - the doubling of rooks on the c-file fol lowed by play on the queenside. 18 .l:.fcl Completely trusting the opponent. White wants to begin 'smoking out' the black pieces by ..tn and then to find a convenient moment to carry out mass exchanges. An ending will be very favourable for him, in view of the fact that Black's knight at h5 and bishop at g7 are stuck on the kingside and cannot easily be switched to the defence. 18 ... l:tac8 Sixteen minutes were spent consid ering this obvious move - Black was weighing up whether or not the idea, carried out a little later, would work now. No, it does not work. The vari ation has to be strengthened.
194 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
19 <ifi>h2 (D) A move which would have been very useful (he moves his king off the back rank, defending in case of neces sity the g3-pawn) , were it not for the real danger suddenly impending over White's position. Botvinnik evidently assumed that there were absolutely no threats and decided to make a useful prophylactic move, intending to fol low up with either .i.f3 or .i.fl. It is true that even after the immediate 19 J.f3 (.i.f l) there would have followed 19 ... f5. After this waiting move Black reckons that everything is ready for the combination, and he makes the in troductory 'anti-positional' move. 19 f5! 20 exf5 J.xf5 21 lla1 (D) In the event of 21 a3 'ii' b3 22 ltJe4 llc2 23 llxc2 llxc2 24 'i!Vd1 Black could have tried the interesting piece sacrifice 24 .. . ltJf4 ! ? with unfathom able complications. Botvinnik most probably assumed that, in view of the threat of 22 g4, the black pieces were now forced to retreat and that White would be able to occupy the e4-square in comfort, but here the prepared sur prise awaited him. 21 ••• ltJf4 The controversy provoked by this move was, in my opinion, rather point less. It is good, in that all other con tinuations are bad, and if the knight sacrifice is incorrect, then a question mark should be attached not to Black's 21st move, but, say, to his 17th. All the same, after the knight sacrifice Black's pieces (this applies especially to the recently 'unemployed' bishop at g7) become very active over the entire board and White is obliged to switch to the concrete analysis of numerous sharp variations. The acceptance of the sacrifice is forced. 22 gxf4 exf4 23 .i.d2 '23 a3 would have won the game'. This was the essence of an article by Goldberg with an analysis of this posi tion, published in a bulletin after the World Champion 195 match. Botvinnik's second goes on to give numerous interesting variations confirming this viewpoint. The critical position arises after 23 . . . 'ir'b3 24 i..xa7 (the immediate 23 J..xa7 is re futed by 23 ... 'iWa5, when Black regains the piece, retaining all the advantages of his position) . It is hardly worth try ing to convince the reader that Black had evaluated in detail all the vari ations and had decided that the knight sacrifice at f4 would win. Rather, 2 1 ...ltlf4 was a purely positional sacri fice. Let us in fact look at the position that arises in the variation recom mended by Goldberg after 24 i..xa7
(D).
For the moment White's extra piece does not play a part, especially as Black can shut it out of the game by . . .b7-b6, whereas both black bishops are extremely active, and can operate both on the queenside and on the king side. White's queenside is also rather rigid, and his king's protection is weakened. Thus Black's positional compensation is evident, and the ques tion to be answered by a detailed analysis is whether he can transform it into something more tangible. I was intending to continue 24 ... i..e5, threat ening 25 .. .f3+. White has three ways of defending: he can retreat his king to g1, or he can prevent the opening of the diagonal by 25 f3 or 25 J..f3. Let us consider these continuations in turn. 1) 25 <ifi>g1 b6. Black is threatening to regain the bishop by 26 ... .l:.4c7, and 26 'ii' d 1 'it' xb2 27 .l:.a2 .l:.xc3 ! does not help. It follows that White cannot re lease his bishop, and if so, then the position is materially equal but in practice favourable for Black. Things are much more difficult for Black if White does not retreat his king to the back rank. 2) 25 f3 . On the one hand, with this move White intends to return the 'runaway' from a7, but on the other hand he completely blocks in the other bishop at g2.

3) The most interesting play re sults from 25 �f3. The analysis of this continuation was the reason given by Goldberg for claiming Black's combi nation to be completely incorrect. The fact that the position is by no means as simple as Goldberg writes, is convinc ingly demonstrated by Konstanti nopolsky in his analysis on the pages of the Moscow Chess Bulletin. During the game I was also intending to sacri fice my queen in this variation, but I avoided calculating further, reckoning that Black gains real compensation. Konslantinopolsky found a very inter esting tactical confirmation of this. After the moves 25 �f3 b6 26 'ii' d l 1Wxb2 2 7 l:ta2 .l:.xc3 (It i s noteworthy that Black's continuations are invari ably the same. This, in my opinion, provides indirect evidence of the cor rectness of the combination. Black has a very easy game, whereas White has to seek defensive resources) 28 .l:.xb2 .l:.xc1 it transpires that 29 1i'd2 leads to a difficult position after the unex pected reply 29 ... .te4!, when the pair of bishops, which until very recently were 'occupied' with the queenside, suddenly switch to a direct attack on the king. For example: 30 'i!i>g2 .txf3+ 31 'i!i>xf3 .l:.8c3+ 32 'i!i>e4 .l:.c4+ 33 'i!i>f3 .l:. lc3+ 34 <ite2 f3+ 35 'i!i>d l �f4. White must therefore play 29 1i'e2, but here too after 29... .l:.8c3 (also indi cated by Konstantinopolsky) for the moment the material deficit is not felt. It is possible that ways of improving White's defence will subsequently be found, but the present commentary by no means claims to be a detailed analysis of all the variations that could have occurred. Its role is to reveal the course of the struggle through the eyes of one of the participants, and from this point of view I am convinced that the double-edged knight sacrifice at f4 was the correct decision. Now we return to the position after 23 �d2 (D). 23 1Wxb2 It is interesting that on the move af ter the knight sacrifice Black thought for 1 5 minutes. Was this the result of an oversight? Or a desire to check the variations? Neither one, nor the other. It was merely a confirmation, so to speak, of the intuitive nature of the sacrifice, a confirmation that Black had not calculated variations begin ning with the sacrifice and ending in mate. Also no less indicative was the fact that later analysis showed this move to be incorrect. While I was thinking, I had already written down World Champion 197 on my scoresheet 23 ... �e5, a move which, as it transpires, was the strong est. After it White cannot play 24 'it>g1 'Rxb2, when 25 tLld1 l:bc1 is not pos sible, while after 25 .l:tab1 �xb1 26 .l:r.xb1 'ii' c2 27 .l:r.c 1 (or 27 ..te4 .l:txe4) ... 'ii' f5 28 'ilf3 'ii' h5 29 lLle2 .l:r.c2 the weakness of the queenside is again in evidence. 24 �f3 is also unsuccessful. How ever, after 24... 'ii' xb2 25 tLld1 Black is not obliged to sacrifice his queen, as Konstantinopolsky gives in his analy sis, but can advantageously continue 25 ... 'ii' a3 ! After 26 .l:txc4 .l:r.xc4 27 'ilxc4 'ilxf3 Black's attack is irresist ible - apart from anything else the rook at a1 is attacked, and if White does not play 27 'ilfxc4 he has to reckon, among other things, with the positional threat of 27 ... .l:r.c2. I rejected 23 ... �e5 in view of the variation 24 f3 1i'xb2 25 tLld l ! 'Rd4 26 .l:r.xc4 .l:r.xc4 27 .l:r.c1 .l:r.xc1 28 �xc1 'ilfxd5 29 �fl. when Black's three pawns do not outweigh White's extra piece. It would seem that in this case the chances of the two sides are roughly equal. But how could Black gain an ad vantage, if White played the initial part of the game slightly passively, but very solidly? Probably the creation of a position, in which White has to make do with a draw, is in itself a consider able achievement for Black. When I played the text-move, I reckoned that the game should end in a draw by repetition. Perhaps all those observing the game were of the same opinion, and it was only a few days later that grandmaster Salo Flohr found a beau tiful winning possibility for White. 24 .l:r.abl 24 lNd1 would have lost to 24 ...

White obtains significantly the more pleasant ending. Thus the storm initi ated by Black could have rebounded on him, but all this occurred because of his mistake on the 23rd move. As I have already pointed out, Botvinnik considered the capture on f3 to be fa vourable to Black, and he preferred the immediate exchange of queens. Psychologically this is quite under standable: when you are a piece up and are under attack, it is always pleasant to get rid of the opponent's queen, but in his calculations White underestimated the strength of Black's 26th move. 25 .l:.xb2? fxe2 26 .l:.b3 .l:.d4 The unwieldy black rook has sud denly acquired colossal strength in the centre of the board.

In this, it is true, a part was played by reasons not at all connected with chess: the noise in the auditorium prompted the match arbi ters to carry out their threat and trans fer the play to a closed room. This, of course, proved to be a very severe warning to the spectators, since during the subsequent games they did not give cause for such a measure, but the feeling, when the clocks are stopped and you are politely asked to leave the stage, moreover at the very height of the game, can also hardly be called pleas ant. At any rate, I am somehow not yet used to playing in such 'nomadic' conditions. Such an unaccustomed World Champion transference could have led to an even worse blunder, and therefore I deliber ately chose a less strong, but safer con tinuation, where there was no longer any need to calculate lengthy vari ations. 29 ltlxe2 After 29 .l:tal, whatever the circum stances, Black could have finally de cided on 29..

Black's next move is an attempt to ex ploit this circumstance, but instead it is a virtually decisive positional mis take after which he is forced into a dif ficult position.

Despite material equality, Black's decision to resign is well-timed.

What is this, immodesty? Even the most subjective of chess players has never given an exclamation mark to this move, which has been known for a long time. But should this move de serve approval (for reasons not apper taining to chess), then the immodesty of the annotator is not so great. He re ally only deserves half an exclamation mark, the other half being due to A. Koblents, since it was during the proc ess of preparing for this game that the idea of playing the French Defence occurred to us, although I have adopted this opening very, very rarely, and with out great success . Even so, the choice of such a variation must have been an unpleasant surprise for Fischer, since positions of this type have occurred in his games very rarely, and a study of his games showed that the American Champion feels much less confident in unfamiliar positions. To be honest I should admit that, after deciding prior to the game to play the French De fence, at the board it took me about 1 0 minutes to decide o n the advance of my e-pawn.

A variation which has only very re cently risen from the grave. Back in 1 954 the 9th game of the Smyslov Botvinnik match, and the Unzicker Botvinnik encounter at the Amsterdam Olympiad, created the firm opinion that the system with 5 ... i.a5 was unfa vourable for Black. Five years passed, and in one of the 1 960 chess bulletins a note by international master Kon stantinopolsky appeared, in which new plans found for Black in this variation were described. I remember how, be fore the match with Botvinnik, Kob lents and I spent some considerable time playing through these variations, though at the time we were unable to test them, since in the 1 960 match Botvinnik did not adopt this system. A short time later chess magazines all over the world, including our (Latvian) magazine, published the in teresting game Matanovic-Mititelu, played in the Budapest Zonal Tour nament, in which Mititelu won as Black. In my game with Fischer the fol- lowing moves were made very quickly.

Recently they have begun to hold such tourna ments in Holland (Beverwijk), and also in Sweden. It was to the New Year tournament in Stockholm that Soviet grandmas ters Kotov and I were invited. It should be added that the 1 960- 1 96 1 Tournament was timed to coincide with an important jubilee of the Swed ish Chess Organisation. Early in 1 9 1 1 the Stockholm Chess Club was formed, and for half a century now it has been the centre for Swedish chess players. Therefore, the Jubilee Tournament was, if one can so express it, espe cially festive. We arrived in the Swedish capital on 28th December at 1 0 o'clock local time. It turned out that we had been expected since the previous evening, but even so we had flown in just at the right time - we still had at our disposal a whole half hour before the start of a televised game. Of course, the time set aside for us to rest flew past unno ticed, and when we assembled in the television studio, we felt somewhat exhausted. My opponent was the well known Swedish Grandmaster Stablberg. The time control was not altogether nor mal - 50 minutes for the whole game, so that the viewers should be able to follow the game in its entirety. Think ing, however, that to follow the game for two hours at a stretch would also not be easy, the Swedish television authorities decided to extend the pleasure over three days. This was perhaps more interesting for the spec tators, and also less tiring for the par ticipants, since every 35-40 minutes there was an interval. Grandmaster Kotov took the role of commentator. Now I can perhaps disclose a small se cret. The game was shown from 6th to 8th January, and the participants had to give their word that until the end of the transmission no word of the game was to appear in the press. Therefore I only had the chance to 'boast' about my win following the conclusion of the tournament.

12 c5! As far as I am aware, prior to this game the move c5 had not been met in this opening. White begins an im mediate fight in the centre. Black's natural reaction does not appear com pletely convincing. 12 • • • 'ii' c7 1 2. ..dxc5 as in the game Averbakh Furman (28th USSR Championship), 2 1 0 Th e Life and Games of Mikhail Tal did not justify itself. Strongest, prob ably, is 1 2 ...i.b7. 13 cxd6 i.xd6 14 i.gS! This is the whole point. The threat of 1 5 dxe5 is most unpleasant, since after it Black must either part with one of the bishops or else allow a serious weakening of his kingside. All he can do is decide which of these two evils is the lesser. 14 ...exd4 15 i.xf6 is now unsatisfactory. 14 ... i.b7 is probably best, reconciling himself to a passive position. The move played by Black is directed against the threat of dxe5 but he goes from one misfortune to an other, no lesser one. 14 • • . cS Now in the case of 15 dxe5 ii.xe5 Black has some counterplay on the queenside which to a certain degree equalises the chances. On the other hand, the weakening of the d5-square must soon tell. 15 dxcS 16 �c3 17 l:tcl i.xcS i.b7 Tempting here was 1 7 �d5 .

The move in the game is closely associated with the following manoeuvre by the king's rook, after which the pressure down the central files becomes threatening. 17 • • . 1i'b6 18 l:te2! On the second rank this rook is ex ceptionally well placed: it defends the one vulnerable point in White's posi tion, f2, and is ready at the first avail able moment to occupy one of the open files. After lengthy reflection the German Grandmaster played ... 18 ... l:tfe8 (D) ... so as to defend the e-pawn, since 1 9 i.xf6 was threatened. But now the fact that f7 is undefended tells unex pectedly. 19 �dS! i.xdS After 1 9. . .�xd5 20 .Bxd5 there is the threat of 2 1 i.xf7+. 20 .ixdS l:tad8 21 l:tec2!

2 lDc3 d6 3 g3 f5 4 d4! It is this order of moves that repre sents the strongest rejoinder against the system adopted by Black.

Nothing has come of his idea of commencing an attack at the very start of the game. Rather, Black must see to it that his oppo nent's threats do not become too real . White's basic strategic threat is to play d5 followed by .!Dd4. Since it is im possible to prevent this, I decided to try to divert my opponent, by giving him the chance of an attack on my king.

In fact, Black stands better now than he has done in the whole game. 16 �g5 (D) Now White goes in for complica tions which turn out unfavourably for him.

5 m O-O 6 i.e2 e5 7 dxe5 A rather unpleasant surprise. The exchange of queens is a cold shower on Black's aggressive intentions. Apart from this, two psychological factors probably influenced the choice of such a continuation. Firstly, practical experience in my match against Bot vinnik showed that it was possible to reckon on success even with this mod est plan, and secondly, a longish ab sence from tournament play made I vkov cautious. Objectively speaking, a premature exchange in the centre can create no problems for Black. 7 8 'ii' xd8 9 .!DdS dxe5 lhd8 I believe 9 .!Dd5 has never before been played in this position. Normal is 9 i.g5 .:.es 10 O-O-O with apparently equal play.

8 'ii' xd8 :xd8 9 .!Dd5.!Dxd5 1 0 cxd5 c6. The difference in the present game is that White's e-pawn is not defended by his f-pawn. If Black wants a sharp game, and that was the case in this game, he will never be satisfied with the variation 9 .. . .!Dxd5 1 0 cxd5 c6 1 1 i.g5 since the most Black can then achieve is a draw, and only after ex tremely precise play. 9 . . ..!Da6 1 0 i.g5 .:.d6 1 1 .!Dxf6+ i.xf6 1 2 i.xf6 .:.xf6 1 3 .!Dxe5 .:.e6 1 4 f4 f6 1 5 .!Dg4 is no good either.

A leisurely 1 1 . ..l:.d8 came into the reckoning, with the aim of bringing a knight to d4. Black wishes to ensure the superiority of his two bishops, which, because of the rather closed character of the position, is little more than a theoretical possibility. 12 .i.b5 l:.d8 13 i.xc6 bxc6

True, the combination it self is not all that simple, and White decided on it only after 40 minutes' consideration.

However, the idea of exploiting the undefended World Champion 219 position of Black's bishop on c6 prompted me to continue my searches, and in the end the following possibil ity was found: 2 1 exd6+ .i.f6 22 1i'h4 <3;g7 (22 . . ..i.xd4+ 23 1i'xd4+ c;ilg8 24 .i.e4 l:te8 25 l:td 1 , and White has more than enough play for the exchange) and now 23 .i.d7 ! !

Unfortunately, the move 20 .. .'.tig8, which was played a tempo, left all these variations behind the scenes.

Of course, after 2 1 . . . f6 it would not be difficult to find one of the winning continuations: 22 .i.xg6 or 22 1i'h6, or perhaps even 22 l:te3 or the simple 22 .i.d3. After the text White once again thought for a long time. Nothing con crete is promised by 22 e7 .i.xe7 23 'ii' h6 f6 24 .i.xg6 .i.d8, or 24 l:te3 l:tt7 25 .i.e6 .i.f8, or 24 .i.e6+ <3;h8 25 l:te3 l:tae8 ! 26 l:th3 .i.d8, or, finally, 24 .i.e6+ <3;h8 25 .i.d5 .i.b7 .

Matanovic made this move almost without thinking, which I found a lit tle surprising. For about half an hour before it, White had been considering the variations which would follow 1 2. . .1t'f6 and had reached no final World Clulmpion 221 conclusion. 1 3 �g3, prolonging the attack, would be worth considering, or the sharp 1 3 gxh5 ii'xf3 14 l:.g 1 ii'xe3 1 5 'fic2 'fif3 1 6 O-O-O with a reckless clash. After the text-move, the variation 1 3 �xf4 exf4 14 .txf4 ii'f6 1 5 'fid2 .txg4 1 6 .tg2 was quite acceptable, with White stunting Black's counter play. 13 ii'd2 g5 Stronger is 1 3. . .ii'f6 because now White's problem is of a purely techni cal nature. 14 �g3 15 h4 ii'f6 liJa6 (D) Black is intending to construct an impenetrable wall after he has devel oped all his pieces and removed his king to e7, believing that the queen side is hermetically sealed. Neverthe less, the h-file is quite capable of serving as a springboard and White has constructed his plan on this very fact. 16 l:.a2 'iit f8 17 hxg5 hxg5 18 "ii' cl The queen stands best on this di agonal, as in many variations Black's g-pawn is vulnerable.

The plan is workable in principle, but the pity is that at a suitable moment Black plays . . . a6 and . . .b5 . If White wanted to frustrate this with a4 his bishop would be even more tightly hemmed in and it would be even more difficult for it to return.

5 Unwell Again
Immediately after the Individual Championship, the Team Championship Final began in Moscow. Before this I spent a further day in bed in Baku - once again I was suffering from kidney colic - and then, in Moscow, almost straight from the plane, I sat down to play against Smyslov. It is true that the reserve for our team did every thing he could to persuade me to rest, promising to play successfully, but I never theless decided not to dishearten my team at the very start of the final, and I played against Smyslov until I felt that I was unable to continue. As a result I drew four games, including, it is true, two fighting ones, against Korchnoi and Petrosian, and lost one. I lost because my opponent Stein, readily and with astonishment, made exactly the winning moves that I had recommended in my notes to some game, and about which I had completely forgotten during play. Even so, it hardly occurred to me that the third act of this kidney tragi-comedy might occur at, of all possible times, the Candidates Tournament in Cura�ao. After the tournament in Moscow, I was not feeling too well, and it was decided to send me to Marianske Lazne, the world-famous resort. Just before my depar ture a deterioration set in, and within 24 hours I had been taken to hospital, put on the table, and operated upon. The operation was performed by an excellent sur geon, a veritable grandmaster of world medicine, Professor Frumkin. This was, unfortunately, to be one of the last operations of his life. When we were talking before the operation I asked him to bear in mind the fact that within two months I had to travel to Cura�ao, and that it would be good if he could repeat the 'mir acle' of 1 959, when after the removal of my appendix I won the Candidates Tour nament. The professor listened to my request, and operated most carefully, but, alas, history did not repeat itself. On coming out of hospital, I began my preparations, and I played two training games against Gipslis with a shortened time limit - 40 moves in 1 112 hours. I played quite well, and decided that everything was alright. Subsequently, in Cura�;ao, it became clear that I was only capable of playing for those same first three hours in a competitive game. I only found out about this later, and in the plane, crossing the Atlantic for the first time, I was firmly resolved to obtain once again an audition with Botvinnik. JOURNAliST.

Although photographs taken before the flight show that prior to the tournament I looked somewhat emaciated. The first round in no way warned me, although I adjourned my game against Petrosian in a lost position. The usual fust round result, I decided. Then the sec ond game, against Keres, made me suspicious. At first everything went well; I sacrificed my queen and obtained an advantage sufficient to win, but then came the fifth hour of play, that same hour that had always brought me so many divi dends in the past. Here, however, I began playing quite terribly. Then in the third round against Benko, in a time-scramble, in which I had so many times swindled the American Grandmaster, I myself was swindled. Nought out of three ! It was clear: never in my life had I been in such poor form. For four hours, even four hours and a quarter, everything was normal, but then a reaction took place, I lost my orientation, and gave away points with exceptional generosity. I gained my fust half point in the fourth round against Fischer, which, I must admit, fairly surprised me. Even then the Achilles' Heel of the future World Champion - a dislike of sharp, irrational positions - was known. By embroiling him in this sort of play, I adjourned the game with an advantage, but Black's sealed move came like a thunderclap. Tal - Fischer Candidates Tournament, Curarao 1962

l:.xdS! ! 42 exdS i.h6, and Black, by placing his bishop on f4, supporting it with his g-pawn, and giving up his e-pawn by ... e4 ! , obtained an impregnable position. Things continued in the same way. I finished the fust cycle with 2 points out of 7, alone in last place. However, my natural optimism urged me on, and, with 2 1
232 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
games still to go - a whole tournament ! - somewhere in my mind I 'changed my schedule' . Seeing that the competitors at Cura�ao were playing more reservedly than in Yugoslavia three years previously, and that the number of points required for first place - I didn't even consider any other ! - would be less, I decided to steal up on them. Then the second round began with me playing what was probably the worst game of my life. As White against Petrosian in a French Defence, somewhere around move 8 I thought for more than an hour, trying to choose between one of two normal continuations, both of which would give White an opening advan tage. First I wrote down one move, then the other (incidentally, two rounds later, I adopted the second against Benko, and won, while Spassky played the first against Petrosian a year later, and also won), and, being unable to decide which was the stronger, I suddenly made a third, ridiculous move. By move 1 3 White al ready stood worse, and then in addition I immediately blundered away a bishop. In this cycle I suffered a further three successive defeats, when I declined a draw offered by Fischer, and ruined excellent attacking positions against Filip and Geller, losing to each of them for the first time. Even my first ever win against Korchnoi did not especially cheer me. With one half of the tournament gone, I had moved up one place - to last but one ! - with 4112 points. However, the lead ers had 'only' 9 ! I spent the two-week break still hoping to rest and regain my form, and with the belief that I would win almost every game in the 3rd and 4th cycles. I began with the firm desire to effect an immediate change. Indeed, against Petrosian, I succeeded in seizing the initiative as Black, and, frightening my op ponent with a combinative threat, won a pawn. I was later told of the dialogue which took place at this point between the So viet trainer Boleslavsky and Petrosian's anxious wife. Replying to Rona Yak ovlevna, the imperturbable Boleslavsky remarked that Petrosian stood badly at the moment, but that what Tal would do in the fifth hour of play was anybody's guess. I didn' t 'do' a great deal - I lost the greater part of my advantage, and in the adjourned position Petrosian had every chance of a draw. Even so, this game seemed a good omen to me, but the next one - with Keres - was the last one that I played with any hope of success in the tournament. By success, I repeat, I mean only fust place. I thought up a very interesting combination, and after making a preparatory move, I even went up to Petrosian and joked: 'I'm going for the brilliancy prize' . The point was that, in my preliminary calculations, I was planning to sacrifice my queen for only two minor pieces, but after writing down 't!Vh5, which would have led to the sacrifice, I instead changed my mind and played 'i!Vf3, forgetting about Unwell Again 233 Black's obvious reply. Within two moves, not a trace of my attack remained, but I was a pawn down, and soon had to resign. It was only then that it became clear to me that it was time to give up the tour nament as lost. After this I played much more calmly, even imperturbably, and scored four draws - an achievement! - plus a loss to Geller. In this game I had the advantage, but all the time I was disturbed by the question: was it right for me, when in my heart I had given up the fight for first place, to play for a win which would upset the positions of the leaders: Petrosian, Keres and Geller. At the same time it was awkward to offer a draw: after all, Geller could hope for me to blunder in the fifth hour. So, tormented by doubts, I forgot about my clock until I noticed that I had only a few minutes remaining, whereupon I began playing at blitz speed. When the time-scramble was over, it turned out that on the way I could have won White's queen in one move, but in the adjourned position it was Geller who had the advantage. I was intending to play the fourth cycle without any ambition at all, and per haps it was because of this that I had a recurring attack of my illness. Then an other, and another. In short, I went into a local hospital, and there, by the united efforts of the doctors, the other players, the controllers and the leader of our dele gation, I was persuaded to stop playing. Although I had never withdrawn from an event through illness since the time of the 4th category tournament and scarlet fe ver, I did this with a relatively quiet mind: all seven of my opponents would be equally affected by my withdrawal. After the return home, and a break of several months, came the Olympiad in Varna. I was included in the USSR team only, of course, after lengthy debates, and the medical inspection was 'not inferior' in severity to that which cosmonauts have to undergo. I managed to overcome this obstacle, and was given the place of second reserve. In my first games I played like a man making his first steps after a long illness, but as early as the third game (with Mohrlok) I succeeded with an attractive at tack, in which, unfortunately, the main variation remained behind the scenes. In this event I played quite well. True, I did not perform as a recent World Champion should (on the fourth board the opponents were not as strong or expe rienced as those on board one), but well enough to take first place on my board. The following game was unofficially judged to be the most brilliant played in the Olympiad (see diagram on following page). 13 c5! dxc5 14 dxe5 'ilfxe5 15 'ii' a4+ c6 16 O-O lDg6 17 lDc4 'ii' e6 18 e5 b5 19 exf6! bxa4 20 fxg7 l!g8 21 i.f5 lDxh4 22 i.xe6 i.a6 23 lDd6+ <l;e7 24 i.c4 l!xg7 25 g3 <l;xd6 26 i.xa6 lDf5 27 l!ab1 f6 28 llfd1+ <Ji;e7 29 l:e1+ 'it>d6 30

Nevertheless, for me the most memorable event of the Olympiad was the re sumption of the Botvinnik-Fischer game. The question of which team would take first place was already decided, but for this game chess fans gathered from liter ally all over Bulgaria. Everyone remembered the recent interview given by Fis cher, in which he had said that he could beat Botvinnik in a match, and the game therefore held exceptional prestige interest. My game, against D. Byrne, was also adjourned, in an ending slightly favour able for me, but no-one, myself included, looked at it seriously. Three of us, Bole slavsky, Spassky and I, set up Botvinnik's position in our room, and got down to analysing it. We were not the only ones. When, on the advice of our trainer Bole slavsky, I went off to the family room of Donald and Robert Byrne to offer a draw, I saw on their table the adjourned position of the Botvinnik-Fischer game. The analysis went on for almost the whole of the night. The three of us worked together, as did Botvinnik, Geller, Keres and Furman on the floor above. From time to time the younger players, Spassky and I, would take turns to go upstairs and exchange conclusions. Towards five o' clock in the morning, Geller's fantastic idea - to battle with two isolated pawns against two united pawns in a rook ending - had been fully worked out, and we decided that there were considerable drawing chances. And when, for the last time, we set off downstairs to sleep Mikhail Moiseyevich said to us: 'Please, if anyone asks, tell them my position is hopeless ! ' . We overslept, Unwell Again 235 and missed breakfast by a long time, but when we arrived in the restaurant we found the Americans there. They looked sleepy, but contented: they were in no doubt that Fischer's position was won. When we all arrived at the overcrowded tournament hall, we found the follow ing picture: Botvinnik walking calmly up and down the stage, Fischer sitting with his head in his hands, and a theoretically drawn position already on the board. The Varna Olympiad helped considembly in re-establishing my self-confidence. Otherwise it is difficult to explain my result in the USSR Team Championship, which began immediately afterwards in Leningrad. As always, the opposition on board one was pretty strong, and as usual my games were aggressive, but even so, in the first 7 rounds I scored 7( ! !) draws. Then, in the last round, an amusing situ ation arose. The point was that on the top board, along with Spassky, Keres, Gel ler, Smyslov and Boleslavsky, there was a candidate master from Moldavia, Shofman. He had seven noughts, I had seven draws, and we had to play each other in the last round. Everyone tried to guess whose tradition would be broken: mine, his, or both together if he should win. I managed to 'change my principle' , and Shofman's series continued. Despite my suddenly acquired reputation as a 'drawing king' , I travelled to the Individual Championship of the USSR in Erevan in a good frame of mind, since I felt that with each succeeding month I was approaching my previous form. In Erevan I started well, and one of my games, the one with Bannik, is given here. I was flattered by the assessment given to this game by Petrosian: 'Even if I don't say who made the combination, it is clear all the same: from far off it smells of Tal ! ' I was going well: 4 out of 5, 5 out of 6. Then, in quick succession, came defeats at the hands of the experienced masters Mikenas and Aronin. Never theless, drawing few games, I was still a contender for first place. This continued until my game with Korchnoi, who was playing splendidly. The pairings had placed Spassky and myself next to each other in the tournament table, and now Korchnoi first defeated Boris with Black, and then me with White, when he boldly and confidently left himself only seconds for his last few moves, but on the other hand had everything weighed up ! This game evidently made such demands on Victor's stamina, that towards the end of the tournament he played much less strongly. I scored 4112 points from my last 5 games, but this was sufficient only to enable me to share 2nd-3rd places with Taimanov, half a point behind Korchnoi. There was some consolation for me (although I did not consider that I had performed badly) in the form of several special prizes, including one for the most interesting game played in the Champi onship.

An examination had shown that a repeat operation was necessary. It was carried out by a pupil of the late Professor Frumkin, who, according to his teacher, was knowledgeable. The operation took place in Moscow, and on this occasion a thorough job was made of it, since in the first half of the year I had nothing especially important planned in chess. The op eration was completed successfully, and after leaving hospital I remained in Mos cow, trying my hand for the first time in a new field, as chess correspondent for the paper Soviet Sport, during the match for the chess crown between Botvinnik and Petrosian. It was with pleasure that I 'avenged' myself upon my colleagues, discovering in analysis their mistakes. My first experience showed me that the work was difficult, interesting, and beneficial. It also had repercussions of a purely chess nature. Whereas earlier I had played 1 e4 and 1 d4 on the first move with roughly equal frequency, two months of observing the problems of isolated and hanging pawns left me so sated with their taste, that for a long time after this I simply avoided 1 d4. In the summer, the time came for me myself to play, and I realised that some times a lengthy chess starvation can be beneficial. I travelled with Bronstein to Miskolc, where my play was easy and unrestrained, which is apparent if only from the games against Ghitescu and Bilek given in this book. I practically assured myself of first place some 3-4 rounds before the finish. Then the USSR Peoples' Spartakiad was held once again. My result was more satisfactory than the one three years earlier, but our team only reached the second final group, not the main one, and so for part of the event I was playing against less experienced masters. Nevertheless, several of the games proved to be of in terest. Unwell Again 237 Mnatsakanian - Tal USSR Spartakiad, Moscow 1963 The positioning of the black pieces appears dubious, and if White had chosen, say, 39 a4, radically preventing the counterblow ...b5, he could hardly have lost.

In the diagram position, I had been hoping to lure Mnatsakanian into a quite different combination: 39 tt)d5+ exd5 40 cxd5. Now, in order to avoid the loss of a pawn, Black must play 4Q ...tt)b8, and after 4 1 d6+ 'it>xd6 42 tt)c6+ 'it>e6 ( 42 ...'it>xc6 leads to mate) 43 ltd6+ 'it>f7 44 tt)xb8 i..xfl 45 'i!i>xfl he cannot play 45 ...Itxb8 on account of 46 Itxd7+. However, the quiet 45 ...'i!i>e7 ! would sud- denly reveal that White's spectacular combination has led only to his defeat. In the second half of the year I took greater steps to make up for my previous lack of activity, and took part in a further three tournaments. The first was in Ha vana. Not without a certain trepidation, caused by memories of Cura�ao, I flew across the ocean, but on this occasion my kidneys behaved themselves perfectly. The tournament itself can be put down in my chess biography as one of those in which I was satisfied with the result, but in no way with my play. The participants were very varied in strength, and if one's game is 'over worked' this is always dangerous. When, in the first round, I failed to win a won pawn( ! !) ending against Pachman, and in the second round overcame Jimenez only with difficulty, and not really deservedly, much became clear to me. Never theless, taking into account the fact that, in order to win in such a mixed tourna ment of Grandmasters, masters, candidate masters and even first category players (measuring according to standards familiar to me), a high percentage of points would be required, I tried to take a hold on myself. As a result I drew few games,
238 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
but lost three. One of these was as White to Trifunovic. I was already well ac quainted with his tenacity, and before the game Geller and I selected one of the variations of the Queen's Gambit, but while the high-speed lift was taking us from the 28th floor of the hotel 'Havana Libre' , where we were staying, to the ground floor, I suddenly thought: 'Why play the Queen's Gambit when there is the King's?' I began to play sharply, which is always not without its dangers, the more so when one is playing 'creakily' . In short, by move 15 my position was al ready in ruins. Although I felt that it would be worth offering a draw, for Tri funovic might well accept - he had drawn all his games up till then! - I didn't have the courage to make this 'move' . Some ten moves later I resigned. Somewhere in the middle of the tournament came the important game between Korchnoi and myself. Up till then I had hardly lost to him as Black, and after a very sharp struggle this game also ended in a draw. And for a week, Korchnoi sud denly stopped speaking to me. At the end of the week I lost to the Cuban Calero (it was his only win) in a game where I twice had a completely won position, but twice blundered, on the second occasion losing my queen. After this there was still a draw to be had, but I blundered for the third and last time. The first person who came to console me was Korchnoi. When I enquired as to what had provoked his week-long hostility, he answered in his usual direct way: 'Well, you see, I reckoned up, and decided that I would have to win against you, otherwise you would take first place. No one thought that you would lose to Calero !' Indeed, finishing with 8112 points out of 9, which included a 90-move win against Geller, I nevertheless ended up half a point behind Korchnoi, as did Geller and Pachman. There was a great contrast between this, the Capablanca Memorial Tournament, and the International Tournament which started immediately after it in the Moscow Central Chess Club. Here my result was roughly equivalent, but I was much more satisfied with my play. I am inclined to think that the prize I re ceived for interesting play was more or less deserved. The reader can find two of the games, against Gligoric and Padevsky, in this book. An amusing episode accompanied the start of this tournament. The day before, on the birthday of one of my friends, by no means a chess player, someone sud denly expressed the desire that in my game with the Dutchman Kuijpers the fol lowing day I should sacrifice something. 'Which piece, and on which square would you like?' , I asked jokingly. 'Well, let's say a knight on e6.' The following day I had naturally forgotten this conversation, and my game with Kuijpers first proceeded quietly, and then became more complicated in the time-scramble. I made a move, and with time-trouble over, Kuijpers realised that mate was inevitable, and resigned. In the foyer my delighted friends gathered round. Unwell Again 'Good man ! Did you do it on purpose?' 'Do what?' 'Well, make that last move with your knight to e6?' I immediately remembered, and realised that my chess prestige in these circles had risen sharply, and so as to maintain this, I pompously asked: 'What would you like me to sacrifice tomorrow, and where?' For a moment my friends were taken aback, and since no recommendation was given, my draw in the second round was put down to their 'indifference' to me. I would also like to mention the difference in my play with White and Black in this tournament, rather unusual for me. As White I drew only one game, but as Black I lost one game and drew the remainder, including one against the Polish player Balcerowski who finished last. Two of the other encounters are also worth recalling: those with Smyslov and Liberzon. During the first stage of our chess 'relationship' , when playing against Vasily Vasilyevich, I was terribly afraid of transposing into an endgame. Here as Black I calmly went into an ending, and one that was somewhat inferior. Up to a certain point Smyslov played brilliantly, and achieved a great deal, and in des peration I gave up the exchange without gaining the slightest compensation. Then Smyslov decided to convert his advantage into a win without giving me the slight est counter-chance, and began playing somewhat listlessly, whereupon my king penetrated into the white position onto the square e3. At the time of the sealed move, I was even of the opinion that Black's chances were by no means worse. This was not shaken even by the radio report, which said that Smyslov was the ex change ahead, and had a winning position. JOURNALIST. Who was the commentator? CHESS PLAYER. Not you, not you, don't get alarmed. Evidently Smyslov did not believe the radio assessment of the position either, for the day before the resumption he offered a draw . My one nought in the table came in my game against Liberzon, when - and this happens to me - in an equal and quiet ending with opposite-coloured bishops I simply lost patience. We were playing in the small room of the Central Chess Club, from where it was easy to go up to the spectators, and Liberzon, after mak ing a move, immediately went over to his family who were in the hall, and began talking in very lively style with them about something. This suddenly infuriated me, and in quite ridiculous fashion I began playing for a win, which, as is well known, is almost always equivalent to playing for a loss. My third individual tournament in a row was the Championship of Moscow University in lightning chess, in which some of our guests, participants in the
240 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
Central Chess Club Tournament, took part. Of the 19 games I lost one, drew none, and came ahead of Kholmov (who took second place) by 2112 points.

I started it, and spent the whole of it, sitting at the chessboard. It was in a 'new country' for me, England, that I saw the New Year in, at the ancient International Tournament held in Hast ings. Here everything reminded one of chess and non-chess battles. William the Unwell Again 24 1 Conqueror, the victory of HarryNelson Pillsbury in the famous tournament of 1 895 . How much I was to read about all this ! The tournament went well for me, although in view of the short distance (at that time the Hastings Tournament always comprised five English players and five foreigners) I was rather afraid of a recurrence of my old illness - a loss in the first round. Just imagine trying to catch up after such a slip ! The contenders for first place were the old hand of the tournament: the Yugo slav Grandmaster Svetozar Gligoric, and its debutante myself. Neither of us was defeated, but I won one game more. Hastings took a leaf, as it were, out of Ha vana: there was nothing to boast about regarding my play. An exception should perhaps be made of my game with Gligoric, in which a place was found for an at tack, a counter-attack, a combination and a counter-combination. Apart from myself and the master Khasin, the Soviet Chess Federation also sent the young Lady World Champion, Nona Gaprindashvili, to Hastings to play in a secondary tournament. At that time she was still a first-year student of Eng lish. She was, of course, the centre of general attention, but we helped her to over come her embarrassment, and in addition A. Khasin, a professional teacher of English, would reply to the endless questions from journalists. I recall the ques tion which Nona was asked particularly often: 'What do you think of English men?' At first Nona used to answer with embarrassment, and not altogether tact fully: 'Not much, thank you ! ' Then one day she called me over, and asked me: 'Misha, it's awkward for me; say that I like them, but that I like Georgian men bet ter!' Directly from England, Nona and I set off for Iceland. Gligoric also arrived, the Icelandic Grandmaster Olafsson was included, together with a number of other players, and we all played in one tournament: 1 3 men and one girl. Here the Gligoric-Tal race began. The result was that I scored 1 21f2 out of 1 3, and Gligoric a point less. Three rounds before the finish, the interval was only half a point. Gligoric lost to me, winning his remaining games, while I had somewhere played a draw. On this day a telegram arrived from Moscow, saying that Nona had been awarded the title of Honoured Master of Sport of the USSR, and as a senior colleague I ar ranged a small banquet, to which a number of the competitors were invited. The following day I was due to play Nona. I didn't think that at that moment I had the right to play for a win, and so I said to the Lady Champion that I was not averse to agreeing a draw. To my surprise, Nona displayed her character, and said that, in view of the close battle for first place, I was obliged to play only for a win. Then I suggested to her that she should name an opening which she would like me to play, she agreed to this and, naturally without any additional preparation, I sat
242 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
down at the board. I now felt more confident, and even had the right to think of re venge. The point was that a New Year lightning tournament had been held in Hastings, and in the final of this Nona had scored 3 out of 3, and I only 2. I gained my revenge in Reykjavik, and in the course of play I was once more made aware of the Georgian lady's champion-like character. Already a pawn down, Nona got into time-trouble, but when, not wishing to win on time, I 'forgot' to press my clock on a couple of occasions, Nona said to me in a hissing whisper: 'If you do that again, I'll resign straight away ! ' Then, in the penultimate round, I won my most interesting game o f the tourna ment against Olafsson, Gligoric drew, and the question of first place was decided. Then, after a six-year interval, I once again took part in an Interzonal Tourna ment. Once again the battle was to finish in the first six, and to come ahead of at least two compatriots: of the five Soviet Grandmasters, the door to the Candidates cycle was to be opened to only three. In addition, there was the not-exactly-clever rule of the forced draw1 , and it was very important at which stage of the tournament a player would encounter the 'Russian row' . For Larsen, for instance, it occurred at the finish, when he had already assured himself of a place in the first six, and therefore he was able to play calmly. Gligoric was less fortunate: he played against the Soviet Grandmasters earlier and, after dropping several points, became nervous. For us too, it was not very pleasant to have to play one difficult game after another without a break. My game in the second round with Portisch gave me a number of difficult mo ments, and later even became tragi-comic. Having decided that the most impor tant thing was to play the opening originally, I fully succeeded in my intention but then had to sacrifice to maintain the fire. Portisch captured my pieces, and I, with nothing to lose, broke up his king's position by the advance of my rook's pawn. At some point Portisch could have allowed me to win his queen, gaining for it almost a complete set of the other pieces, but he did not want this, and in a severe time scramble we repeated the position. When the draw had been agreed, Portisch somewhat perplexedly asked me whether he could have played better. I just waved my hands. Later, when he had cooled down after the game, Portisch admitted that he had been expecting my capitulation at any moment, and the fact that I did not resign had put the normally calm Hungarian Grandmaster out of his stride. Players from one country were given pairing numbers so that they played each other as early as possible in the tournament. This meant that these players had consecutive numbers in the draw, and consequently the remaining players often had to play (say) five or six Soviet Grandmasters in succession. -Editor's Note. Unwell Again 243 - This game did me a good practical service. A year later we met in the Candi dates Matches, and it was our game from the Interzonal that showed me, firstly, that Portisch was somewhat afraid of me, and, secondly, that such play could con fuse my erudite, experienced and formidable opponent. To return to the Interzonal, after five draws at the start against the Soviet Grandmasters and Portisch, I managed to win several games, and finished the tournament in 1 st-4th places. I thus became one of the Candidates, but was not es pecially pleased with the 'Battle of Amsterdam' . JOURNALIST. Is your play affected when you have to set yourself a goal in an event? CHESS PLAYER. More likely it is affected by a different sort of stimulus. Per haps if I had lost one of the games where I had a very dubious position, to Por tisch, Foguelman or Gligoric, everything would have turned out differently. As it was, my results in the tournament table had a rather grey appearance. With those who finished in the upper half, I drew, while the 'tail' was 'cut off' . One of the more or less interesting games, with Evans, is given here. Besides this, I was given great pleasure by the first game in my life with the veteran S . Reshevsky. Prior to this, I had read that the American Grandmaster did not devote a great deal of attention to the opening, and that in his youth he had been very formidable in time-scrambles. Now, on the strength of my own experi ence, I became convinced of the 100% accuracy of this characterisation. This was one of the few games where I succeeded in catching my opponent in a prepared variation, which, strange as it may seem, is contrary to my normal way of playing. It is one thing, when you yourself are playing from the first few minutes, and something quite different when the game begins at about move 20, as it did against Reshevsky. Everyone reckoned that the end was in sight, for my posi tional advantage was considerable, and the difference in time simply colossal. On these 20 moves I had spent about 10 minutes, which was necessary for the purely technical operations of writing down the move, moving the piece, and pressing the clock, while Reshevsky had only 15 minutes left! Taking all this into account, I was physically unable to force myself to deal the finishing blow with the neces sary energy. I began playing from inertia, as it were, whereas time after time Reshevsky would discover exceptional defensive resources. Then I sacrificed a piece, whereupon the game became tactical, and I was greatly impressed by the way that Reshevsky, with l-2 minutes for lO moves, would hold his hand over the board and quite impulsively grasp the very piece that was required, and make with it the only saving move. Finally, in a more or less equal position, Reshev sky offered me a draw. I had also read that he would do this when he was in a bad :!44 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal position, and I searched very carefully for what Reshevsky might be afraid of. I found nothing, agreed to a draw, and then the American Grandmaster revealed that it wasn't the position on the board that he was afraid of, but the opponent - at any rate, during this game. Taking into account the specific nature of the tournament, the position before the 22nd and penultimate round remained tense: at least four of the five Soviet Grandmasters had real chances of success. Someone had to be the 'superfluous fourth' , and it was Leonid Stein who stumbled. For the second time running he did not reach the Candidates because of the discrimination, although he took a place which was sufficient for any non-Soviet player. In the last round, the Bul garian Grandmaster Tringov literally forced me, with his risky play, to carry out a combination with a sacrifice of two pieces, although at this moment there was no real need to take any risks.

Two weeks later I set off for Kislovodsk with the most unlucky player from the Interzonal Tournament, L. Stein, to play 'non-elimination' chess in the traditional Unwell Again 245 tournament of the USSR Central Chess Club. I expected that Stein would attempt to exact moral revenge and the battle was indeed pretty sharp, and ... amusing. In one of the early rounds I succeeded in playing what was perhaps the most in teresting game in the tournament, exacting revenge against Liberzon for my de feat the previous year.

showed that I am unable to take first place without any adventures. In the eighth round I lost to the oldest participant, the Hungarian master Kluger, and since there were only three rounds to go before the finish, they began congratulating Stein. However, in the next round he lost, while I managed to win all three games, in cluding the decisive one against Fuchs, which is given here. w The resumption prior to the last round also sticks in my mind. Khasin - Tal Kislovodsk, 1964 Despite the deserted board, it is not easy to find a defence for White. In the first instance, the intrusion of Black's king is threatened, while on 61 c;i;lg3 the follow ing amusing variation is possible: 61...�e6 ! 62 tlJd4+ �d5 63 tlJc2 .i.f4, an nouncing double check, and either mating or winning the h-pawn. White chose 61 tlJe1 :b3 62 t2Jf3 :c3 63 tlJd2, and lost: 63• . • .i.xd2 64 :Xd2 �g5 65 :r2 �h4 66 :xr7 :xh3! 0-1 But not 66 ...:g3+ 67 �f2 l:.xh3 68 l:.f6 ! After Kislovodsk, the Team Championship of the country was held in two stages. In the semi-final in Tallinn, old friends and rivals of the 'Daugava' and 'Kalyera' teams (at that time essentially the teams of Latvia and Estonia) battled for the second place in the Final - already the 'Spartak' team had safely assured it self of the first place. In this match of rivals, I defeated Keres, the 'Daugava' team won, and we went forward into the Final which was held in Moscow. This took place not long before the Olympiad in Tel-Aviv. Upset by the fact that on this occasion I had not been included in the Soviet team, I was angry with the 'whole world' , and was burning with a desire to 'gain revenge' . Perhaps it was for this reason that I played so energetically, and I even consider that the game against Smyslov given here is one of my best ever games. It is not very often that one sacrifices a queen for a rook, in order to reach a better ending ! I n the last round, I played for the first time against Botvinnik under semi-tour nament conditions, as it were: previously we had only met in matches ! Once Unwell Again 247 again the Caro-Kann Defence appeared, Black defended excellently, and after the draw had been agreed, Botvinnik and I shared first place on our board. The year ended for me in Kiev, where I participated in the USSR Champion ship. Here, unfortunately, I caught a cold, which made itself felt. In the first round it was by no means because of this that I lost to Bronstein, in a game from which I gained enormous pleasure. The manoeuvre of Black's king from e8 to f6 simply staggered me. After this failure at the start, followed by a few draws, I reached the 50% level by winning against Vasiukov. In this game, I spent 40 minutes on my 19th move 'dragging the hippopotamus out of the marsh' , which I have talked about earlier. In the next round I was once again down to '- 1 ' , then two rounds later up to '+ I ' , and after the 9th round I fell ill. The day before, I had adjourned my game against Korchnoi, and on subsequent resumption a drawn position was reached: rook and pawn against bishop and pawn. Since it was Korchnoi who had the rook, we carried on playing. On and on we played, and just when I could have saved the half point practically as I pleased, he nevertheless 'outplayed' me: I chose for my bishop almost the only losing square, and there arose a new theoretical position, but this time with a different assessment. Under the doctor's instructions, I played several of the games in my hotel room. The majority of my opponents readily agreed to this, realising that it was not I who was being capricious, but others proved less compliant, and insisted that play should take place only in the tournament hall. Need it be said that I dou bled my efforts in these games, and won them both. In winning against Shamk ovich, I seriously spoiled his tournament position: up till then he had been amongst the leaders. With Sakharov also, the game proved to be fairly 'ruthless' . The majority of the commentators assessed my overall result (3rd place) as quite good, taking into account my illness, but there were no special creative achievements. I will give only the concluding attack against Shamkovich. Tal - Shamkovich USSR Ch, Kiev 1964 w

The 'encircling' bishops lie in wait for the white b- and e pawns, but White succeeds in demon strating the impotence of this attack.

Black's idea is revealed in the variation 17 c3 'ii' f6 1 8 .i.d2 'it' g6 ! , and White cannot turn the extravagant placing of his opponent's pieces to his advantage. However, this idea contains a flaw.

The position of the tournament leaders was still un clear, but it was certain that to make life uncomfortable for Korchnoi, I had to win this game: a difficult task with the black pieces against a resourceful player like Novopashin. It was fortunate for me that my op ponent chose a very sharp line which suited my style and gave me the chance to gamble on winning more easily - or, of course, to make an error and lose !

Padevsky adopts the French De fence comparatively often, and with great success. It is sufficient to recall the game Fischer-Padevsky played in the Varna Olympiad, in which the American Grandmaster gained a draw only with the greatest difficulty. In the Moscow International Tournament the French Defence had brought Padev sky a victory over Kuijpers.

Particularly well known are his two encounters with Fischer (Candidates Tournament, Yugoslavia 1959). 10 g4 1 1 i.xf6 12 g5 13 a3 b5 ttlxf6 ttld7 Here White thought for about 40 minutes. The fact is that I very much wanted to play a move like 13 ttlf5 but only succeeded in convincing myself that there was a reason why this sacri fice had not been played before. w 13 i.b7 14 i.h3 O-O-O (D) As far as I know, the 'last word in fashion' in this variation is 14 . . .b4 15 axb4 'ti'c4 1 6 l::t. he 1 l::t. b8 as Cobo played against Matanovic (Havana 1 962).

After GligoriC's move a position from the first game of the 'Sicilian match' Gligoric-Fischer is reached, where White played 1 5 f5 i.xg5+ 1 6 �b1 e 5 1 7 ttldxb5 and won (though not without American assistance). I think that the continuation chosen by White is more promising. 15 i.xe6 fxe6 16 ttlxe6 ii'c4 Perhaps 1 6. . .'ti'b6 is more accurate; I would have answered in the same way as in the game. 17 ttld5 Of course, the knight on e6 is much stronger than Black's rook. However, this is not the whole story. Now (and two moves later) the modest b3 is threatened. 17 • • • 18 exd5 i.xd5 �b7 Black's misfortune lies in the fact that he cannot play 1 8. . .ttlc5 because of 19 b3 'ti'e4 20 'ti'c3 !

Grandmasters Gli goric, Ivkov and Matanovic have successfully adopted this system over a period of almost ten years. When Geller, during the Havana Interna tional Tournament, was preparing for his game with Ivkov, we began to ana lyse the move 14 b3 which, strange as it may seem, turned out to be a theo retical innovation.

After this natural move Black has no opening difficulties at all. Much more active is 8 f4 since in this posi tion castling can be delayed.

1 e4 eS
2 lDt'3 dS The sharp, impulsive play of my opponent has gained him widespread popularity in chess circles, but on this occasion (whether or not with the aim of maintaining his reputation) he chooses an over-sharp continuation. Perhaps the fact that Lutikov had been successful in our previous encounters played a certain role in the choice of this variation, together with the con siderable psychological effect of the novelty. Indeed, I had never previously encountered in tournament practice the position after Black's 2nd move. White's first task was at least to re member the name of this opening. At the board I did not succeed in solving this problem. The second was to recall any games previously played with this variation. With this second problem I coped rather more successfully. There flashed through my mind the encoun ter between Boleslavsky and Lilien thal (Match-Tournament for the title of Absolute Champion of the US SR, 1 94 1 ) and the notes by Botvinnik to this game, from which it was clear that the move played by Boleslavsky, 3 tlJxe5, is not the strongest (after it Black could have equalised) and that 3 exd5 should be played. A game by Konstantinopolsky from the World Correspondence Team Championship was published in one of the chess yearbooks in which the Soviet master played 3 exd5, and won. Thus equipped with a solid theoretical support, I decided to follow Botvin nik's recommendation. 3 exdS e4 4 1We2 fS This move also appeared once in one of the chess bulletins, and was played, if I remember correctly, by Kostyuchenko in a game with Kofman in one of the Ukraine tournaments. It was so long ago that I could not re member anything except the result of the game (Black won). The move 4 . ..f5 does not fit in with Black's basic aims I don't understand this, since Black wins in any case by 44 . .. l:b7 45 'it>e6 'it>f8 46 d7 l:b6+, etc.

It remains unclear at what point the vari ation prepared by my opponent could be improved. Here 7 . . .i.e7 already looks totally inadequate, since after 8 lLlxe4 O-O 9 lLlxf6+ i.xf6 1 0 c3 Black gains no advantage at all, while the two extra pawns, or at least one, re main. Nevertheless, I think that this was stronger than the continuation chosen by Lutikov. 8 9 1Vxb4 10 i.g5! c6 exf3 How quickly the situation has al tered ! One after another the white pieces take up ideal posts, while Black has parted with his dark-squared bishop and has considerable difficulty in sheltering his king. Besides, mate rial equality has not yet been fully re established. 10 •.• cxdS Against the sharp 1 0. . . a5 I was planning the logical 1 1 \!kc5 . 1 1 O-O-O lLlc6 12 \!ka3 1 2 i.b5 would be a waste of time, since after 1 2. .. <i1>f7 White's queen is attacked and there is no point in strengthening the d5-pawn by ex changing on c6. Besides the move in the game, 12 1i'c5 was also strong, but I did not wish to transform a game which had begun so favourably for me into the colourless, though comfort able, position which would result after the exchange of queens ( 1 2. . .1fe7). Now this move is ruled out because of the reply 1 3 lLlxd5 . 12 • • . i.e6 13 i.c4 The beginning of an interesting combination. Here also White had a rich choice: 1 3 gxf3, 1 3 l:.e 1 or 1 3 lLlb5. However, all these continuations seemed to me insufficiently energetic, although objectively each of them was in no way inferior to the one chosen by White. w 14 tilxd5 15 lLlc7+ 1fe7 'ii' xa3 <i1>e7 (D) Now it is clear that White has no time to capture the queen: his bishop Unwell Again 283 at c4 is en prise. It was possible to reach an ending with an extra pawn by playing 1 6 i.xe6 1i'd6! (the only move in view of the threat of 17 l:r.d7 +) 1 7 l:r.xd6 �xd6 1 8 i.f4+ lbe5 19 lDxa8 �xe6 20 lbc7+ �f5 2 1 i.xe5 �xe5 22 gxf3, but during the game I could not work out an accurate winning plan in this ending. What is more impor tant, the resulting position is out of keeping with what White had in mind when he gave up his queen. Since all the time White is short of just one piece to inflict the decisive blow, the following developing move suggests itself. 16 l:r.he1! ii'c5 Evidently the best. 1 6. . . 1\VaS loses to 17 l:r.xe6+ �f8 1 8 i.f4 l:r.d8 (the only move) 19 l:r.xd8+ lbxd8 20 i.d6+ �f7 2 1 l:r.e5+ �g6 22 l:r.xa5 fxg2 23 i.d3+ and the pawn is stopped. In the case of 1 6. . .'ilfd6, I was intending to continue 17 l:r.xd6 �xd6 1 8 lDxe6, and since 1 8 . . .lDe5 1 9 i.f4 will not do, it is difficult to imagine that the black king will complete his journey safely. The continuation chosen by Lutikov also leaves him the exchange ahead, but here too White has very serious threats. 17 l:r.xe6+ �f8 18 l:r.xf6+ gxf6 19 lbe6+ �e7 Weaker is 1 9. . .�e8 20 lbxc5 fxg5 2 1 lDxb7 and because of the threat of 22 i.b5 , Black does not succeed in uniting his rooks. 20 lbxc5 fxg5 (D) w 21 l:r.d7+ �f6 22 l:r.d6+ �e7 Against 22 .. .�f5 the simple 23 gxf3 is perhaps the strongest. After the text move White could have once more checked with the rook on d7, and then played 24 gxf3 or 24 g4, but by now I was longing for a quiet life. 23 l:r.e6+ �d8 24 lbxb7+ �c7 25 i.d5 lbb4 This loses immediately. White would have been faced with certain technical difficulties after 25 .. .fxg2 26 l:r.xc6+ �xb7 27 l:r.g6+ �c7 28 l:r.xg5 l:r.ae8, but even here I think that three pawns supported by a powerful bishop should win against a rook. 26 i.xf3 27 lbc5 l:r.ae8 lbxa2+ Even without this oversight Black's position is hopeless.

Thus White's tactics appeared to be simple enough - play for a win, avoid losing, and follow the events on the neighbouring board (where Aver bakh was playing Stein). It is well known that Master Fuchs (along with many other leading East German play ers) invariably answers 1 e4 with l ...e6, and has frequently upheld Black's cause in the most intricate variations. Not feeling inclined to conduct a theo retical discussion on 'French' affairs, I decided to go in for another topical variation (the so-called 'Meran'), which also occurs frequently in Fuchs's games, and whose complications I consider to be very attractive for White.

In 1 957 the Soviet student team, on its way back from Reykjavik, played a match against Denmark in Copenhagen . The experienced master Enevoldsen adopted this same sharp system against Averbakh. As far as I remember the game continued 9 i.d2 �xb2, and here Averbakh dampened his oppo nent's spirits by playing 10 'ii' b5+. The ending turned out to be somewhat to White's advantage. As I found out after the game, my opponent had ob served this variation during a match Unwell Again 289 between East Germany and Denmark. Black had been the same Enevoldsen, while White had been Uhlmann. In this game also an ending was quickly reached after White forced the ex change of queens. It seems to me that White's advantage in the centre, to gether with the fact that he can quickly bring his pieces into play, should en courage him to keep the struggle com plicated. The one inconvenient feature of his position is the awkward situ ation of his queen in the centre of the board. This can be easily removed, if the queen is sacrificed. 9 i.d2 In my opinion, 9 <li>d 1 i.d7 gives Black more than sufficient play for his pawn. 10 .l:.cl 11 lDt'3 12 1fc4!

Remembering in time that piece of 'chess' wisdom - don't expect too much of a good thing - White decides to give up his queen in a different way, only this time Black is not agreeable. 13 ... i.b4 Now Black is forced into an unde sirable ending.

In the game Bilek Smyslov ( 1 6th Olympiad, Tel-Aviv 1964) White played 1 0 ltJb3, but after 1 0. . ..tb6 it soon became clear that Black had an excellent position since White's kingside activity is hindered by the absence of his knight while his queenside play is hindered by its pres ence !

However, White's 15th move also has one drawback: his knight on h5 is a condemned man, since it is clear that his only task can be to give himself up on g7. Sensing the danger, Vasiukov begins to make amends for his open ing mistakes, and with a series of pre cise moves succeeds in doing this. 15 ••• �h8! A move which is useful from every point of view.

There was now a long gap in my chess time-table: the Candidates Matches were only due to begin in the summer. Both then and now I could not imagine my preparations being purely theoretical, so after a 7-year interval I decided to take part in the Latvian Championship, where I assumed the role of favourite.

Recovered Tal - Shmit Latvian Ch, Riga 1965 Before the last round, I was leading my closest rival, A. Gipslis, by one point, and by playing on in the last round until there were only the kings left, I became the Champion of Latvia, regaining this title after a 12-year interval. In the summer came the Candidates Matches. We prepared very thoroughly for my first opponent, Portisch, who at that time was already considered an opening specialist, and whose style resembled that of Botvinnik. Hoping for success, and knowing that the semi-final Matches were due to begin only a week after the quarter-finals, at the same time we made some preparations for a match with lvkov, reckoning that he would win against Larsen. Our assumption was rein forced by the recent tournament in Zagreb, where Larsen had lost some five games, including one to lvkov in about twenty moves. The one thing that we were somewhat guarded about was the shortness of the matches: 10 games. Up till that time I had played one match of 14 games with Saigin, and two of up to 24 games with Botvinnik. Perhaps for this reason my trainer forbade me to play the King's Indian Defence against Portisch, so as not to take an unnecessary risk, and thus find myself in the position of having to win one back. We assumed that Portisch would prepare especially thoroughly against the King's Indian. As White I decided to play only 1 e4, since against this move the Hungarian Grandmaster defended less confidently. From the creative point of view, I was quite delighted with these two matches, against Portisch and Larsen. The first match, with Portisch, began with a score of + 2 - 1 =2 in my favour, and to some extent set the tone for the whole match. As Black I equalised fairly quickly, and adjourned the game in a slightly favourable ending. According to the regulations, adjournments were to be played off after every two games, and so the second game began with a certain moral advantage on my side, especially since match play has its own specific form: as White you try for success, and as Black for equality.
298 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
Here Portisch surprised me: in the second game, for evidently the first time in his life, he chose the Caro-Kann Defence. To me, such a blatant copying of Botvinnik seemed somewhat guileless, and when in my turn I avoided the well beaten path, Portisch found himself in an unfamiliar situation. He played inaccu rately, I played sharply, and the reader can see for himself how it all turned out. On the resumption of the first game, I missed a win on the 56th move, the last one before the time control, and then in the third game played badly in an abso lutely level position, overlooked a simple manoeuvre by White, and Portisch played the remainder of the game very accurately, although it too was unfinished after the first session. The fourth game is also given in this book, and I would merely like to give the conversation which I had with Portisch when we were analysing it afterwards. The point is that at some stage I had to choose between transposing into a techni cally better, perhaps even won position, with a knight on d4 against a bishop on d7 and an isolated black pawn at d5, or playing for an attack. I chose the latter. Here Portisch asked me why I hadn't played differently at this point, with :d3. I replied that the move hadn't even entered my head. He looked at me in astonishment, and said that I had already played this move in an earlier game. It was my turn to be astonished. 'Where? When?' 'At Cura�ao, against Benko !' Yes, Portisch had prepared conscientiously for our match. The day finished with a score of 1 - 1 , for straight after this game I resigned the adjournment with a quiet mind . . . I t was perhaps the fifth game that proved decisive. Once again the Nimzo-In dian Defence, and a variation which was not expected of me: the only time I had played it previously was in the 1953 USSR Youth Championship. As it turned out, Portisch was 'in general' prepared for it, and it was he who surprised me by offer ing a sacrifice of the exchange. I found the correct reply, and a sharp ending was reached, in which, towards the time control, Portisch succeeded in outplaying me. w Portisch - Tal Candidates Match (5), Bled 1965 Recovered 299 Nearly two whole days were devoted to the analysis of this position. It was pub lished in full in the Riga magazine Shakhmaty - the editorial staff always 'forced' its editor not only to give directional guidance, but also to write conscientiously about all the events in which he, that is I, took part. It is not possible to give the full analysis here, nor is it necessary, and I will limit myself to just the main line. Portisch sealed 41 e4!, the only move to give him any winning chances. There followed 41 ••• lhh2+ 42 �e3 i.f7 43 .l:r.b6 .l:r.h5!, and after half an hour's thought White replied 44 f5, which forced Black from the road of analysis onto the path of improvisation. What a pity ! The game could have finished beautifully if White had chosen the sharp 44 e5 fxe5 45 f5, with unequivocal mating threats. After the forced 45 ....l:r.g5 ! 46 �e4 h5 47 �xe5 h4 48 f4 .l:r.gl 49 f6+ �h8 50 .l:r.b7, Black seems to be in a very bad way, but he saves himself by tactics: 50. . .:el + 5 1 i.e4 .l:r.xe4+! 52 �xe4 h3 53 .l:r.b8+ �h7 54 �f3 �g6 55 .l:r.b6 �f5 56 �g3 h2 57 �xh2 �xf4 58 .l:r.b7 b2 59 .l:r.xb2 �f5, and a theoretically drawn position is reached, where the rook and pawn cannot win against the bishop. After Portisch's move, the game was drawn without any particular trouble. Be fore the last three games I still had a lead of one point, but the previous game had evidently overtaxed Portisch, for he played without any great enthusiasm, and I won both as Black in the 7th game, and as White in the eighth. This gave me the necessary 5 112 points ahead of schedule. After a break of a week came the semi-final match. I have already said that Larsen's victory over Ivkov came as a surprise to us, and Larsen is the sort of op ponent against whom one must either prepare very carefully, or else play sponta neously. In view of the lack of time, the first variation was ruled out, and we realised that the match was going to prove very difficult, although the score from previous en counters was clearly in my favour: + 3 -0 =2. So, in an optimistic frame of mind, I played the King's Indian Defence in the first game, with the permission of my second. This attempt was to be the first and the last. It turned out that Larsen was very well prepared, and played much more strongly against me than he had against Uhlmann in the recent Zagreb Tourna ment. He adopted a new, very interesting order of moves, which set Black ex tremely complex problems. Then, however, I was surprised that, instead of deciding the game by combinative means, Larsen, contrary to his usual habit, played very reservedly, and practically allowed me to equalise. Here I began to think of more, remembered the score of our previous encounters, and after miss ing good drawing chances, once again got into a lost position. Larsen was once again unhurried, but this time inexorable. I postponed my resignation until the day the game was resumed.
300 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
The following day the unexpected happened. Larsen decided to play too openly for a draw. The fact is that there are very many players in the world who can play for a win, but very few who can draw to order, especially as Black. Lar sen certainly cannot be considered one of them, and the penultimate game of the lvkov-Larsen match is a further indication of this. What became of Larsen's desire can be seen from the game, which is given here in the book. Thus the score became 1 - 1 . Then came two draws, one of which, the 4th game, affected me badly, and left its mark on my play in the 5th game. In the match with Ivkov, Larsen had adopted the Alekhine Defence in one game, and it had also occurred in his previous games. In our game, after 1 e4 llJf6 2 eS llJdS 3 d4 d6 4 liJf3 dxeS To some extent a Larsen patent 5 llJxeS, he sud denly played S ••• llJd7. If this had been in a simultaneous display, I would have de cided that my opponent had simply overlooked the stroke 6 llJxf7 r:txf7 7 'iih5+, when, against his will, the black king is forced to go for a walk. Larsen could not have missed this, and I began examining the possible vari ations, which were, of course, pretty complicated. Intuition kept telling me that the sacrifice could not be incorrect. However, I decided to calculate everything 'as far as mate', studied one variation, a second, a third ... 50 minutes went by in this way, and most of the time was spent in searching for a defence for Larsen, whom I nevertheless trusted. Finally, in one of the innumerable variations, I naturally succeeded in finding something resembling a defence. Of course, the position did not require such consideration. Either my oppo nent's 'offer' should have been immediately declined, or else the problem should have been tackled without prejudice, and the knight sacrificed at f7. In fact I re jected the sacrifice after prolonged thought, and this was a psychological blunder, for even after I had gained the advantage, my thoughts kept returning to the 'criti cal' position. Somewhere in the middle of the game, I suddenly came to the con clusion that in a variation I had examined, and which I had thought to be in Black's favour, White in fact gains a decisive advantage. This I could not endure, and I played the second part of the game aimlessly, which led after 40 moves to a lost ending. Then I had to seal my move. I thought for over half an hour, I even wanted to resign, but Larsen was no longer on the stage. In a gloomy mood we sat down to analyse, and began with the position after ... Black's 5th move. We convinced ourselves that 6 llJxf7 would have given White a very strong attack, and went on to the adjourned position. Considering it to be hopeless, we lazily moved the pieces about. At about three in the morning, owing to Koblents's extreme tiredness, I managed to draw a couple of times, and I joked that now Larsen would be unable to win the ending. Thus a small though, to be honest, rather dubious degree of optimism arose. Recovered 30 1 In addition, however, at some stage play could transpose into an ending, very slightly similar to the games Botvinnik-Fischer and Portisch-Tal, where sepa rated pawns successfully fought against two connected passed pawns in a rook ending. This also gave us a certain amount of hope. Nevertheless, what saved me was no doubt the fact that Larsen thought that he could win the game just as he pleased. At the decisive moment Black's eyes were 'dazzled', and when the second time control was reached at move 56, the position was already drawn. The game as a whole somehow unsettled me, and for the fifth game I extracted from my arsenal the Griinfeld Defence, which I had prepared for the match with Portisch. I have always liked it in a platonic way, but previously I had played it only a few times, and with no great success. Although, as the game went, I could have gained equality without difficulty, I once again began dreaming of more, which finally led to a retreat. On this occa sion Larsen demonstrated his technical ability, and to adjourn the game seemed improper. Thus Larsen went into the lead. On the day before the sixth game, Larsen's wife, who was able to affect Bent's mood like no one else, left Yugoslavia. Whether it was for this reason or some other is not clear, but the score was immediately levelled (the game is given here) and the tension reached breaking point. The seventh was, in my opinion, the most interesting, sharp and fruitful game of the match, though it was not without its mistakes. Larsen did not gain any opening advantage, and got into serious time-trouble, in which I became nervous, and for some unknown reason rejected the win of a piece. Then one of us blun dered, the other returned the compliment, and we adjourned the game, so as to resume it, according to the schedule, after the 8th game. In analysis we found that, practically by force, an ending could be reached with rook and pawn against knight and pawn. In Averbakh's book on the endgame, we found exactly this position, with the diagnosis - draw, and began looking to see how we could avoid it. Suddenly I thought of an idea by which we might disprove Averbakh. After long searching we decided that we had managed to do this. This meant that in the three remaining games, in two of which I had the white pieces, I could play calmly ! I adjourned the 8th game with a purely symbolic ad vantage, which was impossible to realise, and then resumed the 7th game. It turned out that, after all, it was not so simple to refute the theoretical findings, and as a result the score remained level. Thus we were back where we started, and everything depended on the last two games. And if the score should be 1 - 1 ? The seconds and the chief controller, the likeable and witty Austrian Dorazil, discussed this, for the moment theoretical but
302 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
perfectly real possibility. They could not come to an agreement (playing to the first win was not practised at that time in the Candidates matches, and first occurred 9 years later in a Ladies' Match) and so Dorazil made the following suggestion: 'It will all be very simple. I will stand Larsen and Tal side by side, and give each of them a sheep's bone, and then bring in my dog. The one he goes up to will go through to the final ! ! ' The controller's decision was 'accepted' with delight, and play continued. The 9th game also proved to be dramatic. At the board I found an important re joinder to an opening surprise (at least, that is what it was for me) by Larsen, and by about move 15 already considered that I could play for a win. In addition, Larsen once again spent a great deal of time in thought. Here nerves came into the act. At first I committed some inaccuracies, and then in Larsen's time-trouble made such a move that my position immediately became hopeless. When, after the game, Koblents asked Larsen to comment on the move 24 ... g5, the Dane replied: 'For several minutes I thought that Tal had gone mad ! ' Indeed, there i s no other word for this move but mad. Larsen immediately gained a menacing attack, and after the time-scramble and its inevitable slips, we adjourned the game in an ending which was inferior, and most probably lost for me. Larsen was a pawn ahead with a good position, and could do what he liked. The one thing that we were able to find in analysis was a rather simple trap. Larsen fell into it! Although the adventures did not end there, and we both in turn made further mistakes, a theoretically drawn ending was reached. Thus before the last game I had an advantage not only in the form of the white pieces, but also in that my spirits were raised. Besides, at that time I had faith in my ability to play decisive games. The reader can see for himself how the battle was decided. I must admit that I returned home in high spirits, although they could have been dampened by the fact that in the final I had to meet Boris Spassky, against whom the chess score was far from in my favour. JOURNALIST. Incidentally, which of the Candidates would you have prefer red to meet in the final? CHESS PLAYER. If one goes by bare arithmetic, I had a plus score against Geller and Smyslov. As they had already played each other in the quarter-finals, the chance of me meeting a 'pleasant' opponent was not all that high. JOURNALIST. You are, after all, of an emotional nature, but in matches you see before you the same face, day after day ... Recovered 303 CHESS PLAYER. It is for this reason that even now I prefer tournaments. Even if, in a match, my opponent's face is the most likeable. Before describing the match in Tbilisi, I must 'complain' that my preparations for it were ruined by medical considerations. The doctors discovered something completely imaginary (as it later turned out) in my lungs, and virtually insisted that I should be sent to the Crimea. In addition, they stated categorically that the match should take place only in Yalta. I flatly refused to agree to this, since after a very friendly correspondence with Spassky, I had suggested Tbilisi, and he had agreed. I have no doubt that Boris would have come to Yalta if l had asked him to, but to play in a sanatorium ... Ugh ! Prior to the match, Koblents came to Yalta, along with L. Shamkovich, who also helped me in my preparations. Occupied with all kinds of medical proce dures, I did not spend a great deal of time at the board. In addition, it was only later that I realised that all this endless manipulation and swallowing of medicines did not exactly assist the development of my creative fantasy, or even put me in a good frame of mind. Then the match started. The first game straight away featured an interesting move by Spassky, for whom the three encounters of 1965, and the four (including the match with Petrosian) of 1 968/9 were to be the summit of his achievements. This glory must rightly be shared with I. Bondarevsky, an excellent trainer, who not only keenly senses the nuances of a position, but also the psychological con dition of his protege and the opponent. The interesting 'move' made by Spassky was to play the Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez, and not just this by itself, but also the treatment given to the attack by Spassky and Bondarevsky: giving up a pawn to avoid a sharp calculating struggle. So, at the very start of the match, Boris gained the initiative for a pawn, and at the same time a solid position. I attempted to shake his position, and was success ful, although analysis later revealed that White had in fact played too riskily. I ob tained the better ending, and had I continued to conduct the game strategically I would have had quite good winning chances. However, a combination with a purely study-like idea cropped up, and without hesitation I temporarily sacrificed a piece, which, after Spassky's precise and simple reply, gave me only a useless extra pawn in an ending with opposite-coloured bishops. In the second game Spassky, who like myself plays less strongly at the begin ning of an event, miscalculated in a sharp position, and came out a pawn down, and I won. JOURNALIST. I have a photograph from the beginning of the third game. Spassky is sitting at the board, bent low and ready to spring, as it were. He is a
304 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
picture of self-discipline, of a man striving to go forward. You are quite placidly leaning back in your chair ... is it possible that the third game, and the match as a whole, was lost not by a chess player to a chess player, but by an athlete to an athlete ? CHESS PLAYER. Very possible ! Although it would seem that psychologi cally I lost the match somewhat later. In the third game, Spassky avoided the Marshall Attack, for which we had pre pared. White should nevertheless have obtained a slight but comfortable and last ing opening advantage, but I simply played the moves in the wrong order. The game went into an equal ending, and I offered a draw. It was only after the match that I found out that Bondarevsky had given Spassky strict instructions to play on in such positions 'until Tal was sick of them' . The shrewd trainer was right: on re ceiving a refusal and after some further 'moving about' , I began to create difficul ties for myself, and adjourned the game a pawn down, although the draw had not yet been thrown away. The resumption took place the following day. Here again Spassky and Bon darevsky chose exactly the same unhurried tactics - no forced variations ! I had not the time left to do this - the previous day I had used up half an hour on my clock. Here I worked out a long study-like variation, and reached a position where Spassky would have a king and queen against my king and a pawn on f7. And I boldly went in for it. But when this position was just about to be reached, I real ised that my king would not be on g8, which would have given the draw, but on e8, and that when I queened the pawn I would be mated. I was forced to change course, but for this it was already too late. After the quiet fourth game, before which Spassky gave me a present - it was played on my birthday - Spassky once again played the Marshal! Attack, commit ted an inaccuracy, and I obtained by force an ending which was highly unpleasant for Black. Instead of playing 'a la Spassky', and gradually realising my extra pawn over a large number of moves, I was once again tempted by some concrete variations, exchanged all four rooks, and then realised that in the resulting ending with opposite-coloured bishops there was no longer a win. When, in the sixth game, by utilising one of his opening weapons, Spassky just as quickly took play into an outwardly harmless, but in fact slightly favourable ending for White, my nerves once again could not stand the strain. Instead of equalising accurately, I 'rushed' things, both of Spassky's rooks penetrated onto the eighth rank and we thought that the adjourned position was lost. The one slim hope was that, if Spassky had sealed the most natural move, then by a tactical stroke I could exchange a pair of rooks, and although my position would remain unpleasant, the draw would be there. Recovered 305 Strange as it may seem, it was just this move that Boris sealed ! He then 'tor mented' me for quite a long time (this followed from his tactics in the match) but without result. Here it was that I made a mistake. I was advised to avoid 1 e4 for the moment, especially since I had prepared for many of Spassky's favourite schemes against 1 d4, but I became obstinate. Besides, I was subconsciously counting on Spassky's former inability to play decisive games (which had more than once let Boris down), and I set myself the goal of maintaining the equilibrium until the penultimate 1 1th game. So, I thought, let him once again play the Marshall At tack, even though I had not achieved anything against it so far! He played it, and what's more found an improvement on his previous play, and deliberately took play into a slightly inferior ending. However, the tactics planned by Spassky and his trainer justified themselves. I gradually 'converted' the favourable ending into one that was not altogether comfortable, but on resumption nevertheless held the draw. In the eighth game Boris played slackly, and Black quickly equalised. Perhaps if there had been two more draws, then Spassky would have cracked, but it was I who did so first. In the ninth game I made the half-hearted decision to play 1 e4, but not allow the Marshall Attack. Boris played inaccurately, and White gained a considerable advantage, but in striving for the 'planned' fifth point I got carried away. I began to demand too much from myself, and what is more important, from the position, and instead of first ensuring the safety of my king, I moved my rook off somewhere and gave Spassky counterplay which he utilised splendidly. As a result the game was adjourned in a lost position. Acting unhurriedly, and in exaggeratedly academic fashion, Spassky realised his advantage. The situation had now changed sharply. There were only three games to go to the finish, in which I would have White in only one, and I had to win back a point. In the tenth game, as early as the 3rd( !) move, Boris demonstrated his unwill ingness to get mixed up in anything at all risky, and instead it was I who did this. I played unevenly, and badly, and the score became 6-4 in Spassky's favour. As Spassky later told me, before the eleventh game, and also during it, he was very nervous, but this did not prevent him from playing his best game of the match. I organised a typical football 'pile-up' on the black king's position, but gave up as lost the queenside and the centre. This neglect of prophylaxis did not go unpunished, and the match concluded. After this I went to see the Tbilisi doctors, where I found out that, firstly, in tense doses of all sorts of medicine do not go unnoticed either by the kidneys or by the nerves, and secondly, that I was, according to the doctors, perfectly

Game 62 Tal - Zhuravlev Latvian Championship, Riga 1965 Old Indian Defence I will not hide the fact that before the start of this game I was nervous. The last time I had taken part in the Lat vian Championship was seven years previously, since when I had had prac tically no encounters at the chessboard with our best players. Meanwhile, the class of their play had markedly risen. It is not just a joke that in 1958 many participants were trying to reach the candidate master norm, whereas now the norm had been set for obtaining the title of master. One of the seekers of this title happened to be my oppo nent in the first round. Of course, my participation in the Championship of the Republic was purely for training purposes, in parti cular for working on my opening rep ertoire and on the question of 'time ' . Many observers criticised me (and not without reason) for the fact that sometimes I play too quickly, and at other times with the speed of an ex press tortoise. In the Championship of the Repub lic I took the advice of D. Bronstein: to note down the time taken over each move during the game. I think that this additional information can help disclose the course of the players' thoughts during the game.

After the Petrosian-Bot vinnik match, on which I had to com mentate, I took to commencing all my games (apart from two it seems) in this way, perhaps as a protest against the fact that for two months 1 e4 was not once played.

weaker, since after the equally plausi ble move l l . . .'it'a5 the 'development' of White's rook is seen to be no use at all.

After lengthy reflection I decided on the move 1 1 'i¥c2, firstly since I had a vague picture of the vari ation which was to occur in the game, secondly from general considerations (White is trying to establish a knight on f5 and he frees the square dl for a rook), and thirdly since I was intend ing to weigh up once more an unusual possibility (cf. the note to White's 1 2th move). w 11 'ii' aS (l.OO)(D) 12 i.d2 (1. 10) Once again White thought for a considerable time, although l l . . .'ii' a5 could not have been unexpected.

The opening of the g-file, as the further course of the game shows, is also in his favour, and, what is most important, Black parts with his dark squared bishop, which was very nec essary to him both for the defence of his king, and for counter-attack (the diagonal a7-g1). At the board I was afraid of the positional move 17 ... lLldf6, which in effect completes his develop ment.

Strange as it may seem, an unex pected reply, since the Hungarian champion adopts this defence very rarely, and we (more precisely, I) had somehow not thought up any plans against the Caro-Kann. It was clear that the Hungarians would have care fully studied the games from my matches with Botvinnik, and there fore, without any prepared 'mines ' , it would be inexpedient to choose the variations with 7 h4 (2 d4 d5 3 tlJc3 dxe4 4 tlJxe4 i.f5 5 tlJg3 i.g6 6 tlJle2 tlJf6) or 4 h4 (3 e5 i.f5). After Por tisch's first move I feverishly began to recall which variations I had not yet Recovered 3 1 1 adopted in tournaments. To my aid came reminiscences as a trainer. Last year in the USSR Ladies' Champion ship I assisted Zara Nakhimovskaya, and since the Riga lady, in answer to 1 e4, plays only l . ..c6, we studied the various systems of the Caro-Kann lit erally for a whole day. As it happened, Konoplyeva chose the line 2 l2Jc3 d5 3 l2Jf3 . From the opening Nakhimovs kaya obtained an excellent position, but all the time I felt that somewhere White could have played better (al though, of course, I did not mention this to Zara). It was now that I remem bered this. In the end, I decided, Por tisch has played less games with the Caro-Kann than Nakhimovskaya (I hope that they will both excuse me for this comparison). 2 l2Jc3 d5 3 l2Jf3 dxe4 A slight, but rather well-known in accuracy. 3 . . . .tg4 has long been con sidered best here, not yielding White an inch in the centre.

Before the match we had noticed that the Hungarian Grandmaster has an excel lent feel for the most subtle strategic nuances but reacts less confidently to sudden tactical turns.

20 cxb6 Still out for blood. My first inten tion here had been to force a draw at last by 20 .i.h6 to which Black has one good reply 20 .. .'ii'xb2 ! (less good is 20 .. .'ii' c7 2 1 'ii' xf6+ �g8 22 ..txg7 ! ). However, not every c-pawn can reach the square a7, so White decided on the risky, though not losing, capture of the queen. 20 ti)xf4 21 'ii' g4 tt)ds 22 bxa7 (D) A position has arisen with a rather unusual material balance. White has a queen and three pawns against a rook and two minor pieces. If Black suc ceeds in co-ordinating his forces, then he will clearly have the better chances. There are two factors which hinder this: the audacious pawn on a7, which at the very least frightens Black, and, although only temporary, the diffi culty of developing his king's rook. With his next move Portisch tries to solve these two problems simultane ously, but the further course of the game shows that his plan is incorrect. 22 • • • �e7 The idea is clear, Black's king heads for the a-pawn, and any checks will only act as a following wind, for ex ample, 23 l:.e1 + �d6 24 'ili'g3+ �d7 25 'ii' g4+ �c7 . It is clear that White 3 14 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal must somehow open up lines on the queenside, so that, in his new place also, the black king will feel uncomfort able. This White succeeds in doing. Therefore, stronger was the straight forward 22 ...g6. How the game would have finished in this case, I do not know, but at the board it seemed to me that the pawn on a7 insures White, to a significant degree, against defeat. In a number of variations he is able, by playing a81i', to win in exchange both Black's remaining queenside pawns. 23 b4! Evidently Portisch underestimated this reply. Since it is clear that captur ing the pawn is bad because of 24 l:.b1 , Black is forced to allow it on fur ther, and its advance spreads confu sion in the enemy ranks. 23 ••• :as Even so, stronger perhaps was 23 . . . 'iti>d6 24 b5 'iti>c7, not giving up, for the moment, the idea of going after the pawn. In any event there will be no time to capture it. 24 l:.e1+ 'iti>d6 (D) 25 b5! :xa7? This loses instantly, but Black's de fensive task was already very difficult. White has at his disposal two threats: the attacking 26 bxc6 bxc6 27 'ii' e6+ 'iti>c7 28 l:.c1 and the constricting 26 b6 ! , after which either the a-pawn re mains a constant threat, or else Black must, all the same, go in for the ex tremely dangerous opening of the b file (after 26 . . . l2Jxb6 27 l:.b1). The move in the game hastens the end. 26 l:.e6+ 'iti>c7 27 ltxf6! 1-0 Game 64 Tal - Portisch Candidates Match (4), Bled 1965 French Defence 1 e4 2 d4 3 l2Jc3 4 .tg5 5 l2Jxe4 e6 d5 lDf6 dxe4 l2Jbd7 Up till 1 962, this variation was not especially popular, and was adopted only rarely in those cases when Black very much wanted a draw. In the Can didates Tournament at Curac;:ao, Petro sian played this variation against me in round eight, as did Benko two rounds later. In the game with Petro sian I played 6 lDxf6+ lDxf6 7 lDf3 c5 and after an hour's thought chose the absolutely unique plan of 8 'ii' d3 .te7 9 .txf6 .txf6 10 'fkb5+. White natu rally lost very quickly. The game with Benko developed more normally, but Recovered 3 1 5 during the game with Portisch I could not recall the exact order of moves (up till now I have fairly successfully endeavoured to forget all the games which I played at Cura�ao). 6 lZJxf6+ Probably the most accurate.

10 'iVe2 h6 Black's desire to rid himself of the bishop on g5 is understandable, but in the future the pawn on h6 will draw the attention of the white pieces directed against Black's kingside. h6 is a very convenient square on which to sacrifice. 10 . . .O-O 1 1 l:tad 1 lZJd5 1 2 i..xe7 lZJxe7 was more i n the spirit of the variation, when Black's knight can follow his white opponent: against lZJe5 there can follow . . . lZJg6, while with the white knight on d4 Black can play . . . lZJc6. In positions of this type the exchange of knights is to the ad vantage of the defending side. 11 i..f4 O-O 12 l:tad1 i..d7 13 :Xd4 White thought for about half an hour over this move. It was difficult to decide which was stronger: the openly aggressive move in the game, or the more reserved 1 3 lZJxd4 after which White could play his rook along the third rank without loss of time. In nearly all variations White's attack would develop absolutely unhin dered. What didn't much appeal to me was the fact that Black could reply 1 3 . . . lZJd5 14 i..e5 i..f6 15 i..xd5 exd5 16 i..xf6 'iVxf6 and although White has an undisputed positional advan tage, it may prove insufficient to win. White can easily obtain three quarters of a point, but after a defeat one wants more. 13 'ili'b6 14 'iVd2! It was with this continuation in mind that White decided on his pre vious move - to capture the pawn with his rook. I did not consider any other moves. Therefore, I was most 3 1 6 Th e Life and Games of Mikhail Tal astonished when after the game Por tisch told me that only here had we di verged from the path of the Tal-Benko game, where White had chosen the ridiculous, in my (present) opinion, continuation 14 .l:.d3 . 1t is not surpris ing that here, having come up against an innovation, Portisch thought for about forty minutes. 14 ... i.c6 (D) Black could also defend his bishop, and meet the coming bishop sacrifice, by 14 . . . l:tfc8. Against this I was in tending to examine once again the sharp variation 15 i.xh6 gxh6 16 'fi'xh6 'ikxd4 ! 1 7 ti)xd4 .l:.xc4 1 8 .l:.d 1 , with dangerous threats, and if this proved insufficient I had in reserve the unpretentious retreat 15 i.b3, keeping an attractive position. After the text, White's reply is practically forced, otherwise the move 14 'ili'd2 is simply a waste of time. 15 i.:xh6 .!De4 The only move. In case of 15 ... gxh6 White continues his attack by means of 1 6 1i'xh6 and now on 16 . . . i.xf3, decisive is 17 'ili'g5+ 'ifi1h8 1 8 .l:.h4+ ti)h7 (or 1 8 . . . i.h5 1 9 i.d3 with the irresistible threat of 20 .l:.xh5+) 1 9 'ikxe7 when 1 9. . . .l:.g8 fails to 20 'ii' f6+.
16. .. ti)e4 is answered very strongly by
17 i.d3 . If Black changes the move order by playing 15 . . . i.xf3, then if he wishes White can transpose into the variation already considered by 1 6 i.xg7. Besides this, the simple 1 6 gxf3 gxh6 17 'ifi1h1 i s also not bad. 16 'ili'f4 gxh6 17 .:.Xe4 This gives the game rather a differ ent direction. In return for the sacri ficed exchange White counts on keeping a persistent initiative. The at tempt to force matters by 1 7 'fi'xh6 achieves its goal after 17 . . . i.c5 1 8 ti)g5 ! , 1 7. .. .l:.fd8 1 8 i.xe6! or 1 7. .. 'ili'c5 1 8 i.d3, but after the only move 17 . . . .l:.ad8 ! , keeping the f7-square de fended, White has nothing better than to force a draw by perpetual check: 1 8 i.xe6 .l:.xd4 1 9 i.f5 ti)f6 20 Rg5+. 17 . .. i.xe4 18 1Wxe4 Here Portisch once again thought for a considerable time. He has on his side a minimal advantage in material the exchange for a pawn - but the ex posed position of his king and (once again) the presence of opposite-col oured bishops calls on him to be extra careful. Thus 1 8. . . 1i'xb2 loses almost immediately to 19 ti)e5 ! , when it is impossible to defend against the vari ous sacrifices on e6 and f7 ( 1 9. . . i.f6 Recovered 3 1 7 20 .td3). I thought that the best defen sive resource was 1 8. . . .tf6 1 9 .td3 Afd8 20 'ii' h7+ 'iltf8 21 'ii' xh6+ <l;;e7 (weaker is 2 1 .. . .tg7 22 1i'f4 or 1i'h5) 22 b3, but here White already has two pawns for the exchange, while his in itiative shows no signs of diminishing. Portisch attempts to include his rook in the defence. 18 ... l:.ad8! 19 b3 The prospect of re-establishing ma terial equality by 19 .td3 l:.xd3 and 20 ... 1i'xb2 did not appear good enough. 19 ... .tcs Now the idea behind Black's de fence is revealed. First of all, he re stricts White's rook for the moment by attacking the point f2. He plans for the black bishop to take part in the de fence via the square d4. The following manoeuvre by White is aimed at fur ther weakening Black's kingside. It involves the calculation of a long vari ation, a calculation which, unfortu nately, is inaccurate. Meanwhile, by continuing simply c3, White could have maintained all the advantages of his position, and Black's defence would have involved great difficulties. White's oversight is, however, rather amusing. 20 'ii' f4 'iltg7 21 'ii' e5+ This forces the advance of the pawn, since it is hopeless to allow the queen in on f6. 21 ... f6 22 'ii' g3+ White naturally did not even con sider capturing on e6. w 22 ••• 'ilth7 (D) 23 l:.e1 l:.g8 23 . . . l:.d6 would lose to 24 lDh4 :g8 25 .td3+ f5 26 .txf5+! 1 This was White's idea - to free the square e7 for his rook. However, Black had at his disposal a very interesting defensive possibil ity : 23 . . . .tb4 . I had taken this into account, and had prepared a winning variation, or so I thought: 24 .txe6 .txe l 25 .tf5+ 'ilfh8 26 'fig6 .txf2+ (if 26 . . . 'ii' xf2+, then 27 'ilfh l 'ii' fl + 28 liJgl ) 27 <J;;n :d 1 + 28 'ilfe2 'i!le3+ 29 'iltxd l . While Portisch was thinking over his move, White to his horror ascer tained that, by playing 28 .. .:e 1 +, Black would be the first to mate. White would probably have had to I do not see White's continuation if Black simply takes the bishop. 3 1 8 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal move his rook, or else force a draw by

25 <M!
I do not feel inclined to attach a question mark to this move. It appears completely logical. White frees his queen from the defence of his f-pawn, since nothing is gained by capturing it without check. But here White had at his disposal a fine opportunity to gain a decisive advantage, by playing 25 c3 a5 26 a3 ! ! (Koblents pointed out this possibility straight away after the game). Now, in view of the threat of 27 b4, Black is forced to move either his queen or his rook, but then White captures one of the pawns (on e6 or f6) with decisive effect. For exam ple: 26 .. . l:.c6 27 'fi'xf6 i.xf2+ 28 <it?fl l:.xc4 29 l:.xe6 or 26 .. .f5 27 b4 axb4 28 axb4 l:.g4 29 'fi'e7+ l:.g7 30 bxc5 Rxc5 3 1 'fi'f8 ! l:.g8 32 fif7+ l:.g7 33 l2Jg5+ ! hxg5 34 Rh5+ Clt?g8 35 .:txe6. Fortunately, White's omission does not alter the overall assessment of the position.

Even then, by continuing 27 "flf6, White would keep all the advantages of his position. 27 g4! This destroys, once and for all, the black king's shelter. Black gains noth ing by 27 ...fxg4 28 hxg4 'ilc6 because of the simple 29 ltJe5, when he does not have a single check. Here the best defence was perhaps the immediate 27 ... 1Wc6 28 gxf5 Rxf3 29 fxg6+ <i!i>xg6, but White is then material up with an active position. The move made by Portisch loses immediately. 27 ... .:td7 28 :Xe6! It was still possible to fall into a trap: 28 i.xe6? i.xf2 ! and Black suc ceeds in simplifying the position. Now it is all over.

With his third move the Danish Grandmaster set White a problem: he had to decide which system to play. With his fourth move, however, Black himself answers this question. In this game he is attracted by a system which was very popular among the great players of the past: Steinitz, Las ker and Capablanca. Nowadays it does not enjoy such fame. Black obtains a cramped but solid position, which to day, when the striving is for more ac tive defensive possibilities, is thought unfashionable. 5 d4 6 l2Jc3 7 l2Jxd4 .td7 exd4 .te7 The question of how White should best play in this position is a mystery, I think, not only to me. In any case, it was with great surprise that I read an article in Shakhmatny Bulletin by Shamkovich, in which it was stated that the strong continuation 8 .txc6 bxc6 9 'fkf3 O-O 10 e5 had been sug gested by Tal.

On 22 . . . lLlf6 White can favourably retreat his knight to c3, or else play 23 c4 since his e-pawn is defended.

Imme diately after the final game of the Larsen-Ivkov match, the Yugoslav grandmaster showed me that encoun ter, and 'scolded' himself for the pseudo-active move 6 1Wh5 which he had made. Then he offered the follow ing opinion: 6 tt:ld2 is the quietest re ply, 6 'ii' f3 , although committal, is the strongest; after a swift analysis, I agreed.

As exchanging on c3 would only strengthen White's centre, while White's knight is threatening to move to e4 with great effect, Black contin ues to manoeuvre with his knight, hoping to deflect White from his in tentions. w 8 9 i.bS+ 10 i.a4 llJb4 c6 llJd7 (D) The transfer of the bishop to its in active post on a4 does not signify that White has given up ideas of an attack. After llJe4 and c3 the bishop can be fa vourably switched to the b1-h7 diago nal. Here White thought for quite a long time. The advantages of his posi tion are perfectly clear - a lead in de velopment, and Black's difficulty in evacuating his king - but all this must be effectively exploited. In the given position victory was doubly necessary; if I couldn' t win from such a position the psychological shock would be too great - it would mean that I had for gotten how to win altogether. Here White had a number of tempt ing ways to develop his initiative. I was first of all struck by the tactical possibility 1 1 a3 llJd5 1 2 llJxc6.

Koblents and I had exam ined this position on a number of oc casions in friendly games. Here is one of these, played on the morning of the l Oth game.

12 lDd4 lbxd4 13 i.xd4 bS A very important moment. After the move made by Larsen it is obvious that White's attack will develop more quickly, which in such positions is very often the decisive factor. Black should definitely have played 1 3 . . . e5 to which I would have replied 14 g5 . Now the attempt to win the exchange fails : 14 . . . i.g4 15 'it'g3 i.xd 1 ? 1 6 gxf6 i.xf6 1 7 lDd5 and Black loses ( 17 .. .exd4 18 lDxf6+ 'iit h8 19 l:.gl , or 17 . . .1i'd8 18 i.b6), but by continuing 15 . . .exd4 (instead of 15 ... i.xd 1 ) 1 6 gxf6 dxc3 1 7 fxe7 cxb2+ 1 8 'iit b1 i.xd 1 , Black keeps quite good defen sive chances, since the position has become considerably simplified. 14 gS lDd7 How should White develop his at tack?

Variations of the type 15 ...b4 16 axb4 'it'xb4 1 7 1i'h5 l:.b8 1 8 l:.d3 'ili'xb2+ 1 9 'iit d l appeared quite attractive, but then my attention was drawn to the idea of the knight sacri fice on d5, opening lines for the at tack. On this occasion I fairly easily persuaded myself not to reject such a tempting, though not unhazardous, idea. The amusing variation which I found at this moment (cf. the note to Black's 1 8th move), reinforced the conviction that to refrain from such a sacrifice would be simply shameful. All this time the after-taste of the fourth game was somehow weighing on my mind, and I even used a sort of internal monologue in order to make up my mind: 'If in the end, Misha, you are destined to lose this match, there is no need for the reason to be coward ice' .

Otherwise the knight will give itself up even closer, on f6. 17 exd5 The piece sacrifice has something of a positional nature. Black's pieces are grouped on the queenside (rook on a8, queen on b8 and bishop on c8), and it is by no means easy for them to come to the aid of their king. The open e-file is a barrier. Besides, both white bishops are aimed at the enemy king, and the standard combination with successive bishop sacrifices on h7 and g7 is threatened. Black cannot defend against this without making positional concessions. On 17 ... g6 White can con tinue the attack by 1 8 h4, or by 1 8 �h3 ! , which is, i n my opinion, more active. Larsen tries to cover h7 with another pawn1 . 17 . • • f5 Now White's dark-squared bishop is too strong. 18 ltde1 Black has an unpleasant choice: either to defend his bishop with his rook from f7, when the position of the rook gives White the possibility of opening lines on the kingside with gain of tempo (g6 !), or else to move yet another piece away from the king side.

7 A Candidate Again
After an absence of more than a year from tournament play (this time had been spent playing matches) it was 1 966 when I set off for Sarajevo. I have already said that I play with particular pleasure in Yugoslavia, and with success, and the tradi tional Sarajevo Tournament was no exception. I do not recall what it was that held me up, but I was somewhat delayed in leav ing Moscow, and I flew out to Yugoslavia in the same plane as our footballers. Petar Smederavac, my son's godfather, was due to meet me at the airport (imme diately after my match with Larsen he had got married, and I had been a witness at the wedding), but he was a few minutes late, and the Soviet footballers intro duced me to their Yugoslav colleagues as ... the Soviet team masseur. Then Petar appeared, took me away in another car, and the footballers were 'orphaned' . Right from the start in Sarajevo, I played several interesting games, including one with Damjanovic, against whom I held a grudge. The point was that, during the match with Spassky, Mata had also been playing in Tbilisi, in an International Tournament, and in an interview had characterised me as follows: 'Tal plays the opening like a good Grandmaster, the middle game better than a good Grandmaster, and the endgame like an ordinary master' . Such a formulation very much displeased me, and you will understand that it was with great pleasure that I exchanged queens in our game, especially since the resulting ending was clearly in my favour. This tournament also saw the continuation of my duel with Spassky, this time, of course, by proxy. The Czech master Jansa, who was both a friend and an ad mirer of Boris, chose against me that same variation of the Ruy Lopez, in princi ple favourable for White, which had nevertheless caused me so much trouble in the 9th game with Spassky. In a very sharp position Jansa offered me a draw and in reply I immediately blundered and lost. Then there was a very amusing episode in my game with Matulovic, who completely fits the description of me given above by Damjanovic. In a slightly favourable rook ending I occupied the only open file with my rook, expecting Matulovic to do the same. Then, however, Black would have been left with a very slightly better pawn ending, which would have been quite impossible to win. The Yugoslav did not place his rook on the open file either straight away, or at any time that it was possible. Thus the file re mained in my hands for ever, my advantage increased, and in the end I won. To the question, why had he not exchanged rooks, Matulovic gave a quite unex pected reply: 'I haven't yet studied pawn endings ! '
332 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
There was an attractive little finish to the following game. Tal - Pachman Sarajevo, 1966 Black incautiously captured the pawn by 20 • • . 'ii' xe2 and after 21 fDc7 :le7 22 �f3! was forced to give up his queen: 22 •.• 'ii' xd1+ 23 :Xd1 :lexc7 24 :!cl h5 25 �g2 and then resign (1-0). It turns out that the natural 22 .. .'i!Ve5 is met by 23 :!xc6 'i!Vxf4 24 fiJd5 ! !, when the white knight creates havoc all over the place. After ten rounds I was trailing the leader, the Yugoslav player Ciric, by 1 112 points ! The future Grandmaster, usually so peaceable, was thirsting for a fight in Sarajevo. He had scored eight wins, one defeat, and only one draw ! We met in the 1 1th round, and the previous day I had read in a sports paper a somewhat flowery compliment addressed by him to me. In an interview, Ciric had said that he thought he had good chances of first place, and that if Spassky had been playing instead of Tal, he would consider his victory already assured, whereas, as it was, everything was not yet clear. I did my best to confirm his fears, and won our game. There was an amusing finish to it. For this encounter, apart from the normal fans with a good under standing of chess, many sports fans arrived. In the time-scramble, with the dem onstrators somewhat behind the players, Ciric obtained a second queen on the 39th move, but resigned on the 40th, and shook my hand. On seeing the hand shake and the two black queens on the board, the less experienced spectators shouted 'Bravo, Cira ! ' , while at the same time the more qualified section of the public was shouting 'Bravo, Tal ! ' They were all quietened by the demonstrator who hung up on the board the sign 'White won' . Thus, when the last round began, we found ourselves level, and that is how we finished. Once again there came a break in my chess life. It was due to the fact that, after a 3-year interval, my diseased kidney made itself felt, and also that there took A Candidate Again 333 place in Moscow the match for the World Championship, at which I once again fulfilled my duties as a journalist. In short, it was only in the autumn that I once again sat down at the board. I began the Kislovodsk Tournament with a defeat at the hands of the Moldav ian master Lutikov, but then my fortunes sharply improved until my kidney began playing up. For several days, the question of my leaving the tournament was de bated, but I decided to play on to the end, thinking that there was no reason why the talented Lutikov, similar to me in his chess convictions, should suffer because of me. I dissipated the whole of my plus score, and finished only on the 50% mark. It was therefore not without some apprehension that I began my next tourna ment. All the time I was haunted by the thought: what if my illness should make itself felt during the Team Championship of the Country for Sports Societies. I could not avoid taking part: the tournament on the top board would be extremely strong, and Botvinnik would be playing there. After declining to play in the Can didates Matches the previous year, he was pretty 'hungry', and played with great enthusiasm. JOURNALIST. The joke was made that, in this team tournament, all the World Championship Matches of recent years were continued. CHESS PLAYER. Yes, on the top board the following games took place: Botvinnik-Smyslov, Botvinnik-Tal, Botvinnik-Petrosian, Petrosian-Spassky, as well as matches from the Candidates Cycle: Spassky-Tal and Spassky-Keres. Prior to the last round I had succeeded in winning just one game, though I had not suffered any defeats. Then I faced the leader, Botvinnik. After it, the score in my games with Mikhail Moiseyevich was finally levelled: after all, I had won the first match against him by 4 points, but had lost the return by 5; in this game I first won a theoretical duel, then a pawn, and in the adjourned position my material ad vantage had risen three-fold. Besides our game, there were two other games from the match unfinished, in cluding one on a ladies' board in a very complicated position. After glancing at the Tal-Botvinnik game, the team trainer and I spent two whole nights analysing the ladies' adjourned position. In the morning, we woke our lady player, quickly showed her the results of our night-long analysis, and set off for the tournament hall. The adjourned games were resumed. That evening the deciding match of the fi nal round was due to be held, in which Botvinnik would play Petrosian. Without any ulterior motive, I went up to a representative of the 'Trud' team - Botvinnik's team - and expressed my sincere admiration for the play of their constant leader.
334 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
The representative's reaction stunned me: 'Then agree a draw with Botvinnik, and we will agree to a draw on the ladies' board, where we stand better! ' I was taken aback, and I didn't know what to reply. The representative imme diately went up to Botvinnik, who was thinking over his move, and said some thing to him. The latter raised his head, waved the representative away, and stopped his clock in a sign of resignation. In the end Geller was the winner on the leaders' board, and we three - Botvinnik, Petrosian and I - finished half a point behind. The end of the year was crowded with events, but began in an unpleasant way. At the Olympiad in Havana an unknown man 'caught' me with a 'tactical blow' : a bottle to the head. As a result, the 'first game' of the Olympiad, Tal-N.N., ended in my defeat, close to a rout. However, this only led to my missing the first four rounds, in which we played against Morocco and India, and in which I might have hoped to improve my indi vidual score. Perhaps this shock even had a beneficial effect on me, just like the operation for appendicitis in 1959, for I played with great enthusiasm. Despite missing the first four rounds, and the final one, I nevertheless played more games than the other members of our team. As many as three of the games played in Ha vana are given here, and of these the encounter with Robert Byrne was of special significance. As is well known, the Soviet team did not want to be given four points by default against the Americans, who did not turn up to play*[Editor's note: The match had originally been scheduled for a day on which Fischer could not play (for religious reasons), and rather than play without their first board, the USA team did not appear for the match.], and with our agreement the match was set for another day. It was my game with Byrne that decided its fate. Before the last round, when the success of our team was already assured, I was allowed by our captain to fly out a little earlier than my colleagues: I was to be one of the first Soviet players to participate in a tournament in Spain, in Palma de Mallorca. I began, as if by inertia after Havana, in very lively style, and at the start scored something like 5 out of 5. The Spaniard Arturo Pomar was also playing well. Ear lier I had read a lot about him, almost the only pupil of Alekhine. I considered my most important game to be the one against Trifunovic, the only player in the tour nament with a plus score against me. Here is the finish (see diagram on next page): White's sealed move was 45 e6! ! There followed 45.•. i..xe6 46 l:.a7+ i..d7 47 'ith2! l:.h5 48 b5! l:.xc5 49 i..xh3 f5 50 bxc6 :Xc6 51 i..xf5 l:.d6 52 'itg3 'ite8 53 l:.xd7 l:.xd7 54 i..xd7+ �xd7 55 'itg4 <iti>e6 56 'itg5 'itf7 57 'itf5 1-0 A Candidate Again Tal - Trifunovic Palma de Mallorca, 1966 The final rounds took place after a specially organised tourist bull-fight, with the participation of the players and some mini-bulls. One such calf 'offended' Po mar, driving him into the arena. Perhaps this defeat, not so much physical as moral, affected Pomar, for the following day he lost, fully opening the way for me to first place. JOURNALIST. But you, after all, also went into the arena! Tell me, please; if in Havana the 'additional game ' with N.N. had occurred accidentally, why in Mallorca was it necessary to play a similar 'game ' with a real live bull? CHESS PLAYER. Firstly, it was really more like a calf. Secondly, I had heard so much about the bull-fight - from Bizet to Hemingway - that it would be un thinkable to decline to take part in one in such convenient circumstances. True, at that moment, I wasn't to know that the following morning the local papers would display our photograph (that of the calf and me) with the headline: 'The first So viet bull-fighter in Spain ! ' Three draws at the end of the tournament gave me first place. The year 1 966 was over. The New Year found me in Tbilisi, once again in the role of correspondent, at the USSR Championship. Since it was a Zonal Tournament, and since I already had the right to play in the Candidates cycle, I considered that it would be some what awkward for me to play, since to some extent I could influence the distribu tion of the places, involuntarily fulfilling the role of 'controller' . In the spring my kidney once again began playing up, and I went into the well known Botkin hospital in Moscow. The observations turned out to be so lengthy that from there, to put it bluntly, I did a bunk, since there was the pleasant prospect of playing in a very strong International Tournament in Moscow, dedicated to the 50th Anniversary of the Great October Revolution. Starved of chess, I began fairly successfully, with wins over Filip and Bilek (the combination in which was
336 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
judged to be the most brilliant in the tournament). Both these games are given here. Then, against Gligoric, I got the order of moves wrong, and so did not win a piece, nor the game. For a long time after this I was unsettled, not so much by the lost half point, as by the missing of a simple tactical possibility. A draw with Gipslis followed, then an incorrect sacrifice against Keres, simply refuted, and several more draws. Only in the second half of the tournament did things go somewhat better for me. The game that I won against Petrosian is given here; I defeated the World Champion for the first time after a 10-year interval. I also gained my first win against Bronstein for a long time, and defeated Uhlmann in an amusing struggle. At one point the East German Grandmaster thought for so long that my colleague Gipslis, who had already finished his game, went off to hear The Barber of Seville, but was disappointed by the performance, and left after the first act, and once again made for the tournament hall. To his amazement, he found Uhlmann still thinking over the same move ! His meditation lasted for 1 hour 40 minutes ! I would have laughed if at that time anyone had said to me that in our next game Uhlmann would beat this record, but that's just what happened: Uhlmann thought for 1 hour 50 minutes ! ! I suffered one more defeat, playing the King's Indian De fence most unsuccessfully against Portisch, and as a result shared 2nd-5th places with Smyslov, Bobotsov and Gipslis. The winner was Leonid Stein. My next event, the Team Tournament of the USSR Peoples' Spartakiad, was also in Moscow. Latvia found itself in a strong preliminary group, from which we only reached the second final group. I scored 6 points out of 9, without defeat, and played several interesting games.

Now I played for the first time in the traditional USSR-Yugoslavia Match, which has been held regularly since 1956. It was in 1967 that, for the only time, the match was made into a tournament of 12 players, 6 from each country. It is still with a smile that in the press I read references such as 'in the game Tal-Gip slis from the USSR-Yugoslavia Match, 1967 .. .' In the first round I played Gligoric, adopting the same variation as in the Mos cow Tournament a few months earlier, the variation over which such a discussion was to flare up between us in the Candidates Match a year later. Then came a draw with Korchnoi, who set an exceptional pace, and as a result outstripped his closest rivals - Gligoric and myself - by one and a half points. Then, after a lengthy stay in hospital, this time in Riga, I played two games with my old friend Victor Ciocaltea in the equally traditional match between Lat via and Rumania. After this came the Championship of the Soviet Union in Kharkov. It was the first and, God grant, the last experiment of running the USSR Championship on the Swiss System. After all, the overwhelming majority of the players who gathered in Kharkov (and there were more than a hundred) played interesting chess, but were not serious contenders for the gold medal. No argu ments in favour of the system - the greater number of participants, a school for the young, etc. - can hide its main drawback: the influence of Lady Luck. I began with three wins. Then came a slight setback of several draws, but one of them was judged to be the most brilliant game of the Championship, and both players re ceived a special prize.

This game is given in the book. The second key moment in the Championship was my game against Poluga evsky in the penultimate round. We were leading with the same number of points, and when, after 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4, I played 2 ••• e6, Lev offered me a draw. I accepted, although for decency's sake we made a further 12 moves or so, and the question of first place was put off until the last round. By the luck of the draw, Polugaevsky, much to his displeasure, had to play Grandmaster Kholmov, whom up till then he had never beaten. My opponent was to be my compatriot Zhuravlev: a master from Liepay who, as it happened, I had never played before. The piquancy of the situation was increased by the fact that should Zhuravlev win, although he had never qualified for even a USSR Champi onship semi-final, he would become a Grandmaster of the Soviet Union ! Polugaevsky was very upset by the result of the draw, and I took great pleasure in teasing Lev, 'confidentially' informing him that in Riga an urgent meeting of A Candidate Again 339 the Chess Federation was being held in order to decide the question: did Latvia want a USSR Champion, or a new Grandmaster. That evening I went into Poluga evsky's room, and informed him that the Federation had decided the question in favour of the USSR Champion. Of course, of this 'meeting' and 'decision' of the Latvian Chess Federation, Zhuravlev knew nothing. The following day, having completely pulled himself together, Polugaevsky scored a clear-cut win over Kholmov, while this is how my game concluded: Tal - Zhuravlev USSR Ch, Kharkov 1967 w 34 'ii' xb7!

I played there with Korchnoi, and the Leningrad player once again set a furious pace, scoring 6lf2 out of 7 at the start. From my first games I felt that I had neither the enthusiasm, nor the right sort of mood, for chess. From the whole tournament there were only two games that I could boast about. The game against Donner is given here in this book, and this is the other (see diagram on next page): 24• . •:ca8 25 bxc4 b4! 26 .l:tad1 l:txa2 27 'ii' xd7 1i'xd7 28 l:txd7 b3 29 lLlcl i.h4 30 lLle4 l:ta1 31 l:tb7 l:tb8 32 .l:txb8+ lLlxb8 0-1 This tournament was my last test before the start of the Candidates matches, and showed that, to put it mildly, I was not in my best form. This was also con finned by the start of my match with Gligoric. In preparing for this encounter, Koblents and I realised that a duel was likely to develop in one or more topical
340 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
Rossolimo - Tal Wijk aan Zee, 1968 opening schemes, since the theoretical preparation of the Yugoslav Grandmaster has always been notable for its thoroughness and soundness. There was no discussion about where the match should be held: I readily agreed to play on my opponent's 'home ground' in Belgrade. In the first game I had the white pieces, and at the start I was subconsciously unwilling to reveal my secret weapon immediately. On the other hand, success would mean the immediate destruction of Gligoric's favourite and main defence against 1 e4. The second consideration outweighed, and after spending some three minutes on the opening, I made the preparatory move w Tal - Gligoric Candidates Match ( 1 ), Belgrade 1968 22 l:ta3 In the overcrowded hall of the Palace of Syndicates, where we were playing, the noise level rose: whether it was a joke or not, the rook had placed it self en prise to the black bishop. Gligoric sank into thought, and after 40 minutes found the correct way to neu tralise White's innovation: 22 .•• bxa4 23 l:txa4 l:tab8. A Candidate Again 34 1 Subsequently I could have obtained an ending with an extra pawn. but this would have been practically equivalent to agreeing a draw. Preferring a sharp game, I avoided this, then at some point blundered, and in the adjourned position Gligoric found a precise way to win. The second game again featured a theoretical duel, this time in the Nimzo-In dian Defence where we had prepared an improvement in Gligoric's favourite variation. As a result, Gligoric immediately offered a draw as White, but I had to try to win one back and began attempting to obtain more from the position than was justified. Suddenly I saw for White an excellent combination (however, analysis later showed it to be incorrect). To avoid it, I moved my knight away from the centre, and nervously offered a draw myself, but the advantage was now with Gligoric. Only in the time-scramble did I manage to win the exchange, which, however, did not give any real winning chances. The following day, when the game was to be resumed, there was an important international football match in Belgrade, which was clearly not worth missing for the sake of such a position. So, after agreeing to a draw, Gligoric and I went together amicably to the match between Yugoslavia and France. In the third game another misfortune befell me, and rather an amusing one. In preparing for the match, we knew that in reply to 1 d4 Gligoric played the King's Indian Defence 90 times out of 100, and I decided to play a system often chosen by Larsen. It was only when I played it that I immediately remembered that I had already adopted the same variation as Black against I vkov at Bled, in 1 96 1 , when Gligoric was present. The Yugoslav naturally neutralised my whole set-up, and in a slightly superior position offered a draw. Only the fourth game gave me a certain cause for optimism. I once again won the theoretical duel in the Nimzo-Indian Defence, and this time, with the slightly better game, I offered a draw 'from a position of strength' . For almost the first time in my life, the sober voice of reason suggested that for the moment it was not worth declining draws, but was better to get into form and attempt to decide the match in the 3rd, 4th, and should the opportunity arise, 5th 'White' games. But nothing came of the 5th game, and many of the reporters in the Yugoslav press began to express their preference for Gligoric. They said that he had a point in hand, that he had three 'White' games to come against my two, and that he was fit and well prepared physically. However, I sensed that I was 'beginning to play' , and felt that in the fifth game I had seen quite a lot at the board. Gligoric, meanwhile, was in something of a dilemma. On the one hand he re alised that it would be good to increase his advantage with a win, but on the other hand he began playing with an extra degree of caution, so as to maintain that which had already been achieved. This indecision only hindered him. At any rate,
342 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
in the sixth game he played inconsistently, making first a safe move, and then an active one. It is not impossible that Gligoric was disturbed by my playing an opening which I had never played before. Be that as it may, the score in the match was levelled, and besides, I had noticed earlier that Gligoric before a defeat, and Gligoric after one are two entirely different players. This was also confirmed in our match. In the seventh game I held the initiative, and managed to take the lead, so that both the score, and the mood of the oppo nents, had changed in my favour. Gligoric had two 'White' games remaining, and here my sense of danger came into operation, though when it arose in me I do not know. In the eighth game I de cided to avoid repeating the variation with which I had twice been successful. With what was I to replace it? I decided to 'borrow' from Larsen, who at that time was playing his match with Portisch in Zagreb, (incidentally, late every evening we would watch on television both a commentary on my game with Gligoric, and a description of the game between the Dane and the Hungarian) and chose the variation which he was adopting in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. The decision proved to be a correct one, since later Gligoric told me that it was before the 8th game that he and Velimirovic had found an important improve ment, which effectively put out of business the variation which I had played in the 2nd and 4th games. The fact that I myself diverged noticeably distressed the Yu goslav Grandmaster. I quickly obtained at least an equal game, but despite having the better prospects, offered a draw, since I very much wanted to be in time to watch the televising of the football match between the USSR and Hungary. Gli goric thought for some 25-30 minutes, until midway through the fust half, and declined. I felt just a little bit angry, but even so, when within 5 or 6 moves Gli goric in turn offered a draw, I did not try to gain revenge for the missed football: besides, I sensed that Svetozar had already cracked. Indeed, the following game, the 9th, turned out to be the last. In it I adopted the move order chosen by Korchnoi in the 2nd game of his match with Reshevsky, which was proceeding at the same time in Amsterdam. I did not, of course, expect Gligoric to blunder away a pawn, as Reshevsky had done, but this almost hap pened. True, at the last moment Gligoric realised the danger, but he was able to ward it off only at the cost of two tempi. They proved sufficient for the game to be adjourned in a position which, although complicated, saw White the exchange ahead (see diagram on next page): A lively and highly significant part in the analysis of the adjourned position was played by the world-famous violinist David Oistrakh, an old and faithful lover of chess, who had arri ved in Yugoslavia for a concert. Incidentally, the analysis was quite complicated, and we analysed the position roughly 1 8 moves A Candidate Again Tal - Gligoric Candidates Match (9), Belgrade 1968 w ahead, avoiding a number of false paths. It was the main variation of our analysis that occurred in the game. 43 l:.dl i.c7 44 lL!e4 'ittf845 lL!d6 i.xd6 46 l:.xd6 <l,;e7 47 l:.d5 a4 48 c7 b3 49 axb3 axb3 50 l:.xe5+ <lt;d6 51 l:.b5 <l,;xc7 52 :Xb3 <l,;c6 53 c5! i.e6 54 l:.c3 i.d5 55 <l,;gt f5 56 l:.a3! <lt;b7 57 l:.g3 g5 58 l:.e3 <l,;c6 59 l:.e7 <l,;xc5 60 l:.h7 g4 61 hxg4 fxg4 62 l:.xh6 i.b7 63 l:.g6 1-0 The resumption therefore proceeded at practically lightning speed. The match concluded and I set off to visit Petar Smederavac, my son's godfather. Just on my arrival in Yugoslavia, a daughter had been born to him, and I became her godfa ther. Petar gave the baby the name of Talija. I returned to Moscow, and exactly half an hour later Victor Korchnoi, who was to be my opponent in the Candidates Semi-final Match, flew in from Amsterdam, where he had beaten Reshevsky. In our match, the Leningrad Grandmaster was considered by chess correspon dents to be the undisputed favourite. The score of our previous encounters ap peared in the press, and it was recalled that, in the last tournament where we had both participated (Wijk aan Zee), Korchnoi had finished 3 points ahead of me. I was confronted by the following problems: firstly, to make myself forget about our previous games, and secondly, to force myself to play as reservedly as possible, since Korchnoi is at his most dangerous in positions of a counter-attacking type, and feels less confident in situations where he himself has to take the initiative. Therefore we decided at the start of the match to give preference to 1 d4, since previously I had always opened with my king's pawn against him. The very first game fully confirmed all our expectations. I began extra-calmly, then came simplification, and straight from the opening the game went into an ending which I could not have lost if I had tried. Korchnoi could have gained
344 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
approximate equality, but he was completely discouraged by the way the game had gone, and made two anti-positional moves. A pawn ending was reached which was lost for him, although this still had to be proved. w Tal - Korchnoi Candidates Match ( 1 ), Moscow 1968 Here I wrongly made the mistake of not believing myself. At first I wrote down the winning move 28 e5, but then decided to work out all the variations literally to mate. To do this proved not at all easy. It was only several days later that a detailed analysis appeared, confirming that, by avoiding many false paths, White could win by force. Being unable to find all this at the board, I rejected 28 e5, sub sequently again played inaccurately, and Korchnoi found the only moves to force a draw. The most amusing thing is that I was not at all upset: the game had shown that the match tactics we had planned were quite correct. In the second game I again avoided all the sharp continuations into which my opponent tried to provoke me, and in the third game once again chose the quiet opening variation which had been psychologically so unpleasant for Korchnoi in the first game. Here, and this doesn't happen often, my opponent fell into a pre pared opening trap, and I obtained a completely won position with an extra pawn. I allowed myself to relax a little, which you can't afford to do against Korchnoi, and first made my task more complicated, and then in time-trouble lost all my ad vantage. I realised that there was no cause for panic, and that this game would have played on Korchnoi's nerves no less than on mine, but my heart began to be tor mented by doubts: one game I had not won, now a second. I was already some what softened up when I arrived for the next game. Korchnoi very keenly sensed this, played the first part of the game very ener getically, adopting an interesting theoretical innovation and obtained a clearly A Candidate Again 345 superior, if not winning position. In addition, I was also dispirited by the fact that over the first 15 moves I had spent a mass of time, and Korchnoi practically none. To avoid the worst I decided to get some play at the cost of a pawn, which, of course, Korchnoi should not have taken, but a recurrence of his old illness - a ten dency to capture pawns of 'any quality' - almost allowed me to save the game. For the pawn Black's pieces came strongly into play, and only severe time-trouble 'led' me past a continuation which would have made Korchnoi fight for the draw. However, I blundered, lost a piece and the game. My good intentions were immediately abandoned, and after a lengthy discus sion with my second, I decided to return to my old ways, and play 1 e4, although it had previously been unsuccessful against Korchnoi. In reply to this, Korchnoi chose a quiet variation of the Ruy Lopez, which he had played only rarely, prom ising White an active and superior game. I did not play the best way, and Korchnoi practically equalised. Of course, if I had not been burdened by the thought of my loss in the fourth game, and the chances missed earlier, I would have gone in for the quiet position planned by Black, but my nervous decision, taken on the spot, gave Korchnoi the chance to shine with a typical counter-attack. Everything seemed to be settled. By tradition, the match against Korchnoi was lost, for I would never make up the difference of two points in the remaining five games, in three of which I would have Black, and I went along quite calmly to the sixth game. Korchnoi evidently considered even three draws to be a luxury for me, and went all out to 'finish me off' . Indeed, he obtained the better position, while I was once again in time-trouble, and took my only chance: to sacrifice the exchange for a pawn. The position became considerably sharper, but Korchnoi was evidently unprepared for such a change, and when the time control had been reached it was clear that, despite being the exchange ahead, White was lost. The fate of the match once more hung in the balance, and Korchnoi 's self-con fidence was markedly shaken. In the last games of the match he tended, uncharac teristically, to aim only for a draw. It became easier for me to play in such a situation, but not once was I able to realise any advantage I gained. I began the lOth game very calmly. A loss and a draw were equally worthless to me, but there could be no question of any unjustified risk. In the fust half of the game Korchnoi played unsurely; in a Dutch Defence I seized the initiative, and gained a winning position (see diagram on following page). But here nerves came into the act. After all, in the event of a win, the psycho logical wind would be in my favour, and a sudden-death play-off would disturb Korchnoi's equilibrium. Instead of 32 . ..'ti'g7 or 32 . . .

At the board I failed to find a very promising pawn sac rifice, whereupon Black's attack gradually died out, and before the second time control I was forced to agree to a repetition of moves. It was then that our little incident took place on the pages of the press, when Korchnoi in his interview declared me to be 'a highly routine player' . On the pages of the weekly 64, only just revived, the editor, Petrosian, spoke up for me, and I thus became the object of a creative discussion. JOURNALIST. But how did you yourself react to Korchnoi 's declaration ? A Candidate Again CHESS PLAYER. I didn' t. I knew Victor, and I knew that he was capable of saying what he did not mean. However, I found it amusing how he expressed his dissatisfaction, when a couple of months later I turned up as correspondent for 64 at his Final Candidates Match with Spassky. Evidently he assumed that, ex ploiting my official position, I would try to get even with him. Then I found out that a place had not been found for me in the Soviet Olympiad team for Lugano, and I went off to a small tournament in the Georgian town of Gori. Particular interest was given to the event by the participation of the Lady World Champion Nona Gaprindashvili. After beginning the tournament with my usual defeat, I then won several games, including the following interesting encounter.

I started the last round as the leader, and drew my final game with Gaprin dashvili, which suited us both but made Gufeld most unhappy, since as a result Nona finished up level with him. The year concluded with the Team Championship of the Country in Rig a, and with it began a chess year (not coinciding with the calendar year) which I would very much like to cross out from my autobiography. It brought me only failures, and failures that hurt very deeply. In the first round of the Team Championship I declined a draw offered by the master I. Zaitsev, adjourned the game in an inferior position, then reached a
348 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
drawn position, but blundered badly on the last move before the second time con trol. In the second round I went down with a crash to Bronstein, and although I then came up to '+ 1 ' (one of the games, with Khermlin, is given here), my result could not be called anything but mediocre. Straight away, just before the New Year, I set off to Alma-Ata for the Cham pionship of the Soviet Union. True, New Year's Eve itself was pleasant enough, since on 30th December I had my revenge against the same I. Zaitsev, winning a fairly good game.

I naturally fell out of the leading group, and then began my second ascent. Sev eral games went successfully, including the one with Gurgenidze given in the book, and some six rounds before the finish the distance between myself and the leaders had been reduced to a minimum. Taking into account the fact that I had a not especially difficult finish, there was even hope for complete success. Just at this point came a recurrence of my illness, which had not left me, apart from short intervals, for the whole of 1968. The consequence was that, for the first time in my life, I scored only 1 112 points out of 5 at the finish, and it should have been even less. The result was my worst failure up till then in the Championship of my country. A Candidate Again 349 In addition, I had no suspicion of what was awaiting me in the following Zonal Championship that same year. After the Championship I had once again to return to matches, and to meet Bent Larsen, who had lost in the other Candidates semi-final Match. The winner of our 'consolation' duel would have the right to compete in the next Interzonal Tournament. At that point I felt so terrible that, for the first time in my life, I appealed to the Soviet Chess Federation with a request that the match be postponed. Our chess leaders reacted to this suggestion extremely reservedly. It was in their interests that the match with Larsen should be concluded before the start of the USSR Championship semi-finals, since in the event of my losing, I would have to start the new cycle for the crown in one of these semi-finals. Formally, I was assured that everything possible would be done, but the leaders of our Federation were 'unable' to find Larsen, who at that time was playing a match with Westerinen in Helsinki, and the match began on the date set previously. When I asked Larsen whether he would have been prepared to postpone the match, he said without thinking: 'Of course ! My wife gave my telephone number in Helsinki to your rep resentative, but no one phoned me .. .' This match with Larsen was as bad as our first match had been interesting. Larsen is of the same opinion, so this is by no means just the grumbling of the loser. Of all the eight games, only the sixth, in which Bent played excellently, is worth singling out. The remainder of the games abounded in mistakes, most of them by me. My poor form in the match is best illustrated by the episode which occurred in the 8th game. Tal - Larsen Candidates 3rd place play-off, Eersel l969 w This position was reached after the black king had 'taken a walk' , and then re turned to e8. I had calculated that by advancing my a-pawn, I would win in a few
350 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
moves, but suddenly I saw that by castling ( ! !) Black could set up a counter-attack on f2. I therefore began taking energetic measures to prevent Black from cas tling .. . After the game, which I lost, one of the participants i n a mass tournament tak ing place there came up to me, and asked why I hadn't played 29 a5 at the appro priate moment. I replied, and then stopped short on seeing the glazed eyes of Larsen and the enquiring fan. Only then did I realise that I had been fighting not against castling, but against its shadow, and I thought to myself. 'It is just as well that this was only a prestige game; if it had decided the match, I would have been near to having a heart attack .. .' Then there came a month's break in my chess biography, given over to medica tion. Lying in a Riga hospital I appeared in the role of chess correspondent on the Petrosian-Spassky match; I received the games move by move by telephone from Moscow, and the following morning I dictated my notes on the games to the Mos cow stenographer of the chess weekly 64. I was then taken to Moscow, and the day for the operation was named. Then I found out that for six to eight weeks after it I would be confined to bed. Meanwhile the Championship of the Soviet Union would have started, this year having the status of a Zonal Tournament, and I de cided to put off the operation until later. Nevertheless, in my condition it proved quite impossible to play, and my colleagues tried many times to persuade me to leave the tournament, but with my former optimism I completed it all the same. Although in the lower half of the table most of the time, in the middle of the tour nament I somehow ran into form. I don't know if it was that my opponents began to under-estimate me, or that my organism suddenly became accustomed to working, but almost in successive games I won against Lutikov, and inflicted the first defeat in the tournament on Kholmov. In addition, Vasiukov lost on time in an equal position, and I began to think: who knows, if I finish well, I may have chances yet. Then, five rounds before the finish, I had two adjourned games; with a big ad vantage against Stein, and an apparently completely won position against Fur man. I began to look ahead: for 'Zonal' success, besides these games, I would have to win towards the end against Gipslis and Averkin. The adjourned games were resumed.

I got into time trouble, messed things up, and resigned, and then with a complete lack of enthu siasm resumed my game against Stein, finally drawing with difficulty.

4 lDxd4 e6 S lDc3 d6 The Argentinean master chooses the system of play which has been perhaps the most popular in recent events, the Scheveningen Variation. However, his move-order is slightly unusual: in this situation (a) one of the most active replies to the normal Scheveningen (I e4 c5 2 lDf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lDxd4 lDf6 5 lDc3 e6) 6 g4 ! , would, i n this position, be a blow in thin air, and (b) in the normal variation 6 i..e2 lDf6 7 i..e3 i..e7 8 O-O O-O 9 f4, Black can manage perfectly well with out the move . . . a6, by continuing 9 . . . i..d7 10 'ii' e1 lDxd4 1 1 i..xd4 i..c6. By adopting this variation, Korchnoi, Larsen, Polugaevsky and Portisch have achieved excellent results as Black against 1 e4. Attempts to improve White's at tacking potential led to the creation of the sharp plan 6 i..e3 lDf6 7 f4 i..e7 8 'ii' f3 O-O 9 O-O-O. Indeed, in a series of games White obtained an irresistible attack. However, in his game with Gufeld from the 33rd USSR Champi onship, Furman found a very important improvement: 8 . . .e5 ! 9 fxe5 dxe5 1 0 lDxc6 bxc6 1 1 i..c4 O-O 1 2 O-O (this position was considered to be favour able for White) 1 2. . . lDg4 ! 1 3 .l:r.ad 1 lDxe3 . It should, incidentally, be men tioned that the move 8 . . .e5 has been taken up by the Argentinean team. Al though White's play can probably be improved (in particular, in this last variation 12 h3 merits attention in stead of 12 O-O), even so Black's posi tion appears perfectly satisfactory. In the present game I decided to choose a sharp variation which, fol lowing the example of the Yugoslav players Matulovic and Velimirovic (to whom the author's patent belongs is as yet unknown), has become the latest word in fashion 1. 6 i..e3 lDf6 7 i..c4 i..e7 8 �e2 O-O 9 i..b3 White unequivocally declares his intentions - to castle long and advance his kingside pawns (in particular, his g-pawn). The bishop's retreat is dictated by the desire to avoid the continuation 9 O-O-O d5 after which an attack is, for the moment, out of the question, and for play against the isolated d-pawn the white king is not well placed on the queenside (due to the half-open c file). 9 a6

352 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
A new and, it would appear, by no means bad continuation. Usually Black has played IO .. .'i!i'c7 here, after which, along with Matulovic's variation 11 l:thg1 b5 12 g4 b4 1 3 �xc6 'ii' xc6 14 �d5 ! , the immediate 1 1 g4 is also pos sible, as occurred in the game Kava lek-Polugaevsky, which was played a few days earlier. Polugaevsky contin ued indifferently: 1 l . . .b5 12 g5 �xd4 1 3 �xd4 �d7 14 'ii' h5 �c5 and after 1 5 l:thg 1 ! came under an irresistible attack ( 16 'ii' h6 ! ! is threatened). Also, 1 1 ...�xd4 12 l:txd4 e5 13 l:tc4 ! does not relieve Black of his difficulties, since the rook is situated conveniently enough on c4, being able to sacrifice itself for Black's queen 's bishop, after which White's attack develops very easily. For example: 1 3 . . . 'ii' d8 14 g5 �e8 15 l:txc8 ! l:txc8 1 6 h4 �7 17 'i!i'g4 when h5 is unavoidable. With the black queen on a5, 1 1 g4 can hardly be good for White, since after 1 l . . .�xd4 12 l:txd4 e5 1 3 l:ta4 'ii' d8 14 g5 �e8 the position of the rook on a4 is rather absurd. 11 �b1 I didn't want to play immediately 1 1 l:thg1 (which was probably the strong est move). The point was that in the variation 1 l . . .�xd4 12 i..xd4 b5 the most active plan appears to be the one involving the advance e5 , for which the king's rook is best placed on e 1 . In order to find out his opponent's inten tions, White for the time being simply makes a useful waiting move. 11 ... l:te8 Without doubt a poor reply. The virtues of this move (the possibility of moving the knight or bishop to f8) are most unclear, whereas the drawbacks (in particular, the weakening of the f7- square) become apparent almost im mediately. 12 l:thg1 .Bd7 Here 1 2. . .�xd4 1 3 .Bxd4 b5 is bad in view of 14 g4 b4 1 5 g5 �d7 1 6 �d5 ! 13 g4 14 i.. xd4 15 gS �d4 i..c6 �d7 (D) A Candidate Again 16 l:td3 Here White was faced with the question: how to build up the attack? After 16 'ii' h5 g6 17 'ii' h6 i.f8 18 'ii' h4 �e5 19 l:tg3 I did not like the fact that Black could gain time by . . .h5. The immediate advance of the h-pawn ap peared promising, but I was loath to give up the idea of a piece attack on h7 . Now Black's reply is forced, since 17 'ii' h5 is threatened, after which 17 . . .g6 fails to 18 \i'xh7+ ! , while, be sides 1 8 l:th3, the threat of 1 8 l:tf3 is highly unpleasant. 17 h4 18 h5! g6 �c5 lDxb3 It is interesting that Black rejected the capture of the rook after thinking for literally two minutes. After the game Bolbochan said that he consid ered the position after l8 . . .�xd3 1 9 'ii' xd3 to be hopeless for Black. The attack certainly appears very danger ous, but it is not so simple to find a forced win after 1 9. . . i..xg5. During the game, keeping the move 1 9 cxd3 in reserve, I very much wanted to play 1 9 hxg6 ! , after which some highly interesting variations could occur. Clearly bad is 1 9. ..�e5 20 gxf7+ �xf7 2 1 g6, or 20 .. .'ifi>xf7 2 1 'ii' h5+. On 1 9 ...hxg6 there could follow 20 l:th1 �e5 (20 ... e5 21 'ii' f3 !) 21 f4 <Ji;g7 22 fxe5 dxe5 23 'ii' h2 ! White's task is hardest after 19 . . .�f4. Nothing is gained, for example, by 20 gxh7+ 'iit xh7 21 l:th 1 + 'iit g6 22 l:th6+ rifi>xg5 (to be honest, I should admit that here also there was a reserve variation: 2 1 \i' g4 11i'xg5 22 11i'd 1 , winning the queen for two rooks and maintaining an at tacking position1). However, it appears that White can do better by playing 20 gxf7+! �xf7 21 i..xe6+! !, after which both 21 ... tifi>xe6 22 11i'g4+ 'ifi>f7 23 'iWxf4+ �g8 24 g6 ! and 2 l . ..�xe6 22 'ili'f3+ rifi>g6 (other wise 23 g6) 23 �d5 ! �xd4 24 �xe7+ lead to mate. The reserve variation was prepared in case Black could play 21 ... rifi>f8, after which I could not see a clear win, though at the same time I did not believe that such a compro mised position could be defended. 19 axb3 (D) White again offers the sacrifice of the exchange. On 19 cxb3 i.b5 ! his at tack would be significantly slowed down. 19 .•. e5 After 22 ... 1!fh6 23l:thl J.h4, I do not see how White wins the queen.

Against any immediate offensive Black succeeds in guarding the Achilles' heel of his position: the h7-square. 21 i..d2 .l:.ad8 22 .l:.hl The rook on d3 must keep control of the d5-square. 22 ... i..f8 23 'ii' g4 b5 Black's misfortune is that he has no time to transfer his bishop to e6 from where it would defend not only the d5- but also the g4-square, which is where White's knight is quietly head ing for. On 23 ... i..d7 there would have followed 24 lLld5 ! i..xg4 25 lL!xc7 winning the exchange, although, tak ing into account the weakness of the g5-pawn, realising this advantage would involve certain difficulties. 24 'ii' h4! The preparations are complete. 24 ••• b4 Black apparently has no suspicion of the impending danger. However, there is no other useful move. 24 ...

Of course, White also keeps a sig nificant advantage after 25 ltJd5 i.xd5 26 .l:.xd5 but the move in the game is more decisive. 25 ••• d5 (D) At last Black succeeds in effecting this thematic advance, which in many Sicilian encounters serves as a cure for all ills. Here, however, this is not so. As the further course of the game shows, 25 . . . 'ii' b7 26 f3 d5 was a little more precise, though even this would not have saved Black from defeat.

This last move is perhaps not bad, but the fact is that Black combines it with a dubious plan. Here, and espe cially on the next move, . . .c5 was in the spirit of the position, establishing control over d4, after which Black's position would definitely be prefer able. I wanted to carry out the advance . . .d5 , so as to exploit the position of White's knight and queen's bishop. 14 �f3 d5 In making this move, Black as sessed his position very optimistically, since pawn exchanges in the centre are clearly unfavourable for White, while the continuation 15 e5 d4 ! 16 exf6 dxc3 even leads to material losses . However, Kristiansen's next move came as an unpleasant surprise to me. 15 i.a7 Perhaps the immediate 15 i.c5 was more accurate, so as on 15 . . . lt::! d7 to gain a tempo by 16 i.d6. The move in the game involves a sacrifice of the ex change. 15 . . • 16 i.c5 Ilb7 d4 After almost an hour's considera tion, I very unwillingly made this move. The point was that the continu ation 1 6. . . lt::! d7 17 i.d6 i.d4 1 8 'iit> h 1 (or 1 8 lt::! d 1 ) did not appeal to me, since the white bishop on d6 seemed no less active than either of Black's rooks. Perhaps this is a somewhat sub jective assessment. But what to do - I would be very happy to have the white pieces in the position arising in this variation. On the other hand, to sacri fice the exchange myself by 16 .. .'ili'a5

19 I:tc 1 Black's initiative seemed in
sufficiently concrete. Now Black be gins a rather complicated plan, seeing before him somewhere in the distant future a genuinely promising A Candidate Again 357 exchange sacrifice. In the end I was able to effect it, but only with the as sistance of my opponent. 17 lLle2 On 17 lLla4 Black was intending to continue 17 . . .e5 after which 1 8 f5 gxf5 is unfavourable for White.

The essence of the position is that Black must, at any price, liquidate his opponent's poten tially most active piece - his bishop. Black's last move is made frrst of all with this in mind.

Of course, in this case also Black's position remains highly dubi ous, and it was with difficulty that I persuaded myself that I must be able to find some kind of counterplay.

It used to be played ten years ago but nowadays the variations commencing with 9 . . .h6 or 9 ... l2Jb8 are preferred. In fact Petrosian played 1 3 ... .i.b7 in one of our games in the 1 959 Candidates Tournament. On that occasion, I replied 14 a3 and after 14 ...exd4 Black quickly reached a sat isfactory position. The most important moves here are 14 d5 and 14 l2Jfl . As far as I remember, theory did not give an answer as to which of the two con tinuations is more promising. Now, when opening fashions have changed, it is even more difficult to answer. 14 llJn Authors of theoretical reviews also suggest the variation 14 d5 l2Jb4 15 .i.b1 a5 1 6 a3 l2Ja6, with somewhat better chances for White. 14 .•. l:te8 The World Champion made this move after lengthy consideration. The move 14 .. .exd4 is justified after 15 l2Jxd4 since then Black quickly devel ops his forces by 15 . . . l2Jxd4 16 'j!fxd4 l:tc8 17 l2Je3 d5 and it would be White who would have to worry about equal ising. However, I was planning to play not 1 5 l2Jxd4, but 15 l2Jg3 and then l2Jf5, not hurrying to recapture the pawn on d4. The idea of Petrosian's move is to reinforce the e5-square, and to avoid giving up the centre. 15 l2Jg3 g6 16 .i.h6 .i.f8 (D) 17 'iid2 It is possible that this move is not the strongest.

There is also the variation 22 ltlxe4 Axe4 23 Axe4 ltlxe4 24 .l:r.xd4, but then 24 .. . ltlg5 is very strong. White's queen is out of play, and it is Black who gets the at tack! 21 ••• Ae6!

paradoxical 24 ... �h5 (which was sug gested by Petrosian after the game) deserves attention. 24 ••• l:lc4 This move appears logical. Black exchanges off the active white rook, but now White has at his disposal a tactical possibility which allows him to bring his knight into play. 25 l:lxc4 I wanted to play the immediate 25 �e2 but Black has the strong rejoinder 25 ... .i.xe4 and on 26 ltxc4, 26 ... .i.b7. 25 • . • bxc4 26 �e2!

Knowing the Champion's particular liking for ex change sacrifices, I examined the re sulting position very carefully.

On 36 �d2, Black must play not 36. .. 11d 1 , because of 37 �xe4, but 36 ... l:lb4. White can win the f-pawn by 36 �g5 (instead of 36 �d2), but it is doubtful whether this gives him any appreciable advan tage, since Black has a strong light squared bishop and besides, there is little material on the board. 29 l:lcl With both players short of time, White prefers to maintain the tension. 29 'ii' c6 30 �d4 'iVe8 31 l:le1 Depending on my opponent's reply, I decided to keep open for myself the possibility of play on both flanks. 31 l:r.e5 32 �3 lte6 33 'fib6 (D) Black had virtually no time left, and to find immediately the correct reply to such a move is no easy matter. 33 ••• i.xe4 A Candidate Again 367 This loses.

I very much wanted to sacrifice a piece by 17 lLlxg7 ! ? �xg7 1 8 lLlg4, but recollections restrained me! In a similar position I sacrificed a knight on g7 against Keres in the 1 959 Peo ples' Spartakiad. On that occasion, the sacrifice was inadequate.

It is highly possible that this sacri fice should not have given White a de cisive advantage, but it is definite that without it White would not be able to maintain the offensive, since Black is fully prepared to begin simplifying the position. 19 .i.xg6 hxg6 20 'fi'f3 is met by the cold-blooded reply 20 .. . l:tf8 !

Game 74 Tal - Vasiukov USSR Championship, Kharkov 1967 Alekhine Defence The result of this game was of great significance. It was played two rounds before the finish, when the Moscow Grandmaster was leading the tourna ment. Among the chasing group, half a point behind, was his opponent. It should be stated that, in a theoretical sense (and possibly also in a practical sense), Vasiukov was prepared for the Championship better than anyone, and it would appear that a great deal of credit for this must go to ... Korchnoi. You may recall that Vasiukov was Korchnoi's second at the Interzonal Tournament, and in one of his inter views he wrote roughly the following: 'I hope that in some way I was able to assist my 'ward' ; as for myself, the creative contact with Korchnoi af forded me great satisfaction, and has brought certain benefits' . I was to sense Korchnoi's influence straight away.

Of course, White does not give up the idea of making this breakthrough (it is the one possibility of fully activating his forces) but first wishes to arrange his pieces in the best possible way.

I avoided this move, for the following reason: not long before the Team Championship the Estonian master Kyarner, who was taking part in the Championship of the Latvian Central Chess Club, came into the editorial office of Sahs. He showed us his game with Katalimov, in which this variation occurred: 1 d4 lDf6 2 liJf3 c5 3 d5 b5. Mter some interesting play, the game was won by White. In considering my third move, I used the detective methods of Sher lock Holmes, who could have been an excellent chess player. My thoughts went essentially as follows: Kyarner and Khermlin play in the same team, Kyarner has no doubt shown his team colleagues the game, the game may have been studied in detail. 4 lDc3 White avoids 4 c4, after which a normal variation of the King's Indian Defence would have been reached, and intends in the future to use the c4- square for his king's knight. 4 i..g7

9 i..e2 The point is that the usual plan for Black in such positions is to transfer his queen's knight to c7, from where it supports the intended . . .b5, while the pressure on White's d-pawn hinders his central breakthrough. Now this manoeuvre is impossible, and it is not easy for the black pieces to find their proper places. 10 h3 11 i..f4 12 liJd2 'fic7 b6 i..b7 It only remains for White to play 1 3 lDc4, and for a long time Black will be condemned to passivity.

The Georgian Champion Bukhuti Gurgenidze has for a long time shown himself to be one of the strongest mas ters in the country. It should be men tioned that in his games, as a rule, the creative element predominates over the practical. Whatever his results in competitions, he plays a number of interesting games, and in practically every tournament he tries out at times dubious, at times even paradoxical ideas, which, however, he upholds with great success. Thus, for instance, against the Sicilian Defence he adopts as White a most unusual set-up, which at first provoked only sceptical smiles from his opponents and from theorists.

A Candidate Again 383 But time has passed, and it seems that not one of a number of strong oppo nents has succeeded in demonstrating that the Georgian master's point of view is unjustified. In the USSR Championship at Alma Ata, Bukhuti Gurgenidze adopted an unusual system in the Caro-Kann De fence. It might appear that this open ing has been studied so much in recent years that it is difficult to open any new page in it. Nevertheless, this is not so; in a number of games in the Championship, opening discoveries occurred as early as the third move.
1 e4 c6

3 �c3 bS (D) It should be said that the Georgian master adopted the Caro-Kann De fence in this tournament from the very start. This was a rather clever idea, because the opening had never pre viously been included in his reper toire. Starting with the games in the third and fourth rounds against Vasi ukov and Liberzon, Gurgenidze played the Caro-Kann continually. In both of the above-mentioned games the Panov attack occurred, and then at last Igor Zaitsev played 3 �c3 . To the great astonishment of the spectators, the players, and Gurgenidze's opponent, there followed this outwardly so para doxical move 3 ... b5 . Zaitsev, after thinking for quite a long time, played 4 e5 after which the position became blocked. Zaitsev suc ceeded in obtaining an advantage, but then, in analysis, it seems that Gur genidze found an improvement for Black (in particular, it is interesting that after 4 e5 he suggests 4 ...a5). On the day before the game I was chatting with some Georgian masters, and they half-jokingly asked me 'What do you think of the move 3 ... b5?' I an swered completely honestly: 'I think it's a horrible move.' When in the game I played 1 e4, I thought that Gur genidze would believe me, but 3 . .. b5 followed nevertheless. After thinking for some 20 minutes over my fourth move, I came to the conclusion that to refute this continuation immediately was not possible. w 4 a3 I also considered 4 .i.d3 b4 5 �ce2 dxe4 6 .txe4 �f6 7 .i.f3 but after 7 . .. g6 a position is reached in which the advance of the b-pawn proves its worth. 4 ... dxe4 Now Black heads for one of the normal variations.

Now, after 5 ... .i.f5, if White plays the standard 6 ll)g3 .i.g6 7 ll)f3 ll)d7 then Black's ...b5 appears highly logical, since it begins a strug gle for the occupation of the central d5-square; when a knight reaches there it will be no easy matter for White to drive it away by advancing his c pawn. White decided to demonstrate that the advance of the b-pawn has significantly weakened Black's posi tion, and with a light heart went in for the sacrifice of a pawn. 6 .i.d3 .i.xe4 I don't think that a detailed analysis is necessary in order to demonstrate the advantages of White's position af ter 6 . . .

Black will play . . . .i.d6, ... 'ifc7, . . . O-O and then at some point prepare the freeing advance . . . e5 . At the same time the pressure of White's bishop along the long diagonal is not particu larly effective, while Black can always reply to a4 with . . .b4, thus preventing the opening of lines on the queenside. 8 .i.d3 e6 (D) But now 8 . . . 'ii' xd4 deserved atten tion: 9 ll)f3 'ii' d8 1 0 'i!fe2 e6. White has the initiative and a good position for the pawn, but it can hardly be said that this is adequate compensation. I must admit the truth: I made the move 8 .i.d3 fairly calmly, since the Geor gian master very much dislikes posi tions in which, for a minimal material advantage, he has to conduct a lengthy, painstaking, and relatively cheerless defence. That's the way it was; after a short reflection Gurgenidze played . . .e6. The fianchetto of Black's bishop was also worth considering. In both cases White has a certain advantage, but on the basis of this game one can not, of course, speak about a refuta tion of the Georgian master's original system. 9 �3 .i.e7 10 'ii' e2 For the moment White did not want to determine the position of his king, having not lost hope of castling long, A Candidate Again 385 since the advance of Black's queen side pawns appears fairly harmless. At the last minute he decided against this plan, having decided that in a position with a certain advantage there is no point in falling in with the opponent's intentions of complicating the game.

This variation can be continued: 1 3 c4 bxc4 14 i.xc4 �b6, and with the d5-square in his hands Black can look to the future with reasonable op timism.

H White does not succeed in creating any real threats on the kingside, Black will consoli date his knight's post by . . . a5 and ...a4, with a completely secure position. However, White has no way of start ing a direct attack: on 1 5 1We4 Black replies simply 15 ...g6 and on 16 .i.h6 he can play 1 6. . . .i.g5, while if the h pawn advances then Black can straight away capture it. 15 'ili'g4 With a threat to which Black does not pay sufficient attention.

8 My 1Death1 and my New Life
It was now that I realised that in my present state it was impossible for me to con tinue living and playing chess. I travelled to Tbilisi, and there they removed my diseased kidney, which evidently should have been done 2-3 years earlier. If it is possible to talk at all about renaissance, that was how I felt when I came round af ter the operation. On roughly the fifth day, I was already impatiently awaiting my next tournament. It was just at this time that a rumour began to spread, to the effect that during the operation I had suffered a complete and final 'defeat' . It reached Yugoslavia, and my friends from the Moscow 'Mossovyet' Theatre, who were on tour there at that time, were saddened to read in a number of Yugoslav newspapers of the death of Tal. I hastened to reassure my friends, quoting them the words of one of the classic humorists: 'The rumours about my death are greatly exaggerated !' The tournament about which I had been dreaming began in Tbilisi roughly a month after the operation and I played there with particular pleasure. I don't know whether this really happened, but later I was told that when I sacrificed my queen against Suetin, the following comment was made: 'not bad for a dead man, don't you think!

Several of my other games were also of interest. As a result, despite the strength of the opposition - Hort, Bronstein, and a number of other Grandmasters - I succeeded in sharing first place with the tournament 'host' Gurgenidze, who reached the Grandmaster norm. I felt fine, but the doctors nevertheless advised me not to change climate straight away, but to spend some time in Tbilisi under their observation. At this time agreement had been reached about the 'Match of the Century' , in which, de spite my recent results, I was allotted a fairly high board. Before the meeting in Belgrade I also found time to take part in the Georgian Championship, though I had to play hurriedly, sometimes at the rate of two games per day. I set off to Mos cow to prepare for the 'Match of the Century' , not even knowing how the Cham pionship had ended, and only from the weekly 64 did I find out that I had taken first place. It was time for the chess festival, the 'Match of the Century' . Brilliant organisation, the best players in the world, and a hard struggle. I, for example, was expecting from force of habit to get the better of Najdorf, since for merly I had always won as White, whereas when he was White he usually aimed for a draw from the start. On this occasion Najdorf maintained the equilibrium as Black in the first game. In the second game he offered me a draw in a position where he had com pensation for a pawn minus. In reply I began to play more sharply, and came un der a mating attack. The third game is given here, and then in the fourth round the USSR team played very cautiously, since the day before we had lost the greater part of our lead. I was no exception. When I was faced by a decision: to attempt to seize the initiative by an exchange sacrifice, or to play quietly, I chose the second path, and soon offered a draw. Najdorf said that he would consider it, then twice during his 45 minutes' thought consulted with the captain of the Rest of the World team, Dr Euwe, and finally stretched out his hand to me, adding: 'But the position is com pletely won for White ! ' The 'dessert' after the 'Match of the Century' was the un official World Lightning Championship. Interest was intensified by the fact that, for apparently the first time, Fischer was taking part in an international lightning tournament. Prior to this, Soviet players had often played five-minute games with him, and on the basis of this previous experience he was not considered one of the main contenders for first place. In the first round, by tradition, I lost to him from a superior ending, and in the second was technically punished by Robert for attempting to win one back. He played excellently throughout the tournament, and ended up the winner, but I played unevenly, losing several strange games. My wins against Reshevsky and Korchnoi are worth mentioning.

After this I took part in a completely new, unusual event. In Dnepropetrovsk, the USSR Cup Competition was held on the so-called Olympic system, in which the losers drop out. In chess this is not normal, and in addition, the time limit used was unusual: 45 moves in 2 hours 15 minutes, then 20 moves in the next hour, and a further hour for the remainder of the game. If the main match of four games ended in a draw, then two more games were to be played at semi-blitz speed, 1 hour for the whole game, and if the score was still level, so on at this rate until the first win. The seven Grandmasters competing were exempted from the fust round, and went straight into the last 32. I played three matches, and I cannot say that the draw was very kind to me. Each encounter was with a 'known' player, although there were a number of less experienced masters, unfamiliar to me, taking part at Dnepropetrovsk. One of the games from my fust match, with the very solid Inter national Master Bagirov, is given here. Our match finished ahead of schedule since after a draw in the first game I won the next two. The fate of each of my next two matches was decided in the last game. First I played against Grandmaster Gufeld. Over a long period he had only won once against me, and in the majority of the other games had been unsuccessful, although he had sometimes had good positions. This was repeated in the match, and Gufeld reacted so strongly to this that he even appeared in print with notes to three of the games. In the first game, I adjourned a pawn down in a difficult position, but on re sumption succeeded in complicating my opponent's task, and we reached a queen ending, in which, as is well known, one can give as many checks as one likes. Af ter the second time control, in a now equal position, Gufeld marked off on his scoresheet a further twenty moves, and was most surprised when I reminded him that there would be no further control, and that we had to play on until the fall of the first flag. He had some ten minutes remaining, while I had about twice as much, but I refrained from exploiting such an 'advantage' . The next two games were drawn, and then in the fourth, my opponent's nerves did not hold out (see diagram on following page). 19 i.xc5! gxf5! 19 ...dxc5 is weaker in view of 20 lDe5 and 21 i.c4. 20 lDxd6! exd6 21 i.d4 fxe4 22 lDg5 exd3 23 i.xf6 h6 24 i.xg7 'i!Vc6 25 'ii' f2!

This led to a slightly better ending for Black, in which Sa von began to 'torment' me. I was unable to stand this 'torture' , and so I did not go forward into the semi-final. The winner of the Cup was the initiator of the event in this form, Grandmaster Bronstein. Whether it was because I did not perform too well in this event or for some other reason, I don't know, but after the USSR Cup I was forgotten, and re membered only when the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League decided to hold a very interesting Match-Tournament in Sochi, between seven
398 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
Grandmasters and seven very strong young masters. In the Grandmaster team there were such highly-qualified examiners as Korchnoi and Stein, while the ma jority of our young opponents have since become Grandmasters themselves. Even so, the tournament did not have an official status, and perhaps it was be cause of this that, after our game, Tukmak:ov said that in Sochi the 'old Tal' was playing. Two games from this tournament are given here. I awaited the USSR Championship in my home town of Riga with great impa tience, but for formal reasons I was not allowed in. Much as it pained me, I had to make do with the role of correspondent. To some extent I was recompensed by an abundance of tournaments in the fol lowing year, 197 1 . First I was hospitably invited by our neighbours from the North to the Tallinn international tournament, which was then becoming tradi tional. The event turned out to be quite imposing; it is sufficient to list the names of the Soviet grandmasters: Keres, Stein, Bronstein, Furman, Tal and A. Zait sev. It was these six who were mainly concerned in the battle for first place. For a long time it seemed that victory would go to Keres, for in the middle of the tour nament I lost to Furman. But a 100% finish enabled me to catch Paul Petrovich, who dropped a half point in the last round to that same Furman. Of the games played in this tournament, the one with Wade has found its way into this book, and here are two more half-correct - 'typically Tal-like' , as they were described - combinations.

My next tournament also took place on Estonian soil, in Parnu. It was a train ing event, so only Soviet players took part, and I remember it mainly for the fact that in several games I managed to slip out of difficult positions. This happened in the games with Stein, Keres and Etruk, the last being particularly instructive. Etruk - Tal Parnu, 1971

400 The Life and Games ofMikhail Tal
As you can see, in the final position I am the exchange and a pawn down, but it is my opponent who has to force the draw. The question of first place remained open until the penultimate round. I lost recklessly to the master Kyarner, while Stein defeated Keres in an important encounter, and finished first, ahead of Keres and myself by half a point. Individual tournaments always alternate with team events, and I was still 'fit' to play for the 'Daugava' team. Off we went to Rostov-on-Don, to the Champion ship of the Country. At this time our team was experiencing a crisis, since many strong players from Latvia had joined the Army Sports Club and accompanied us with the certainty that we would finish in one of the bottom places and drop out of the Premier League. But we were a happy group, and once again an old truth was confirmed: in team events, a high Elo coefficient is only half (and the less impor tant half!) of a guarantee of success. I played pretty well, and received the prize for the best result on board one, but some really severe tests awaited me at the end of the year: first the USSR Cham pionship in Leningrad, and then the International Alekhine Memorial Tourna ment in Moscow. In Leningrad I could not rid myself of a strange sensation. Everything was ap parently going alright: at first three draws and then four wins in a row, but some where inside me there was this feeling: 'There's something missing' . Indeed, as White I then lost without a fight to Shamkovich - this was one of the most undis tinguished games of my whole life. Then fatigue gradually began to take over. After all, when thoughts do not arise with their normal ease and confidence, one has to compensate for this by 'squeez ing out' the points. In the second half of the Championship, I adjourned almost every game, and on the days set aside for adjournments I had to sit down at the board three times. I was a contender for first place almost to the very end, but a defeat at the hands of Stein deprived me of my chance of taking the title, while an amazing defence by the master K. Grigorian, who received the prize for the best ending, allowed Smyslov to draw level with me before the last round. By drawing this final game with each other, we received silver medals, while the 'gold' and the title of Grand master went to Savon. In this tournament I played for the first time against Anatoly Karpov. On this occasion no real fight developed, but we more than made up for this with a very tense struggle a month later in the Alekhine Memorial. Eighteen Grandmasters took part in that event (only Balashov was awaiting confirmation of his title). My play was highly uneven. It began in my now tradi tional first round, when I gave the spectators a few happy moments by declining My 'Death ' and my New Life 401 a draw against Olafsson, and then, in far from Grandmaster style, overlooking a standard mate in two moves on the back rank. Subsequently there were further adventures, and some quite good games (one of them, against Uhlmann, which received the prize for the most brilliant attack, is given in the book; incidentally, it was here that Uhlmann established his record, thinking over the move 1 2. .. exf5 for 1 hour 50 minutes), but I should like to single out the game with Karpov. This young player had already twice performed quite well in the Championship of our Country, finishing up each time around 5th place, but the veterans, among whom I include myself, did not rate his chances very highly. On sitting down against him, I considered myself almost obliged to win. A few inaccuracies, and Karpov found himself in difficulties; then he over looked a small tactical finesse, and came out a pawn down with an inferior posi tion. At this point, having confirmed for myself my sceptical assessment of Karpov's play, I considered the fate of the game to be decided. But I only had to play not very accurately for Anatoly to obtain immediate counterplay. The position became sharper, and then an ending was reached in which I had two rooks against a queen. I recalled a similar ending from my match with Korchnoi and decided that history would not repeat itself, and that I would play cautiously and accurately, and head for the adjournment. For some reason or other, I did not manage to analyse the position thoroughly, and we decided that I should make a sufficient number of moves to reach the sec ond adjournment, since Karpov, in our opinion, could not strengthen his position. Evidently Karpov also realised that his position was objectively lost, and straight after the resumption he made a bold raid with his king. It had to be refuted tactically, but for this I was unprepared. When we adjourned the game for the sec ond time the position was already drawn. My final result in the tournament, a share of 6th-7th places with the then World Champion Spassky, could hardly be considered a success for either of us. The first quarter of 1972 was devoted to preparing the Latvian team for the first ever All-Union Chess Olympiad, and competing in the Olympiad itself. Included in these preparations was a friendly match for which we travelled to Leningrad. Both of my games against Korchnoi ended in draws. Then we played in Vilnius in the traditional tournament for the Baltic Capitals with the inclusion of Minsk. Of the three games here, I drew two, lost the third to the master Kapengut, and then we set off to Moscow for the Olympiad. Once again we took part in the traditional semi-finals, and once again the draw brought us up against the Byelorussian team - our regular opponents against whom we are usually lucky.
402 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
JOURNALIST. Just a moment! The class of your play is significantly higher than that of your fellow team members. What are your duties associated with this ? CHESS PLAYER. The main one, strange as it may seem, is not the individual 'extracting' of points: these are equally valuable on the first board and on the tenth. The main duty is a consultation with each player before each round (true, this does not apply to Gipslis and Klovans when we appear for the Latvian team, and not 'Daugava'), and, of course, the analysis of adjourned positions, difficult though it may be to straight away produce a 'diagnosis' on each of 5-6 adjourn ments in the same round. To return to the Olympiad, up to the last round of the semi-final it was not clear who would go forward to the main final: our team, or the Byelorussians. (The formidable Moscow team was already safely assured of one place.) In the penultimate round we heavily defeated Byelorussia, and in the last round - Kazakhstan (my game from this match with the master M. Mukhin is given here), and we went forward into the final. There we finished in 'our own' sixth place. I would have taken first place on board one if I had simply not played in the last round, and instead had given up my place to a reserve. However, our last round opponents were the Leningrad team, and I could not avoid playing against Korchnoi: our chess 'relationship' was too well known to everyone. So I played, the game ended in a draw, and the prize for the best result amongst the leaders went to Keres. This especially pleased me, since he was a founder of the Riga magazine Shakhmaty. After the Olympiad came another interval of four months, and how difficult it is to keep in good form without the necessary practice ... This chess 'Lent' was broken by a small tournament in Viljandi, one of those organised with such skill and love by Estonian chess players. In this little resort there assembled three Grandmasters, several masters, and the strongest Estonian players. It was here - although of course I found this out only later - that I suf fered my last defeat in 1 972. The tournament developed into a race between my self and the Moscow master Dvoretsky, but when I lost to the master Uusi (the game was adjourned in a drawn position, but on the way to the tournament hall I suddenly ceased to want a draw, and on the second move I allowed my opponent to force mate), Shamkovich and Suetin immediately drew level with me. Really enraged by such a stupid loss I defeated both of them, then scored my third point in succession in the last round, but nevertheless finished half a point behind Dvoretsky. And then - though I naturally had no suspicion of it at the time - there began that long series of games without defeat, of which, to my sincere amazement, so much was written in the press. My 'Death ' and my New Life 403 Up till the last minute, the composition of our Olympiad team was not fixed, and in the end, when those who had definitely been included were making prepa rations, Savon and I set off to an International Tournament in Sukhumi. This was considered to be a final testing for us, and for this I personally was glad: I have al ways preferred live participation in a tournament to theoretical preparation. And so - Sukhumi. It was hot, with the temperature in the shade sometimes reaching 35°C, and the Northerners amongst us suffered pretty badly from it. Thus, for instance, Robert Hiibner, with whom I became acquainted in Sukhumi, got sunburnt and his skin began to peel. I began the tournament moderately, although I realised that it was bound to de velop into a race with Savon. As it turned out, my game with him was the critical one. In the opening I fell into a variation prepared by Army players, got into a dif ficult position, and only succeeded in gaining some sort of play just before the time control. Even so, I had no real illusions about the adjourned position, which is just what Savon thought, and evidently it was this that allowed me to slip out. In the course of the resumption the following episode occurred. We were play ing with a clock of far from perfect construction, and on which the flag fell at no where near the correct time. It fell on Savon's clock just as he was making his last move before the time control. I saw that by rights White had at least a minute left, and to demand a loss on time in such circumstances seemed blasphemous to me. All these thoughts occurred in a flash, and before the controller had time to record the fall of the flag, I made a move and pressed my clock. The game subsequently ended in a draw. Towards the end I managed to win almost every game, and thus take first place, while for the following game I was awarded a special prize. Honfi - Tal Sukhumi, 1972

After Sukhumi I was given a place in the Olympiad team, and at the last minute Savon was also included. JOURNALIST. How do you react to injustices committed against you ? CHESS PLAYER. I don't care for them at all, to put it mildly. On a previous occasion I became extremely nervy when, once again at the last minute, I was ex cluded from the team for the Lugano Olympiad, but usually I grit my teeth and try to laugh, though, it is true, the laugh comes out rather malevolently. Savon, a very sensitive person, was so affected by the nervous strain, that in Skopje the Soviet team was essentially a man short. We got through the preliminary group calmly enough, if you don't take into ac count the tense match with Cuba, which the Soviet team won only because the controller did not record Korchnoi's loss on time against Garcia, while the Cuban (and perhaps Korchnoi as well) did not notice it. In the final, our troubles started in the very first round. In the match with our traditionally difficult opponents, the Hungarian team, our top four players scored three draws and one loss (Bilek won against Korchnoi). In the next three matches we won with great difficulty by the minimum margin, but in each of them one of the Soviet players was defeated. There had been Olympiads where the Soviet team had gone through without los ing a single game ! (or, at most, one or two). But here Petrosian lost in the match against West Germany, Savon against Holland, and Karpov against Bulgaria. My 'Death ' and my New Life 405 I had managed to win all my games, but it is the resumption with Radulov that I recall. At that point we were by no means winning the match (one draw, three adjournments), and were more concerned with ensuring that we didn't lose. We split up into groups for analysis and my consultant was Grandmaster Keres, our team's trainer. I have quite a large number of chess memories, but that night of analysis with Keres is one of the most pleasant. The work was calm, flowing, as it were, of its own accord; every hour a cup of coffee was consumed ... and I never even suspected that such an apparently uninteresting ending (I was a pawn up, with rooks and opposite-coloured bishops) could contain so many interesting and beautiful ideas. Incidentally, the analysis proved to be highly productive, for when on the following day the game was again adjourned, on the 72nd move, Keres and I were perfectly familiar with the position: we had reached it in our analysis the previous night. There was no need for a second resumption: Radulov resigned without further play. Since the Bulgarian Grandmaster Tringov forgot( ! !) to put his scoresheet with the sealed move inside the envelope, Korchnoi was awarded the point, and we won the match. Since the team saw that I was playing well, I was also included for the next match.

But
406 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
then unexpected setbacks in the matches with Czechoslovakia and Argentina (all eight games were drawn !) once again undermined our position. At the same time, the young and ambitious Hungarian team, 'scenting' suc cess, was playing with great enthusiasm, and was close to a heavy win against the Dutch, whereupon a sensation was possible: the permanent champions - the USSR team - might not be able to catch their friends and rivals. But suddenly the hall groaned; the Hungarian Forintos had blundered into a mate, and the chances of the two leading teams became level. Prior to the last round, we were only slightly ahead of the Hungarians, splen didly led by Portisch. We met for the final discussion regarding the composition of our team. The leaders of our Chess Federation phoned from Moscow, and ad vised, even demanded, that both Tal and Karpov should definitely play. Unfortu nately, we were playing on adjacent boards - myself on board four, and Karpov as first reserve - and there was no way in which we could both have the white pieces (which is what they were hoping for). As a result I was given the black pieces in the final match with Rumania. On arriving for the match, we looked at the teams in the equally important match between Hungary and West Germany, and received a rude shock: the Ger mans were appearing without their leader, Grandmaster Hiibner, who had won the prize for the best score on board one, and their number two, Grandmaster Darga. Straight away we began to be nagged by doubts: 'Can it be that the Ger mans are trying, after all, to organise a sensation?' . Only at the closing of the Olympiad did we find out that Hiibner did not want to risk his assured first place on board one, while Darga did not play, so as to give International Master Pfleger the chance to play against Portisch, and in the event of success (as Black!), to become a Grandmaster. All this we found out later, but during the match we saw that the German mas ters were playing very conscientiously. The young Hungarians, on the other hand, were evidently 'burned out' before this decisive encounter, and the result was 2-2. Our match was not as tense as might have been expected. Karpov and Korchnoi, playing White, quickly obtained winning positions, while Petrosian and I drew as Black. This is how our difficult victory at the Olympiad in Skopje was achieved. On my board I took first place with a score of 12 wins and 4 draws. After this I had to make a choice: whether to play in the USSR Zonal Championship. I already had the right to play in the Interzonal Tournament, but after the story of 1970 I felt obliged not to miss any Championship of the Country in which I had the chance to play. Thus I set off for Baku, where I was the lone 'Interzonaller' , and so was hors concours as regards the three places into the Interzonal. My 'Death ' and my New Life 407 I started off extremely sluggishly with six draws in a row and more than once my technique of realising an advantage misfired embarrassingly. At one point I had so lost confidence in myself, that the thought even entered my head: am I ca pable of winning even one game? Perhaps it was with the object of psychotherapy that I sat down in the foyer of the tournament hall to play lightning chess with lo cal first category players. Here I was successful, my peace of mind was restored, and this told immediately on my results. In the seventh round came a win, in the eighth also (this game against Zilber stein is given here), and so it went on. I succeeded in defeating Savon in an impor tant game, won amusingly against Bronstein, and with direct attacks mated Shamkovich (this game is also included) and Mukhin. I can also single out the following interesting ending: Tal - Zhidkov USSR Ch, Baku 1972 w 89 h6+ i.xh6 90 l:!g6+ 'iti>h7 91 'iti>f6 i.e3 92 'iti>f7 i.a7 93 l:!a6 i.b8 94 l:!a8 i.c7 95 l:!c8 i.f4 96 l:!c4 i.gS 97 l:!c3 1-0 As a result, several rounds before the finish (in the USSR Championship this occurs extremely rarely) I had assured myself of first place, and took quick draws in my last three games. In the middle of the tournament I had managed to score J Q lh points out of 1 2. The Championship ended, and the 'Russian troika' of Grandmasters - Balashov, Vasiukov and Tal - as the Dutch described us, arrived for the traditional tournament at Wijk aan Zee. I once again began modestly. True, in the first round I played and made the ac quaintance of the young Yugoslav Albin Planinc, as well as his colleague Ljubomir Ljubojevic, about whom I had heard many good things, and many sceptical ones. I found out for myself the unevenness of Planinc's play. To me he lost without
408 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
much of a fight, but then he crushed Donner and Najdorf in turn, literally within 20 moves. Meanwhile, I had reduced my pace, but since the results among the leading group were very even, some four rounds before the finish there were still eight or nine contestants within an interval of one point. I was pinning my hopes on the finish, but in the 1 2th round I noticed that my opponent, Hort, had a shocking cold, and I decided not to torment him for long. I won my last three games, the first as follows: w Tal - Ljubojevic Wijk aan Zee, 1973

However, we both played for a win, and I alone was successful. On the way home we stayed on for a short time in Holland, appearing before chess fans, and then a few days after my return there began a tournament which I consider to be one of my best during the last few years. It was the traditional Tallinn Tournament, the third in number. Its popularity had grown, and on this occasion the list of Soviet players was even more impressive. For the first time Spassky and Polugaevsky were play ing, as well as Keres, Bronstein, Tal, and other well-known players. From my My 'Death ' and my New Life initial wins I can pick out two examples of squeezes in more or less positional style. Timman - Tal Tal/inn 1973

JOURNALIST. This was the fifth successive tournament that you had gone through without losing. It was said in the press that you were approaching a hun dred games without defeat, and that you had become a new, more harmonious Tal. Was this really the case ? CHESS PLAYER. I had become not new, but more 'old' . Of course, giving mate to the enemy king had ceased to be an end in itself. But even at that time I did not play with the draw in hand, and, to be honest, the thing that least worried me was this unbeaten run. Besides, I had been in dubious positions, and it was not only I who was 'guilty' of the fact that I got away with them. Of the remaining games, I should like to mention the following, the result of which was of importance. Tal - Keres Tallinn, 1973 16 lbd5!?

The Interzonal Tournament was approaching, but prior to it I took part in two somewhat unusual events. The first, organised by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, was a tournament of Pioneers' Palaces. I had last played for my Palace in Riga ex actly 15 years previously, and here I was, once again amongst the lads. Each team was led by a former pupil, now Grandmaster: Smyslov, Spassky, Petrosian, Kar pov, Bronstein, myself . . . we gave simultaneous displays with clocks against the lads from the other teams, and then added together the points gained by each cap tain and his team. At the same time there was a separate event for the team captains. Each morning I would meet my lads, and talk to them about the day's 'exam iner', and I breathed for myself the air of chess youth. It was all splendid ! My 'Death ' and my New Life 41 1 In the captain's competition I came first, and here is one of the games, against the young Candidate Master Zaid.

It was not at all essential, and the doctors, as far as I understood, performed it 'just in case' . It was all but four years since I had been in hospital. I had grown unaccustomed to this 'pleasure' , and the acclimatisation was not alto gether successful. When, straight after the operation, I arrived for the team match, my unbeaten run came to an abrupt end. After first defeating Bronstein, I then lost twice to Balashov. In these games he played better than I did, but I paid little at tention to this warning. After all, I had never made much of this famous run, and when it came to an end I said jokingly: 'Fine ! Now I can start a new one. . .' But the new run began, unfortunately, somewhat later, after the Interzonal Tournament. It is difficult to decide exactly why it happened, but at the start of the Interzonal I played extremely badly. I can reproach myself only for the fact that I did not realise it immediately, although the very first game should have warned 4 1 2 Th e Life and Games of Mikhail Tal me. I was satisfied with the result, a draw as Black against Smejkal, but in the course of the game I missed a spectacular but by no means difficult combination, which would have given me somewhat the better chances. Then came two defeats at the hands ofplayers who could by no means be con sidered amongst the strongest: Torre and Estevez. I played unevenly and got into time-trouble, where my poor form immediately showed itself. Blunders followed one after another, and among the things I overlooked was a mate ! This poor start evidently affected my delicate kidney, and I fell ill. After miss ing two rounds I resumed play, and went into the game against Korchnoi with just one desire: to win. He guessed my state of mind, and around move ten offered a draw. I impulsively declined, and then began seeking an objective reason for do ing so. I began a sort of clearly 'left-sided' plan, got into an inferior position, and after mistakes by both sides in the time-scramble, adjourned the game in a diffi cult position. Next I lost to Hiibner in a game where I stood better at one point, but then ad journed several games with winning chances, and did not as yet lose my opti mism. I was nevertheless playing 'creakily', with difficulty, and this led to my amass ing 6( ! !) adjourned games: a difficult position against Korchnoi, and better posi tions, as I thought, against Kuzmin, Karpov and Tukmakov, as well as against Quinteros and Cuellar. If they were all to end up as I was planning, then all would not yet be lost in the tournament. But the resumption brought a serious correction, since it was impossible to analyse all the positions anything like thoroughly. We managed this only in the game against Tukmakov, finding a win at around three in the morning, and merely made a superficial acquaintance with the others. The resumption began with the game against Korchnoi, where a loss was more or less planned. Then came Kuzmin, and I suddenly saw that in my nocturnal analysis (at about 5 a.m.) I had made two moves in a row for myself( ! !) which, of course, one could not count on doing in an official situation. I should have agreed a draw, but I thought for about forty minutes, and then, just at the point when I was ready to conclude peace, Kotov, the chief controller came up and informed me that Tukmakov had resigned without playing on. The thought flashed through my mind that if I were to draw with Kuzmin now, I would then have to play on against Karpov, and my adjournment analysis had not gone as far as that position. So I decided to continue, and played on . . . to a hopeless position. Following this, my results had no significance for me. Even a successful sec ond half of the tournament, with 6112 out of 9, (the games played against Larsen and Gligoric during this time are given here) only enabled me to finish high enough to take the last prize. My 'Death ' and my New Life 4 1 3 Strange a s i t may seem, I was grieved b y the fact that m y best game, which was awarded a special prize, should have been against Larsen, with whom I sympa thised, and who I very much wanted to see amongst the winners. Thus all my ambitious plans had to be shelved for three years, and the depres sion which set in after the Interzonal told on my play in Bath, in the European Team Championship. This did not affect my results to any great extent, but after two wins came a series of four draws. The following combination was awarded a brilliancy prize. Botterill - Tal European Team Championship, Bath 1973 Here White sealed the move 42 .i.xf8 and Black was afforded a curious oppor tunity to force a win. Incidentally, nothing is gained by the straightforward 42 ... -tgl + 43 <ili>g3 'it'c3+ 44 <ifi>h4, when Black has to waste a tempo in capturing the white bishop, which is taking no part in the play. 42 ... .i.e3!

After 51 <ili>g4 i.d7+, White resigned (0-1) In the last round, in order to take first place on my board, I had to beat the Hun garian master Csom, but I did not manage to do this, although we played on much longer than all the other competitors. 4 14 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal Game 8 1 Tal - Najdorf USSR v Rest of the World, Belgrade 1970 Sicilian Defence Of course, in such a short match I had to win the third game at all costs. I could not afford to stake everything on the last game in which, in addition, I would be playing Black1 .

4 lDxd4 e6 5 lDc3 'Wic7 So far, just as in our first game. An analysis of Najdorf's games before the match showed that he does not pay a great deal of attention to theory, at least he does not make a scrupulous study of it. In the main, Najdorf, like myself, tends to check variations at the board, while the clock is ticking. In the 37th USSR Championship, White, as a rule, gained good posi tions using a rather old-fashioned sys tem involving the fianchetto of his light-squared bishop, a system which in recent years has gained a new lease of life. Although in theoretical reviews it is often stated that Black can obtain a comfortable game, it is usually White who gets a good game. I decided to adopt this system.
6 g3 a6
Of course, not as in the well-known game Fischer-Tal (Bled, 1961) in which Black absent-mindedly played 6 .. . lDf6 and after 7 lDdb5 straight away found himself in a difficult position. Now everyone knows about this. 7 i.g2 lbt'6

An important finesse. Until recently Black normally played 8 ... i.e7 and af ter 9 l:le 1 d6, possible is 10 lDxc6 bxc6 1 1 e5 dxe5 12 l:lxe5 O-O 13 .tf4 when 1 3 . . . .td6 fails to 14 l:lxe6 ! . The move order adopted by Najdorf denies White this possibility. 9 l:le1 i.d7 10 lDxc6 A move which makes sense only in conjunction with the following ma noeuvre. 10 ... bxc6 (D) On 1 0. . . i.xc6, 1 1 lDd5 is good for White. w After the 2nd round, Najdorf was leading Tal in their individual match by 1 1h-1h, having won in round 2- Editor's note. My 'Death ' and my New Ufe 415 11 lC!a4 e5 The first of a series of inaccuracies, which soon put Black in a difficult W position. Significantly stronger was 1 1 .. . .l:r.b8 1 2 c4 c5 so as to prevent the advance of the c-pawn. 12 c4 i.e7 Once againcarelesslyplayed. 1 2. .. c5 was essential, agreeing to a weakening of the d5-square as being the lesser evil.
13 c5 O-O
Black could have attempted to change the course of events by 13 ...d5 but this appears insufficient after 14 exd5 cxd5 1 5 lC!b6 (or 14. . . lC!xd5 15 ..txd5 exd5 16 lC!b6). 14 cxd6 i.xd6 15 i.g5 White has an undisputed positional advantage, since Black has no com pensation for his weaknesses on the queenside. However, assuming that the position would win itself, I con ducted the following stage of the game in routine fashion. This move is an in accuracy. As will soon become clear, 1 5 i.e3 was stronger. i.e7 16 'ii' c2 h6 17 i.e3 .l:r.ab8 18 .l:r.acl .l:r.fd8 (D) At this point I thought for a long time, being unable to decide which piece to move to c5 : the knight or the bishop. Both were tempting, but since White in the end decided to exchange off the dark-squared bishops, his next move was simply a waste of time. Stronger, of course, was 1 9 ..tc5 . I wanted to put the knight on c5, but I didn't like the fact that after 1 9 lC!c5 i.c8 20 h3 (here White has to reckon with the possibility of . . . lC!g4) there follows 20 ... 'ti'a5 2 1 b3 i.xc5 22 'ikxc5 'ii' xa2, although this position is also without doubt in White's favour. The unfortunate move in the game gives Black the chance of gaining counter play.
19 h3 lC!b7!
It becomes clear that the pawn on h3 will become an object of attack af ter . . . lC!g5 . The intended route for this knight is ... lC!g5, . . . lC!e6 and, if possi ble, ... lC!d4. 20 i.c5 White returns to the correct plan, but after a certain delay. Now on 20 lC!c5 there could have followed 20 .. . ..txc5 21 i.xc5 lC!g5. 20 ... i.e8 21 .l:r.ed1 White goes in for exchanges, as suming that a reduction in the number of fighting units will make the defence

It would have been considerably more difficult for White to demonstrate the signifi cance of his advantage after 24 .. . .:tb5 . On 25 lbxa6, 25 ... .:ta5 is strong, while after 25 .:tc 1 lbe6 26 lbxe6 'ii' xe6 27 b3 Black has at his disposal the useful rook manoeuvre 27 ... .:tb4 28 i.fl .:td4, when once again the pawn on h3 prevents White from switching over to a siege of the queenside pawns. White certainly keeps a positional advantage, but I think in this case Black's defen sive chances would have been signifi cantly better. 25 lbxe6 26 b3 27 'flc3 'ii' xe6 'fle7 At this point I considered my posi tion to be won, because on 27 ... 'flc7 (otherwise 28 'ii' aS decides the game) White transfers his bishop to fl , where it is excellently placed, but the Argen tinean Grandmaster finds an interest ing tactical resource. 27 ... .:tb4! (D) For the moment this prevents the bishop move. In the case of 28 a3 Black can continue 28 . . . .:td4, since White's a-pawn is then attacked. Once again White thought for a long time, but on this occasion succeeded in find ing the strongest continuation. 28 h4! The one drawback to the move 27 ... .:tb4 lies in the fact that it weakens the back rank. The direct attempt to exploit this weakening by 28 .:td3 a5 29 'fid2 a4 30 .:td8 does not produce anything tangible. With the move in the game White brings his bishop into play. This was the main variation which I considered: 28 ... aS 29 a3 .:tb8 (29 .. Jld4 is now bad because of 30 .:txd4 exd4 3 1 'flxa5) 30 'iWxaS .:txb3 3 1 .:td8, and now 3 l . . . <ittf8 32 i.h3 .:txa3 33 'iWb6 or 3 1 .. .<itth7 32 'iWa8 i.d7 33 h5 . 28 ••• f6 More stubborn was 28 .. .h5 and 29 ...g6, but passive defence is not Naj dorf's style. After the move in the game the light squares are weakened still further. 29 .:td3 White proceeds with the execution of the plan involving the doubling of heavy pieces on the d-file. Since the attempt to cut the Gordian knot by 29 ...c5 30 .:tdS c4 is met by the tactical My 'Death ' and my New Life 417 rejoinder 31 a3 ! l:txb3 32 1Wxc4, the pawn sacrifice made by Najdorf is forced. 29 �h7 30 i.h3 i.g6 31 l:td7 1i'f8 32 1i'xc6 l:txe4 33 1i'xa6 l:tel + 34 �h2 f5 (D) On 34 .. . i.e4 would have been met by 35 i.g2. The attempt to set the e pawn immediately in motion (34 . . .e4) meets a tactical refutation: 35 h5 i.xh5 36 'it'aS. 34 ...h5 was perhaps best. 35 l:td6 White could have played 35 1Wa5 l:te2 36 l:td2, but he sets a trap into which his opponent falls. 35 .•• i.h5 This is what I was hoping for.

This same position occurred be tween us in the USSR Peoples' Spar takiad in 1 967. On that occasion I played 1 0 .:te l , and after 1 0. . . i.f6 1 1 i.e4 lLlce7 Black obtained a reason able position, although all through the game he had to overcome certain diffi culties. 10 a3 The move in the game is in no way stronger than the approved 10 .:tel but it does have one advantage, that of novelty. Bagirov proves to be less pre pared for it. 10 . . . lbxc3 This is certainly playable. Also pos sible is 10 . . . lLlf6, transposing into a line of the Queen's Gambit. 11 bxc3 Jtf6 12 'ii' e2 On this move I spent a considerable time as it was essential to decide what plan to adopt. In place of the isolated d-pawn, an isolated pawn couple has appeared. One of the possible plans here is the advance of the central pawns. This can be done as follows: i.b2, 'ii' e2, rooks on dl and possibly c l , the bishop moves away from d3, and then, if feasible, c4 and d5 . How ever, Black also has time to develop his forces: . . .b6, . . . i.b7, . . . lLla5 , con trolling the d5-square, and possibly organising counterplay along the c file. Therefore White makes the non committal move 12 'ii' e2 which is My 'Death ' and my New Life 42 1 useful for the harmonious develop ment of the heavy artillery, and also for active operations on the kingside. In passing, White sets a little trap: if Black tries to free himself by 12 . . .e5 White is not limited to the win of a pawn by 1 3 dxe5 ltJxe5 14 ltJxe5 .i.xe5 15 .i.xh7+ <ifi>xh7 16 'ii' h5+ but can play the stronger 15 'ii' e4 g6 1 6 'ii' xe5 'ii' xd3 1 7 .i.h6, which wins. 12 . . . .i.d7 The immediate 1 2. . .b6 fails to 1 3 'ii' e4. However, the quiet 1 2. . .g 6 was worth considering. 13 .:tb1 b6 The fact that this advance of the b pawn has been provoked must be con sidered useful for White, since he insures himself against a possible counter-attack by Black involving the move . . . 'ii' a5 (the c3-pawn is attacked, and in some cases the queen can be transferred to the kingside). 14 .:tel In this position White thought for some time over the consequences of 14 h4. B ut what I didn't like was 14 . . . tiJe7 (capturing on h4 naturally fails to 15 'ii' e4) with the possible vari ation 1 5 ltJg5 tiJf5 ! Now 16 g4 is too dangerous in view of 16 . . . ltJxh4 1 7 ltJxh7 .i.c6 when i t i s Black who has a very strong attack. After the text-move, it is by no means easy for Black to solve the problem of how to develop his pieces. On 14 ... ltJe7, 15 ltJe5, transposing into positional lines, is possible (.i.d2, .:tbd1 etc.). 14 . . . .:te8 On 14 . . .e5 ! ? White, if he wants to fight for the initiative, is bound to cap ture the pawn: 15 dxe5 ltJxe5 1 6 ltJxe5 .i.xe5 17 .i.xh7+ (not 1 7 'ii' xe5 .:te8) 17 . . . <ifi>xh7 18 'ii' h5+ and 19 .:txe5 . However, it is a long way to a draw in this position, since the heavy pieces are still present, while the black king's shelter leaves much to be desired. Bagirov wishes to carry out the free ing pawn advance under more favour able circumstances, but now some rather amusing complications arise al most by force.
15 h4 (D)
Once again, of course, capturing the h-pawn is out of the question because of 16 'ii' e4. White plans to continue ltJg5 with an attack. Here 15 . . . ltJe7 ap pears less attractive because of 1 6 ltJe5 , and the weakening o f f7 tells: the thematic combination .i.xh7 + etc. is threatened. However, the move 15 h4 appears to be very double-edged, and therefore
422 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
Black's traditional decision - to an swer a flank diversion with a counter blow in the centre - is perfectly natural. 15 ... e5 This was the continuation to which White devoted most attention. Now he has to act very energetically, other wise Black will seize the initiative and his counter-attack can develop very quickly. 16 lbg5 exd4 Consistent and quite good, although to a certain extent forced. The ex change 1 6. .. i.xg5 would have given White a very strong attack after 1 7 i.xg5 followed by 1i'h5. In answer to 1 6. .. h6, 17 'i!Ve4 is good, since Black cannot accept the piece sacrifice: 1 7 ...hxg5 1 8 'i!Vh7+ 'iltf8 1 9 hxg5 i.xg5? 20 'i!Vh8+ 'ilte7 2 1 i.xg5+ 'iltd6 2 2 'ilkxg7, with a decisive attack. 1 6. . .g6 is refuted in interesting fashion: 1 7 i.c4 .l:tf8 1 8 1i'f3 ! , and on 1 8. . .exd4 there follows the surprising combination 1 9 ltJxf7 ! .l:txf7 20 i.h6! !, after which there is no satisfactory de fence against the threat of 2 1 i.xf7+ and 22 1i'd5+ (20 ... i.e8 21 .l:txe8+ and 22 'ilkxf6; 20 ... l2Je5 2 1 .l:txe5). 17 i.xh7+ 'ilif8 18 i.e4 The first impression is that the white pieces are somewhat 'hanging' , and that since White's queen i s un pleasantly pinned Black will have a number of active possibilities. How ever, White's threats on the kingside outweigh this circumstance. Thus, on 18 ... i.f5 there would follow 19 1i'h5 g6 20 1i'h7, and if 20 .. . i.g7, then 2 1 h5 ! i.xe4 2 2 h6 (this motif i s repeated in several variations). Therefore Bagirov decides to sim plify. 19 i.xg5 20 'it'hs i.xg5 f6 (D) If White wishes to fight for an ad vantage, he must continue to play aggressively. On 20 i.f4, 20 ... i.f5, forcing favourable simplification, now appears satisfactory. 20 . . • .l:txe4 This capture is essential. After 20 .. . fxg5 White could reply 2 1 hxg5 with many threats. 21 .l:txe4 'iltg8 What a pity ! After this feeble king move Black is simply the exchange down without any compensation. The remaining part of the game is reduced to the purely technical realisation of the material advantage (true, White tries to ensure that things are not lim ited to technique alone). My 'Death ' and my New Life 423 The capture of the white bishop was fraught with great dangers. After 2 l ...fxg5 22 hxg5 White's queen and rook take part in the attack, his second rook is ready to be included, and the pawn on g5 plays a far from minor role. Black should have accepted the challenge and played 2 1 . ..i.f5 !, which creates a highly interesting position, in which all White's pieces except his queen are either directly or indirectly attacked. White was anticipating this move, and had planned to continue 22 i.xf6 1i'xf6 23 'ikh8+ (if 23 llf4 Ci:Je7, and nothing is gained by 24 g4 i.xbl ! 25 llxf6+ gxf6 26 1i'h8+ Ci:Jg8, and Black has more than sufficient against the queen) 23 ... <J/;fl 24 1i'xa8 i.xe4 25 llel . Now the bishop is attacked, and it cannot move because of 26 'ike8 mate. Black has only one defence: 25 ... 'ii' xh4 (on 25 ... 'ifg6, 26 f3 d3 27 llxe4 'ikxe4 28 fxe4 d2 29 'ii' b7+ de cides) 26 cxd4. Now neither Black's knight nor his bishop can move, and White threatens quietly to move his rook to e3, threatening a decisive at tack on the bishop. Thus: 26 ... 'ii' g4 ! 27 f3 i.xf3 28 'ii' e8+ <J/;f6 29 'ii' f8+ <J/;g6 30 'ii' xf3 'ii' xf3 (30 ... 'ii' xd4+ is also possible) 3 1 gxf3 Ci:Jxd4 (D). I examined this ending when con sidering my 20th move, and came to the conclusion that after 32 lle7 White has certain winning chances. How ever, I did not analyse it in any more detail either during the game or after wards, but in any case this was Black's only chance.

The master from Omsk gives the impression of being a player with a solid positional style of play who is constant in his tastes. As far as I know, he normally chooses the Sicilian De fence against 1 e4, so here I stopped to think. My opponent had made his first moves quickly - perhaps he knows my game with Kolarov (European Team Championship, 1 970), where there oc curred 3 lDc3 d5 4 o!L\f3 i.g7 5 h3, and has prepared something. Then other associations began to arise. Prior to the USSR Champion ship, Zilberstein had been playing in the International Tournament at Kislo vodsk, and among the participants was Gurgenidze, a fervent supporter of the systems with ...c6 and ... g6. The players in the Championship at B aku were not familiar with the games from the Kislovodsk Tournament. Perhaps there was a trap in store for me in this My 'Death ' and my New Life 447 variation? This is why I decided to in vite my opponent to go into a position on King's Indian lines, since (as was also established during preparation) Zilberstein does not play this opening as Black.

Now White can, if he wishes, trans pose by 4 exd5 cxd5 5 tLic3 into the Panov Variation of the Caro-Kann De fence, but I had no desire to do this - once again associations: in B aku dur ing 1961 I lost as White in this vari ation against Bronstein.

5 tLic3 tLih6! Only five moves, and this is the first time I have seen this position ! For all the growth of modern opening theory there are still many gaps in it. The game now develops along un usual lines. My first thought was to re fute the knight move by 6 i.f4 with the threat of 7 'i!Vd2, but I did not like the fact that Black would transfer his knight to f7 after 6 ...f6, and would be gin a siege of e5, which had appeared to be the most strongly supported ob ject in White's position. Black need not fear the possible loss of a pawn (6 .. .f6 7 exf6 exf6 8 cxd5 cxd5 9 'ii' b3 O-O) since he is well ahead of his op ponent in development. 6 h4 The normal reaction to the flank de velopment of the bishop. Black should perhaps have continued his plan by 6 . . .f6. After 7 h5 g5 8 f4 g4 a position would have arisen with good points for both sides. I consider that, since the e5-square is supported, White has the better position, but perhaps this is an over-optimistic assessment. 6 i.e6 7 lDh3 dxc4 8 lDf4 i.d5

For 'invigora tion' this game was once again played through before the start of the 1 6th round here in Baku. There were some very clear analogies. In both cases Shamkovich had Black. Prior to this game Tal was again undefeated. Also, arithmetically the number 16 in some way resembles 8.

(D) On this occasion Black solves cor rectly that eternal problem of how best to place the rooks. The queen's rook stands on the d-file, preventing 1 9 e4 followed by the capture of the knight, since in this case the rook ending will be hopeless for White. As, in all prob ability, White will be sooner or later forced to exchange on d4, Black's king's rook will come into play along the then open e-file. 19 �g1 e5 20 lDxd4 After 20 lDd2 the drawbacks to White's 1 3th move could have been exposed by 20 ...g5. 21 'ii' c4 22 'ii' a4 exd4 'ii' h5 My 'Death ' and my New Life 459 White is over-optimistic.

The leading Yugoslav Grandmaster is distinguished, I would say, by the ' seasonal constancy' of his play with Black. About ten years ago he only played the system with 9 . . . llJa5 1 0 j.c2 c 5 1 1 d4 liJd7. Then came the turn of the Smyslov system 9 ... h6, to which Gligoric remained faithful for a long time, despite occasional setbacks. Since 1 972, he, like many others, has been adopting the Breyer system. The Leningrad Tournament was, if I am not mistaken, the fourth event in a row in which Gligoric played this variation (true, in his own interpretation).

Gligoric closely studies his pre vious games, and constantly perfects the systems he adopts. This was espe cially brought home to me during our match in 1 968, in which he succeeded in obtaining a comfortable game as Black. The present game is no excep tion. The Yugoslav grandmaster im proves on the game Keres-Gligoric (San Antonio, 1 972), in which after 14 . . .g6 15 j.h6 ! i.f8 1 6 'ii' d2 White created strong pressure. For the mo ment White's queen's bishop has no convenient post ( 1 5 j.g5 is answered by the simple 1 5 . . .h6), while in some cases Black is ready to play . . .d5 . Hence the decision to block the centre. 15 dS g6

I rejected the immediate 17 a4 because of 17 . . .bxa4 1 8 bxa4 llJc4. This was all the more reason for not playing the bishop to e3, where it makes the opponent a pre sent of a tempo. In making this last My 'Death ' and my New Life 461 move, White was planning to advance instead his b-pawn, but then thought better of it. After the stronger 1 7 'ii' e2, I consider that White would have the better chances. 17 • • • �c8 18 a4 A confession that the previous move was a mistake. 18 bxa4 19 bxa4 lDc4 20 �g5 �g7 Avoiding the tactical possibility 20 .. .h6 2 1 �xf6 'ii' xf6 22 aS ! when the knight is threatened. 21 'ii' e2 In making this move, White did not yet know whether he would be aggres sively inclined (cf. the note to Black's 22nd move). 21 • • • lL!a5 22 'ii' d2 Now White likes the position of his bishop on g5. 22 • . . .l:.b8 Black could, of course, have played 22 .. . lL!c4 after which White would have a choice: either to offer a draw by 23 'ii' e2 or else to retreat the queen to c 1 .

White wrote down on his scoresheet the (not exactly diffi cult) move 36 lL!xc5 which finishes the game instantly, and after which my opponent was indeed going to resign, since the a-pawn reaches the eighth rank by force.

The 'shadow of Leningrad' continued to dog me, and although I managed to get through the traditional Chigorin Memorial Tournament in Sochi without defeat, and take first place there, I could be satisfied with my play only very relatively. Several times I obtained attacking positions (against Andersson, for instance, and against Hennings), but then for some reason I began to hurry things, and thus threw away my advantage. The same happened in the following game, which was widely reported in the press, although I did manage to win it.

This is hardly justified. Of course, the consequence of my failure in the In terzonal was still having its effect, but even so I played better in the Champion ship in Moscow than I had in Sochi. It was more likely that I was affected by the cold that I caught at the very start of the event, which led to my games from the second and third rounds being postponed. By the way, for my relatively quick re covery, I am completely indebted to my wife, who was partially filling the role of my second. Recent Events 465 Let us return to the Championship. I recall my game with Polugaevsky, which was an exact reflection of the fourth game of my match with Larsen. After cor rectly sacrificing a pawn, I thought for 50 minutes over a tempting piece sacrifice, each minute becoming more and more convinced that it would not work. When everything was quite clear, I suddenly became angry with myself for wasting such a lot of time and ... sacrificed! With a few moves, which I had foreseen quite clearly, Polugaevsky repulsed the attack, and it was all over. My subsequent play was rather nervy. There were wins, while good opportuni ties were lost, but it was the following game that was the last straw.

Before the new year began I first played six games in a Match-Tournament be tween the Russian Federation and Latvian teams, and then accepted with pleasure an invitation to play in an International Tournament in Dubna, a small town near Moscow, and a scientific centre of world renown. The audience there, consisting of physicists from various countries, was very congenial, as was the composition of the tournament. I was late for the first round, and I entered the hall just as Kholmov was giving Recent Events 467 mate to Rukavina. It was at the start when I succeeded in playing my most in teresting games (of course, I wasn't to know that it was in Dubna that my new run of unbeaten games was beginning, about which less has been written, but which lasted longer than the first).

JOURNALIST. Incidentally, what general qualities should a second have ? CHESS PLAYER. In the first place, he should be faithful to his protege. He must know his protege well, be able to tell his condition 'from the side' , and be able to suggest when is the right time to play more reservedly, and when to give full rein to instinct. The second may be a like-minded chess thinker, or a chess an tipode, it is not of great importance. On the other hand, it is most essential that he should not be overawed by the prestige of his protege. Of course, it is important that the second should carefully follow current chess literature, since there is no point in having to invent everything anew in the process of preparation. With re gard to whether or not the second is a theorist, this is not all that important. I very much dislike 'seasonal' seconds: today he assists grandmaster A, tomor row grandmaster B against grandmaster A, etc. This is unpleasant, and, I would say, not altogether honest. It was not without certain adventures that Kuzmin and I reached Hastings, since we were forced by the weather to wait for more than 24 hours at Moscow airport. We eventually arrived only a few hours before the start of a round, not the first, but the second ! After such a flight we were unable to play at full strength, and both our games were pretty quickly agreed drawn. In general, my play in Hastings was af fected by a depression which set in after my game with the Cuban master G. Gar cia. In this game the slight threat of an attack on my opponent's king persuaded him to give up the exchange, just so as to go into an ending. After a further few moves his position became hopeless, and I thought to myself: 'How good that it has all worked out so quickly; I may be in time to go to the cinema' . Especially since, due to our late arrival, Kuzmin and I had to play eight games on successive days, and we were glad of every rest hour we could find. Recent Events Then suddenly, having relaxed, I made a bad blunder, and the game continued for the full five hours, and ended in a draw. This affected my play, as did another unexpected consequence of our late arri val. When we arrived, all the decent rooms in the hotel had been taken, and we were accommodated somewhere in the attic in a completely unheated room. Both of us - first I, then Kuzmin - caught a cold and fell ill. Even my wife could tell this from my voice when she phoned me on New Year's Eve. I told her that it was cold in our room, and the reaction was unexpected. Without saying a word about it to me she phoned Moscow and asked our Chess Federation to help me, to which the head of the Federation jokingly advised her to send to Hastings some firewood or coal. Whatever the cause, my depression or the 'energy crisis' , in the first eight rounds I scored only one win and seven draws, and was going steadily along in 7th-8th place. Then, by winning three games in a row, I joined the leading group, and when Kuzmin, having caught cold in turn, lost two games, the battle for first place intensified. Of the games from this spurt, the ones against Stean and Hartston turned out quite well, but it was the following ending that afforded me the most pleasure: Suttles - Tal Hastings, 1973 43 ••• i.e7! 44 h4 g6 45 lDfeS gS 46 hxgS hxgS 47 fxgS i.xgS 48 b4 i.xd3+ 49 lDxd3 i.e7 SO bS i.d6 51 aS i.xg3 52 lDb4+ 'it>cS 53 lDc6 a6 54 'it>d3 i.f2 SS lDa7 axbS 56 a6 b4 57 lDbS 'it>b6 58 a7 'it>b7 59 lDd6+ 'it>xa7 60 lDxfS b3 61 lDd6 'it>b6 62 lDc4+ 'it>bS 0-1 Before the last round there was quite a large group in contention for first place.

agreed a draw with the young Englishman Miles, and thus became one of the four joint winners. I do not want to return to this theme once again, but I spent the first half of 197 4 in 'hibernation' ; I played only two games in a friendly match between the Sports Societies 'Daugava' and 'Avantgarde' - I think you will agree that this is too mea gre a ration for a player who very much loves playing. True, in one of these games I tried out an idea which was to bring me three points in 1974. By contrast, the remainder of the year was not just crowded, but overloaded with events. In May there came preparations for the Olympiad in Nice, and once again we had seven grandmasters contending for the six places in the team. On this occa sion my inclusion was not in doubt, and the 'superfluous seventh' turned out to be Lev Polugaevsky, a recent Candidate. In Nice, Kuzmin, who had also been mainly inactive from January to June, and I played in most of the games in the preliminary group, in order to 'warm up' . This was very necessary, since in my first few games I made some very amusing mistakes, which in one case led to a draw with an opponent whose class of play was not all that high. I felt that I was running into form only after the game given here with Miag masuren. After I had sacrificed a rook the spectators gathered round, and this was immediately noticed by the leader of our delegation, V. D. Baturinsky, who had just come into the hall. Being short in stature, he was unable to see over the heads of the others, but when I stood up from the table, I confidentially informed him that I was a rook down. 'Blundered?' our chief asked indignantly, clearly ready to remind me of the in structions given before the game to play quietly and carefully. 'Sacrificed!' 'Well, only mind you play carefully' {!) Baturinsky recapitulated somewhat perplexedly. This Olympiad proved to be as easy for us as the previous one had been dif ficult. The team played harmoniously and accurately, and we did not suffer a sin gle defeat, not only in the matches, but also in the individual games, and before the last round we had assured ourselves of first place. From my games I can pick out the following one (see diagram on following page): 18 .te4! l:tf7 19 ife2 .trs 20 .tf2 b5 21 tlJdS bxc4 22 lDb6 l:td8 23 �d5! .txd5 24 l:txd5 ila3 25 l:txc4 lDe7 26 ifd2! lDxdS 27 lDxdS The black queen is now trapped! 27 ... �h6 28 ifxh6 ifxa2 29 �h4 ifaS 30 h3 1-0 Recent Events Tal - Partos Nice Olympiad, 1974 47 1 Two weeks after the Olympiad I set off with my wife to a tournament in Lub lin.

much wanted to draw, and even asked me before the game not to 'torment' him, if we should reach an equal ending. However, when he offered a draw after I had been thinking seriously for 30 minutes, I was irritated, instantly declined it, and straight away ... left a pawn en prise. We concluded the game in a terrible time scramble, in which my opponent gave up recording the game round about move 25, and I some five moves later. In the course of this rapid play I could have forced a �aw, but I overlooked this, and instead left a piece en prise. Adamski made his move, and I saw that it was time to resign. All the same I made one more move, and my opponent's flag fell, but there was a controller standing by, and he said nothing, so I assumed that the 40 moves must have been made. Holding out my hand in a sign of resignation, I suddenly heard the voice of my wife, speaking in Latvian: 'Have you made up some new rules or something? After all, he's lost on time! ' I replied in Russian that there was a controller for that, but she held up the fingers of both hands: that was how my wife had been counting the moves. We reconstructed the score, and it turned out that Black had indeed not man aged to make his 40th move. My opponent took my scoresheet, rewrote it, and showed that he had made ... 42 moves. It turned out that Adamski had simply added a repetition of moves, which was quite ridiculous: the controller confirmed that there had been no repetition. Then a decision was made by a commission of appeal, which, on the basis of the 'eye-witness evidence' of a whole series of participants, confirmed the loss on time. Much was written about this, even in the pages of the Polish non-chess press. Adamski complained a great deal, but the end of this episode amused me. The game appeared in The Chess Player with notes by Adamski, and the total number of moves 42, so I maintain the right to make an equally bare-faced falsification of the truth, and am 'preparing' to have published one of my wins from a simultaneous display as a game Tal-Adamski. In the end, this will be just as much the 'truth' . In order to conclude the tale of the Lublin Tournament, I should also say that there was no real battle for first place, but my wife, unlike her husband, is very jealous as regards the position of Tal in the FIDE rating list, and after consulta tions with the chief controller and some calculations, she revealed that in order to maintain my rating I required not just first place, but 12112 points out of the 15 pos sible. When, partly giving in to her insistence, I won in the 1 3th round, she guilt ily informed me that she had apparently made a mistake, and that 12 points would suffice. I 'promised' her that I would lose one of my games, but all the same fin ished with two quick draws. I hardly had time to return to Riga before I set off for the Team Championship Recent Events 473 of the Soviet Union with the 'Daugava' team. We were one of the outsiders, and everyone thought that we would be one of the teams to drop out of the Premier League. Almost all our opponents had ratings much superior to ours. Who could have guessed that, apart from the teams roughly equal to us, 'Mol dova' and 'Zenit' , the other team to drop out of the Premier League would be 'Lokomotiv' , headed by Grandmasters such as Spassky, Polugaevsky and Pla tonov? But that is what happened. We played concertedly and energetically and I succeeded in defeating Petrosian with an attack, and had a nice little finish against Bronstein.

The result was that I took first place on the top board: among those also left be hind were Spassky, Smyslov, Geller. .. Within a few days I flew to East Germany to a tournament in Halle. I was already in Berlin before I was told that the second Soviet participant would be Grandmaster Savon, replacing Kuzmin, who was unwell. This tourna ment went much more calmly for me than the one in Lublin. I drew several games in the first few rounds, in a couple of which I was the defending side, while my win over Liebert did not make me particularly happy because it was so unconvincing. Then, in the fifth round, I played a game which did not strengthen my tourna ment position, but - and this is much more important - it significantly improved my frame of mind. This was a game in which I introduced an innovation, accord ing to my opponent (a specialist in the Scheveningen Variation) who had publish ed an article on the move 6 g4 not long before the tournament. Either the innovation was a success, or else my opponent reacted incorrectly to it, but by move 15 White's position appeared overwhelming. Then, although I was per fectly well aware that it was an unnecessary move, and not the best, I sacrificed a bishop so as to cheer myself up.

Recent Events 475 Instead of an extra half point, I thus obtained an excellent supply of optimism, and between the 6th and 1 3th rounds drew only two games while winning six. These included an important win over Knaak, which is given here. This led to me taking the lead, and two draws at the finish were sufficient to give me first place. The tournament was the main, but by no means the only event, in a chess fes tival dedicated to the Jubilee of the German Democratic Republic. Thus I gave several simultaneous displays (alone, unfortunately; Savon had to hurry on to Odessa). I particularly recall my last two appearances on a holiday in Berlin, where I succeeded in playing the following game. Tal - N.N. Berlin simul, 1975 Sicilian Defence

Grandmaster Kholmov could not go to the tournament in Novi
476 The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal
Sad, and it turned out that no one except me could replace him at the last minute. I would have declined to play in any other event - the surfeit of play was begin ning to tell to some extent - but Yugoslavia was a special case. After spending just one day at home, I once again set out for the airport. Even so, I arrived only in time for the start of the third round, having found out on the way that my colleagues in the tournament, Grandmasters Forintos and Radulov, had so far scored 0 out of 4 ! Going straight from the 'plane to the tour nament hall, I quickly shared with Radulov the first Grandmaster point. On the following day, my excessively wild play against Kirov led to the ending of my long unbeaten run, although for a greater part of the game my opponent was not thinking in terms of more than a draw. Then came a draw in one of the postponed games (the leaders in the meantime had set a furious pace and were far ahead) and I began to wonder whether on this occasion my favourable Yugoslav sky was covered by clouds. However, in the middle of the tournament I managed to increase my pace, and I scored 5112 points out of 6 at the finish, and I could as sure myself of first place by winning my adjourned game from the last round against Buljovcic. At first glance it appeared that the adjourned position was a dead draw, but even before the adjournment I had seen a curious manoeuvre which led by force to a won queen ending. But I was unable to actually play it. Buljovcic lives some 30 miles from Novi Sad, and when I arrived for the resumption, instead of my op ponent, there was a telegram awaiting me. Buljovcic apologised, and said that be cause of a motoring accident, in which, fortunately, only the car had suffered, he would be unable to come. I suggested that the position be adjudicated, and the variation which I demonstrated appeared convincing enough to my main rival in the battle for first place, Grandmaster Forintos. After the tournament I spent some two more weeks in Yugoslavia. First I gave some displays, and then came the traditional match between Soviet and Yugoslav players, played on the Scheveningen System 1 with six players to each team. This is usually a match between the two countries, but at first it was decided to call it Moscow-Belgrade. Since there were only two Muscovites in our team, we appro priated an incomprehensible name: Combined Team of USSR Clubs. We could not simply call ourselves the USSR Team, since most of our leading Grandmas ters were not playing. To be honest, I was intending to have something of a rest during this match, and was counting on there being a reserve player, but there turned out not to be Every member of each team plays against every member of the opposing team - Editor's note Recent Events 477 one, and I had to play in every round. I won one game, against I vkov, who com mitted a 70-year-old theoretical mistake, and the remainder were not particularly fighting draws. We nevertheless won the match. It is not at all surprising that for the main event of the year - the USSR Cham pionship Premier League - I arrived extremely tired. Here there were many young players, playing energetically and as equals with more experienced Grand masters. As usual I lost in the first round to Polugaevsky, but then managed to win sev eral games, including one against Dvoretsky, which won the best game prize, and which is given here. With a successful run in the middle of the tournament - during which I played the game against Taimanov given here - I took the lead. True, the first alarm sig nal was also heard: in my game with Vaganian, in a completely won position, I carelessly fell into a cunningly prepared trap. JOURNALIST. It often happens that you are leading, or are trying to catch a leader. Which is easier? CHESS PLAYER. The latter, of course, since there is an additional stimulus. Besides, for me it is more pleasant to be trying to catch up. If they are chasing me, then the thing that happened in this USSR Championship in Leningrad is what frequently occurs. In the penultimate round I played Beliavsky, who was performing very suc cessfully, and who, together with Vaganian, was a point behind me. Simple logic suggested that as White I should play quietly for a draw, and that's all. A some what prejudiced attitude to youth forced me to fight not for 'my' gold medal, but 'for the honour' of my chess generation. As a result I overlooked one move by my opponent, and from being in my favour, the position became level, then worse, and after a further mistake - lost. There were now two of us in front, and level is how Beliavsky and I finished up. Once again a year ended, and once again there began a lengthy pause. True, I studied chess, but not altogether in my usual way: at the request of Anatoly Kar pov I spent some time with him, for we believed that the Fischer-Karpov match would take place ... At the beginning of April the position regarding the World Championship be came clear, and I set off to the tournament in Las Palmas. A very interesting and unusual resort, but... Not only the old hands of the tournament, who were taking part for the fourth time, but even the local residents could not remember such cold

weather at that time of the year. The mean April temperature in Las Palmas is 20°C, whereas for us it was around 14 °C. There was no question of any bathing or long walks. About half of the participants in the tournament were contenders for the top places - all were Grandmasters of excellent repute, and with a high Elo coeffi cient. The other half could objectively only hope for isolated sensational success, and that is how it worked out. The game with Mecking gave me a poor start to the tournament. 1\vice I com mitted inaccuracies, then equalised the position, but not long before the first time control 'found' almost the only losing move. The furious start by Grandmaster Ljubojevic settled the question of first place several rounds before the finish. Just when I gained some illusory hopes of catch ing him, I overlooked a mate against Olafsson, again on the back rank, just as in the Alekhine Memorial Tournament. From my games I can pick out the attack against Pomar, and the following en counter, which was awarded a special prize for the most interesting game of the tournament.

Game 97 Tal - Miagmasuren Nice Olympiad, 1974 English Opening When football interferes with work ... The seventh round of the Olympiad Preliminaries. The USSR team is con fidently leading in its group. Their next opponent is the Mongolian team. One of the federations - football or chess - has made a hash of things. 'Is it really necessary for the Chess Olympiad and the Football World Cup to be played at the same time?', gloomily joked football supporters from various countries, who had gath ered in Nice on chess matters. There were various degrees of distraction. Thus the leader of the Brazilian play ers, H. Mecking, preferred to spend his playing time by the television screen, and his team was awarded a loss by default. Others, fortunately, were more restrained. Other things being equal they were not against concluding their game from the seventh round a little earlier, since on this day the Football World Cup opened with the match be tween Brazil and Yugoslavia. 1 c4 The Mongolian is a player with a strong leaning towards tactics. In an swer to 1 e4 he adopts various sharp systems of the Ruy Lopez. Therefore, as in our first encounter (Tallinn 197 1), I avoided the early advance of my king's pawn. 1 ... 2 lDc3 e6 i.b4 This is in no way inferior to various other moves, although it is played much more rarely. 3 lDf3 d5 4 d4 It is possible that Black's previous move was not the most accurate since White, by continuing 4 'iWb3, could have gained the advantage of the two bishops. What I didn't like, however, was the fact that after 4 . . . i.xc3 5 1Wxc3 lDf6 White's advantage is of a very academic nature. I wanted to reach a more lively position. Besides, I considered that since my opponent during the first three moves had 'got away' from theory, he would hardly want to return to normal lines. That is indeed what happened. 4 ... lDe7 Once again a perfectly possible continuation. True, from e7 the knight does not take part in the struggle for the e4-square, but, on the other hand, any possible pin along the g5-d8 di agonal is rendered practically harm less. 5 e3 Whatever my opponent has done, I am playing White against the Nimzo Indian Defence! 5 ... c5 6 i.d3 dxc4 Also possible was the immediate 6 . ..

c!Llbc6 cxd4 Here one might disagree with Black. It was hardly good to open the e-file for White and it soon becomes clear that Black's kingside is not very securely defended. In my opinion, 9 . . . i.xc3 1 0 bxc3 'i!Bc7 deserved preference, s o as after 1 1 e4 to begin a siege of the pawn centre on the lines of certain variations of the Griinfeld Defence or the Queen's Gambit. It would also be interesting to examine the conse quences of 9 ... i.a5. 10 exd4 11 bxc3 i.xc3 b6 Here again 1 1 ...'fi'c7 was more cau tious. Black's intended fianchetto de velopment of his queen's bishop entails a weakening of the e6-square. 12 'fi'd3 i.b7 13 1Ie1 Already at this moment I wanted to take decisive action.

It is possible that this move is also not bad (against the continuation which occurred in the game it would have won very quickly), but I had dif ferent plans: in the first place, to try to exploit the undefended state of h7, and in the second to begin a central pawn advance in some cases. In making my 14th move I mainly considered the Black defences 14 . . . .!Llf5 and 14 ... 'fi'd6, which seemed to me to be the strong est.

At the last moment, how ever, I noticed that Black could play 1 7. . . tL.lg6 ! 1 8 'iVxg6 'iVf6 and White is forced to exchange queens. True, his position remains better than good after 1 9 'i!i'xf6+ gxf6 20 .txh6+ 9i;e7 2 1 d5, but even so, an ending ...

Game 99 Tal - Dvoretsky USSR Championship, Leningrad 1974 King's Indian Defence M. Dvoretsky is a player who is hard to beat.

In this game, however, he allowed his opponent too much. 1 d4 As I have recently come to realise, this is also not a bad move ... 1 • . • lt:\r6

It has long been known that such an opponent is dou bly dangerous (this is shown by the following rounds, where Bohm scored two successive wins), since his series is always liable to come to an end. 1 d4 The Dutch master has only recently appeared on the international scene, so that there are few of his games in chess publications.

In reply to 1 1 O-O Black would have continued 1 1 ...ttld7 followed by 1 2. . . ttle5; then the absence of the white knight from f3 would be in his favour. How is he to play after the text? If, for example, 1 1 . ..ttlf6, then 1 2 'ii' d2 ttlbd7 1 3 f4 leads to a complicated game, in which White's chances appear preferable. Of interest is the exchange sacrifice 1 1 . .. l:txe3 1 2 fxe3 ttlf6 ( 1 2. .. 'ifh4+ 1 3 �d2 ttlf6 14 'ii' e1 is weaker) with purely positional compensation, but it was difficult to refrain from the fol lowing move ! 11 ... 'ili'h4 12 �d2 (D) White had other, more active ways of meeting the threat of 12 .. Jhe3. Both 12 ttle4 and 1 2 'it'd2 would have won material. In the first case, after 12 ttle4 i.xg4 1 3 i.g5 i.xe2 14 'it'xe2 'it'xg5 ! 15 ttlxg5 l:txe2+ 1 6 i.xe2 ttlf4, Black would have excellent play for the sac rificed exchange, since the bishops are not only of different colour, but also of different strength.

The resulting irrational position is not un favourable for Black, since his queen's knight comes quickly and effectively into play. The move made by Bohm is without doubt the strongest. 12 ttlf6 13 'it'g1 Black had reckoned mainly on the move 1 3 ttlb5, after which the ex change sacrifice 1 3 ..

The decision to preserve the dark-squared bishop in volves not only giving up a pawn (which is significant), but also (and this is very important) a loss of time. In addition, Black had simply over looked a tactical possibility on move 22. 18 lbxd6 'ii' aS+ 19 �d1 l:.d8 If White was now forced to capture on c8, Black's position would be clearly preferable.
