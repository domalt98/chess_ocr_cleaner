Foreword by Garry Kasparov Ask any chess fan to give a short list of his favourite games and it is sure to in clude games by Alekhine. Perhaps Reti-Alekhine, from Baden-Baden 1925, or Bogoljubow-Alekhine, Hastings 1922. These two games are generally reckoned to be amongst the most brilliant on record. But Alekhine's reputation was not built solely on the wonderful quality of his games, nor, simply, on his longevity as World Champion (he held the title from 1927-35 and again from 1937-46, when he died as World Champion, sadly destitute, in Portugal). It was also Alekhine's outstanding diligence as an annotator of his own masterpieces which has helped to establish his place in the history of chess. No serious student of chess can af ford to ignore Alekhine's notes to his games, and the most important of these are assembled here in this volume. Alekhine's games and writings exerted a great influence on me from a very early age. I wished to emulate the dynamic style of the first, great, Russian-born champion, who wrested the crown from Capablanca in 1927. I fell in love with the rich complexity of his ideas at the chessboard. Alekhine's attacks came sud denly, like destructive thunderstorms that erupted from a clear sky. Max Euwe , who briefly took the world title from Alekhine between 1935 and 1937, wrote of him: Alekhine is a poet, who creates a work of art out of something which would hardly inspire another man to send a picture postcard. The wilder and more in volved a position the more beautiful the conception he can evolve. A similar view was expressed by Dr. Emanuel Lasker: Alekhine loves making experiments ... delighted to think that his own skill and his own imagination are the cause of all that what happens on the board. This style of Alekhine's was what I admired and wanted to develop in my own games. I had a natural feeling for it. I hope readers of this book will feel similarly inspired by Alekhine's masterpieces. Garry Kasparov Baku 1989 Introduction by John Nunn I first came across Alekhine's collection of games when I was about 11 years old. Up to that point, I had been quite successful in junior events and I had the feeling that chess wasn't really a very difficult game. After playing over all 220 games in the first two volumes (covering the periods 1905-23 and 1924-37), I thought "How can anyone play like this? It's just impossible to see so much during a game". I was particularly struck by his game against Rubinstein from Semmer ing, 1926 (game 42 in this book), and the move IS. ..ltJx12! in particular. It seemed incredible that there might be a stronger move than the obvious recapture on c3, but after having checked the analysis several times, I had to admit that taking on 12 was a forced win. But how did this move even enter Alekhine's head? Today, finding this combination doesn't seem so totally impossible as it did then, but it remains an enormously impressive game. In my opinion Alekhine's special gen ius lay in his ability to discover unexpected twists in positions where a lesser player would have made an automatic, conventional move. Other examples of such twists, in addition to the IS ... .!bxf2 mentioned above, are the move 19 'fIc7! in game 31 and the idea of IS dxe5 and 19 'i'f4! in game 47. In view of my early acquaintance with Alekhine 's books, I was excited when the idea arose of producing an algebraic edition of the cream of Alekhine's games. This gradually became a major project. Apart from the conversion to alge braic, I have corrected a surprisingly large number of notational errors in the original books, rearranged the games in chronological order, edited the text and checked the analysis. I have not commented on minor flaws in the analysis, but major errors and omissions are pointed out in footnotes (except for game lIS, where the new analysis was so extensive that it had to be embedded in the text). These terse footnotes should be studied carefully, as in many cases they indicate fundamental reassessments of famous games, for example Reti-Alekhine, Baden-Baden 1925 and Alekhine-Bogoljubow, Nottingham 1936. Some readers may find it surprising that so many major analytical errors exist in Alekhine's notes-after having worked on this book, my respect for Alekhine's games has increased, but I have come to recognise that his annotations are influenced by the "I won the game, so I must have been winning all the way through" syndrome (which, it must be said, afflicts many annotators). A few additional points: games 1-109 were originally annotated by Alekhine himself-the remaining games were annotated by C.H.O'D. Alexander. All foot notes are mine, except where they are marked (GB), in which case they were writ ten by Graham Burgess. Alekhine uses the symbols '±' and '=F' to mean 'clear advantage for White' and 'clear advantage for Black' respectively. The games in this book represent the distillation of the life work of one of the greatest chess geniuses of all time. As I discovered myself, it is possible to learn a great deal from them.

This move, suggested in 1 908 by the Danish master MlIlller, is in my opinion much better than its reputa tion as, up to the present, it has in no way been refuted and the few games in which it has been adopted rather tend to militate in its favour. 6 lDxe5 White could also play 6 c3 to which the best reply is 6 ...J.a7 as in a game Yates-Alekhine (Hastings 1 922), which continued as follows: 7 d4 (interesting would be 7 Ite1 lDg4!

Here 4 ... 'i!t'b6 would be premature on account of S lC!c3. 5 lC!c3 Now, however, this move is out of place. The usual line of play, S c3 followed by 6 �d3, is certainly bet- ter. 5 ... �g4 Equally satisfactory would be S ... a6 followed by 6 ...�g4. 6 �b5 e6

This move gives White the chance to weaken the enemy position on both wings.

How ever, 9 ...�cS would have been more prudent. 10 a4! Very strong, as Black has no time to continue 10 ... cxd4 followed by 1 1 ...�b4, because of 1 1 as. There fore he is compelled to yield the bS square to his opponent. 10 ... as 1 1 h4 h5 This move is relatively better than 1 1 . ..h6, as it forces White to make an immediate decision on the kingside. 12 lDxg6 fxg6 (D) 13 gxh5 The variation 1 3 gslC!gS 14 �d3 �f7 I S lth3 looks stronger than it really is, as Black can resist the at tack by bringing his gS-knight to e7 and then fS. The text move makes things easy for Black. His g7-pawn, it is true, is weakened, but, on the other hand, he obtains excellent pros pects in the centre. 13 • • • 14 "it'e2 gxh5

The king's position on the queen side will be quite safe as the white bishop can easily be eliminated.

A very pretty trap. 1 5 ••• i.d6 Black discovers in time the oppo nent's subtle plan: 15 ...cxd4 16 exd4 lbxd4 1 7 lhd4 1Wxd4 1 8 1Wxe6+ lbd7 19 "it'c6+ ! ! bxc6 20 i.a6#. The text move eliminates all danger. 16 i.xd6 l1xd6 17 i.d3 White has insufficiently weighed the consequences of this move; in particular, he has not realised that the knight will have no time to settle down at b5, and consequently Black will obtain an important advantage.

The beginning of a strong attack against f7 , weakened as it is by the Alekhine - Duras 15 premature exchange ofBlack's light squared bishop. Furthermore, it is interesting to observe how impor tant the open a-file is for White's at tack. 16 • • • 'ilfe7 Besides this move and the sequel it implies, Black had a further choice of two lines of play: 1) 16 . . .dxe5 17 'ilfxe5 'ilfd6 1 8 'ilfxd6 cxd6 1 9 :t fe 1 with advantage to White. 2) 16 ... :te8 17 e6! fxe6 18 .i.xe6+ �f8 (or 1 8. ..�h8 19 lDg5) 1 9 b4 ! .i.xb4 ( 1 9. ...i.b6 20 :tfe1) 20 lDxd4 :tb6 ! 2 1 'ilff3 ! .i.c3 22 lDc6 ! :txc6 23 'ilfxc6 .i.xa1 24 :txa1 , and White has the better game as the e6-bishop is invulnerable.

This temporary pawn sacrifice will allow the black pieces to break through into the hostile camp, and to co-operate in a direct attack against White's king, an attack which will become irresistible thanks to the passed c-pawn, which fixes the white pieces far away on the other wing. 34 bxc4 35 'iWd2 36 c;ilg3 l:ta3 'ti'c5 After 36 c;ilg2 i.xc4 Black would be threatening to capture the knight with check. 37 'iWc1 38 l:txc3 39 l:iJe3 i.xc4 :c3! dxc3 Directed against the threatened ...

3 'iVxd4 It is quite evident that such dis placements of the queen at an early stage in the opening are not likely to reap any advantage. However, Black is compelled to play with pre cision, in order to give his opponent no time to start an attack against the kingside or even in the centre. For, no doubt, the white queen installed at g3 (via e3) would exercise pres sure on Black's kings ide if he even tually castles on that side. 3 ..• lDc6 4 'iVe3 J.e7 Black could also have played 4 ... lDf6 for the following variation is mere bluff and eventually turns to Black's advantage: S eS lDg4 611e4 dS! 7 exd6+ J.e6 8 J.a6 (or 8 dxc7 'iWdl + ! ) 8�.'iWxd6 9 J.xb7 'iWb4+ ! 10 'iWxb4 lDxb4.

This advance, which at first sight appears somewhat risky in view of the position of White's d I-rook, will on the contrary allow Black to ex tract the maximum return from his advanced development. 7 . .. d6 would result in almost a closed game and White would find time to complete his neglected development.

Black's advantage is now evident. 10 ito J.e6 The sacrifice initiated by this move is both full of promise and de void of risk, for B lack will have an equivalent in material for his queen.

attack. The chief point in these at tacks lies in the fact that none of them was prepared in the immediate vicinity ofits objective. On the con trary, all the preliminary manoeuvres which tended to divert the enemy pieces from the defence of their king took place in the centre or on the op posite wing. Furthermore, it is inter esting to note that the deciding move, a real hammer-blow, is played by a bishop and always involves sac rificial variations.

Game 19 Steiner - Alekhine Budapest 1921 Alekhine Defence
1 e4 lbr6
This new defence was played for the first time by myself in a consult ation game at Zurich (August 1 92 1 ), and was introduced into master prac tice shortly afterwards at the Buda pest Tournament in September of the same year. Its correctness now seems perfectly established. One of the most searching proofs of its vitality lies in the fact that Dr. Emanuel Lasker, ex-champion of the world, although openly opposed to this defence, successfully adopted it against Maroczy at the New York Tournament (March-April 1924), af ter having tried in vain to demolish it. In the course of an encounter be tween Dr. Lasker and Dr. Tarrasch, Black obtained a clearly superior, if not a winning, gamein the following way: 1 e4 lbf6 2 e5 lbd5 3 d4 d6 4 c4 lbb6 5 f4 dxe5 6 fxe5 lbc6 7 i.e3 Steiner - Alekhine 51 i.f5 8 lbc3 e6 9 lbf3 i.b4 10 i.d3 i.g4 ! 1 1 i.e2 i.xf3 12 gxf3 'iVh4+ 13 i.t2 'iVf4!. 2 e5 In a game Bogoljubow-Alekhine (Karlsbad 1 923), White tried 2 lbc3 upon which Black replied by 2 ...d5 (2 .. . e5, transposing into the Vienna Game, is also to be considered), leading to the continuation 3 e5 lbfd7! 4 d4 c5 ! 5 i.b5 lbc6 6 lbf3 and now Black could have reached a very advantageous variation of the French Defence by 6 ... e6 in place of the risky line 6 ...a6 7 i.xc6 bxc6 8 e6! . 2 ... lbd5 3 d4 In a game Slimisch-Alekhine from the same tournament, White continued by 3 lbc3 e6 ! 4 lbxd5 exd5 5 d4 d6 6 lbf3 lbc6 7 i.e2 i.e7 8 i.f4 O-O 9 O-O f6 10 exf6 i.xf6 and Black had a slightly superior game. 3 ... d6 4 i.g5 After this move, whose object is to hinder the advance of the hostile e-pawn, White loses his advantage, because of the difficulties he will ex perience in defending his own e pawn. The most dangerous line of play for Black is undoubtedly 4 c4 followed by 5 f4. 4 5 dxe5 6 i.bS dxe5 lbc6 i.f5! Black is not concerned about the possibility of doubled pawns. If 7 i.xc6+, the possession of his two bishops, the open b-file and his better

development would constitute ex cellent compensation for the slight weakness on c6. 7 ffi lLlb4! The win of a pawn by this last move required a minute examination of all its consequences. 8 lLla3 'ifxdl + 9 l:.xdl!

The point of the manoeuvre initi ated on the 7th move. Nevertheless, the material advantage of a pawn, which Black has succeeded in secur ing, seems very difficult to utilise, because of his poor development. 14 lLlxc6 �xc6 15 �xc6 bxc6 16 l:.xc6 l:.d5 17 �f4 e6 18 'Be2 (D) How ought Black to strengthen his position now? For example, here are two plausible suggestions which give no satisfactory result against a correct defence: 1 ) 1 8. . .g6 1 9 l:.gc l l:.d7 20 �e3 'Bb7 2 1 l:.6c3 �g7 22 l:.b3+ 'Ba8 23 �xa7 ! �xe5 24 l:.c4 with the better game for White. 2) 1 8. ..g5 19 l:.xg5 ! �h6 20 l:.g4 �xf4 2 1 l:.xf4 l:.xe5+ 22 'Bf1 'Bb7 23 l:.c3, and Black has no chance of winning. 18 . . • �c5! . . .whereas this move, which at first sight does not seem better than the above-mentioned moves, is the only one enabling Black to maintain his advantage. 19 b4! Therightreply, permitting White to force a favourable exchange. It is clear that Black's g-pawn cannot be taken at once, owing to ... 'Bb7. 19 �xb4 20 l:.xg7 l:.d7 21 �e3 Black is once again faced with a very difficult problem. How is he to secure the defence of his weak pawns on both wings? His lone bishop is insufficient for this task, since if it be brought to b6 via a5, thereby adequately protecting his queenside, White would transfer his attack to the opposite wing and would eventually win at least a pawn by l:.c4 followed by l:.h4. On the other hand, if Black withdraws his bishop to f8, in order to secure the protection of his kingside, White would take the queenside as his ob jective and would obtain a strong at tack by J:tg4 followed by J:ta4. Black must therefore avoid com mitting his bishop, in order to be able to utilise it for the defence of which ever wing is threatened. His follow ing moves are dictated by the above considerations. 2 1 2 2 J:tc4

3 c4 a6
A move of Janowski's, which has been quite frequently played by Ru binstein in recent tournaments, but without appreciable success. Neces sary in the greater number of the variations of the Queen's Gambit Accepted, 3 ...a6 is here merely a loss of time, and in addition creates weaknesses on the queenside when White continues by 4 cxd5 or even 4 c5, as in the present game. 4 c5 4 cxd5 is quite sufficient to secure a slight superiority, as was shown by Johner-Rubinstein and Kostic-Ru binstein from the Teplitz-SchOnau Tournament of 1 922, among others. The former game continued 4 cxd5 exd5 5 lbc3 lbf6 6 .i.g5 .i.e7 7 e3 O-O 8 .i.d3 b6 (a little better, but also insufficient to equalise the game, was 8 ... lbbd7 9 'ifc2 !) 9 .i.xf6! .i.xf6 1 0 'ifc2 h6, and Johner could ha ve obtained a very strong attack against Black's weakened kingside by 1 1 h4, followed by 1 2 O-O-O and g4. In his game against Kostic, Ru binstein tried 5 ... .i.e7 in place of 5 ... lb f6, and the continuation was 6 .i.f4 lbf6 7 e3 O-O 8 .i.d3 lbbd7 9 O-O l:1e8 1 0 l:1c 1 b6, after which White could have obtained a distinctly su perior game by 1 1 h3 (in order to conserve his dark-squared bishop against the threat of exchange by ... lbh5). In the present game, the first that I played against Rubinstein after a seven-year interval, I voluntarily adopted a new line of play in order to avoid the variations resulting from 4 cxd5 (because I rightly thought them very familiar to Rubinstein), resol v ing that I would do or die! 4 ••• lbc6 Wishing to play 5 ...e5, which White must oppose by every means at his disposal. 5 .i.f4 0.ge7 6 0.c3 0.g6 7 .i.e3!

I learnt, some time after the game ended, that Rubin stein, in Collijn's Uirobok, ami ned 7 e3, a variation leading to equality. 7 ... b6 Black, giving up hope of breaking through in the centre, at least elimi nates the cramping white c-pawn, and reckons to secure an advantage in development, by reason of the un usual position of White's bishop at e3. 8 cxb6 cxb6 9 h4! The only means of weakening the dark squares of the enemy's posi tion, and thus obtaining a future for his e3-bishop. 9 ... .i.d6 If 9 ...h5 then 10 .i.g5 f6 1 1 t!i' c2 followed by .i.d2, e3, a3 and .i.d3, with the better game for White.

An extraordinary position after the 1 3th move of a Queen's Gambit! During the first thirteen moves White has played his c-pawn thrice, his h-pawn thrice and his dark squared bishop four times, after which he has obtained a position in sight of a win, if not actually a win ning one. It is especially with re spect to the original opening of this game that people often speak of a 'hyper-modern technique' , a 'neo romantic school' , etc. The question is, in reality, much simpler. Black has given himself over to several eccentricities in the opening (3 ... a6; 5 ...
0.ge7; 6 . . .
0.g6)
which, without the reaction of his opponent (for example, 7 e3 instead of 7 .i.e3 or 9 g3 instead of 9 h4) would in the end have given him a good game. It is, therefore, as a ne cessity, and not with a preconceived
56 The Hague 1921
idea, that I decided upon the advance of the h-pawn, preventing Black from securing an advantage in the centre. But, as a rule, in the opening stages of a game such eccentricities are in accordance neither with my temperament nor my style, as the reader can see from the perusal of this book. 14 e3 15 .td3 b5 .td7 ':'c8 Black dreams only of the possibil ity of an immediate attack by White (commencing by tDg5 or tDe5 fol lowed by 'i!i'f3), which he hopes to thwart by a demonstration on the queenside ( ... 'i!i'a5, ... .tb4). With this idea, the preparatory move 15 ... .:.c8 would have been very useful. But as White is not com pelled to bestir himself as long as the opponent does not trouble him seriously, it would have been better for Black to play at once 15 ... tDa5, followed by 1 6. .. .tb4, and thus force White, by this semblance of a counter-attack, to take some defen sive measures. 16 a4! (D) Whereas it is now White who seizes the initiative on the queenside, forcing Black to block this part of the board, and thereby allowing White to post his c3-knight in a dominating position without loss of time. 16 b4 17 tDe2 'i!i'b6 18 tDc1! Preventing 1 8. ..b3. 18 l:tc7 19 tDb3 tDaS Too late! 20 tDc5!

The usual move is 3 ...e6 transpos ing into the Tarrasch Defence. After the exchange of pawns in the centre we reach a symmetrical position in which the advantage of the move And i f 25 .i.xd8 .i.xe2 26 .i.e? then 26 ... .i.xf3. always secures for White a slight po sitional advantage. If in this game he obtains a better result, that is solely due to the fact that his oppo nent allows himself to go in for an innovation- especially risky when his development is already retarded. 4 cxd5 1Dr6 5 li:)xd4 a6 Black wished to avoid the vari ation 5 ... li:)xd5 6 e4 li:)f6 7 �b5+ �d7 8 e5 ! �xb5 9 li:)xb5 'ili'xdl + 10 �xdl li:)d5 l l li:) lc3, which is to the advantage of White, as mentioned in the latest edition of Collijn's Lim bok.

' Afterthe text move, in contrast, the advance of Black's e pawn would give White the opportu nity of exercising strong pressure on the e-file. Black therefore resigns himself to the development of his bishop on g7, but equally without success. 9 ••• g6 10 li:)O! This gain of time allows White to prevent 1O ...�g7, followed by 1 1...O-O. By keeping Black's king in the centre, White's attack will be facilitated, thanks to his superior development. The opening of this
64 Pistyan 1922
game offers some analogies with the game against Rubinstein, played at The Hague (game 20). In the one, as in the other, the advantage won re sults from repeated movements of the same pieces (here the first eleven moves contain four displacements of the queen and three of the king's knight). But the possibility of similar ma noeuvres in the opening phase is solely attributable, I must reiterate, to the fact that the opponent has adopted faulty tactics, which must from the first be refuted by an ener getic demonstration. It is clear, on the contrary, that in face of correct development, similar anomalous treatment would be disastrous. It cannot therefore be any question of a 'Modern System' , but just simply of exploiting in a rational manner the opponent's mistakes. I cannot conceive why there is such an ardent desire to discover in a game of chess anything more subtle than it has to offer, for I am of opin ion that the real beauty which it pos sesses should be more than sufficient for all possible demands. 'iIc7 1 1 'il c3 l:tg8 12 �e3 b6 13 lDbd2 1 3 b4 would be an error ofjudge ment, because Black would then save his piece by 1 3. . .�g7 14 lDd4 'tWa7 ! .

A risky defence, which up to the present I have adopted only very infrequently in serious games. But in the present game I had positively to play for a win in order to make sure of first prize, whereas a draw was sufficient for my opponent to secure third prize, and hence I found myself forced to run some risks which were, after all, justified by the result

7 l:c1 c6 8 'iVc2 This move, which was very fash ionable since the Ostend Tourna ments of 1907 and which had almost completely superseded the old move (8 ..td3), will soon become totally obsolete, since every international tournament brings a fresh and suffi cient line of play for Black.

S ...c5 usually results in the isola tion of White's d-pawn. but on the other hand it allows White to under take a rather dangerous attack on the kingside. This variation admits of a complicated and very difficult game, with nearly equal chances. Concerning S ...dxc4, see game 25 (Alekhine-Yates). 9 a4 As this identical variation had yielded me a win the previous eve ning against Griinfeld, who played here 9 a3 (see Game 29), I wished to avoid fighting against the defence which I considered then, and still consider now, the best. This is the reason which decided me in favour of 9 a4, a move that Rubinstein, my present adversary, had employed against me, without conspicuous success, in a similar position in the Hastings Tournament of 1 922. That game continued as follows: S ...h6 9 i.h4 a6 10 a4 c5 1 1 i.d3 cxd4 1 2 exd4 dxc4 13 i.xc4 lDb6 1 4 i.a2 lDbd5 15 i.bl lDb4 16 'Be2 �.d7 1 7 O-O i.c6 I S lUdl l:tcS 1 9 lDe5 lDfdS 20 i.g3 i.g5 2 1 f4 ! i.h4 22 lDxc6 l:txc6 23 lDxd5 l:txcl 24 l:txc I lDxd5 25 'Be4 g6 26 i.xh4 'Bxh4 27 f5? 'Bg5 ! and Black won easily. It is manifest that the move 9 a4 cannot pretend to yield any advan tage, since Black can answer it by 9 . . . lDe4 ! with greater force than on the preceding move, White's queen side being now slightly weak. Rubinstein, however, seeks to take advantage of the weakness by a dif ferent method. Alekhine - Rubinstein 83 9 ••• l:te8 If 9 ...h6 White replies 1 0 i.f4 with advantage. 10 i.d3 1 1 i.xc4 dxc4 lDd5 (D) We now realise the idea con ceived by Black-a fusion of the new defensive system ( . .. a6) with the old system ( ...dxc4 and ... lDd5), in the hope of thus profiting by the weakening of the square b4 created by the advance of White's a-pawn. w 12 i.f4! White in his tum deviates from the beaten track. The text move is here much stronger than in the analogous position where I played it against Selezniev at Pistyan 1 922 (see Game 15) for the following rea sons: 1 ) Mter 12 ... lDxf4 1 3 exf4 the position of the black rook at eS is less favourable than on fS, where it hinders a subsequent attack on the point f7. 2) The manoeuvre ... lDb6-d5 which, in the game cited, allowed Black to undertake a counter-attack, loses its sting because White's queen
84 Karlsbad 1923
is at c2 and he can therefore gain a tempo by .td3, threatening the h pawn. In addition the move a4, unfa vourable in other cases, here affords him the possibility of .ta2 and .tb1 , a manoeuvre analogous t o the GrUn feld variation (9 a3), but still more effective here because of the opening of the e-file. We can therefore anticipate, after the ensuing exchange, a slight posi tional advantage for White. 12 ... lbxf4 13 exf4 c5 This move, which goes against the general principle of not opening up fresh lines to a better-developed opponent, is dictated by the wish to eliminate White's troublesome pawn on f4.

have been reduced to vanishing point.

The problem of winning still needs to be solved, for at present the doubling and even the trebling of the white pieces on the h-file would lead to nothing. The rather compli cated plan which White will strive to pursue, which must, of course, be modified in accordance with Black's manoeuvres, can be summarised as follows: 1 st phase - Bringing the king to the centre where, after the later ex change of queens and rooks on the h-file, it will threaten a rapid pene tration of the hostile camp via as. These tactics will logically induce a corresponding displacement of the blackking, themore plausible since its presence in the centre will con solidate the weak points c6 and e6. 2nd phase - Compelling Black's pieces to remove themselves in suc cession from the kingside by tactical threats aimed either at the king him self or at the enemy pawns (39th and 4 1 st moves). The prospect of the oc cupation of the square e5 by a white knight, thereby immobilising the black knight at d7, increases still more the difficulty of concerted ac tion by the black pieces, which is al ready difficult enough on account of the limited space available to them 3rd phase - Finally, at an oppor tune moment, namely, when Black's pieces are at their greatest distance from the kingside, doubling rooks on the h-file. The rooks, after the forced exchange of queens and bishops, will penetrate into the heart of the hostile position. As we shall see by the sequel, the methodical execution of this strate gic plan requires no less than twenty eight moves! 33 • • • tbg6 34 tbd3 Not at once 34 'it>e2 on account of

This is no way detracts from Alekhine's combination, since even perfect defence by Maroczy would have left Alekhine with some advantage; in the game itself, as so often happens, a long period of defence takes its toll and Maroczy blunders, allowing mate in three.

The only way-and an absolutely safe one-to play 'for the win' . 15 lbdl exeS (D) w The endgame position reached is by no means as easy to conduct-es pecially for the first player-as it appears. Black's plan-which will prove a complete success-is di vided into the following parts: 1) Exchange one pair of rooks. 2) Bring the king to e6 where he will be protected from a frontal at tack by the e-pawn and can prevent the entrance of the remaining white rook at d7. 3) By operating with the rook on the open g-file and advancing the h pawn, force the opening of the h file. 4) After this the white king-and eventually also the bishop-will be kept busy in order to prevent the in trusion of the black rook at hI or h2. 5) In the meantime Black, by ad vancing his a- and b-pawns, will sooner or later succeed in opening one file on the queenside. 6) As, at that moment, the white king will still be on the other wing, White will not have sufficient force to prevent the final intrusion of the black rook on his first or second rank. Granted that if White had, from the beginning, realised that there ac tually existed a danger of losing this endgame, he probably would, by ex tremely careful defence, have saved it. But as it happened, Black played with a definite plan, and White only with the conviction that the game must be a draw. And the result was a very instructive series of typical stratagems much more useful for in experienced players than so-called 'brilliancies' .

Certainly not an error but a proof that White has not as yet grasped the spirit of the position. Otherwise he would not have been anxious to 'force' the exchange of one pair of rooks which, as mentioned, is quite welcome to the opponent. 16 nfd8 17 �n A more aggressive line starting by 1 7 g4 would perhaps be advisable.

About the same thing, if not in quite such typical form, occurred in the 5th and 22nd games of our first match. But also, strangely enough, my other match opponent, Dr. Euwe, has the same peculiar tendency to exchange queens at inappropriate moments: compare, for instance, the 7th and 24th games of the 1935 match, the second match game and especially the third exhibition game of 1 937. I am mentioning these coinci dences by no means in order to put undue blame on my opponents, but merely to remind the average ama teur how particularly difficult the question of an opportune queen ex change is, and how much attention this question deserves. If even the leading exponents of our game are often inclined to assess incorrectly their endgame chances, what, really, is to be expected from the 'di mi nores'? 25 gxf4 w 'ifxf4+ I:.dd8!

It becomes more and more diffi cult to find original combinations in chess, especially in the earlier stages of the game. This, I think, is one of them: although the bishop move has been made in analogous positions (for instance, with White's pawn on a2 and his bishop on c 1 ) it has not, to my knowledge, ever before been combined with the idea of trapping the rook after Axa3 'itxb2.

Black's chief trumps which, with cor play, must guarantee the win, are the permanent insecurity of White's king and the unprotected po sition of the bishop, whose efforts to find a safe square are bound to fail.

Even if it can be con vincingly proved (which has not been done) that the bishop develop ment at g4 is not good for Black, the text move will still be used by those who prefer to avoid the variations starting with White's 'i'a4+. 4 a4 White has no reason to prevent ...bS, since the variation 4 e3 bS S a4 .i.b7 6 axbS axbS 7 lIxaS i.xaS S b3 is to his advantage.

However, by playing the immediate 15 'Bxb2 White can prevent this defence and obtain adequate play for the pawn. 17 c4!

Actually, even in this case Black's position would have been precarious enough, espe cially in view of White's threat 23 lLlxe6, which would win promptly after 22 ... l:c7, 22 ... lLld6, or 22 ...�e8.

3 lbfJ lbr6 4 'it'a4+ This queen manoeuvre is more ef fective here than in the Catalan sys tem (after g3) since White may, in some variations, wish to develop his bishop on the diagonal f l -a6. But also after the more usual 4 e3 White's prospects are considered by far the more promising, and this fact is due not to a particular variation, but to the modern method of treating the Queen's Gambit Accepted with White: to advance the centre pawns at the first opportunity, even at the cost of heavy sacrifices. This char acteristic idea can be seen in the games Reshevsky-Vidmar (Notting ham 1 936), Euwe-Alekhine (5th match-game, 1 937), and, even ear lier, Opocensky-Rubinstein (Mari enbad 1 925). In my own recent practice the following example, il lustrating this new tendency of White, is, I believe, noteworthy: Alekhine-Letelier, Montevideo 1938: 4 e3 e6 5 iLxc4 c5 6 O-O a6 7 'it'e2 b5 8 iLb3 iLb7 9 lbc3 lbbd7 10 l:tdl iLe7 1 1 eA.! b4 12 e5 bxc3 1 3 exffi lbxf6 14 iLa4+ c;PfS 15 dxc5 "a5 1 6 c 6 'it'xa4 17 cxb7 l:tb8 1 8 bxc3 l:txb7 19 lbe5 'it'e4 20 'it'xa6 l:c7 2 1 iLa3 ! g6 22 iLxe7+ l:xe7 23 'tWd6 �g7 24 'it'xe7 'tWxe5 25 'tWb4 1 -0.

In conjunction with ... h6, this flank development has often been rather successfully adopted by Dr. Tartakower. White has several plau sible ways of meeting it, not one being a convincing refutation. In the present game, I decided to allow Black to fulfil his plan of mobilisa tion or-to be more precise-the first part of it consisting of ... .i.b7, ... lbbd7, ... c5-and to try to take ad vantage only from one detail of the position, namely the fact that the black queen is deprived of the diago nal d8-a5 and will not easily find a good square.

The full value of the system adopted by White could only be esti mated if Black had built up the clas sical defensive position by playing 1 3. ..c5 followed by ... 'i'c7. The in consequential text move-prob ably motivated by an exaggerated fear of White's lDh4-leaves White a free hand both in the centre and on the queenside. The first victim of this strategy will be the a5-knight, which will be at once removed to a purely passive square and become merely a target for White's combina tive play. 14 b4 15 lDa3 16 i.b3 lDb7 c6 lDb6 White threatened eventually c4, which would force Black to ex change his b-pawn, thus weakening still further the queenside. The move in the text, which prevents that dan ger at the cost of a tempo, is there fore not to be blamed. 17 as lbd7 18 �e3 In making this last preparatory move for the forthcoming queenside pawn advance, White had to take into account the counter-attack 1 8. ..d5 ! ? 1 9 exd5 c5, which he intended to meet by 20 d6 ! �xd6 2 1 �d5, or

In my opinion this move gives White more chances of obtaining an opening advantage, for the following reasons: 1) The dangers of the continu ation 3 ...dxc4 in conjunction with 4 ...e5 are clearly shown in the pre sent game; 2) the Winawer Counter-attack 3 ... e5 can be met in a simple and ef fective manner by 4 cxd5 cxd5 5 e4 ! and if 5 ...dxe4, 6 �b5+ ±; 3) in answer to 3 ... lLlf6 4 e3 g6 I suggest 5 f3, which after 5 ... �g7 6 e4 dxe4 7 fxe4 e5 ! 8 d5 O-O 9 lLlf3 leads to a rather complicated posi tion, still positionally favourable to White. 3 • • • dxc4 4 e4! It is almost incredible that this quite natural move has not been con sidered by the so-called theoreti cians. White now obtains a clear advantage in development, no matter what B lack replies. 4 • • • e5 The alternative is 4 ...b5 5 a4 e5 (or 5 ...b4 6 lLla2 lLlf6 7 e5 lLld5 8 �xc4 ±) 6 axb5 exd4 7 �xc4! �b4 ! 8 :a4 a5 9 bxa6, and White will emerge a pawn to the good. 5 �xc4 This sacrificial combination is certainly very tempting and, espe cially over the board, extremely dif ficult to refute; but it is by no means the necessary consequence of White's previous move, which has a value absolutely independent of the correctness of the piece sacrifice. The positional exploitation of White's advantage in space consists of 5 lLlf3 ! exd4 6 'fixd4 'fixd4 7 lLlxd4 after which Black would only get into further trouble by trying to protect the gambit-pawn; for in stance, 7 ... b5 8 a4 b4 9 llXii �a6 1 0 �e3 lLlf6 1 1 f3 followed by':c 1 and �xc4 with a clear positional advan tage. 5 . . . exd4 Fatal would be 5 ...

As a matter of fact, the offer could be accepted since Black would have at his disposal a more ef fective line than the one I had ana lysed when proposing it. My 'chief' variation was the following: 6 ...dxc3 7 �xf7+ <j;e7 8 'fib3 lLlf6 9 e5 lLle4 1 0 O-O!

Such sacrifices are always correct in over-the-board play ! ' Moreover, even an Alekhine will not normally analyse exhaustively such a sacri fice-he will examine as many vari ations as he can in the limited time available, and for the rest trust that, if his general judgement of the posi tion is correct, he will be able to find a reply to an unexpected counter stroke) .

In all symmetrical openings, the danger for Black lies in the fact that he can not indefinitely continue to imitate White (cf. his 7th move in this game) and is liable to find himself confronted with a position in which White makes a strong aggressive move and Black is forced to make a very humble reply, with consequent disadvantage: examples of this can be found not only in the Slav but in the Four Knights' , Petroff's Defence and the English Opening.

If 1 3 d5, a position similar to that i n the 1 1 h3 variation arises, but better for Black since after 1 1 h3 he has to play . . . liJc6 to force d5 after which he returns to as, thus losing time. 13 dxe5 14 liJe3 j"e6 (D) It seems that Alexander is actually referring to the Hastings encounter-see game 98.

15 1'r'e2 W'e8 The idea of this move is that after an eventual tLld5 by White and an ex change on that square the rook will be ready to protect the e-pawn.

Then 1 6 tLlg5 tLlb7 17 tLlxe6 fxe6 1 8 .i.d2 tLlc5 gives rise to an equal game, while 17 tLld5 .i.xd5 ! 1 8 exd5 .i.d6 is also satisfac- tory for Black. 16 tLlg5 c4

This would, however, be better than the text as it would leave B lack with fewer weaknesses. The poin t of b4 is that whether Black exchanges or not, the pressure on White's queenside is completely eliminated. 18 tLlxe6 19 axb3 20 cxb4! fxe6 b4 Not the obvious 20 c4, in reply to which Black can play ... tLlb7-c5 blockading the passed pawn, with a good game. 20 • • • .i.xb4 21 .i.d2 .i.xd2 If 2 1 . . .tLlc6 22 .i.xb4 tLlxb4, then 23 tLlc4 ! tLlxc2 24 'ti'xc2 followed by 'ti'c3 and l:ta5.

It would be much less serious for B lack if he had not played 17 . . .cxb3, as he would then only have had the weakness on the e file and White would not have c4 for his knightl . 22 1'r'xd2 23 1'r'c3 24 .i.d3 25 b4 26 lDc4 tLlc6 1\Yb6 tLld4 l:tec8 l:tab8 If the queen moves, then 27 l:ta5 and the e-pawn will fall without compensation. 27 l:ta5 28 1'r'xb4 29 tLlxe5 1'r'xb4 l:txb4 tLlb3 (D) It seems as if Black has extricated himself rather neatly-if the rook retreats then 30. .. tLlc5, and White can only win the a-pawn at the cost of his e-pawn. 30 l:txa6!!

1 e4 e5
2 f4 This game was played in the last -round of the tournament. Alekhine having 6112/9, Keres 6/9, and the other competitors being out of the running. Keres therefore had to go all-out for a win, which explains his somewhat rash play. 2 exf4 3 tiJf3 tiJf6

5 'i'e2? This, in conjunction with White's 7th move, is a new idea in this vari ation-but not a very good one. Since the normal line 5 d4 d5. 6 c4 tiJc6 7 cxd5 'i'xd5 8 tiJc3 �b4 gives Black a satisfactory position with a pawn more, Keres decides to delay B lack's ...d5 and to prepare for queenside castling. B lack, however, simply continues with his develop ment, is able to play ...d5 as soon as he really needs to, and White's un natural queen move rebounds. 5 �e7

7 g4!? A corollary of 5 'Be2, intending to permit the development of the bishops and give White open lines for a kingside attack. If White does not play this move, he will have to move his queen again to develop the fl-bishop, and the pawn on f4 will exert a cramping effect on his whole game. The disadvantage of opening files in this way, i.e. by pawn sacri fices that do not disturb the oppo nent's pawn structure, is that one then has no pawns left with which to storm the enemy king: for this rea son Alekhine finds comparatively little difficulty in defending himself. 7 ... fxg3

2 c4 e6
3 lbf3 lN6 This famous game has been analysed many times, for example by Alekhine himself, Fine (Chess Marches On!, 1 945), Pachman (Pachman's Decisive Games, 1975) and Dvoretsky and Yusupov (Secrets o/ Chess Tactics, 1 992). As the conclusions of modem analyses are totally different to those expressed by Alexander, I shall add some extra commentary at critical points. As this extra analysis is fairly extensive, it is embedded in the text.
300 Prague 1942
4 g3 5 'iWa4+ dxe4 iDbd7 In Junge-Alekhine, Munich 1943, Alekhine played ... i.d7-c6; the more usual plan, adopted here by Junge, of ... iDd7, aims at an early advance of the queenside pawns combined with . . .i.b7. The two lines are of about equal merit, and either should give equality with careful play by Black. 6 i.g2 a6 7 'iWxe4 b5 8 'iWe6 The immediate 'iWc2 is more com mon, but White has in view a con tinuation for which he wishes to drive the rook off the a-file. 8 ... :b8 8 . . . IZ.a7 is slightly better as the rook has little future on the b-file, and from a7 it can later play across to c7 or d7 if necessary. However, the text move is perfectly sound.
9 O-O i.b7
10 'iWe2 e5 11 a4! A far-sighted positional pawn sacrifice which B lack should de cline by 1 1 . ..b4, thereby maintain ing equality. After accepting the sacrifice, the best Black can hope for is to avoid disaster if he defends with absolute accuracy. 1 1 i.xf3 12 i.xf3 exd4 13 axb5 axb5 14 :dl 'iWb6 Not 14 ... i.cS IS i.f4 eS ( I S ...

(D) Overlooking White's forthcom ing sacrifice. Black's best line was 1 6. .. i.e7 1 7 e3 dxe3 1 8 i.xe3 'iWe6 when White has adequate posi tional compensation for his pawn, but nothing immediately decisive. w 17 iDxe5 i.xe5 (D) If 17 ...

[IN: Neither of these lines is es pecially convincing, because once queens are exchanged White has no advantage-Black's active rooks and pressure against b2 easily bal ance White's two bishops. After 1 8 . . . �d8, Alekhine gave 1 9 'iWfS 'iWxc6 20 'iWxeS with two lines: 1 ) 20 ... i.d6 21 :xd4 :b6 22 i.f4 iDe8 23 IZ.a7 �c8 24 'iWfS+ �b8, and now the strongest line is 2S :xd6 ! iDxd6 26 :d7 ±. 2) 20 ... iDd7 21 :xd4 :c8 22 i.d2 b4 23 :c1 'iWxc l + (23 . . .

After this I can not see anything more than a draw, for example 26 �a4+ �c4 ! or 26 b3 'Bb6 27 'Bd7+ �c6.] 25 l:ta1 26 l:ta6+ 27 lla5+ 28 1\Yc5+ 29 l:ta7+ b4 �b5 �c6 �d7 1-0 Index of Opponents Numbers refer to pages Ahues 167, 227 Alexander 240 Andersen 1 73 Bogoljubow 44, 49, 70, 151, 152, 154, 156, 202, 204, 207, 210, 212, 229, 242, 255 Book 282 Capablanca 129, 131, 136, 138, 142, Chajes 87 De Roszynski 19 Duras 14 Euwe 1 1 5, 1 1 8, 216, 218, 220, 224, 261, 263, 266, 268, 2 71, 276, 279, Fahrni 30 Fine 245, 252 Flohr 1 78, 191, 287 Foltys 235 Frydman 233 Grtinfeld 78 Isakov 31 Janowski 95 Johner 60 Junge 298, 299 Keres 291, 294, 296 Kimura 194 Kmoch 127, 169 Koltanowski 185 Lasker, Em. 215 Levenfish 10 Maroczy 86, 160, 180 Marshall 25, 107, 124, 145 Mieses 20 Mikenas 196 Nimzowitsch 12, 23, 121, 158, 1 75 Opocensky 97 Pirc 1 76 Rabinovich 34 Reshevsky 248 Reti 73. 92, 100 Rubinstein 54. 82. 1 1 1, 113 Samisch 77, 258 Schwartz 109 Selezniev 39 Stahlberg 1 71 Steiner 51, 149. 192 Sterk 46 Sultan Khan 189 Tarrasch 27. 58. 99 Tartakower 125, 164, 187 Teichmann 37 Thomas, Sir G. 105 Torres 65 Treybal 103 Vygodchikov 8 Winter 183. 238 Wolf 62 Yates 67 Znosko-Borovsky 1 6, 199 Index of Openings Numbers refer to pages Alekhine Defence 51, 105, 248 Benoni Defence 204 Budapest Defence 187 Caro-Kann Defence 125, 183, 189 Catalan Opening 268, 299 Centre Game 20 Colle System 191 Danish Gambit 31 Dutch Defence 70, 164 French Defence 30, 129, 158, 1 75, 218, 224, 238, 289 Giuoco Piano 99 Griinfeld Defence 220 Irregular Defence 95, 107 King's Fianchetto 100 King's Gambit 27, 37, 294 King's Indian Defence 92, 109, 118 King's Knight's Opening 19 Modem Defence 196 Nimzo-Indian Defence 115, 121, 1 69, 1 71, 266, 279 Petroff's Defence 25 Queen's Gambit Accepted 149, 1 78, 210, 212, 227, 252, 282 Queen's Gambit Declined 46, 54, 62, 67, 78, 82, 86, 87, 103, 131, 136, 13� 142, 160, 180, 21� 235, 255 Queen's Indian Defence 1 11, 1 13, 145, 154, 167, 1 73, 240, 296 Queen's Pawn Game 10, 12, 34. 39, 44, 49, 58, 60, 124, 127 Reti Opening 271 Ruy Lopez 8, 14, 1 6, 23, 65, 73, 156, 185, 192, 194, 1 99, 207, 245, 258, 287, 291, 298 Semi-Tarrasch Defence 276 Sicilian Defence 77, 233 Slav Defence 97, 151, 152, 202, 216, 242, 261, 263, 284 Tarrasch Defence 1 76 Three Knight's Game 229
