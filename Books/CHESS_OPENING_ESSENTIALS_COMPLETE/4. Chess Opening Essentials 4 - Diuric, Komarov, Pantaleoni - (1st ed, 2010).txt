Joe Petrolito, Australian Chess Magazine "The key positions of each opening are diplayed in red (yes, red) diagrams. The name(s) of the inventors are in bold, red font, and references to other sources or sections of the book are also in red ( .. ) very useful for finding my way around the book." Arne Moll, ChessVibes "The amount of information available on chess openings is so gigantic that one gets almost suffocated. In this book all l .e4 systems are clearly listed and presented, without losing itself in endless variations." FreeChess.com "Gives an outline of each opening and major variation in tum, explaining the ideas and most popular choices for the benefit of elementary players. I was impressed by the practical advice given in the notes in this well-produced volume." British Chess Magazine "Full of great ideas, clear explanations and instructive games ( .. ) I have frequently enjoyed browsing through the beautifully-presented volume." GM Paul Motwani, The Scotsman "When you open this fat paperback for the first time, you will be surprised: color! Compared with this, books from Everyman, Gambit or Olms look like black-and-white television. ( ..) Not only is the main line explained and the reader made hungry for more, but he gets enough strategic knowledge and insider-tips to get, even if he plays the opening for the first time, into the rniddlegame safely." Erik Rausch, Rochade Europa Magazine "It is about the basics of the opening, about ensuing middle game positions, and about the plans one should pursue. 'Ideal for the club player who wishes to improve." Nederlands Dagblad "At the beginning of each major variation there is an extensive exposition of ideas, structures and plans. The games do give a good impression of the style of a particular opening system and will help the student to decide if he feels 'at home' in the positions." Thomas Berens, Chess-International "A complete overview of all openings, well explained with a large amount of readable text. Buy it for the clear cut explanations! " John Elburg Chess Reviews "A patzer like me, let alone someone with an Elo rating under 1700, should not buy a complex monography on the Najdorf before getting this instructive opening book." Pekka Pakarinen, Suomen Shakki Magazine (Finland) "Well organized, easy to follow, adequate space for notes to other opening references. Good explanations of why a particular opening is or isn't used by the world's best players." Mark Weeks, About.com "For players rated up to 1800 it will undoubtedly be quite useful.

Preface "There are no bad openings, only badly played ones"- Lajos Portisch This is the fourth and final volume of our series on the opening phase of the game of chess; during our journey we have examined a wide array of openings and their indi vidual and often very different peculiarities. Which is the best opening of them all? As any chess teacher can tell you, this perhaps naive but legitimate question is number one on the beginners' FAQ list! Luckily, there is no answer; it is wise to be wary of books in the series Crush your Op ponents with Defence X, or Make them Tremble and Cry with Opening Y- if only it were that easy. Quite simply the 'best' opening and 'perfect' repertoire do not exist. However, there are undoubtedly openings which are better suited than others to a player's indi vidual strengths and weaknesses - and this is true for both patzer and grandmaster. As with life, the old adage to thy own self be true applies and this concept is the cor nerstone of chess improvement. There are many chess players whose results suffer because they use openings which are completely incompatible with their style of play. Our ambition with this series of books was to supply the willing student with the information necessary to achieve an instructional overview of this intriguing part of the game. Once you have decided on the 'perfect' opening for you, it is possible to look at it more deeply by us ing one of the many monographs on individual openings and variations that are available on the market. We have been very careful to try and achieve the right balance; we hope the book is deep enough to be meaningful, without being weighed down by an excessive number of variations. Stefan Djuric Dimitri Komarov Claudio Pantaleoni Note from the editor: The colours in this book serve to help the reader to navigate more quickly, and to distinguish between, for instance, main lines and others. Coloured text highlights important moves, and also key initial positions and positions arising after important sequences. Bold type, be it in black or in colour, indicates main lines, which are also classified and sub-classified. Lines given in italics are unsound lines that should be avoided. There are also numerous graphic features highlighting moves, plans, and strong or weak points. s Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 4 Glossary of chess symbols !! brilliant move +- White has a decisive advantage !? interesting move ± White has a clear advantage ?! dubious move ;t White has a slight advantage ? mistake = equal ?? blunder :j: Black has a slight advantage N novelty + Black has a clear advantage t initiative -+ Black has a decisive advantage -+ attack # checkmate 6 Contents

Introduction We will begin this book with the same question that we asked in the previous books in our series on the 1 .e4 & 1 .d4 openings and the Indian Defences: What is the best move in this position? As noted previously, the classical ap proach is to occupy the centre with pawns. 1 .e4 was by far and away the most pop ular choice in the 1 9th century. How ever, by the early part of the 20th cen tury 1 .d4 was equally popular and well respected. Ample evidence of this is provided by the historic 1 927 World Championship match between Alekhine and Capablanca: l .e4 was played only once (in the first game!) , and in the 33 (!) games that followed White chose to begin with 1 .d4. So what about openings that do not be gin with a direct occupation of the cen tre? A.s we have pointed out previously, the modern chess expert has a variety of tools that were not available to scholars in the past. Just a short trip back in time takes us to the 1 940's and SO's - when redoubtable figures such as Euwe, ·Pachman, Taimanov, Boleslavsky, Geller and Suetin wrote weighty tomes that were a challenge for even the most will ing student (not least because they were only available in Russian and German! These great theoreticians truly deserve our respect as they managed to cohe sively catalogue a vast amount of diffi cult-to-obtain material without the help of the modern aids that we now take so much for granted, namely data bases containing millions of games and powerful chess engines (without these formidable programs mistakes in tacti cal analysis were always on the cards) . However, perhaps the most important resource that we have to today for the assessment of academic theory and for practical competition is statistics. It is difficult to overstate the value of being able to check the recent perfor mance of every single move in any given game. Naturally, these tools must be used with intelligence and flexibility. The following factors always need to be taken into consideration when assess ing the worth of a line: the psychologi cal impact of a move may offset its ob jective defects; the relative skill of the players - some lines are more common at high levels and vice versa; a very re cent theoretical novelty can quickly change the standing of an opening line (which may later prove to be excellent, notwithstanding initially discouraging performance figures) . However, in general when a variation has been sufficiently tested and the data

Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 4 used are gathered from a large enough number of games, the hard facts be come clear. So, what does all this signify? l.e4 and l.d4 were - and to a large extent still are - considered to be objectively the best moves; do statistics challenge this assumption? Let's examine the table at the bottom of this page. l.tLlf3, l.c4 and l.g3 have the same performance. l.d4 is slightly better than l.e4, but it should be noted that the average Elo of the 1 .e4 players in the sample is approximately 1 0 points be low the average of the players who chose l.d4. If you adjust the results to take into ac count Elo differences, the five most common opening moves have the same performance. l.f4 is the only choice that performs below 50%, but also here the average Elo is a contributing factor to lower performance: l.f4 players have signifi cantly lower Elo ratings. Well then. So if all the openings are pretty much the same, was all that stuff Move White's performance Total 55% l.e4 54% l.d4 5 6% l.tLlf3 5 6% l.c4 5 6% 1 .5!3 5 6% l.b3 53% l.f4 46% 1 0 about the importance of the centre just hot air? No, let's not get carried away. The centre will always be a strategic fac tor of fundamental importance. How ever, to understand it properly we must have a more sophisticated concept of occupation. A true strategic advantage is obtained if you manage to combine control and occupation of the centre. The not insignificant problem is that this is rarely possible, unless your op ponent is an obliging person and plays very passively! Any military expert will tell you that the more territory you occupy, the more difficulty you have in controlling it; the corollary is that control by itself is not enough to win a war - you also require occupation. So what is the best approach in chess? As always, it is a question of balance: you need to reconcile control and occu pation, giving preference to one or the other in accordance with your taste and style of play, but without too much e� phasis on one at the expense of the other.

One only need think of the Alekhine Defence, which we discussed in the first volume; if White chooses the Four Pawns Attack, he will physically occupy the whole centre with a menacing pha lanx of pawns, but at the same time grant Black ample opportunities for counterplay. On the other hand, with
4.tbf3, White contents himself with a
more disciplined control, which has produced better results statistically. Towards the end of the 1 990's, Black players increasingly chose semi-open defences to meet l.e4 (most notably the Sicilian), and the Indian defences in reply to I.d4. It is therefore only natural that White would also choose set-ups that concep tually involve a delayed occupation of the centre, or, indeed, concede the cen tre to the opponent with the idea of playing systems traditionally associated with Black with an extra tempo. A good example is the King's Indian Attack I.tbf3, 2.g3, 3.�g2, 4.O-O, S.d3 and 6.e4 (these moves are played virtu ally regardless of how Black responds). This is none other than a King's Indian played by White, and therefore with a move in hand (with greater attacking chances, and hence the name). In trod uc tion Another good example is the English - I .c4: here the most effective response statistically is I ...eS. And we have a Sicilian Defence with re versed colours. However, it is clear that the extra move changes things consider ably: here Black is less likely to open the game with a ... d7 -dS push, whereas the equivalent advance for White (in the Open Sicilian) is common. Another example of 'White playing Black' is I.tbf3 dS. Now, depending on what White plays-,
2.e3 and 3.b3 establishes a reverse
Queen's Indian, or 2 .g3 a reverse King's Indian. However, more often than not, White plays 2.d4, establishing a Queen's Pawn Game, or makes the move 2.c4, going into the Reti, which we discuss later.

1.tt:Jf3 and 1.c4 are therefore considered
to be very elastic moves that can lead to one of the following: distinct and characteristic set-ups with their own individual identities, black defences with reversed colours, or 1.d4 transpo sitions. Then there are other first move options where one knows that White has the in tention of playing a black defence with an extra move: 1.tt:Jc3, 1.d3, 1.e3, 1.c3 or
1.a3. None of these may be particularly
vigorous. However, they are always go ing to be useful moves, and while it is true that Black should have few prob lems achieving equality, he needs to be careful not to become overly ambitious and get into trouble trying to exploit a nonexistent advantage. In addition, there are the two flank openings 1.b4 and 1.g4. On the merits of these opinion is di vided: there are those who consider them perfectly playable, while others view them as having more defects than virtues. Their performance is similar to that of Black, and even if they do not give White any particular disadvantage they are dubious in as far as White re nounces the advantage of having the first move. The final group consists of opening moves that can only be described as ec centric (i.e. they do not occupy the cen tre, or in any way contribute to the di rect or indirect control of the centre) - here we see the game begin with a knight jumping to the outer rim of the board, or the advance of the h-pawn or worse still - its companion on f3. The chief purpose of these lines is to be provocative and few players believe they offer anything more.
1.l2Jg1-f3
White develops a piece towards the centre; he plays a useful move and post pones a pawn push until he has a better idea of which set-up Black is likely to choose. Contemporary players are very fond of this flexible approach, even if White obviously denies himself the possibility of playing lines that involve an early f-pawn advance or that begin with plac ing the knight on e 2 or h3. In the 1 9th century this knight move was played by Staunton, Blackburne, Zukertort and, most importantly, by Steinitz. However, it was only in the 20th century that it became a perfectly 'nor mal' move, even if White usually fol lowed it up by playing d4, with a trans position to the Queen's Pawn Game. It is important to note that we very fre quently see transpositions to positions that are generally classified as belong ing to the English l.c4. In the 1 92 0's Richard Reti came up with the idea of challenging 1 . .. d5 with the move 2.c4!?. Reti's plan was to delay or avoid the d2-d4 push, thus giving l.tLlf3 its own individual and modern identity. Besides 1 . . .tLlg8-f6 and l. . .d7 -dS, which are the two most common re plies, Black can choose from a variety of options that are listed below in ascend ing order of importance. 1 3

2.e4!? and playing a Sicilian.
A relatively popular continuation is 2 .b3 , which has similar strategic objec tives to the Larsen Opening 1 .b3 , and is therefore examined in that section. A specific variation of a standard ope ning can be reached after 1 . tLlf3 c5 with the moves:

4Jb8-c6 e7-e5 d7-d5 And we are in a line of the King's Indian Attack, i.e. in a main line of the King's Indian with reversed colours. l.flg 1 -f3 Given the importance of every tempo in an aggressive defence such as the King's Indian, having an extra move as White is significant. However, it is difficult to say if the extra tempo is sufficient to represent a concrete advantage. Without doubt Black would be wise to avoid overly aggressive continuations such as 5 ...f6 or, worse still, 5 ...f5 , but rather the more solid 5 . ..tt:J f6 or 5 ... i&.e7, with a balanced position.

Black simply copies White's move and waits. Former World Correspondence Champion Hans Berliner is the author of a book in which he states with the certainty of a true believer that l .d4 is superior to all other openings. Then, vv-ith equally dogmatic conviction, Ber liner declares that there is no doubt that the best answer to l .tLlf3 is l .. . tLlf6. Usually White replies with one of the following moves: • 2. c4 - the English Opening. • 2.d4 - covered in our 2nd and 3rd volumes on the Queen's Pawn Gaille and Indian defences. • 2. b3 -discussed in the section on 1. b3. Here we will look at the individual lines that arise after 2.g3.
2. g2-g3
Please note that besides the lines we are about to look at, it is also possible to play 2 ... dS, with a transposition to the I.tLlf3 dS variation, and 2 . . .d6, which can lead to either a Pirc or a King's In dian after 3 .d4. A) 2 . ... b7-b5 An interesting move: it controls c4 and it frees b7 for the bishop, from where it will challenge its opposite number on g2. The downside is that on bS the pawn makes it easier for White to open up the queenside with a2-a4.

The immediate 3.a4!? is also interest ing. 3.

�c8-b7 e7-e6 Establishing a type of King's Indian At tack set-up. After the natural S.d4, you have a sort of Queen's Indian where the inability of White to advance his pawn to c4 would appear to give Black an easy game. 5 . ... d7-d5 Otherwise S .. .d6 , which maintains control of the eS-square.

B) 2 . ... b7-b6 A natural and solid move: Black's bishop will soon be facing its white counterpart without creating the weak nesses associated with the two-square advance of the same pawn.

Lines where White plays c2-c4, either now or later, will be discussed in. the section on the English Opening. White's set-up is not particularly ag gressive and so a second fianchetto with 4 ...g6!? comes into consideration.

l . .. dS is another very natural move: Black occupies the centre and allows White to play an Indian Defence ( l .d4- ltJf6) with an extra tempo. At this point, White has lots of playable moves: • 2.c4-; this willbe discussed in the next section, • 2.b3 ; see the Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack, • 2.d4- transposes to a Queen's Pawn Game - the subject of the second volume in this series.

oaawigABg Now White has two alternatives: the first is to prevent the advance ... e7 -eS by playing 4.d4 , and when Black devel ops his knight to f6, we are in the Fianchetto Variation of the Griinfeld. The other option is to allow Black to ex pand unopposed:

5. d2-d3
e7-e5 And we are in the Fianchetto Variation of the Pirc with reversed colours.

White plays actively so as to make the extra tempo count. The natural 3 .jNg2 l2:\c6 4.O-O eS S .d3 takes us to a position that has already been examined in the section on I ...cS . In this variation, 4.d4! ? is an interesting idea that establishes a Griinfeld with reversed colours and an extra tempo: Black usually responds in solid fashion with 4 ...e6, and after c2-c4 you trans pose to a Catalan or the Tarrasch.

In that game the actual move sequence was l .tbf3 tbf6 2.c4 g6 3 .b4. However, what counts is the idea behind the moves: White does not physically oc cupy the centre but instead seeks to exert distant control with the hope of under mining Black's centre later on. This con cept is part and parcel of any modern player's technical repertoire; yet 80 years ago it must have seemed revolutionary. Black can choose from four principal eplies. Please note that the last two are the most popular and are classified by the ECO as being part of the English l . . . c6 and the English l . . . e6 respec tiYely. However, we have discussed them here because their themes are consis ·enr with the Reti. Transpositions arising from l .tbf3 and l .c4 (with the possibility of entering a Queen's Pawn Game true and proper) make classification difficult, which is indeed why these moves are so attrac tive and increasingly popular. Kramnik's repertoire Here is a nice opportunity to look at an interesting example of a highly transpositional repertoire; it was em ployed by the young Vladimir Kramnik, who used to like opening the game with the move 1 .tt:Jf3, but who would transpose to 1 .d4 or 1 .c4 openings depending on the circum stances. Let's have a look in more detail. Moving the king's knight out on the first move stops Black's ...e7-e5 ; we can safely presume that Kramnik did not like the idea of playing against the l . . . e5 defences that he would encoun ter after l .c4. However, he was happy to play a Symm etrical English with 1 ... c5
2.c4.
And in the event of 1 ... tt:Jf6, we usually see 2.c4 c5. Reti Opening

Kramnik was in a line of the English which is considered to be more prom ising for White than the analogous vari ation in the Nimzo-Indian. If, on the other hand, Black shows ag gressive ambitions with 2 ... g6, the for mer World Champion was prepared to play against a normal King's Indian with 3.tt:Jc3 . 3 ...�g7 4.e4 d 6 5.d4. When faced with 3 ...d5 he preferred to adopt an interesting Anti-Griinfeld line with 4.cxd5 tt:Jxd5 5.'�a4+. As you can see, this is an appealing method; it is true that it often leads to a Queen's Pawn Game, but at the same time you avoid three of the most ag gressive and unpleasant defences to l .d4, namely the Benoni, the Benko and the Griinfeld. Specialists in these defences have fre quently displayed a certain discomfort when faced with this approach. For ex ample, the Scottish grandmaster Jona than Rowson, a noted expert on the Griinfeld, has confessed to having problems when facing l .ti:Jf3 , and since this admission his adversaries have cho sen to play it more and more often! mm - kkkkkk A

With Krarnn ik's repertoire you run less risk than when you open with I .d4, but the price for this is that White has fewer options after I . tt:lf3. For example, it is no longer possible to play the promising line with tt:lge2 (much feared by many a black player) in the Karlsbad Variation of the Queen's Gambit. Another attractive line that is excluded is the Sa.misch against the King's In dian. Allof the above is yet another reminder that the various openings are not always separate entities, and to have an aware ness of possible transpositions can be very useful when selecting the reper- Reti Opening 1 . <2l g l - f3 d 7 -d5 2 . c2 -c4 toire best suited to your individual needs.

Therefore Black in effect has three lines to choose from: B 1 ) 4 . ... g7-g6 This imposes a hybrid Slav/Griinfeld, which is probably playable. It is worth noting that the analogous Schlechter Variation in the Slav - I .d4 dS 2 .c4 c6 3 .tLlf3 tLlf6 4.tLlc3 g6?! - is considered dubious because of 5 .�f4. However, here White has already played e3, and thus he cannot deploy his bishop on the kingside. Black's set-up is solid but a tad passive.

d7-d5 e7-e6 This formation is similar to that of the Orthodox Defence. This move is much played, and is a favourite of those who have the Tartakower or Orthodox Variation in their repertoire (see Volume 2). At this stage White can fianchetto on one or both sides of the board, which can lead to transpositions that are challenging to handle. In Variation C 1 we willexam ine lines where White fianchettoes on the queenside only (b3, �b2, e3 and �e2) or on both wings (b3, �b2, g3 and ..tg2), whereas in Variation C2 we see only a kingside fianchetto. Remember that 3 .d4 transposes to a Queen's Gambit. A) 3. b2-b3 Protecting c4 and preparing the fianchetto of the c 1 bishop. The other bishop can also be developed with a fianchetto or otherwise go to e2. This line looks modest, but appearances can be deceptive. It is true that White is not seeking to obtain an immediate ad vantage, but rather to gain a plus in the strategically complex middlegame po sition that he is establishing. It is no coincidence that Kasparov chose this very set-up in the crucial last game ofhis 1 987 match against Karpov, which he had to win in order to keep his title.

White easily wins back the pawn but the doubled a-pawns auger an awful endgame. However, White has not forgotten Tarrasch's wise words, "before the end game, the Gods have placed the middle game", and White now starts to play his trumps. His compensation on the long dark squared diagonal is evident yet difficult to quantify: the chess engines see the position as equal.

Judging by the line's excellent perfor mance, the answer would appear to be yes. Here we will examine two lines that have been seen in tournament play:
3.b4 and 3 .e3.
A) 3. b2-b4 White hopes to obtain some sort of ad Yantage by grabbing space on the queenside. In comparison to the line l .d4 tt:lf6
2.�f3 cS 3 .d5 bS
(a Pseudo-Benko- see the 2nd volume of our series) , White is a tempo up as Black has not yet played . . . tt:lf6. However, in the abovementioned line + .�g 5 ! gives White a nice advantage, so �t is unlikely that the extra tempo is go ing to change things radically. Reti Opening I.<0 g l -f 3 d 7 - d 5 2 . c2 -c4 3 . ... g7-g6 Another move is 3 . . .f6 so as to assist an e7-e5 advance: 4.e3 eS S .cS !?, with complex play. Otherwise there is 3 ... .Bg4!?, which discourages White from establishing a kingside fianchetto, as in its sister variation: after 4."ti'b3 , which prevents the creation of doubled f-pawns, the position is still unex plored. 4. g2-g3 �f8-g7

as we pointed out under line A, after 3 . . .cS , the advantage that the extra tempo gives White in respect to the Benko ( 4. b4! ?) or the Benoni ( 4. exd4) could very easily become apparent.

There the knight has al ready developed to f3 , whereas in the Reti the black knight is still on g8.

C h ess Open i ng Essen tials - Volume 4 King's Indian Attack We have seen previously in this volume (and also in the first book of our series on l .e4) how often White can trans pose to the King's Indian Attack. It is appropriate to collect these ideas in one section and to expand on those points that merit deeper discussion. The King's Indian Attack is the set-up characterized by the moves 1.tt:J f3, 2.g3,
3.gg2, 4.O-O, 5.d3 and 6.e4 (which are
usually played regardless of Black's choice of reply) . It is so named as Black typically plays the corresponding moves in the King's Indian: The extra move provides White with greater attacking possibilities. King's Indian Attack after 1.e4 Given that one of the characterizing moves of the King's Indian Attack is the advance e2-e4, it comes as no surprise that it is possible to establish the KIA after opening the game with l .e4. 5 2 However, consistent with the fact that against the King's Indian White's best plan is to advance his pawn to e4, expe rience has demonstrated that the King's Indian Attack is at its most effective only when Black has played . . .e7-e6 (as then . . .e6-e5 will require the use of another tempo) , or otherwise after . . .c7 -c6 (as also here the 'necessary' ...c6-c5 will cost a tempo) . It is therefore no coincidence that in the first volume of this series we see the King's Indian Attack as a possible op tion for fighting against the Caro-Kann ( l .e4 c6 2.d3) and the French ( l .e4 e6 2 .d3) and the Sicilian with 2 ...e6 ( l .e4 cS 2 .ltJf3 e6 3 .d3 - see diagram next page) .

a MM Chess Opening Essen t i al s - Vol u m e 4 King's Indian Attack after 1.t2Jg1-f3 More frequently White will seek to en ter the King's Indian Attack with 1 .- tLlg 1 -f3 and in so doing prevent l . . .e5 , which as we have seen is a move that robs the KIA of much of its effectiveness. 1 . ... d7-d5 For I . ..tbf6 2 .g3 go to page 1 9 (in the section on 1 . tbf3 tbf6).
2. g2-g3
We noted on page 2 6 (in the section on l .tbf3 d5 2 .g3) that both 2 . . . tbc6! ? and 2 . . . g6 are good attempts to render the King's Indian Attack innocuous. Indeed, if White continues with �g2 or O-O, Black can advance . . . e7 -e5 and White is playing a reverse Pirc, which presents no particular problems for Black. However, Black will often play more solidly and opt for . . .c6, and then de velop his bishop to fS or g4. See page 3 0 (Variation D 7 1 -D 7 2 in the section on I .ltJf3 d5 2 .g3) As a final option, Black can continue by applying the ideas normally employed by White against the King's Indian, but here with a tempo less: 2.
3. �f1 -g2
4. O-O
c7-c5 ttJb8-c6 e7-e5 As we all know, the King's Indian is a defence where Black plays on the ra zor's edge and thus every tempo can be crucial. Therefore, when playing against the KIA, Black must always keep this fact foremost in his mind and avoid a hasty occupation of the centre. For ex ample, after
5. d2-d3
the pawn advance 5... f5, which would create a reverse Four Pawns Attack, looks decidedly reckless: After 6.c4 d4 7 .e3, White will open the position to his advantage. In equal mea sure, 5 . . .f6, with the idea of playing a Samisch with reverse colours, appears to be excessively risky. All this would suggest that it may be more appropriate to play a quieter move such as
5. ... �f8-e7
(or first 5 . . . tbf6), with the idea after
6. tLlb1 -d2 <Llg8-f6
7. e2-e4 d5-d4!?
of playing the solid Petrosian Variation (see Volume 3) with reversed colours, and White will find it a challenge to realize the advantage of the first move.

It was to remain a marginal opening un til the end of the 1 920's saw the advent of the hypermodern school; Tartakower declared that l .c2-c4 was probably the best way to start the game as it took con trol of the strategically vital d5 -square. There is no need to say that the great chess minds of the past sometimes got more than a little carried away in their enthusiasm to stir things up and pro voke their complacent colleagues (e.g. . imzowitsch solemnly announced that after 1 . e4 Black has the advantage) . evertheless, the debate over what were then minor openings was of the utmost importance for the development of chess theory. Players of that period continued to pre fer the King's Pawn Openings, but with time the English became more and more accepted and now it is the third most popular way to open the game af ter l .e4 and l .d4. As with 1 . tt:Jf3 , the English Opening is often adopted as a means of transpos ing; in this case a subsequent d2-d4 leads to a normal Queen's Pawn Ga.Ille with the advantage of sidestepping defences that might be disagreeable for White, such as the Benoni, Benko, Griinfeld or Nimzo-Indian. Let's look in more detail at the chame leon character of this flexible opening: After 1.c4 tt:Jf6 2.tt:Jc3, White is ready to push his pawn to e4. If Black now plays
2. .. e6 with the intention of entering a
Nimzo-Indian, White will play
3.e2-e4.
And here it does not make sense for Black to bring the bishop to b4 (the moves 4.e5 and 5 .'1lit'g4 would follow, with a clear plus for White) . Obviously, Black has the option of 3 . . .c5 ! , but many a Black player would not relish the prospect of dealing with the com plications that arise from 4.e5 tt::l g8 s .tt:Jf3 tt::l c6 6.d4 cxd4 7 .tt::l xd4 tt:Jxe5
8.tt:Jdb5.
For the same reason, the Griinfeld is not playable after 2. ..g6 3.e4. Black can try playing . . .d7 -d5 one move earlier, but then after 2... d5 3.cxd5 tt:Jxd5

s ma&n&a C h ess Opening Essentials - Vol u m e 4 he may have to reckon with the various anti-Grunfeld lines (5.'/1Va4+, 5.�b3 ,
5.g3) . By no means do these lines give
White an objective advantage, but they are tricky and White will be more fa miliar with them than his adversary. So far things are looking rosy, but as al ways there is a downside: since 1...c5 controls the d4-square, a transposition to the Queen's Pawn Game is only pos sible if Black allows it. However, this is not going to fuss White, who will gen erally enjoy the manoeuvring game that arises with the Symm etrical English. The true acid test for the English is
1...e5.
Black occupies the centre and turns the English into a reverse Sicilian. After l .e4 c5, White fights for the ad vantage; here the very least that Black hopes for is equality, notwithstanding the fact that he is a tempo behind. 6 2 It is difficult to say if this is objectively realistic: excluding clear cases, equality and advantage are not mathematically quantifiable concepts. The border be tween equality and a slight advantage is hazy and even grandmasters do not agree in their evaluation. However, there is one thing that most will agree on: l . ..e5 creates a game that most l .c4 players do not particularly like. This explains why so many players pre fer to open with 1.tLlf3 with c4 as a fol low-up. However, as we have seen in the Reti, after 1...d5 the advance 2.c4 allows 2 ... d4!?, which can be equally unwel come to White. We once again return to a central point that has been reiterated in the previous volumes (as the ancient Romans would say: repetita iuvant), namely that the per fect opening does not exist. Every major opening has its virtues and defects, and personal taste and competi tive considerations are often more im portant than objective value, presuming that indeed this can be measured. One only needs to look at World Cham pionship matches over the years to see this: openings are determined by the style and repertoire of the opponent and changed accordingly. Modern matches rarely become a didac tic exercise in the use of a particular line. An opening is great as long as it works, and often after the first loss the loser will make a change. To a large extent this is psychologically motivated, and thus it applies as much to the beginner as to the grandmaster; no-one likes playing a line that has just given them a zero. Naturally, there are exceptions. Some players will religiously defend the mer- g4AW-i.fi. 8 kkk kk k

its of their pet line, even in the face of defeat. However, most modern profes sionals believe that a wide study and use of different openings is an essential weapon in competitive chess. From his earliest days Fischer used a highly restricted repertoire in which he had complete faith. But without doubt his experience at the 1 95 9 Candidates' Tournament must have left its mark: his noted conviction that White gains an advantage against the Caro-Kann with the sequence 1.e4 c6 Vt:lc3 d5 3.tt:Jf3

How ever, in the 1 9 7 2 Match of the Century in Reykjavik a very different Fischer sur prised title holder Boris Spassky with a much more varied repertoire. He did not respond to 1.d4 with the King's Indian, which had always been his weapon of choice, but rather the Benoni, Nimzo-Indian and Semi Tarrasch. It came as no surprise that the American champ used the Najdorf in answer to 1.e4, but Spassky would hardly have expected the Paulsen, a double employment of the Alekhine, and the Pirc. Result: 2 victories and 2 E n g l i s h Opening l . c 2 - c 4 draws. In addition to 1.e4, which in his youth he stated to be 'best by test' , Fischer played 1.c4 four times, once again achieving the optimum score of 2 victories and 2 draws. The fact that in this historic match Fischer obtained such good results with openings that are considered to be sec ondary, is clear evidence of how big a factor psychology is, even for two of the greatest players of all time. It is therefore important that any player who wishes to improve their results and un derstanding of the game avoid an overly limited repertoire as much as possible. One does not necessarily need to mem orize complicated lines that go deep into the endgame to play good chess: it also makes sense to choose an opening for which a general idea of typical plans is sufficient to start. And when you reach a point where you are not exactly sure what to do, you can improvise; it has been said that at least fifty per cent of theoretical novelties have come about because poor memories created the op portunities for some free thinking!

Usually Black initiates a pawn exchange on the a-file before beginning aggressive actions on the kingside, but it is still un clear if this has more pluses or minuses. It may be true that he no longer runs the risk of losing the a7 pawn with the pre dictable rook invasion on b7. On the other hand, the open a-file could prove to be a clear path for a quick deployment of White's major pieces. As this is no minor consideration, it is well worth thinking about the immedi ate 8 . . . tt:'lc5 or 8 . . . tt:'lh5 .

tt:Jb8-c6 The most natural and popular move, despite the fact that a black knight on c6 encourages the pawn march b2-b4-b 5 . This i s one o f the key positions i n the English Opening. There is no contact between White's forces and Black's, and neither side seems to want to make a move to deci sively occupy the centre. The real battle lies ahead in the middlegame and the strategic themes are substantially those of the Closed Sicilian with a tempo more or less, depending on which side you are playing. However, this factor is not very significant in this type of posi tion.
8. .lla1 -b1 a7-a5
Here we can repeat our earlier com ment: while this is the most played op tion, it should not necessarily be pre sumed that opening up the a-file is the best strategy. Evidence of this is that the alternatives 8 . . . h6 9 .b4 �e6 1 O.bS tt:'le7 1 l .a4 'iid7 and 8 ... tLlh5 9 .b4 fS 1 O.b5 tt:'le7 have produced slightly better results for Black.

This position is an oddity: two empty ranks separate the opposing forces, which huddle together on their first three ranks. This does not mean that the game will be lifeless; the battle lies ahead. After all, the initial position of a chess game is also virtually symmetrical, but with four ranks still vacant in the centre, there is nothing drawish about it!

6. �a4-h4
Here we have the main idea of the present variation: the queen menac ingly shifts to the kingside, where Black's castled king will be more vul nerable due to the absence of the knight on f6.
6. ... tt:Jd5xc3
6 . . . ti:Jf6 7 .e4 gives White the advantage, whereas after 6 ...�c6 7 .�d4! (the queen continues to slide around the board) 7 ...f6 8.e3 White is only slightly better.

Being up the exchange and two pawns represents a very nice material plus, but White's lack of development - all of his pieces are on the first rank - is cause for great concern. Assessing this position is no easy 'task, which is reflected in the diverse evalua tions given by the different chess en gines: some see it as equal, others give White a net advantage, for others still White is winning! kits!

Whereas this move is more likely to be played by a devotee of the English Opening. White's intention is to place the bishop on its natural diagonal, keeping open the option of developing the king's knight to e2. 3 .e4 is the choice of a l .c4 player who wishes to avoid the Griinfeld but is happy to take on the King's Indian. 3 . tLlf3 will usually lead to a King's In dian or an English/ Griinfel d, as dis cussed in the previous section.

a &w&£ a Black cannot advance his pawn to dS , and after . . .d6 the position assumes the characteristics of the King's Indian. Now - ignoring S .tt::l f3 , which leads to lines we have just discussed - White al most always develops his knight to e2 and can choose between various central pawn configurations: e3/d3 , e3/d4 or d3 /e4. Remember that d4/e4 trans poses to the Fianchetto Variation of rhe King's Indian. 5 .d3 is also possible at this point, and after 5 . . .d6 we are in one of the two al ternatives below, depending on whether White pushes his king's pawn one or two squares. _.\ line with its own individual identity is created by Gurevich's move 6.�g5 ! ?, which will be followed by 'i¥d2/ �h6- /h4/h5. However, the idea is too ambi tious to have concrete chances of suc cess. Well, that is what theory states; in practice anything could happen! A) 5. e2-e4 The move favoured by Botvinnik.
5. ... d7-d6
6. t2Jg1 -e2
¥ith this sequence, Black now has the option of switching to a satisfactory Symm etrical English variation with 6 ...c5 ! ? 7 .d3 (7.d4 does not give White l . c4 tt:l f6 - Lines w i t h 2 . ��)c3 much) 7 ... tt::l c6 8.O-O. For this reason, many prefer to establish this e4/ c4 line only after Black has played . . .e7 -eS.
6. ... e7-e5
7. O-O tt:Jb8-c6
Probably the best reply to 7 ...c6 is to transpose to a King's Indian with 8.d4! .
8. d2-d3
Also this position, like the many in which Black establishes a King's Indian like set-up, is classified as belonging to the English l ... eS (ECO code A2 6) . We would rather deal with it here in or der to underline its distinct nature: in deed, with l .. .tt::l f6, Black is denied the opportunity to directly advance his pawn to fS or to develop his knight to e7 (or h6) .

B AWjBABB As with the Nimzo-Indian, Black shows himself willing to concede the advantage of the two bishops in ex change for a better pawn structure. However, here White has more options because he still has a pawn on d2 : one of the cardinal strategic objectives for Black in the Nimzo is control of the e4-square, but in this position it is not always possible. Now White has four main continua tions, ignoring 4.d4, which transposes to the Kasparov Variation of the Nimzo-Indian. A) 4. g2-g4!? An incredible move, at least from a clas sical point of view: first seen at the end of the 1 990's, it was the idea of Russian grandmaster Zviagintsev - a true lover of the unorthodox and paradoxical (one only has to think of his 2 0 0 5 brainchild, namely 2 . ttla3 ! ? in answer to the Sicilian) . However, the truly astonishing thing about this move is that not only it is playable, but after ten years of testing it also has the best performance! Concep tually it brings to mind Shabalov's move 7 .g4! ? in the Anti-Meran line, which came to light a few years before - see l . c4 <8 £6 2 . <8 c 3 - D efences w i t h 2 . . . e 6 Vol. 2 : I .d4 d5 2 .c4 e6 3 .ttlc3 c6 4.ttlf3 ttlf6 5 .e3 ttlbd7 6.'iYc2 �d6 7 .g4! ?. It would appear that the g4 pawn can be snatched, but it is not wise to do so: 7 ... ttlxg4 is met by 8J:Ig l , and the g7 pawn leaves the board, with a plus for White. The g4-g5 advance is not in tended to spearhead a kingside attack, but rather to chase off the f6 knight for better central control. Even though White has scored well af ter 4 .. .O-O 5 .g5 ttle8, it is difficult to believe that Black is objectively worse.

As always, this has both its good and bad points: though it is true that the e4- square is rarely accessible to Black (White usually avoids d2-d4) , it is also true that a knight already placed on f3 denies White the important option of playing his pawn to f3 , which is very frequently seen in the abovementioned line. 6 . ... b7-b6 9 1 & AW g * 11 1 111

tt:Jg8-f6 e7-e6 This line was a favourite of Nimzowitsch, and more recently Kortchnoi and Kasparov. It has always been appreciated by ambitious players who like to have an initiative, though this involves taking more risks than would appeal to the average English Opening player. Evidence of this is that in the main line, which we will look at soon, White is virtually forced to sacrifice a pawn if he wants to get anything concrete from the opening. The centre pawn advance is very natu ral: why not grab the centre if Black lets you? The benefit now is that White threatens e4-e5 and thus . . .�b4 is no longer on the cards. However, as is always the case with opening moves, for every plus there is a corresponding minus. In this case, the pawn on e4 allows the immediate freeing advance . . .d7 -dS (to what extent it actually frees Black's game is central to the next line) . Oth erwise, if Black opts to push his l . c 4 <8 £6 2 . <8 c 3 - D efences w i t h 2 . . . e 6 c-pawn to c S , the d4-square becomes weak. Now Black has two paths he can follow, ignoring the timid 3 . . .d6, which would be followed by 4.d4 with a clear advan tage for White; and 3 . . .e 5 , which looks too slow:

Whether the compensation is sufficient or not is hard to say.

b-5-- Symmetrical English
1.c2-c4 c7-c5
Many believe the Symmetrical English to be a reliable but on the whole boring approach which offers few winning prospects to Black. This view is the result of prejudicial thinking: symmetry in the opening does not necessarily mean a lifeless po sition; in the case in question, there are lines where identical opposing posi tions are maintained for many moves, but more often than not the symmetry is broken quickly, producing strategi cally complex positions. Let us not for get that the symmetry that marks the initial position of every game of chess produces the countless possibilities that make the game so fascinating! .\s with the Sicilian, Black advances his c-pawn in order to exert control over the important d4-square. Indeed, when White pushes his pawn to d4 and takes with the f3 knight we frequently see true transpositions to the Sicilian, usu ally the Accelerated Dragon or the Kan Variation. However, needless to say, White can choose not to play d2-d4 or otherwise delay it, and instead establish a kingside fianchetto with the bishop on g2 so as to take possession of the long light-squared diagonal. More rarely, we see the pawn go to e3 with a d4 ad vance to follow. This can become quite nasty for Black in the lines where the knight is developed prematurely to c6. Now we will discuss three alternatives. However, we should note again the highly transpositional nature of the English Opening, which sometimes makes classification problematical. In the Symmetrical English, the kingside fianchetto and the two knight moves can be played in various orders. A) 2. tbb1 -c3 Some books give this as the main line. As Fischer observed, White's lack of control of the d4-square encourages Black to energetically play for this square himself: 2. g7-g6! The advantage for Black is that White does not have time to establish the Maroczy Bind formation (see Accel erated Dragon, Vol. I ) but, naturally, he has plenty of other options.

A& fiA&AA Chess Opening Essentials - Vol u m e 4 Another popular alternative is 2...tbf6 3 .g3 d S along the lines of the Rubinstein Variation, which we will examine next. The fact that White has not yet played tbf3 grants him other options: 4.cxd5 tt:JxdS S .�g2 tbc7

The simple aim is to play . . .d7 -d6 without losing the pawn on c6. This is easily the most played continu ation, notwithstanding the fact that there are several attractive alterna tives, such as the gambit 8 . . .d6 ! ? or 8 . . . 4Jg4.

And now we have another key English position. 1 0. �d4-d3 l . c4 c5 - Fo u r Kni g h t s Var i a t i on By far and away the most popular choice: the white queen leaves the dan gerous diagonal and places herself on a safer square. Even though the alternatives are less frequently played, they appear to be promising. 1 0. 'i¥h4 is highly natural, and so it co mes as no surprise to see it used as far back as 1 924, when Euwe employed it against Colle. However, after 1 O . . . .l:tb8 1 1..�. h6 �e6 1 2..�xg7 Rxg7 1 3 Jhc l 'iYaS , Black has prepared the . . .b7-b5 advance, with sufficient counterplay. Following 1 0.'i¥d2 �e6 ! 1 l .b3 dS , Black gains immediate equality. The interesting 1 O.�gS was used by Fischer. The idea is after 1 O . . .h6, ( 1 0 . . .�e6 ! ) to continue with 1 l .�xf6 ! ? .2.xf6 1 2 .'i¥d2 �g 7 1 3 . .l::!. fd 1 , which threatens cS , with an unclear position; do not forget that at this point the move 13 .. ."�a5? is not on for tactical reasons: 14.tbd5! VJildS 1 5.c5!, and White has a big advantage. 1 0. ... a7-a6 Always a useful move: the advance . . . b7 -bS is one of Black's primary ob jectives. The immediate 1 O .. . 'iYaS is possible, but Black must weigh up the conse quences of 1 1 .4JbS ! ? a6 1 2.�d2.

aA A a AAAa C hess Opening Essen t i a l s - Volume 4 1 ) White takes advantage of the fact that he has not castled and advances his pawn to h5 I h6 and then develops his rook to h3 and then g3 (as many a be ginner does!). There is evident compensation for the pawn, even if it would not be prudent to call it an objective advantage. How ever, White's great results demonstrate that his position is easier to play. D) 5. g2-g3 This preparation of the fianchetto of the king's bishop is the most played contin uation. This usually leads to the Rubinstein Variation, which is when Black retreats his knight to c7 and plays ... e7 -e5 , es tablishing a Maroczy Bind with re versed colours (pawns on c5 and e5, in stead of on c4 and e4) . It is worth noting that this set-up is of ten reached by reversing the moves tt:lf3 and g3 , usually with the move sequence l .c4 tt:lf6 2 .tt:lc3 d5 3.cxd5 tt:lxd5 4.g3 c5 5 . .itg2 tt:lc7 6. tt:lf3 tt:lc6 etc. 5. tt'lb8-c6 5 . ..e6 transposes to the Keres Variation 5 ... g6 6.�g2 �g7 7 .

6. �f1 -g2 l2Jd5-c7
In the Maroczy, bringing the knight back to c2 is a promising sub-variation; however, here Black cannot immedi ately occupy the centre: 6 ...e5? allows
7.tbxe5 tbxc3 8.tbxc6, and White has a dis
tinct advantage.
7. O-O
The recent idea 7. 'iW a 4 ! ? prevents . . .e7-e5 : after 7 . . .�d7 8.'tWe4 - with the idea of tt:le5 - the game is too com plex for a simplistic evaluation.
7. ... e7-e5
We have now reached the position in the following diagram, which is con sidered to be the starting point for the Rubinstein Variation. Rubinstein Variation Black's centre is imposing but slightly overextended. White must therefore re spond energetically before Black has the chance to consolidate and make the most of his space advantage.
8. d2-d3

With its sights on c4: in the Maroczy with ti:lc2 the . . .ti:ld7 -cS manoeuvre is standard. 9 . ... �c8-d7 Though not forced, this is by far and away the most played reply: Black pru dently avoids doubled c-pawns, as is ex actly the case in its mirror variation the Accelerated Dragon, where White often plays jLd2 . 1 0. tt'ld2-c4 Now we have reached a critical posi tion: The threat is jLxc6 and then tt:lxe S . Black must decide whether to parry the threat or ignore it.

9.O-O ti:ld7 l O.jLd2 ti:lcS - this sacrifice
is optimum; indeed, with l l .b4 White encourages his opponent to accept the pawn. However, it is the very presence of this pawn on b4 that changes everything: 1 . c 4 c5 - Asymmetrical Va r i a t i on After l l . .. �xc3 1 2..�.xc3 tt:lxe4, the bishop retreats to b2 from where it menacingly controls the long diagonal. This is so uncomfortable that Black usu ally declines the pawn on offer and con tinues with 1 1 . ..<1Je6. However, in the English after 1 1 . �g2xc6 kd7xc6 1 2. tt'lc4xe5 the pawn is still on b7 and the bishop must meekly go to e8 to avoid an ex change. An inquisitive reader may well ask the question: why not · play I O . . .bS and bring the bishop back to b 7 ? That is a nice idea, but unfortunately it does not hold up tactically: l l .�xc6 �xc6 1 2 .tt:lxe5 �b7 1 3 .'iVb3 and here the queen attacks both the bS and f7 pawns.

c7-c5 tt:Jg8-f6 e7-e6 d7-d5 When we talk about the Keres System, we are referring to a set-up that is cre ated when Black responds to White's fianchetto by playing . . .e7 -e6 and then . . .d7 -d5 and, after the usual pawn cap ture, he recaptures on d5 with the f6 knight. Often the advance . . .d7 -d5 is made after . . .tt:lc6 and . . .Jl.e7 , but so as to make ex planation easier, we will presume that the pawn push is made on the fourth move. It is important to stress that after the re capture on d5 by the knight and White's d2-d4, you reach positions that are clas sified by ECO as belonging to the 6.g3 Variation of the Semi-Tarrasch, which we have already discussed in Vol. 2 of our series. However, these lines are an integral part of the Symmetrical Eng lish, and so it seemed appropriate to look at them in this context as well. It is worthwhile to look at the move se quences in which White delays the move tt:lf3 ; for example, after l .c4 c5
2.tt:lc3 tt:lf6 3 .g3 e6, White cannot play
the spontaneous 4.�g2 ?! as after 4 ...d5 ! Black has no problems, which explains Black's excellent results with this line. Black is ready to advance his pawn to d4, attacking the c3 knight, and White does not have time to play his own pawn to d4 as he would be forced to re capture with the queen. For this reason the correct move is
4.t2lf3 , which introduces the lines we
are discussing here. As we have already noted, frequent transpositions are a distinguishing fea ture of the English. Here, for example, after l .c4 c5 2.tt:lf3 tt:lf6 3 .t2lc3 e6, White could play 4.d4 cxd4 5 .t2lxd4 and now: • 5 . . . t2lc6 transposes to the English Four Knights. • 5 . . . jlb4 6.g3 takes us into the Nimzo-Indian. • The pawn move 5 . . .a6! ? merits atten tion as it has recently obtained de cent results; the idea is to attack the c4 pawn with ... 'irc7 . Let's return to 4.g3 d5 .

Now we are dealing with the Tarrasch Defence minus knights on c3 and f6.

After l O.dxcS �xeS l l. .�gS , theory states that Black maintains equality with the strange move l l .. ."¥Rd7 !

4. g2-g3
c7-c5 tt:lg8-f6 e7-e6 b7-b6 This is the most common move se quence for creating the Hedgehog for mation, but it is important to remem ber that it is not the only way. Sometimes White delays the develop ment of the knight to c3 and plays 3.g3; in this case Black must immediately play 3 ...b6 if he wishes to establish this set-up. Indeed, as we explained on page I 02 (2.g3 Variation) , 3 ... e6 4 ..Bg2 b6?! is not possible for tactical reasons. At this point, if Black continues with .. . e6 you transpose to the Hedgehog as given above, but White's early kingside fianchetto gives Black the interesting extra option of . . .g6, the ever more popular Double Fianchetto, which will be discussed in the next section. Responding to 3 .tt:lc3 with 3 . . .b6 has the drawback that White can play 4.d4! , and after 4 .. .cxd4 s .tt:Jxd4 iil.b7 6.f3 ! , he can occupy the centre without hav ing to develop his bishop to g2. This is by no means the end of the world, and Black's position remains playable. How ever, Black will usually prefer to play 3 . . . e6 first and wait for White to fianchetto. It is important to stress that White can not stop Black establishing the Hedge hog formation with the move sequence l .c4 cS 2.tLlc3 tLlf6 3 .g3 , as Black will play 3 . . .e6! and as before, the natural-looking
4.jLg2 ?! is not good due to 4 .. .d5 ! .
White must therefore continue with
4.tLlf3 in order to support the d2-d4
advance, and then Black can fianchetto and create the Hedgehog set-up. However, as noted before, White does have the means to prevent the Hedge hog, namely 2 .g3 ! ?. After 2 . . .tLlf6 3 .iil.g2 e6 4.tLlf3 , a queenside fianchet to is no longer on as there is 5 . tLleS . But a diehard Hedgehog fan is not put off so easily. The battle now goes back to an 'improvement' on the first move! By playing l . . . tLlf6 ! instead of l . . .cS , Black waits for White to play 2 . tt:lc3 or
2.tLlf3 before playing . . .c7-c5 , after
which White cannot thwart Black's plan to establish the Hedgehog formation. It is true that there is nothing to prevent White from playing 2 .g3, but in that event Black can respond with 2 . . .c6! 1 29 MfcAWwA X k k kkk

Now that we have looked at some of these move sequence subtleties, we can return to the diagram position at the beginning of this section (after 4 .. .b6) . 5 . ..tf1 -g2 ..tc8-b7
6. O-O
Black now has two options that resist easy classification, as one will often transpose to the other. In reality there is the third option of 6 . . .d6, but as this always leads into one of these two lines it does not merit to be examined as an individual varia tion. The natural developing move 6 . . . tLlc6 is now a move of the past: nowadays most players believe that in the Hedgehog the 1 30 knight is more flexibly placed on d7 than on c6. However, this does not mean that 6 . . . t2Jc6 is by any means a bad move: after 7 .e4 d6 8 .d4 cxd4
9.tLlxd4 'ifd7 , Black's position is rea
sonable. A) 6. a7-a6 Black delays the development of the bishop so as to take the sting out of sev eral lines that White has at his disposal. However, as always, there is a price to pay.
7. �f1 -e1 !
This is stronger here than in the line that follows. In reply to the normal 7 .d4 there is 7 . . .cxd4 8.'il'xd4 d6 9 .�g5 (one of many possibilities) 9 . . . t2Jbd7 (unlike the variation in which . . .�e7 is played instead of . . . t2Jbd7, White does not have the promising exchange 1 O.�xf6 ! ?) 1 0 .tLld2 ! ? �xg2 1 l .

This is the idea: before playing d2-d4, White closes the b7 bishop's diagonal so as to recapture on d4 with the knight. 8 . ... �f8-e7 While after 8 . . . t2Jbd7 the sacrifice may not be objectively winning, it is tricky to play against over the board: 9 .d4 cxd4 1 o.tt:Jxd4 V/Bc7 (it is too late for

g7-g6 As we explained before, an interesting response to an early kingside fianchetto by White is simply for Black to do the same thing. Kasparov's adoption of this line in the 1 980 's gave its popularity a boost, and the variation is appreciated by star play ers such as Aronian, Kramnik and Grischuk. There are evident strategic similarities with the Hedgehog Formation. The ad vantage here is that the d6 pawn (a typi cal position is given in the second dia gram on page 1 4 1 ) is defended by the e7 pawn, and thus cannot be attacked, and the f8 bishop goes directly to g7, avoiding the long manoeuvre ...�f8-e7, ... lle8, ...g6 and ...�e7-f8-g7 that is common in the Hedgehog. As always there are drawbacks: the d5-square is not controlled by a black 1 40 pawn, and an early lLJdS by White can be annoying. In addition the classic freeing pawn ad vance . . . d7 -d5 is obviously more diffi cult to realize without a companion pawn on e6. Therefore Black tries for the other pawn break, namely on b5 . Let's look at some specific moves:
6. ttJb1 -c3
White can continue with the fianchetto theme with 6.b3 , but the symmetrical nature of the position robs it of dyna mism, and the line has too high a draw rate to attract players who want some thing more from the opening phase.
6. ... �f8-g7
7. d2-d4
Easily the most played move. A worthy alternative could be 7 . .!:!.e I (along the lines of the analogous varia tion in the Hedgehog) with the idea of pushing e2-e4: after 7 . . . tbe4 8.tbxe4 �xe4 9 .d4 O-O! (following 9 ... cxd4, White gains the advantage with Romanishin's

8. �d1 xd4
The variation's starting position. It is true that on d4 the queen can be at tacked with ... tLlc6, but she is ready to sweep across to the kingside to take part in a dangerous attack. The same can be said of 8 .tLlxd4 �xg2 9 . �xg2 as of 6.b3 : while it may be given an occasional outing by top players, it lacks punch and will not give any real advantage to White. Even from a conceptual point of view it looks doubtful: exchanging pieces makes life easier for your opponent if he has a cramped position, as is the case here. 8 . ... d7-d6 This is the move most people choose, but 8 ... tLlc6 is better than its reputation: following 9.\'Hf4 (9.\'Hh4 is well an swered by 9 . . .h6!) 9 ... l:rc8 1 0. .l:rd 1 O-O, White's advantage (if indeed there is one) is minimal. The immediate 8 . . . O-O leads to transpo sitions; Black usually delays castling so as to deny White the typical manoeuvre '¥Rh4/ �h6. However, it should be stressed that after 9 .fih4 d6 1 O.�h6 tLlbd7 1 1 .J::i. fd1 .l:i.c8 1 2 .b3, the position is playable.

Played by Topalov, Kramnik and Aronian - recommendation enough in itself! The move prepares g4-g5, given that an immediate 1 4.g4 would allow 1 4. ..h6 ! 1 5 .�xh6 �xh6 1 6.�xh6 tLlxg4, with a satisfactory game. As an alternative there is a different plan: first �h6 and then tUgS . How ever, it will be difficult to force the f6 knight to abandon its defensive post, from where it holds Black's position together.

Chess Opening Essentials - Vol u me 4 14 ... "iftla8? is a tactical error: 15.ii.xd7! l::i. xd7 1 6.Ci'Ja4. On the other hand, if Black continues to play a game of wait-and-see with 1 4. . . .U.e8 , then after 1 5 .g4, White has an initiative: now 1 5 . . .b5 is question able as there is 1 6.g5 ; whereas follow ing 1 5 . . .

So the knight can get to e8 without losing the e 7 pawn. 1 6. g4-g5 After 1 6Jhd6, there is 1 6. . Jhc4 1 7 Jhd7 .l:.xc3. 1 6. ... lUf6-eS To the classically trained eye, White should be better: he has five ranks to Black's three, and his opponent has a weak pawn on d6, and a passively placed knight on e8 . However, there are other factors which must be taken into account. White's pieces may be better positioned, but they have no clear targets to attack: the 1 42 black king is not at any particular risk and a . . .b7-b5 advance could give Black nice counterplay on the queenside. In other words, both sides have their trumps. May the best player win!

Black ambitiously grabs a key centre square and transforms the English into a Sicilian with reversed colours. It is not difficult to understand the ap peal of this approach: 1 ... e5 is the move that leads to the most victories and the fewest draws. In other words, the stron gest and most combative move! However, it is not the most popular re ply ( l ...tt:Jf6 remains number 1 ) , prob ably because an l .e4 player is under standably reluctant to face a Sicilian minus a tempo. We will now examine the moves: it is only logical that if Black has a wide va riety of second move options at his dis posal when playing the Sicilian, then White will obviously have even more choices thanks to the extra tempo. However, two moves dominate in pop ularity, namely 2.g3 and above all Vbc3, both of which we discuss fur ther on. It is curious that 2 .d3 is a rarity, when you think that 2 ...d6 is the most fre quent continuation in the Sicilian. Equally strange is that the promising move 2 .e3 ! ? is comparatively uncom mon. Ahead a tempo, White aims for the d2-d4 push, whereas in the popular Sicilian with 2 ... e6, Black rarely man ages to make this advance. A quick note regarding 2 .tt:Jf3 !?. White is playing the Nimzowitsch Variation of the Sicilian with reversed colours! However, notwithstanding the extra tempo, after 2 ... e4 3 .t2ld4 t2lc6!

As is the case with these epony mous lines, somebody has almost al ways played the variation before. In this case, Kolisch employed it as far back as 1 8 7 2 ! Nonetheless, the Latvian-born grand master's name is rightly attached to this line, given his successful patronage in the 1 990's. The idea is the same as for the Sicilian Rossolirno Variation - l .e4 cS 2 .tt::l f3 tt::l c6 3 .�b5 - , namely to take on c3 so as to compromise White's pawn struc ture and to get rid of what would be a bad bishop if . . . d7 -d6 were played. Ob viously, here being a tempo down is no small matter, and the absence of a knight on f6 allows 3 .tt::l dS, with gain of tempo. However, White can ignore the 'threat' and continue with cheerful disregard. Now, excluding the playable 3 .tbf3 and 3 .�c2 , the sharpest replies are: 1 5 1 mQ* ll

Black delays the development of the knight to c6 and blocks the path of the f8 bishop, which can no longer go to b4. In doing so, Black presents White with a provocative challenge to play d2-d4, counting on making the most of the exposed position of the white queen (the famously rapid victory of Kasparov against Hubner in 1 98 5 is a good example) . If White does not take up the gauntlet, Black can continue with the . . . f7 -f5 ad vance, or otherwise establish a kingside initiative with . . .�e6 , . . . tbc6 and . . .�d7 . As you will have already gath ered, this is an ambitious set-up, and it comes as no surprise that it was part of the young Kasparov's repertoire, as dur- . ing his career he was always on the lookout for dynamic positions that al lowed him to show his tactical flair.

The most natural, but also here there is a wide range of playable moves to select from. These include S ...h6 6.tt::l h3 gS ! J 7 .e3 tt::l f6; S ... i.e7 6.tt::l h3 tt::l f6 7 .e3 and S . . .�b4- 6.tt::l h3 tt::l f6 7 .e3 . Transposi tions are frequent, and in all of them the strategic concept remains un changed: the gS knight will return to h3 with the hope of going to f4-, some thing which can only be stopped by the committal advance to gS. More often Black prefers to continue development, while White plays his pawn to e3, cas tles kingside and prepares f2-f3 , to strike at the head of the pawn chain.

Not an easy position to assess, as re flected by the differing evaluations of the various chess engines. One thing is certain though: Black's tournament re sults have been acceptable. King's I ndian set-up 3 This title could cause confusion: how can one talk of a King's Indian when there is no pawn on d4- and the knight is sometimes absent from f6? This is not technically a true King's In dian, but in terms of philosophy there are many similarities: Black plays . . .e 7 -eS , establishes a kingside fianchetto, and after . . .d7 -d6, begins a kingside attack with .. .f7 -fS . Sounds fa miliar? It comes as no surprise that those who play the King's Indian against d4- are going to find this set-up appealing. It is important to note that this completes our examination of the English against the King's Indian as 1 . . . tt::l f6 obviously precludes an immediate advance of the f pawn. 1 . c2-c4 e7-e5

Now Black can push his f-pawn, or fianchetto on the kingside in the same fashion as White in the Closed Sicilian. A) 3 . ... f7-f5 Along the lines of the Grand-Prix At tack against the Sicilian - l .e4 c5 2 .lbc3 lbc6 3 .f4.

This is the most ambitious move, and it is without doubt the best as well. The king's knight will be developed to e2 and White retains the option of pushing his pawns to d3 , d4 and less often f4. The meek 5 .d3 is playable but passive: following 5 ... �b4 (5 . . . �c5 6.e3 f4! ? proves to be overly aggressive compared to the sister Sicilian variation, as Black will quickly become aware of the tempo deficit) 6.�d2 O-O 7.lbf3 d6 8.O-O �xc3 ! ? 9 .�xc3 �e8 Black's kingside initiative can start to become a threat. 5 . ... g7-g6 The most common move; with a pawn on e3 , developing the bishop to c5 or b4 is less attractive.

6.cxd5 lt:Jb4 the idea becomes clear: the
threat of a check on d3 rules out 7 . 'ilfb3. For this reason it is customary to opt for 7 .d3 tt:lbxd5 8.lt:Jxd5 lt:Jxd5 9.lt:Jf3 ..td6, with an acceptable position.

If it were Black's turn to move, with ... �e6 we would be in the mainline of the Closed Sicilian, as is clear when you compare the two diagrams. In the Closed Sicilian, White prepares d3-d4 with the move 9.ile3 , which is something Black usually stops with 9 ... tLld4. As explained in Volume I , now the gambit I O.eS ! ? - though not winning - will certainly cause Black some headaches. On the other hand, when playing against the English, Black is a tempo down, and there are reduced chances of opening up the centre and of a kingside initiative. However, this is a dynamically balanced position that of fers Black sufficient resources.
9. l:ta1 -b1
The b2-b4-b5 pawn advance, with a queenside initiative, is the dominant strategic theme in this position. There are many who like to take a more 'prudent' approach with 9.b3 followed by I 0 .�b 2 , copying the black systems with b6 in the Closed Sicilian.
9. ... a7-a5
This is easily the favourite move, but as we have noted in similar positions, al lowing the a-file to be opened might not be in Black's best interests. 1 0. a2-a3 g. i.9 M * H AW Xi

a Aw* an C hess Opening Essen tials - Vol u m e 4 We have arrived at a critical position in this line. We noted in the section King's Indian set-up 2, the fluid centre allows for the following centre pawn configurations to be established: e3/d3 , e3/d4, d3/e4. The first, with two centre pawns on the third rank, is the common set-up. One can now also play 5 .d3 , but we will not discuss that here as it transposes to one of the following lines, depending on whether White plays e2-e3 or e2-e4. B1) 5. t2Jg1 -f3 This is less popular than the other moves because, rightly or wrongly, the knight is considered more exposed to Black's ad vancing pawns on f3 than on e2.

B3) 5. 1:Ia1 -b1 This move would normally be consid ered to be a little premature .. . were it not for the fact that it was played by both Kasparov and Karpov! White expands on the queenside before developing on the kingside. It is worth noting that this move is usually com bined with e2-e3 , with a transposition to the following line.

In the English this advance often repre sents a knee-jerk reaction to l:l.b 1 , and is not always the best. However, in this case good perfor mance results have shown it to be a good move.

Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 4 Generally, Black goes for the . . .£7 -f5 ad vance, and White opts for e2-e3 and t2Jge2. 8 . ... f7-f5 An immediate kingside attack seems to be most in keeping with the spirit of this variation.

Black would like to play . . .�h3 , but he cannot do so now, as the c7 pawn will be taken.

This pawn advance is justified by the placement of the knight on e2, which has all the benefits that we have already mentioned, but with the defect that h4 and gS are not controlled. Black's ambition is to push the pawn further to h4, which would result in the h8 rook having free rein on the h-file, and if White plays his pawn to h4, the gS-square is not accessible to the knight which has developed to e2.

3. tbf3 , which has the merit of 'forcing'
Black to play . . . tLlc6, limiting his future options (for example, plans with ...c6 and . . .dS) . But it is not rare for White to ignore this subtlety and immediately set about establishing a fianchetto with 3 .g 3 . 1 . c2-c4

Here we will look at non-transposing · lines, remembering that with the knight on c3 , delaying the development of the companion knight has both posi tive and negative features, as is always the case in the opening phase of the game.

4. t2Jg1 -f3
The most popular reaction by Black when White adopts the Alapin Varia tion to fight the Sicilian is to beckon the e-pawn further forward - 1 .e4 cS 2 .c3 tLlf6 - , so it is only natural that White, with the advantage of an extra tempo, will frequently employ the same strategy. The alternative 4.�g2 dS has given Black excellent results, while 4.d4 exd4 5 .'YWxd4 dS 6.�g2 transposes to Varia tion C22, which is examined on page 1 50. 4.

It is hard to know whether our silicon friends underestimate the danger, or if we overestimate it. After the 'human' repositioning of the king, the position is complex and the same computer programs disagree in their assessment, ranging from equality to a clear advantage for White. In effect, the placement of the king is not ideal, and Black only has control of his first rank. However, it is important to remember that all the knights are off the board, and White would not look forward to the endgame as his pawn structure is a mess. As is so often the case, an evaluation of 'unclear' is not the sign of a lazy anno tator, but quite simply the only prudent judgement that can be made.

Black's pieces are very active and the chess engines prefer his position to varying degrees.

A) 4 . ... t2Jc6-d4 This concrete move is typical of the contemporary approach to the game, and was first played by Kortchnoi at the beginning of the 1 97 0 's. It was initially greeted with scepticism, but its reliability was eventually proved over the board and at the beginning of the new millennium it was adopted by many star players (Aronian, Svidler, Gelfand, Van Wely, etc.) . Contemporary players are more flexible regarding the old dogma of not moving the same piece twice in the opening phase. In this case, the position is closed and therefore this transgression does not carry great risks. In addition, exchang ing pieces has a tendency to free up the defender's position. The move also makes the useful . . .c7 -c6 advance possible. Another attractive fea ture of this choice is that compared to other lines, in particular 4 .. . it.b4 and 4 .. .d5 , there is only a modest amount of related theory. For many this is not a minor consideration as it allows you to play the variation with comparatively little preparation. 5 . .itf1 -g2 Practically forced. 5.tt:Jxd4?! is clearly du bious: 5 ...exd4 6.tUb5 .icS; as is 5.tUxe5?

Not an easy move to find: conceding the light-squared bishop does not readily come to mind. 13 ... tbd5? looks like a nice move; unfortu nately, it has the defect of losing a piece! Given that this is such a natural-looking move, it is easy to understand why this trap ensnares so many victims. After 14.Nxd5! Nxd5 15.e3!, the knight has only two flight squares: if it flees to fS it will be subject to one prong of a fork, if it goes to e6, after 1 6.e4, the central bishop has nowhere to run! In this case encouraging the pawn to advance to bS was not such a hot idea.

Once again, greater piece activity com pensates for the opponent having the bishop pair. 1 5. t2Jd2-e4 f6-f5 1 6. e2-e3 The resulting tactical complications are tricky to evaluate. 03) 8. d2-d3 O-O At this point White can continue in Dragon fashion with 9 .�e3 ( . . . Ne6 is a standard move in the Classical Dragon) , or otherwise prepare further queenside play with a2-a3 and b2-b4. However, after 9 . . . a5 1 O .a4 �g4 1 1 .lie 1 .l::i'. e8, Black has achieved good results. As already noted, 9 .a4 is playable not withstanding the fact that it weakens b4 (as . . .aS is equally feasible in the Accel erated Dragon) . 031 ) 9. �c1 -e3 �c8-e6 As always, 9 . . Jie8 is a valid alternative. The idea is to play . . . Nf8 and . . . tbd4. 1 0. l:!.a1 -c1 The most natural, though l O.�c l ! ? with a .l':[d J and d3-d4 follow-up is worth considering. .i 'if .� .

1 O . . . 'm'c8 the Sicilian, with the cor
responding plan of Sd l and d4 ( ..J Bd8 and ...dS in the Sicilian) . There White has already advanced his f-pawn two squares. 1 0.'iiV c 1 has the additional ben efit of preventing the pawn advance to f4. 1 0. ... f7-f6 The most solid move. If Black wishes, he can also play the more ambitious 1 0. . .f5 1 7 1 1 .a3 Nf6 1 2 . b4 tbd4. 1 1 . t2Jf3-d2 1 93

So far we have looked at the Big Four ( l .e4, l .d4, I .t2Jf3 and l .c4) that mo nopolize the opening 'market'. Now it is time to look at some openings that initially focus on the flanks with a dis tant eye on the centre. The openings that we will discuss in this section are the most 'respectable' of the uncommon openings. though still a good deal less popular than the quartet of favourites mentioned above . We will later examine openings that are best classified as rare, given that they appear with a frequency of less than one in a thousand games. 1 99 Openings Chess Open ing Essen t i a ls - Vol ume 4 Benko Opening 1 .g2-g3 � � .t 'iV � .t � � 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 �

2.c4 c5 3 .d5 bS).
However, his name more than merits its attachment to the move l .g3 : from the 1 940's until quite recently, Benko adopted this opening with great consis tency and, even more importantly, with optimum results: the fact that Fischer and Tal were two of its victims is com ment enough!

is fifth in the popularity stakes, and by a good margin: only one game in a hun dred begins with this move. Nonetheless, it performs well - remem bering that it frequently transposes to English, the King's Indian Attack, the Reti or the Catalan. Its great virtue, especially with quick time limits, is that Black has to start thinking right from the start! Given its infrequent use, black players are not used to the problem of how to best meet l .g3 with their ex1stmg reper toire, and how transpositions may take them into new waters. This immediate preparation to fianchetto is perfectly logical: its philos ophy is thoroughly modern (control and attack of the centre rather than its occupation) , especially in the lines where Black is deliberately allowed to take the centre squares. 1 . ... d7-d5 Obviously, almost any other move is possible, but occupation of the centre remains the favourite: l . . . tLlf6, l . . .g6 and 1 ... cS are very common, with likely transpositions to almost all of the closed openings. The other means of grabbing part of the centre, I .. . eS, is also very frequent, but it usually leads into the main line. However, Black must keep in mind that White can steer tl1e game into the English l . . .eS by playing 2 .c4.

The most natural move.

g, CjjJi 'iY� Jl. CiJ .M Nimzowitsch opened Lhis way on three occasions in the 1 92 0 's. It was adopted by the Italo-Peruvian Esteban Canal in the 1 9 5 0's, which were boom years for the King's Indian. He was fed up with facing one young Soviet player after an other who played a kingside fianchetto! When he was asked why he had chosen such a passive-looking move he replied: Til be t!te first to put a bishop on t!te Long di agonal. ' However, the line is correctly named in honour of the Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen, who very skilfully deployed it in the 1 960's and 7 0 's at the highest levels. As always, the most convincing argu ment for sceptics are some impressive wins, and Larsen supplied them. Thanks to him the opening is today considered to be both respectable and reliable, even if it has never gained more than modest popularity. With the immediate queenside fian chetto, White takes a positional tack, and, at least in part, renounces the ad vantage of having the first move. 20 1 Opening Chess Opening Essen t ials - Vol ume 4- Against correct play, White cannot hope for more than equality, but as the Rus sians say: equality does not mean a draw. Another selling point for this opening is that the resulting positions are strate gic by nature, and it is not necessary to do long hours of preparation before you can use it. In the age oflimitless da tabases, many players are attracted to an opening that allows them to avoid com plex theoretical duels. Obviously, Black can take his choice from a wide range of very different re plies. The classical approach of occupy ing both centre squares with pawns is the number I choice, but a slightly more conservative partial occupation is also an option (pawns on e6/d5 /c5 or d6/e5) . Other black set-ups based on a kingside fianchetto after I ...tLlf6, or l . ..c5 fol lowed by 2 . . .d6, are obviously playable too. However, they tend to give White exactly the sort of game he is looking for, namely one with a tiny advantage that is risk-free.
A) 1 .

Others prefer the more solid 2 . . . 4Jf6 3 .e3 c6; when this is followed by 4-.c4- �f5 5 .4Jf3 we see set-ups that were discussed in the sec tions on the Slav and the Reti. Another tempting alternative is the odd-looking 2 ...�g4!?. The objective is to stop e2-e3 and double the f-pawns after tLlf3 . White can give the bishop a kick with
3.f3 or 3.h3 , but after 3 . . .
.Bh5 , Black's hope is that further kingside advances by White (g4- and h4-) will be more damaging than productive. The best performing strategy has been to ignore the bishop and play 3 .g3. Af ter 3 . . .c6 4-.�g2 tLld7 5 .4Jf3 tZ:lgf6

As Fischer demonstrated in his 1 9 7 1 match with Petrosian, 3 . tLlf3 is less pre cise as it can be met by 3 ...f6! , and Black takes possession of the centre. After 3 .e3 , Black must decide if he will develop the b8 knight to c6 in a type of Nimzo-Indian with reversed colours,

It is for this reason that set-ups with tt:lf3 and b3 are associ ated with his name. It is important to note that with the se quence beginning with I . b3 , Black has the opportunity to play 1 .. .eS . However, White now has the interesting option of f2-f4 before developing the knight to f3 , creating positions that are often reached by means ofBird's Opening l .f4.

H w Now what is the best way for Black to defend eS ?
2. . . . t2:lb8-c6
The most combative move: Black keeps open the option of pushing the other centre pawn two squares. Though played less often, the more solid 2 . . .d6 is also good. Black closes in his bishop but avoids the problems as sociated with seizing and maintaining too big a centre. The downside is that White has a greater choice of playable lines to choose from: • 1 - play c2-c4 with a transposition to the English; • 2 - a kingside fianchetto; • 3 - an immediate d4 advance to acti vate the queen; • 4 - the most popular choice of 3 .e3 , with the possible continuation 3 . . . tt:lf6 4.d4 tt:lbd7 S .c4 c6 6.tt:lf3 e4! ? 7 .tt:lfd2 dS , which produces a complicated position that continues to defy easy assessment. The strategic themes (with reversed colours) are the same as those for the Advance Variation of the French: the pawn structure provides attacking possibilities, but Black's centre, if sufficiently attacked, risks crumbling.
3. e2-e3
The move that is most in keeping with the spirit of the opening. Those of you who prefer to steer away from the sharp lines that follow can al ways play 3.c4, which prevents Black from aligning his pawns, and go into English l ... eS positions. After 3 ... tt:lf6 4.e3 dS S .cxdS tt:lxdS

Nc5 27J.f3 g5 32.Ng2 Bird's Opening 1.f2-f4 This was played on a couple of occa sions by Labourdonnais and Saint Amant in the first half of the 1 9th cen tury. However, 1.f4 carries the name of the English player Hemy Bird, who played it with good results in around 80 games in the second half of the same century. In more recent times, the Dane Bent Larsen showed a certain fondness for this old opening idea. The f4 pawn controls the important eS-square, and thus l .f2-f4 is definitely useful. However, it does nothing to pro mote piece development and it could limit the natural development of the c 1 bishop to f4 or gS. Black, as is always the case when White does not choose a particularly dynamic opening, can take his pick from a wide variety of replies. The classical approach of occupying the centre remains the most spontaneous and natural option: therefore 1 ... d5 and
1...e5 are the two most common an
swers to Bird's Opening. At times Black keeps his cards close to his chest and plays 1 .. .tbf6 and he can continue, after 2 .<1:lf3 , with alternatives such as 2 . ..g6 ! ? or 2 . . .d6, with the idea of contesting control of the eS-square. 2 . . .c5 is an other possibility; after 3 .g3 , there are frequent transpositions to the Closed Sicilian! A) 1 . e7-e5 The famous From's Gambit, in honour of the Danish player and theoretician who explored this line in the 1 860's. Black sacrifices a pawn and hopes to ex plait the dark-square weaknesses that result from the f2-f4 advance. The ob jective correctness of this notion is open to doubt, but in the rough and tumble of practical play Black has good chances. The fact that it is less commonly played than the solid alternative l . . .dS is not necessarily a comment on the gambit's worth, but more because I . f4 is so in frequent that there are few who can be bothered to study the complications in volved with this line. On the contrary, it is highly popular with correspondence players, who relish highly theoretical battles.

Black's lead in development is menac ing, but in fact White's centre is at tacked by pieces and not pawns, and it is more solid than one would first imagine. After 13.�e31 followed by tLld2 , White can castle on either wing, and finish development with an extra pawn and a nice centre. A2) 4 . ... tt:lg8-f6! The modern Mestel Variation: Black is in no rush to gain immediate compen sation, and instead continues with nor mal development. This reflects the contemporary ten dency to make positional sacrifices: for example, the popular Marshall Gambit in the Spanish is so feared that White often avoids it.
5. d2-d4
Following 5 .g3 h5 ! 6.d4 h4, Black has nice counterplay.
5. ... tt:lf6-g4
Black can also continue with the policy of development and play 5 . . .O-O !?, but the text move (with the threat of �xh2 followed by Vi'h4+) is going to appeal more to the typical From's Gambit player.

2 Chess Opening Essent i als - Vol u m e 4- And all hell has broken loose: White is two pawns up and has two bishops in exchange for a rook, but his king is a sitting duck on d2 and the fact that all his queenside pieces are on their origi nal squares is cause for great alarm. This position is clearly a nightmare to evaluate. The immediate reaction of the recent chess engines is to give White a decisive advantage; then given more time this becomes a healthy advantage; and with even more time just an edge - and in the end equality! We human commentators will limit ourselves to the cautious annotation 'unclear position' . B) 1. . .. d7-d5 After this move, White is playing a Dutch with reversed colours. 2 1 4 White has the advantage of the extra tempo, yet - curiously - the Dutch proper ( l .d4- fS) is played ten times more often than the reverse version.
2. tt:lg1 -f3
After 2 .b3, which discourages . . .g6, the bishop move 2 . . .�g4-! ? has served Black well. 2 . ... g7-g6! If 2 .g3 can be considered the best an swer to the Dutch, it is natural that also here the king's bishop will have an excellent future on the long diago nal. If Black chooses plans based on 2 ...c5 3 .e3 tt:lf6 or 3 ... tt:lc6, White can go for 4-. b3 ! , entering positions that we dis cussed in the section on the Larsen Opening. A few players will play 2 . . . �g4- (or 3 . . .�g4- after 2 ... tt:lf6) , with the inten tion to exchange on f3 and then to pre pare the push . . .e7-eS . However, it seems a little optimistic to first concede one of the two bishops and then open up the position. When facing 2 . . .g6 it is only natural that White will adopt the same plans as used in the Dutch: fianchetto on the kingside in Leningrad fashion, advance his pawns to e3 and d3 (Classical Vari ation) , or establish the Stonewall with e3 and d4-. B1) 3. g2-g3 The Dutch Leningrad is a dynamic and dangerous weapon, and to employ it with an extra tempo would appear to be a good idea. Black should take a re strained approach and avoid excessively sharp lines. E W Be

aa- AAA A sA Chess Open ing Essen t i a l s - Vol u m e 4 The truth of this is reflected by the curi ous fact that the results for White with this set-up do not even match Black's comparatively modest performance! However, we do not want to give the impression that an extra tempo is bad for your game; the difference is ex plained by the fact that lower rated play ers are more likely to adopt the system and their losses- are determined more by Elo difference than opening choice. We have already pointed out that the Dutch is ten times as popular as Bird's Opening: it is clear that top players are prepared to play riskier defences with black, but are not willing to compro mise the advantage of the extra tempo when playing with the white pieces.

White must retreat his knight from eS, with the result that his kingside initia tive comes to nothing. Van Geet Opening
1.ttJb1-c3
i: � .i. 'ilf � .i. � i: i i i i i i i i ttJ 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 � � iY� � ttJ � As far back as 1 883 , Blackburne gave this opening a whirl. In the 1 960's and 1 9 7 0's, the Dutch master Dick van Geet made some interesting attempts to re vive this opening, and he achieved some remarkable results with it. 1 .tbc3 is a natural developing move, and as such cannot be too bad. None theless, it has always been viewed with a certain amount of suspicion by ex perts, and therefore it is little played. But why, you may legitimately ask, espe cially when you consider that the other knight opening 1 .tbf3 is so popular? The point is that in a Queen's Pawn Game (and if Black replies l ...dS tl1at is exactly what you are playing) it is an accepted wisdom that the c-pawn should remain mobile, and therefore blocking its path with the knight contradicts tllis precept. However, the limitations of this dogma become clear when you remember the current popularity of the Chigorin ( 1 .d4 dS 2.c4 tbc6), in which Black cheerfully planks his knight in front of the c-pawn. 2 1 7 C hess Open i ng Essent i als - Vol um e 4 At the beginning of this century, the success top-grade players such as Moro zevich and Bauer had with the Chigorin inspired quite a large number of less talented players to follow suit. It can be a good choice for those who just simply want to play a game of chess without getting caught up in a super-analysed and highly theoretical duel so charac teristic of the modern Internet age. Another big plus for 1 . tt:'lc3 is that with so many possible transpositions, your adversary will often end up playing out of his repertoire. Here are a few examples: If Black plays 1 .. .eS , he will need to know how to handle the Vienna Game in the event that White continues with 2.e4; if he opts for 1 ... c5, he must be aware that af ter 2 .e4 he will be playing a Closed Si cilian; following l ...dS 2 .d4 tt:'lf6 3 .�g5 we are in the Veresov Opening; and af- ter 1 ... d5 2 .e4, with 2 ...c6 we have the Caro-Kann; and after 2 ...e6, the French. In reply to White's first move, Black can play almost every legal move on the board, but the four moves that follow are the most logical to choose from: A) 1 . ... ttJg8-f6 Black keeps his options open, which could be irritating for White, who is usually hoping for a favourable transpo sition .. .
2. tt:Jg1 -f3
After 2 .e4 we are in an Alekhine De fence declined - l .e4 tt:'lf6 2 .t2Jc3 - , which in turn can transpose to the Vi enna (2 .. .e5) or the French (2 . . .d5 3 .e5 tt:'lfd7 4.d4 e6) . If instead White decides to go for 2 .d4, after 2 . . .d5 , we are in Variation D. 2 1 8
2. ttJb8-c6!?
And the pretty set-up in the diagram makes the next remark somewhat un necessary! After 3 .e4 eS (3 ...d5 ! ? is possible) we are in the Four Knights Opening (Vol. 1 ) . The symmetry resulting from 3.d4 d5 renders the position arid: at least in Queen's Pawn Game positions in which the c2-c4 advance has been made im possible, White can apply some pressure to Black with �gS (Veresov Opening) , with the option of occupying the centre with f2-f3 and e2-e4. Here the presence of the knight on f3 robs the position of dynamism, and Black has no worries. B) 1 . c7-c5

ian, with the possibility of playing his other pawn to e4 at a later stage or not playing it at all. 2 .e4 immediately transposes to the Si cilian. Alternatively, there is 2 .d4, with the idea of activating the queen on the kingside. After an initial period of pop ularity, it was rarely played because after 2 . . . cxd4 3.'iYxd4 tt:lc6 4.'ib'h4 d5 ! 5 .e4 tLlb4!, White is forced to give up one of his bishops with 6 .�d3. This is too great a concession with such an open position.
2. ... tt:lb8-c6
The second move choice will decide which type of Sicilian Black wishes to play. Given the popularity of the Sveshnikov, this move is likely. Another favourite is 2 . . . tLlf6, with the idea of heading into a Dragon or Najdorf after 3 .d4 cxd4 4.tLlxd4 - White permitting of course. For Paulsen lovers 2 . . .e6 is a natural move to select.
3. d2-d4 c5xd4

Van Geet Opening 1 . <Zl b l - c 3 As you will note from the diagram, in respect to the Sicilian the move tL:lc3 has replaced e4. If White is not keen on transpositions, instead of playing e2-e4, he can fianchetto on the kingside or otherwise play jlgs after Black plays . . . tt:lf6. For his part, Black can avoid going into a Sicilian by playing 4 .. .d5 , but after 5 .e4! ? dxe4 6.tLlxc6 'iYxd l + 7 .Wxd l bxc6 8.tt:lxe4, the arid endgame positi on marked by a weak c-pawn is proba bly equal, though not fun to play.

Here we will look at opening ideas that are played less than one time in a thou sand, and which thus must be classified as rare. While opinions on the playability of these 'eccentric' lines may vary, one thing remains constant: an uninspiring performance rate (less than 5 0%) , which is not far above Black's score with regular openings. In tennis terms, White loses the advan tage of the serve and instead simply lobs the ball into the other side of the court. Many choose these openings for their surprise effect, however their poor performance discourages most players and they remain unpopular. Judging from their alternative names - including an Orang-Utan - , one could presume that many have been involved in the 'evolution' of these rare ope nings: two or more competing names are the norm. Regardless of the merits of competing claims, we have chosen those that are most commonly used. 2 2 8

Rare Openings In the first part of this chapter, we will have a look at the following openings:
0 Sokolsky Opening l .b4
0 Grob Attack l .g4
0 l .d3 0 l .e3 0 l .a3 This opening got an occasional outing in the 1 9th century. Tartakower jokingly baptized it the Orang-Utan, after spending some inspiring time at the ape enclosures in a zoo the day before he played the opening against Maroczy at the New York tournament of 1 924. This appealing but perhaps apocryphal story has captured people's imagination and the name has stuck. However, most texts prefer the more respectable sounding Sokolsky Opening, which honours the Soviet theoretician who wrote a monograph on the subject in the 1 960's. Obviously this eccentric pawn advance is the first step in creating an extended queenside fianchetto, and at the same time it grabs some space on this side of the board. Black can play almost anything in reply, but clearly moves that contribute to control of the centre or its occupation
A) 1 .
2 . �c1 -b2 lbg8-f6 e7-e6 White must lose a tempo to defend b4. It is curious that allchess engines prefer Black. Though this is probably unwar ranted, it is a httle discouraging for fans of this opening (not that they are that eas ily discouraged; an Internet site has been estabhshed to promote 1 .b4 and defend its honour against the sceptics' attacks!). 3 . a2-a3 Some prefer 3 .b5 , but after 3 . . .d5 4.e3 �d6 S .lbf3 lbbd 7 , the bS pawn does not look so useful.

2. 'ifd8-b6
And now we see the point of Black's first move: the b4 pawn is under attack and a subsequent . . .a7 -aS advance will put it under further pressure, which is unpleasant for White as the b 2 bishop is undefended.
3. a2-a3 a7-a5
4. c2-c41
Without this tactic, the Sokolsky would probably be rendered unplay able, given that 4.c3 is not strategically acceptable. Later it was discovered that it is also possible to defend the b4 pawn with
4.e3 ! ? axb4 S .�d4 ! , since 5 ...c5? is
met by 6.�xc5! and the tactic mentioned in the comment after 5.c5! also applies here. 4 . ... a5xb4 An almost automatic reply, but 4 .. .d6! ? is an alternative that merits consider ation.

Introduced by Uhlmann in 1 980, it was first thought that this move gave Black a plus. However, in reality White can maintain equilibrium. Another interesting possibility is 2 ... ..Bg4!?, which has more or less the

Sokolsky Open ing l . b2 -b4 By far and away the most common con tinuation. It may seem debatable to ex change a central pawn for a lateral one. However, Black's pieces will develop freely and actively, including the rook which will exert its power along the semi-open e-file. 2 . . .d6 is also frequently seen. This re flects Black's usual unfamiliarity with the Sokolsky: Black intends to develop his kingside bishop and continue in King's Indian fashion. After 3 .c4 g6
4.e3 �g7 S .tt::l
f3 tt::l f6 (S ... fS ! ? 6.d4 e4 is worth a thought) 6.d4!, White has been able to score well. The move 2 ...f6, which was played by Pillsbury in the 1 9th century, may be aesthetically displeasing, but it has its logic: it supplies rock-solid support for eS and the threat to capture the b4 pawn becomes real. Following 3 .a3 (the gambit line 3.e4 ..txb4 4.�c4 fails to convince) 3 . . . d5 4.e3 (4.b5 ! ?) 4 ...�e6 5 .d4 tt::l d7 6.tt::l f3 , it not clear if Black's centre is strong or weak.

'if g 5 ! with an advantage. 2 3 2 Grob Attack 1.g2-g4 This opening is named after the Swiss in ternational master Henry Grab, who in the 1 94-0's wrote a monograph on this subject, and who further explored its in tricacies in hundreds of correspondence games until the 1 970's. Of modern play ers of note, only Michael Basman used it with any regularity (in the 1 970's and 80's) . This comes as no surprise, given the Englishman's maverick approach to the opening phase of the game. What is the point of 1.g4 ? The ambition is to attack on the kingside. Consult any beginner's primer on chess and you will discover that control of the centre is a prerequisite for a flank attack; the problem with the Grob is that White ignores this fundamental principle when he plays this showy advance. If we take it for granted that 1 .g4- is not a useful move, the next question would be whether it actually harms White: here opinions differ. Its supporters cite surprise effect as one of its selling points, but the statistical evidence makes it clear that this is of very limited significance: overall, Black scores better than White after l .g4, which is com ment enough for most players. In effect the weakness on h4, and to a certain extent, also on f4, cannot be remedied as pawns cannot move back wards. This is not an academic consid eration: 1 .g3 has a significandy better performance ( 1 6% better!) than l .g4. As is natural, the two central pawn ad vances represent Black's most effective answer, with the d-pawn push the most popular (perhaps because it creates a discovered bishop attack on g4! ) .

The first tempo has been usefully em ployed, and White has played one of the key moves for various important ope nings: the Reti, the English and the King's Indian Attack are the most com mon. As a result, this opening does not have its own distinct identity and it is often used as a transpositional device, in the hope that Black may find himself out side his repertoire. l . .. dS is the statistically most common reply, and after the usual ti:Jf3 , tLl bd2 and e4, White is in the King's Indian Attack, but of course he has other op tions. 1 . . .. e7-e5 White generally chooses to enter the English by playing 2 .c4. Given that White has not immediately occupied the centre, a good alternative first move for Black might be 1 ... g6. Black adopts the same slow cautious strategy as his adversary and establishes a type of King's Indian. The two oppos ing forces eye each other from afar as they slowly ready for battle.

a A A A AAA In the second half of the 1 9th Century Adolf Anderssen started seven games that we know of with l .a2-a3 (and in one of these he beat Morphy!) . Of the modern players, only Velimirovic has played it, and then only occasionally. So what is the idea behind this move that does absolutely nothing in the fight for centre control? To help us understand better, it is useful to consider that a frequent preparatory move for Black is . . .a6. This a useful pawn move, and it is often a fundamen tal component in many Black defences: you only need to think of the Benoni or the Benko, or its frequent appearance in the French, the Pirc, the King's Indian, and above allin the Sicilian. Indeed in the Najdorf ( l .e4 cS 2 .tt:lf3 d6 3 .d4 cxd4 4.tt:lxd4 tt:lf6 S .tt:lc3 a6!) it is the key move in the whole line. It therefore comes as little surprise that some bright spark had the idea of play ing these set-ups with an extra tempo. However, it is essential to remember that . . .a6 is fundamentally a reactive move that prepares counterplay on the queenside in openings where White has already taken possession of the cen tre. The problem here is that it is impos sible to have counterplay if the other side is not attacking you. In other words, Black's best strategy is to avoid very sharp lines so as to reduce the usefulness of playing a2-a3. With this in mind, 1 ... tt:Jf6 and 1 ... g6 look suitable, and it is not a coincidence that they are the best performing re plies. 1 ... d5 is also excellent: after Vt:lf3 Black should simply avoid adventurous varia tions such as 2 ... c5 3.c4 d4, which al low White to play a Benko or Benoni with an extra tempo, and instead con tinue with the solid 2 ... tt:Jf6 , after which the value of a2-a3 is open to question. Needless to say, Black can also opt for 1 ...e5 . However, this allows White to enter the English with 2 .c4, where the move is quite normal. Otherwise White can play a strange form of Open Game ( l .e4 eS) with 2.e41?. Here a2-a3 is odd-looking but useful. Just think how nice it would be to al ready have a pawn on a6 in the Giuoco Piano, or even more so in the 1\vo 2 3 9 kkkk kkk

JiLb2 Re7 Very rare openings Now we have come to the last seven of the twenty legal moves with which White can open the game. When you think that the most com monly employed of these appears in only one game in 1 0,000, it becomes clear that this section is of limited prac tical importance as most of us will hardly ever have to deal with them. However, it is a most valuable exercise to look at the ideas behind these ope nings, even when they are debatable (indeed it is probably a more produc tive experience when they are dubi ous ! ) . This is because learning what not to do improves our overall understand ing of opening play. Seirawan recounts that when he was acting as a second to the American GM Tarjan, he spent entire weeks analysing an opening line for White, only to real ize that in fact the variation was played with the black pieces! Tarjan consoled the downcast Seirawan by wisely re minding him that all analysis is useful and good. Saragossa Opening 1 .c2-c3 1 . c2- c3 This is the best of the very rare ope nings. It supports the d2-d4 advance and therefore must have some merit. The preparatory . . .c7 -c6 is common in Black defences (Caro-Kann, Slav, Semi-Slav) , and thus to play this with an extra tempo could not be so bad. However, to play reactive black defences with reversed colours is a negative ap proach and the majority of players pre fer to play assertively when they have the advantage of the first move. The move in question has the virtue of allowing transpositions to many of White's openings and could thus take Black into unfamiliar territory: for ex ample after 1 ... c5 2.e4, we are in a Si cilian Alapin; following 1 ...e5 2.e4 you enter a type of Ponziani (and if Black is someone who never plays 1 .e4, it may be a nice idea to play 2 .c4! ? , transposing to a Sicilian!) . In response to 1 ... d5 and 1 ... tbf6, White

In the knowledge that h2-h3 is a valuable move in many White ope nings, Black's task is to establish set-ups where this move is of no particular use .. . or better still, a handicap! We must remember that h2-h3 , in addition to the benefit of controlling g4-, sup plies an escape square for the castled king. On the downside, it weakens g3 and creates possibilities for a sacrifice on h3 . Obviously, Black begins to take control of the centre with 1 ... e5 or 1 ... d5 . An in teresting alternative is 1 ... b6 , with the idea of discouraging 2.g4-, which has the threat (if that is the right word!) of transposing to the Grob. Black's performance with all of these replies is about the same and is equal to the overall performance of White with all openings. This means that choosing l .h3 is in effect allowing Black to play Clemenz Opening

and White is playing a type of reverse Modern (in which . . . ltJh6 is sometimes played) with the advantage of the extra tempo, and a reasonable position. Durkin Opening 1.tLlb1-a3 Generally lateral knight moves are dis missed as unproductive: a knight on the edge of the board controls fewer squares and is therefore less effective. However, this is only true to a certain extent: remember that the piece is mo bile and in one bound can reach c4, from which it controls important cen tre squares. Attitudes to lateral knight development are changing; in some recent games White (Russian grandmaster Zviagintsev) after l .e4 cS , continued with 2 .ltJa3 ' ?. The fact that he won both games would not be so surprising if his opponents were not both former world champions ( ! ) , Khalifman and Ponomariov, who are both famous for their opening ex pertise.

*h6 Reagan Attack 1 .h2-h4 What child has not thought at least once of playing h2-h4 so as to bring the rook into action with .l:!.h3 ? Then someone explains that exchang ing a rook for a bishop (sooner or later there is the inevitable ...�xh3) is like losing two pawns and l .h4 disappears from his or her embryonic repertoire. Even without the idea of a follow-up
2 J�h3 ,
1 . h2-h4 remains an extremely dubious move. The weakening of the kingside is not justified by dreams of some distant kingside attack. The normal l ...e5 or 1 . .. d5 give Black a lovely game, and he just needs to be careful not to castle too soon and in so doing favour White's opening move. Ware Opening 1.a2-a4 Like l .h4 in the Reagan, 1 . a2-a4 is more damaging than useful: however it is not as bad because problems on the queenside are generally less significant than on the kingside! White denies himself the possibility of playing a2-a3 , which is a big price to pay for the unnecessary control of b5 that this move grants. Almost all of Black's normal moves are good and will lead to positions where Black has better prospects than White. H4fi.Wifi.4H H4fi.W8fi.4H 11111111

&&&&&&& na&wfeian Chess Opening Essen t i als - Volu m e 4 1 .f2-f3 And now we are at the end of our four volume work. It is with regret that we finish with what is generally considered to be the worst of the 2 0 legal moves available to White at the beginning of the game. But as we have discussed the openings in descending order of popularity it was inevitable that at the end we would be scraping the bottom of the barrel! Given its lowly status, we preferred not to dishonour anyone by associating their name with this ill-advised move and we have simply called it 1.f3 . It is clear that this move makes no con tribution to development and weakens the king's security. Without doubt, Black's most effective reply is
1. ... e7-e5!
In a King's Pawn Game there are greater chances of exploiting the vulnerable monarch. The alternative 1 ... dS is not bad, but it allows 2.f4! ? with a transpo sition to the Dutch, which may not be the best on offer for White, but at least it is within the realms of the normal.
2. '>t>e1 -f2?!
An absurd but strangely frequent move. This is a multi-purpose bad move. White neglects development, loses the right to castle and places his king on a dangerous square. The chess engines give Black a slight ad vantage after 1 ...eS; after the king move, this evaluation correctly becomes a clear plus for the holder of the black pieces. The only good thing that can be said about 2.'it>f2 is that it is defmitely better than 2.g4??, which after 2 ... 'ifh4 re sults in the notorious Fool's Mate, whose delightful simplicity encourages children to believe that chess is an easy game to master. After the king move, we have
2. ... d7-d5
3. e2-e3 �f8-c5
and Black's better coordinated and more active pieces represent a clear ad vantage. The only explanation for opening with 1 .f3 is that in his surprise Black may do something foolish. Though this may occasionally happen, shooting yourself in the foot is probably not the best way to unsettle your adversary. As Bobby Fischer remarked: "I do not believe in psy chology, I believe in good moves". hear! hear !
