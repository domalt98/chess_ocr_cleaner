Chess Opening Essentials Volume 3 - Indian Defences, Complete Praise for Chess Opening Essentials Volume 1: The Complete l.e4 "The amount of information available on chess openings is so gigantic that one gets almost suffocated. In this book all l .e4 systems are clearly listed and presented, without losing itself in endless variations." FreeChess.com "Gives an outline of each opening and major variation in tum, explaining the ideas and most popular choices for the benefit of elementary players. I was impressed by the practical advice given in the notes in this well-produced volume." British Chess Magazine "Full of great ideas, clear explanations and instructive games ( ... ) I have frequently enjoyed browsing through the beautifully-presented volume." GM Paul Motwani, The Scotsman "I think this is one of the few nearly indispensable works on the openings that belong in every amateur's library." The Chess Mind "When you open this fat paperback for the first time, you will be surprised: color! Compared with this, books from Everyman, Gambit or Olms look like black-and-white television. ( ... ) Not only is the main line explained and the reader made hungry for more, but he gets enough strategic knowledge and insider-tips to get, even if he plays the opening for the first time, into the middlegame safely." Erik Rausch, Rochade Europa Magazine "It is about the basics of the opening, about ensuing middle game positions, and about the plans one should pursue. Ideal for the club player who wishes to improve." Nederlands Dagblad "At the beginning of each major variation there is an extensive exposition of ideas, structures and plans. The games do give a good impression of the style of a particular opening system and will help the student to decide if he feels 'at home' in the positions." Thomas Berens, Chess-International "A complete overview of all l .e4 openings, well explained with a large amount of readable text. Buy it for the clear cut explanations!" John Elburg Chess Reviews "A patzer like me, let alone someone with an Elo rating under 1700, should not buy a complex monography on the Najdorf before getting this instructive opening book." Pekka Pakarinen, Suomen Shakki Magazine (Finland) "Well organized, easy to follow, adequate space for notes to other opening references. Good explanations of why a particular opening is or isn't used by the world's best players." Mark Weeks, About.com "I don't think something like 'Chess Opening Essentials', in this size, yet exists. For players with a rating up to 1900 this book covers a large part of the road."

Preface This is an ideal book for the active club player who wants to understand what's going on in the opening of a chess game. I believe Chess Opening Essentials is: • Comprehensive: it covers all main variations likely to arise • Easy-to-use: important moves and key positions are highlighted in colour • Long-lasting: it doesn't outdate quickly because it is about the basics, not the latest fashions • Complete: it explains the plans and counterplans for both White and Black • Down-to-earth: simple, verbal introductions (no database-dump full of dead trees) • Convenient: every opening is illustrated with a number of instructive games. The authors quite lucidly explain the plans behind the various openings, as well as many subtle similarities and differences between them. This way, without giving endless variations, they manage to get across the essence of every opening. Also, the often colourful history of variations is elaborated upon in an entertaining way. Although Chess Opening Essentials is about understanding the ideas behind the openings, and not about following the latest fashions in top-level chess, we could not do without a limited amount of updating. This volume of the originally Italian series Capire le Aperture (published in 2005) has been brought up to date with new develop ments and games until the beginning of 2009. The colours in this book we believe to be a great help for the reader to navigate more quickly, and to distinguish between, for instance, main lines and others. Col oured text highlights important moves, and also key initial positions and positions arising after important sequences. Bold type, be it in black or in colour, indicates main lines, which are also classified and sub-classified. Lines given in italics are un sound lines that should be avoided. But this is not all. There are also numerous graphic features highlighting moves, plans, and strong or weak points. We believe that all this makes for a highly pleasant and accessible presentation, and hope that you, our readers, will agree. I am convinced that by studying this book, beginners, casual players as well as club players can improve their game and enjoy a deeper understanding of the game of chess in its entirety. For even stronger players it can be a tool to test and review their opening repertoire.

Introduction / \ In the second and third volumes in our series on the opening phase of the game we will study the positions that occur after the move 1.d4. We have decided to divide this into two volumes because of the large amount of material involved. In the second volume we have looked at all the defences that are defined by the move l...d5, and the less popular defences (the Dutch, the Modern, l ... e6 etc.). In this third volume we will examine all the defences that arise after l ... tLlf6 (the introductory move for the Indian defences). After the move l.d4, White has the same aim as with l.e4, namely to advance the companion central pawn two squares so as to physically occupy the centre. Aware of this, Black normally will exert control over the e4-square with one of the following moves in order to frus trate White's plan: 1 ...d5 1 ... lt:Jf6 (Vol.3) or- more rarely -with 1 ... f5

a<amias Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 3 After 1. e4, Black can let White occupy the two centre squares - by playing the French, the Caro-Kann or the Pirc- also after l.d4 Black can ignore White's threat to push his pawn to e4 and play 1 ... e6, 1 ... d6 or 1 ... c6. Here White is allowed the opportunity to play 2.e4- naturally, transposing into one of the semi-open games. However, most of the time, a l.d4-player will choose to play 2.c4 so as to remain within the realms of the Queen's Pawn Game. Throughout our book, we use the term Queen's Pawn Game in its most general sense, i.e. for any chess opening which starts with l.d4, regardless of whether White follows up with an early pawn advance to c4, or not. Let's go back a step, and repeat the question we asked at the beginning of the first volume: What is the best move in this position? The classical approach is still to occupy the centre with pawns. But which pawn should we move first, given that there are two centre pawns to choose from? As we noted before, our great-grand parents had few doubts: the move 1.e4! It favours the development of the king's bishop and the queen. It also has the ad- vantage of moving the strategic centre of gravity to the kingside (where we usually find the two kings after cas tling), laying the groundwork for an at tacking initiative against the black mon arch, something which is less common in the Queen's Pawn Game. Well, if all this is true, why is the move l.d4 equally popular and equally strong? The answer to this question lies in the fact that after Black's principal re sponses, White can continue with
2.c4!, leaving the c4 and d4 pawns
aligned, with strong control of the cen tre. This is not something that happens in a King's Pawn Opening; well, at least not in the open games, or when Black plays the Sicilian, with the very inten tion of denying White the opportunity to align the two centre pawns. To put things simply, you could say that with l.e4, White has the honourable intention of delivering a quick check mate to the black king; while the move l.d4 represents a more patient attempt to control the centre, acquire greater piece mobility, gain some material and win in the endgame. Therefore, we have the popular conception that l.d4 is a positional move, while l.e4 is an ag gressive, tactically orientated one. Even if this way of seeing things is to a certain extent true, one should keep an open mind. For example, the young Karpov - the quintessentially solid player - preferred to open with l.e4; Kasparov in the 19 70's and 80's- when AllHUi
[diagram]
&&&&&&&& he was probably even more aggressive than at the end of his career - usually chose 1.d4. With l.e4, it is doubtlessly true that White often has a good initiative against the black king from a strategic point of view -one only has to think of certain lines in the Sicilian. However, there are more than a few variations af ter 1 .e4 in which Black castles queen side, taking the king away from the heat of the battle, with the intention of fore- . ing a slow strategic struggle -the Clas sical Variation of the Caro-Kannimme diately comes to mind. There is also no doubt that 1.d4 is the more solid choice; however, there are certain lines in the Four Pawns Attack of the King's Indian, and even more so, in the BotvinnikVariation of the Semi-Slav (which we discuss in Vol ume 2), which are absolutely hair-rais- Introduction ing for even the most seasoned attack ing player. The point is that it is fine to know and respect the general principles that have shaped our chess thinking since the times of Wilhelm Steinitz. However, they should be utilized with the awareness that every position has its unique characteristics, and therefore generalisations may be irrelevant in any given position. Here is a useful example to make this idea clearer: if you employ three tempi to exchange a bad bishop for a good one, you perform a strategically justified manoeuvre. However, if in those three tempi your opponent can launch a win ning attack against your king, your ma noeuvre was simply a fatal error. Thus, we see the difficulty and beauty of chess: the necessity to be able to weigh up the interconnected relation ships between dynamic and strate gic/ positional elements. As we mentioned before, the Indian defences have l ... <iJf6 as a common de nominator. However, they are then later differentiated by Black's second or third move reply to 2.c4. Which move Black chooses will determine the strategic characteristics of the game. Below is a table of the most important defences we will deal with. 2 ... e5 Budapest Gambit 2 ...c5 3.d5 bS Benko Gambit 3 ... e6 Modern Benoni 2 ... e6 3.t2Jf3 b6 Queen's Indian 3 ... 1tb4+Bogo-Indian 2 ...e6 3.<iJc3 �b4 Nimzo-Indian 2 ...e6 3.g3 dS Catalan 2 ... g6 3.t2Jc3 dS Griinfeldindian 3 ... itg 7 King's Indian It is important to remember that White frequently plays 2.tt:Jf3 with the inten tion of delaying the c2-c4 advance. This move has already been discussed in the section on the Queen's Pawn Game ( I .d4 without an early c4 in the 2nd volume of our series). The knight move has the advantage of avoiding some defences (the Budapest Gambit, the Benko Gambit and the Benoni), but at the same time it obvi ously limits White's options as he can no longer push the f-pawn or develop the knight to e2. Before going on, we will have a glance at two rare minor lines: 2 .•. t2Jc6 with the replies 3. t2Jc3 and 3. t2Jf3, and 2 ..• b6. Indian Defences:

2 . ... tt:Jb8-c6 A somewhat provocative move that should not be underestimated; certainly, if its respectable results are anything to go by Black is not worried about the knight being kicked about and prepares a possible pawn advance to e5. Often you see transpositions to the Bogo-In dian or the Nimzo-Indian, and some times also the King's Indian. It is now a relatively fashionable defence and has been dignified with an imaginative name: the Black Knights' Tango. In ef fect, if White pushes d4-d5 and perhaps fl-f4, Black willmake a number of suc cessive knight moves that makes one think of a dance. However, White rarely cooperates by playing 3 .d5 as he usually wants to avoid creating the chaotic posi tions that Black would appear to enjoy A1 ) 3. t2Jb1 -c3 e7-e5

In the past, it was a favourite of Tartakower and Reti. Now it is given an occasional outing by strong players, but only as a means to get off the beaten path and it is not usually part of their normal repertoire; Its strategic concept is ambitious: Black wishes to demonstrate that the move
2.c4 is premature!
3. d4xe5
Thus, White's central pawn front is bro ken, and Black exploits the weakened dark squares with lively piece play. However, in real life thing do not al ways run so smoothly: Black must lose time to recuperate the pawn, often hav ing to exchange off one of the two bishops, only to find himself with a passive position that is usually without prospects. Because of this, riskier variations in which Black does not seek to win back the e5 pawn are becoming increasingly popular. These may be speculative lines, but in tournament play they often score well. Perhaps because White does not treat them with enough respect!

The plan was then to continue by solidly develop ing the bishop to e7, creating a position that resembles the Philidor Defence (l.e4 e5 2.tt.:lf3 d6), with the difference that White's pawn is on c4. The resulting positions are solid but a little passive. Nonetheless, it is not rare for the posi tion to open up after a long phase marked by lengthy manoeuvring. In the past, the Old Indian was played once in a while by Chigorin, Capablanca and Reti, and later on by Kotov, Bronstein, Boleslavsky, Petrosian and Larsen. It is still relatively popular as it is one of those openings one can play without having to remember long, precise move sequences; it is usually enough to under stand the typical manoeuvres.

An alternative is 3 . . .�fS , which is some times called the Janowsky Variation, which was also played by Colle and Capablanca. The idea is stop e2-e4. At this point, White can continue quietly with 4.g3 or 4.tbf 3 , and we have an Old Indian in which the bishop on fS does not seem so usefully placed. However, the critical move is obviously 4.f3, which endeavours to create a large cen tre with a gain of tempo: 4 . . .e5! S .e4 (S .dS e4!)

4.e4 has the advantage of physically

(needless to say, there are lots of alter native moves) transposing to the King's Indian or the Benoni, which we will look at later. C) 3 . ... e7-e5 This is sometimes called the Czech Benoni, and it is the most solid of the minor variations.
4. lLlb1 -c3 d7-d6
5. e2-e4
The closed centre allows for slow be hind-the-lines manoeuvring. However, White has a space advantage, which al lows him to manoeuvre with greater ease: in addition the bad bishop on f8 seem to be 'more bad' than its opposite number on fl. This is a strategically complex position; the classical approach is for White to at tack on the queenside with a3, b4, .ttbl etc., while Black will prepare play on the kingside with the advance ... £7 -fS in King's Indian fashion. However, re cently it has become increasingly popu lar to discourage this freeing advance with h2-h3 and g2-g4, and perhaps af ter queenside castling to start attacking on the kingside. For his part, Black can fianchetto the bishop on g7, but it is more in the spirit of the variation to de velop it to e7 and then after ... lLle8, White willing, exchange it for White's good bishop on g S.

Chess Opening Essenti als - Volume 3 This was formerly known as the Volga Gambit as it was analysed in Russia at the end of the 1 940's. Today, its name justifiably pays tribute to the Hungaro-American Pal Benko, who made it popular with the most persua sive of allarguments: good results. In addition, the Volga was generally asso ciated with a violent pawn break on e6, while now in the Benko Black replies to
4. c4xb5
with the characteristic 4 . ... a7-a6! establishing a more positional ap proach. The Benko has become a feared and re spected weapon, and there is more than one player who willchoose 2.ttJf3 so as to avoid it. It is true that after 2 ... cS 3.dS , Black can play 3. ..bS anyway; however, without a white pawn on c4 it is less ef fective, and after 4.�gS!, White can play a favourable line of the Torre Attack. The Benko Gambit is one of the most important milestones in the evolution of chess theory, and it is one of the pur est examples of a positional sacrifice: Black gives up a pawn in order to acti vate his pieces on the queenside, with enduring pressure. Let's look at the following historical po sition: It is from the Taimanov-Bronstein game played in the famous 1 953 Zurich Can didates' tournament. Black maintained ongoing positional pressure and won the game. A classical evaluation would tell us that White has an almost decisive advantage thanks to his extra pawn and the passed a-pawn. However, after this game, it was understood that even after simplifying with piece exchanges, Black's initiative makes it difficult, if not impossible, for White to exploit his ma terial advantage -even in the endgame. In the above game, the ... b7-bS push was not made on the third move but later on, and it was White who took on a6 with his bishop, whereas in the nor mal Benko Black's capture on fl forces White to lose tempi moving his king. In other words, though we are looking at a less favourable version for Black, the game teaches us to look at this type of Benko Gambit
1.d2-d4Ng8-f6 2.c2-c4
c7-c5 3.d4-d5 b7-b5 posltlon from a different perspective and as possibly playable for Black. In the light of this, it is not surprising that many white players would rather not have to face this sort of initiative, and will therefore decline the gambit. In a gambit, you should never underes timate the importance of psychology: the fact that White scores better if he declines the Benko Gambit does not necessarily prove that this 'prudent' ap proach is objectively better. It is more likely that for stylistic reasons Black is psychologically less suited for the quiet lines that he now has to play, and thus performs less well. Benko Gambit Declined -

White would be a pawn up if he took on a6, but instead he loses a tempo giving up his pawn. The con cept is the product of the dynamic style that characterises contemporary chess. White keeps the a-file closed and denies Black his usual counterplay. Recently, this idea is seen with 4.a4 or 4.tbf3 , whenever Black takes on c4. However, here there is also the advantage that the b6-square is weakened, and the a4-a5 manoeuvre combined with tbf3-d2-c4 can be highly effective. 01) 5 . ... �d8xb6 The most natural, but here the queen is exposed to attack after the knight tour tbf3 -d2-c4.

g7 39>g4+ Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 3 Modern Benoni Defence
1.d2-d4 ct:Jg8-f6 2.c2-c4
c7-c5 3.d4-d5 e7-e6 The diagram shows the starting positi on of the Modern Benoni. The defence is called modern so as to distinguish it from the antique defence of the same name l . . . cS 2 .d5 eS . Few know that its name comes from the He brew ben-oni, which means 'child of my sorrow'. A Jewish scholar named Aaron Reinganum suffered from depression and sought relief at the chessboard, which resulted in a published analysis of this defence. When published the ti tle alluded to his sad period of study with the words ben-oni and thus the name. Not the most encouraging name for an opening, but certainly appropriate for its debut appearances: as you will see in the section on the Czech Benoni, the resulting positions did indeed sadden the heart of many a black player. It was only later on, when people started to realise the dynamic potential of the modern version, that the time for White to suffer began. We are therefore dealing with a double-edged defence in which either side can easily trip up and lose. The nicest summary of the Mod ern Benoni was provided by the Irish-born Master and World War II code-breaker C.H. O'Donel Alexander, who wrote: If God played the Benoni against God, I believe White would win. But at the human, even World Championship, level, practical chances are about equal. In old opening manuals the Benoni was once called the New King's Indian as it was considered to be a version of the King's Indian in which Black 'more properly' advances the pawn to cS, in stead of playing the 'anti-positional' . . .e 7 -eS pawn push, which renders the g 7 bishop bad. However this is a limited assessment: the . . . eS advance, which is so common in the King's In dian, is made with the intention of a kingside attack by Black. Such an attack is a rarity in the Benoni, which is why more players prefer to play the King's Indian rather than the 'version' with . . .c7-c5 . The Modern Benoni started to become popular towards the end of the 1 9 5 0 's when the brilliant victories of the rising star Mikhail Tal forced dogmatic com mentators to accept its strategic validity. In the decades that followed, it was oc casionally employed by many champi ons with an aggressive playing style, suffice it to mention Fischer and the young Kasparov. At the beginning of the new millennium, Topalov is the only one of the elite that still uses it with any frequency.

After 3 . . .e6, the most popular move is also the most natural:
4. ti:lb1 -c3
Before looking at that, let's examine two alternatives that are important for transpositional reasons. A) 4. g2-g3 - � j_ if � i. J: i i i i i i i � 8 8 8 8 8 8 :a: CLJ it iY w it tt:J :a: This position is often reached by means of the following sequence: 1 . d2-d4 ti:lg8-f6
2. c2-c4 e7-e6
3. g2-g3
White wants to play a Catalan, but after
3. ... c7-c5!?
A player who would normally play the Nimzo- or Queen's Indian, will play the aggressive Benoni as White has re duced his options with g 3 . Now 4.4Jf3 transposes to the Symmet rical English, but after the normal.
4. d4-d5
We have the diagram position.
4. ... e6xd5
Here it would be dubious to continue along the lines of the Benko with 4 . . .b5 ?! as there is 5 .dxe6 fxe6 6.�g2.

8 8 8 8 8 8 :a: CLJ it iY w it :a: This position too is often reached by means of another move sequence: l .d4 tbf6 2 . c4 e6 3 .4Jf3 cS ! ?. As with the previous line, Black is not averse from complicating the game. It would be opportune to stress that a Nimzo-Indian player (2 . . . e6 3 .4Jc3 �b4) is not as conservative as you might think. As we will see, this is a de fence that entails taking strategic risks, and which is often played with the full point in mind. Aware of this fact, if Nb1-c3 C hess Openi ng Essentials - Volume 3 Black is presented with 3 . tt:Jf3 , he will often abandon the somewhat arid solid ity of the more popular 3 . . .d5 (Queen's Gambit) , 3 . . . b6 (Queen's Indian) or 3 . . .�b4+ (Bogo-Indian) , and accept the adventure of the stormier Benoni. This choice has another benefit: White can no longer play the annoying sys tems involving f2-f4 or tt:Jge2 . For example, the Romanian GM Suba exclusively plays this Nimzo-Indian/ Benoni combo when he faces l .d4. In deed, many of those who believe the Taimanov Attack (7.f4 and 8 .�b5 + , discussed later) t o b e very strong, dog matically assert that to wait for 3 . tt:Jf3 or 3 .g3 before pushing . . . c7 -cS is the only way to make the Benoni playable; but quite frankly, this seems to be an ex aggerated claim. With the move 4.d5 we arrive at the previous diagram posi tion. Now, 4.
5. c4xd5
6. tt:Jb1 -c3
e6xd5 d7-d6 transposes to normal lines of the Benoni, whereas 4 . . .b S ! ? is the Blumenfeld Gambit, which we look at next. In conclusion, remember that you can play the Modern Benoni with the se quence 2 . . .e6 and 3 . . . c5 . This approach does not have any partic ular negative aspects, and indeed White will often have problems harmonising his repertoire. We will provide an ex ample to make this last point clearer: let's say that a player facing the Benoni likes the Kapengut System with 7 .f3 ; all's well if Black plays 2 . . .c5 . Now let's imagine that the same player enjoys playing against the Queen's Indian, af- ter 2 . . . e6 he would play 3 .tt:Jf3 . But if Black plays 3 . . .c5 , after 4.d5 White will have to adopt a line against the Benoni that would not be his first choice. On the other hand, players who play 3 .tbc3 after 2 . . . e6 will not have any problems. In this case, it is irrelevant whether Black advances ... c7 -cS on the second or the third move. We have now come to the main line.
1. d2-d4 tt:lg8-f6
2. c2-c4 c7-c5
3. d4-d5 e7-e6
4. tt:Jb1 -c3 e6xd5
5. c4xd5
Now some offbeat players choose 5 . . .�d6 with the idea of moving the bishop to c7 and perhaps aS. It may be hard to take this line seriously, but it would be a mistake to underestimate it as it has performed reasonably well. However, most people choose to play:
5. ... d7-d6
It is clear that we are looking at a defence that carries some risks and which is de manding to play. White has a central pawn majority and the prepared pawn push to eS would be devastating. How ever, Black has his trumps: the bishop on g7 has more scope on the dark-squared diagonal, and Black will try to create queenside counterplay with . . . a7 -a6 and ...b7-b5 (a plan that White will oppose with a2-a4) . These pawn moves will provide good counterplay on the queenside, and without having to sacri fice a pawn as in the Benko ! Anyway, enough chat. Let's look at the moves.

The text move introduces the menacing Penrose Variation, named in honour of the English player who defeated the mighty Tal in 1 960. White's plan is O-O, tbg3 , f4, with a possible 'i¥f3 and �gS , after which the threat of the positional sacrifice eS-dxeS-fS is looming. Naturally, Black does not just sit there twiddling his thumbs while all this is happening, and he has a number of re sources at his disposal. However, if Black plays mechanically he may find himself losing with remarkable speed. Compared to other lines, White does not adequately control the c4-square, and Black's counterplay centres on the pawn advance c5-c4 supported by the queen on c7. This will in turn make the ... b7 -bS advance easier. In addition, the cS-square will be an excellent square to activate the d7 knight. As you will now appreciate, the level of positional and tactical tension imme diately rises, and we are now in one of the most complicated lines of the Benoni.

Chess Opening Essentials- Volume 3 Another idea is Polugaevsky's 1 l .�c2 tbeS 1 2. b3!?. It is a little played line but worthy of consideration. 1 1 . ... tt:Jd7-e5 The key position of the Classical Benoni. Black stops lLlc4 and saves the tempo necessary to play . . .a7-a6 so he can immediately become active on the kingside. Usually, Black continues with the somewhat risky . . .gS. This move weakens the light squares, but sets up good play on the dark squares with ei- ther . . . lLle5-g6-f4 or, after the further push . . .g5-g4, with . . . lLlf6-h5-f4 and . . . 'iVd8-f6. White, for his part, will manoeuvre so as to place the knight on g3 or e3 , with the option of a timely f2-f4 advance, whereas the rook on a3 will have an im portant defensive role on the kingside. As you will have noted, this is a position of great complexity that is characterised by an eternal theme: dynamic advan tages on one side pitted against struc tural superiority on the other. 1 2. Ita1 -a3 1 2 .'iWc2 usually transposes (unless Black plays the Fischer-like move 1 2 . . . ltJhS ! ?) . An effective alternative plan is 1 2 . l::r e 1 in order to transfer the knight to g3 via fl . 1 2. ... g6-g5 1 3. li'd1 -c2 In addition to freeing the d 1 -square, this move defends e4 and allows lLlc4 in some lines. 1 3. ... g5-g4 After 1 3 . ..a6 1 4.lLld 1 tt::l g6 1 S .tt::l e3 tt::l f4 1 6.�d 1 b6 1 7 .f3 ltJ6h5 , White's positi on seems more harmonious, but in practical play Black has excellent oppor tunities.

1.d2-d4 ti:Jg8-f6 2.c2-c4
e7-e6 3.g2-g3 d7-d5 8':R 88 �['i" :a:tt:J �iY� �tbtt This is the starting position of the Cata lan. It acquired its name as it was first played by Tartakower in the Barcelona tournament of 1 929. Tartakower played d4, tt:Jf3, g3, .tg2 against Marin y Llovet and named the opening, which was not original, after the region. The move c2-c4 later became an essential part of the system. As you will note from the diagram, we are dealing with a type of Queen's Gambit Declined in which White fianchettos his king's bishop instead of developing it to e2 or d3. This brings with it the advantage of increased pres sure on the important long light squared diagonal (it is no coincidence that the 'Catalan bishop' has become a byword for this effectively placed bishop). The downside is that the c4 pawn is left to its fate, and when Black captures it with no intention of giving it back - as in certain lines of the Open Catalan - the game takes on the violent characteristics of a gambit. This may not always be to the taste of a l .d4-player, who will usually prefer a more positional approach to the open ing. Regarding move order, we will respect the ECO classifications that consider the Catalan as part of the Indian Defence family (Vol.3). This is in fact debatable: the opening is conceptually part of the Queen's Gambit, given that Black's d-pawn is on dS. However, it must be noted that the Cata lan is a flexible opening, and can be reached by a number of different move sequences: I .tbf3 , l .c4 and l .g3 can all lead into the Catalan. Nonetheless, White usually waits for Black to play ... dS before opening the fianchetto. For example for the ECO, if Black plays 3 . . .c5 ! , the game is likely to transpose into an English or Benoni line. Needless to say, Black has the additional option of 3 ...�b4+, along the lines of the Bogo-Indian. For this reason, White often plays 3 .tbf3 and will only con tinue with 4.g3 . If Black plays 3 ...d5 , however, this ap proach means that White must be ready to deal with the Bogo-Indian or the Queen's Indian. A further problem with classification is created by the possible presence of a knight on c3 . Often this will involve the sacrifice of the c4 pawn; Black's pawn on c4 will often be supported by ...bS , cre ating positions normally associated with the Semi-Slav. For example, in the pre viously discussed Romanishin Varia tion of the Semi-Slav ( l .d4 dS 2.c4 c6 3 .tbf3 tbf6 4.tbc3 e6 S .g3 ! ?), whenever Chess Opening Essentials- Volume 3 Black takes on c4 he enters the Open or Accepted Variation of the Catalan. Let's go back to the position in the dia gram: after
4. �f1 -g2
(the alternative move 4.tbf3 does not change things much), fundamentally, Black has three approaches: - to take immediately on c4: Open Catalan -capture the c4 pawn after 4 ... �e7 so as to be ready to castle: Semi -Open Catalan -ignore the c4 pawn and develop sol idly: Closed Catalan Open Catalan 1 . d2-d4 tt:lg8-f6
2. c2-c4 e7-e6

This move is played not so much with the idea of maintaining the extra pawn, but more to obtain active piece play, and with it greater chances of vic tory.
5. tt:lg1 -f3
the normal move was S .'i'Va4+ in order to win back the pawn on c4. Now it has become clear that after 5 ... 4Jbd7 6.4Jf3 a6 7 .'liVxc4 bS 8.'liVc6 l:.b8 9.O-O �b7 1 0.

as is so often the case, positive and neg ative aspects are inevitable bedfellows in so many positions, and thus we are speaking about a commonly held opin ion and not an absolute truth.
7. 'il'd1 -c2
Easily the most common reply. It has the merit of 'forcing' Black to play ... c6 as the natural 7 . . .b6 gives White an advan tage after 8.cxd5 due to the hole on c6. After 7 .b3 b6! 8.�b2 �b7 , Black man ages to push his pawn to cS using just one tempo. The ambitious 7 .tt::l c3 is playable, but after 7 ...dxc4! 8 .e4 c6 9.a4 (9.�f4!?) 9 ...e 5 ! , Black has scored well.
7. ... c7-c6
Basically, White can now choose be tween two plans: move the knight to d2 and then advance the pawn to e4, or otherwise transfer the knight to c3 after b2-b3 and prepare the e2-e4 push with lld1 or with �b2 and .l:!.ad l . There is also the interesting alternative of 8.�f4, which is played so as to inter fere with Black's queenside develop ment, and then after 8 . . . tt::l hS the plan is to follow up with 9. tt::lbd 2 ! ?.

. :g- ttJ i, 'iY � � � After 4.d5 Black can transpose with 4 ...exd5 to a Benoni in which White has played tt:lf3 instead of tt:lc3 . He also has another option: 4 .. .b7 -b5. This line was successfully employed by Alekhine in his famous 1 922 game against Tarrasch. At first it was a big hit, but with the discovery of 5 .�g5 its popu larity quickly waned. Today, this pre sumed refutation has itself been refuted and the move is no longer feared: as a result, the Blumenfeld Gambit has be come relatively fashionable again. How ever, although it is now considered playable, it still remains a line that involves taking risks. The move 4 ...b5 is very logical; with
4.d5, White has exposed the head of the
pawn chain, but Black attacks its base. The problem is that if White takes on e6 and then on b5, he willbe a pawn to the good. The compensation is apparent, but a pawn sacrifice is not to everyone's taste. At first glance, the Blumenfeld appears to be a close relative of the Benko; however, this is purely an optical illu sion. In the Blumenfeld, a pawn is given up so as to take possession of the centre (the validity of this concept was already well understood in the pioneering days of chess theory, and thus such a gambit was frequently seen in the 1 920's) ; on the other hand, the compensation in the Benko is represented by the ability to apply pressure along the a- and b-files. This compensation is far less 'concrete' , and it is thus no coincidence that half a century had to pass before its merit was appreciated . A) 5. d5xe6

e7-e6 3.ttJg1-f3 �f8-b4+ K � .t 'iV • K l i l l l l l · � CfJ 8 8 8 8 8 8 � CfJ � 'iV w � � The Bogo-Indian is so named in hon our of the Ukrainian/ German Efim Bogoljubow, who played it several times in the 1 920's against some of the best players of that time. However, it should be noted that his early results with the defence were not thrilling ( + 1 - 4 = 2 ) . Indeed, the defence has always been perceived as solid but passive; a probable explanation for its limited popularity (the Queen's Indian is played three times as often) . On the other side of the coin, many players - Petrosian and Smyslov come readily to mind - have been attracted to the defence because the importance of strategic themes appealed to them and there was not the need to memorise the long move sequences of alternative sharp defences. Others, such as Keres - and more recently Kortchnoi -, have in stead introduced various sharp lines into the Bogo. This demonstrates again, that while the Bogo-Indian is no Sicilian Dragon, the scope for interpretation in an opening is greater than you would imagine. A good example of this is Kasparov, who injected new cutting vig our into many of the lines used against the Griinfeld and the Queen's Indian that had previously been considered to be relatively tame. Naturally. there are limits as to how far you can take this: the nature of some lines demands a closer adherence to their strategic character: for example, within the realms of the Queen's Pawn Game it would hardly appear feasible to play the Orthodox Defence aggressively; or worse still, a solid and restrained King's Indian! The Bogo-Indian is considered to be the little brother of the Queen's Indian (3 . . .b6) , and it includes many identical strategic themes and there are possible transpositions. It is also conceptually re lated to the Nimzo-Indian ( 3 . tLlc3 �b4) , in as much as Black - especially in the 4.tLlbd2 line - is calmly prepared to concede the bishop pair. Now we have arrived at White's two re plies: 4.tLlbd2 and 4.�d2 And why not 4.tLlc3 ? In fact the move is playable, very popu lar and indeed has a name: the Kasparov Variation (that man's name automatically gives credibility to any line! ) . However, i t i s a normal part of the Nimzo-Indian (which is discussed later) , in which the development of the knights is in reverse order (3 .tLlc3 �b4
4.tLlf3 ) , while this line is a rarity in the
Bogo. This comes as no surprise; a per- son who prefers 3 . t2Jf3 to 3 . tbc3 is more likely to be a conservative solid player, and thus it is normal that after the check on b4 such a player would wish to avoid the complex strategic ad ventures associated with 4.tbc3 . In addition, many people have been dis couraged from exploring the line be cause in several old opening manuals,
4.t2Jc3 was considered to be dubious
due to 4 .. .�xc3 + (played before White can avoid having his pawns doubled) S .bxc3 d6.

& i '.i i i i & i .� ttJ 8 ,.f::, · 8 ·"'8 · � v � � :g Needless to say, in reality things are more complex. It is true that from Black's viewpoint you are looking at a somewhat improved version of the Samisch Variation of the Nimzo-In dian (3 .t2Jc3 �b4 4.a3 �xc3 + S .bxc3) as the f3 knight is stopping the danger ous pawn moves f3 followed by e4. However, this is a static consideration: White has already developed his knight, and an extra tempo is an extra tempo. Therefore, the current theoretical evalu ation which gives White a small advan tage seems to be more correct. In con clusion: if you play the Bogo-Indian, do not forget 4. tbc3 ! A) 4. tt:lb1 -d2 Bogo-Indian Defence White ambitiously avoids the exchange of bishops so as to maintain the tension. Inexplicably, despite it scoring better, this line is a lot less popular than the bishop move alternative. A1 ) 4 . ... d7-d6 A theme often seen in the Nimzo-In dian. Black is about to concede the bishop and he therefore puts his pawns on dark squares (usually d6 and eS) so that his other bishop will be good.

In the past, theory maintained that this absence clearly favours White, both for the extra tempo gained (the queen is better on d2 than on d 1 ) and given that his central pawns are on light squares, Black should not have parted with his good bishop. All in all, these are aca demic considerations when you take into account that the pawns still rela tively mobile and not blocked as they are in the French. In addition, this eval uation ignores the fact that piece ex changes favour the side whose position is cramped. Furthermore, in this spe cific case, the concrete value of this stra tegic concept is seen immediately.

It is so named because the queen's bishop is developed with a queenside fianchetto, as opposed to the kingside fianchetto that characterises the King's Indian. Nimzowitsch played it first in 1 9 1 4 (the stem game was Blackburne-Noa, Frankfurt 1 88 7 ) , and it became increasingly popular during the 1 92 0 's when it was adopted by Samisch, Bogoljubow, Alekhine, Euwe and Capablanca... a formidable group indeed! It is still a favourite; in the 1 9 7 0's the Russian Anatoly Karpov used it, and today it is frequendy employed by Kramnik, Anand, Adams, Leko and Judit Polgar; once again the creme de la creme! Strangely, despite the fact that virtually every champion has used it, amongst amateurs it is litde appreciated and has the reputation of being solid and boring. There is no doubt that there are some lines that quickly lead to ex- changes and lifeless positions, and they are often played out by grandmasters with the tacit understanding that the in tention is a quick draw. Thus, there is the perception that the Queen's Indian is only good for a draw and not favourable for players whose aim is to win, be they White or Black. It is no surprise that the notoriously ag gressive King's Indian is often de scribed as an opening for the young, while the Queen's Indian is for the old. Predictably, opinions differ as to whether this is a compliment or not! The reality is that Black has some sharp options, usually centred around ...�a6 or the advance . . .c7 -cS , and these lines are now the most popular in a period where dynamism is the watchword. Naturally, the Queen's Indian cannot stand alone in the centre of Black's rep ertoire as it can only be employed against 3 .lLJf3 . Against the equally popu lar 3 .lbc3 the Nimzo-Indian is an ex cellent companion in a repertoire for a positionally-minded player who, though prepared to concede a draw, is seeking a win without taking excessive risks.
3. ... b7-b6
A logical move: this cannot be played a move earlier as White would take con trol of the centre with lbc3 , 'iYc2 and e4. Black profits from White's previous move ( lLJf3 does not control e4 and makes f2-f3 impossible) to adopt a strategy based on piece control of the e4-square ( ... lbf6, ... .ab7 and . . .�b4) , instead of the pawn push to dS as in the Queen's Gambit. However, the fact that now the bishop can be developed to a6, or that the pawn is often advanced to dS , shows the strategic richness of C hess Opening Essentials - Vol u m e 3 chess, and cautions us to avoid dogmatic thinking. The two main lines (4.a3 and 4.g3) are sufficiently important to merit individ ual sections dedicated to them alone. However, before looking at these, we would like to discuss the following im portant options: A) 4. �c1 -g5 A typical move from the good old days, but no longer a popular choice. It is now understood that �gS is more ef fective when Black has lost the opportu nity to unpin the knight with . . . Jl.e7 , as we will see in Variation D. In this case, Lasker's advice to develop knights be fore bishops is wise!
4. ... ..Bc8-b7
The more ambitious 4 ...h6 also seems promising: S .�h4 �e7 6.tLlc3 cS ! ?.

It may not be as popular as it once was, but it still re mains a dangerous weapon, especially if Black plays mechanically. The idea is to develop the bishop outside the pawn chain, and to follow up with e3 , h3 and, if Black pushes to ... d7-dS , with tLleS and g4/g5. 4 . ...
5. e2-e3
Jl.c8-b7 Jl.f8-e7 Sometimes you see 5 ...�b4+, which is playable: 6.tLlfd2 ! ? O-O 7 .a3 �e7 8.tLlc3 dS , with a Queen's Gambit pawn struc ture, but the knight is poorly placed on d2.

Sometimes White places this knight on d2, but developing it to c3 seems more active and natural.

And we have entered a position that is classified as belonging to the Nimzo Indian, but which in terms of philoso phy and statistical frequency is best dealt with here. Some call this hybrid line the Nimzo-Queen's Indian; not very catchy, but at least, for a change, we have an informative name! The natural 4 ... .Bb7 is obviously play able, but it allows White the opportunity to play 5 .a3 ! and transpose into a line of the Petrosian Variation in which Black does not have the option of 4 ...�a6 and 4 ...c5 (see the next section) . Indeed, there are more than a few White players that prefer to enter the Petrosian Varia tion by means of 4.tt:lc3 , even though they must be prepared to battle against the line being discussed. Now White has two principal alterna tives, remembering that S . e3 transposes to the Rubinstein Variation of the Nimzo-Indian. 1 02 01 ) 5. 'tWd1 -b3 This is Seirawan's favourite move.

- � .t•• .t .i i i i i i i i i � b b b ttJ b b b b b ldttJ�'i¥�� � It seems excessively prudent to use a valuable tempo to stop ... �b4; yet para doxically this line is famous as the most aggressive way to fight the Queen's Indian. The explanation for this is that without the annoying ...gb4, White is ready to play ti:lc3 and further prepare for the e2-e4 advance with 'iYc2 or d4-d5 . White's aim is to control the centre by means of direct physical occupation, in- stead of the more distant control that characterises other Queen's Indian lines. Naturally, the game immediately becomes sharper. This line was named after the great Tigran Petrosian, who used it to achieve some important victories from the early 60's on (often with the sequence 4.4Jc3 iLb7 5 .a3) . However, he was not the first to play it; suffice it to say that Sul tan Khan used it to beat Capablanca (!) in Hastings 1 9 3 0 I 3 1 . In fact, the person whose name would most merit to be tagged to the variation is Garry Kasparov, who employed it in the 1 980's to notch up many brilliant victories, and in doing so, helped it to become one of the most played and heavily analysed defences in all opening theory. At the time of writing, it is still very popular, and it is only slightly less common than 4.g 3 , which has always been supported by a committed group of enthusiasts. Enough of words, let's look at the moves: we will now examine Black's three main continuations in order of as cending popularity, namely 4 ...c5 , 4 .. .iLa6 and 4 ...iLb7 . A) 4 . ... c7-c5 Emboldened by White's quiet fourth move Black establishes a Benoni pawn structure. Despite scoring well, this move is not often played; probably because some one who loves the Benoni will play the defence from the outset, and a black player who is not wild about the Benoni will avoid this transposition.
5. d4-d5
Q ueen 's Indian D e fence 5 . ... iLc8-a6 This is the move that is almost always played. However, it is difficult to believe that 5 ... exd5 could be so bad: 6.cxd5 d6 7 .4Jc3 g6, and now it is hard to imagine that in comparison with a nor mal Benoni White's push a2-a3 is more useful than Black's pawn move . . .b7 -b6.

It would be quite reasonable for a reader to object to this move on the grounds that we are always having it drummed into us that you should not move the same piece twice in the ope ning, which is a very valid piece of ad vice most of the time. However, in this case Black correctly believes that for his ends (the pawn advance to cS) White's queen is worse off on c2 than it is on d 1 . Whether the idea of pushing the pawn to cS is good or not is another question.

4. g2-g3
This has always been the most popular move. White develops his fi bishop on the long diagonal to contest control of e4 and to oppose its counterpart on the 1 1 4 black side. The light-squared bishops are often exchanged off, producing a drawish position, which explain the line's reputation for solidity. However, if the draw rate is higher than normal, it follows that the number of Black victo ries is smaller, which is appealing to many who play 3 . tt:lf3 with a safety first mentality. Black has two main replies: the classical 4 .. . .itb7 and the modern 4 .. .�a6. The move 4 . . . ltb4+ transposes to the Bogo-Indian or to one of the main al ternatives. We should quickly mention the 'ugly' 4 .. .c6!?: after 5 .�g2 d5 White cannot avoid going into a Closed Catalan. The Classical Variation:

'iY \¥1 i. . � This line was greeted with scepticism when it was first played by Nimzowitsch in 1 92 5 , and it was only in the 1 95 0 's that we start to see it be ing used with relative frequency, even though much more rarely than its 'nat ural' alternative. This is curious, as the performance statistics for that period demonstrate that 4 ...�a6 scored signif icantly better. In the 1 980's, 4 ...�a6 overtook 4 . . .�b7 in popularity (Kasparov and Karpov started to use 4 ...�a6 in their matches, and we all like to play the moves of champions) , and in recent years it has been played more frequently than 4 ...�b7 . This comes as no surprise; on a 6 the bishop is more active (attacking c4) , and the fact that to the classical eye the move looks ugly is of little interest to the modern player, who is always on the lookout for plans that offer reason able chances of winning. The dynamic quality of modern chess is not so much the fruit of a different phi losophy, but more the result of practical thinking. With the proliferation of open tournaments, the percentages sufficient to win a round-robin are no longer good enough, and it is obvious that when a draw is not sufficient for either side, the game is going to becom.e sharper. White has 5 reasonable ways of defend ing the c4 pawn. A) 5.l\Yd1 -c2 �a6-b7 Otherwise 5 ...c5. with a transposition after 6.d5 ! �b7 7 .�g2 . 6 . �f1 -g2 c7-c5

Black can take on d5 with either the knight or the bishop, and in both cases White's compensation seems nebulous. Q ueen 's Indian Defence However, over-the-board experience at the very highest level (Kramnik, Topalov, Carlsen, Gelfand and Aronian, to name a few) has demonstrated that there is concrete compensation. Though White is not objectively better off, to date no-one has yet discovered a clear line that allows Black to equalise. Given the optimum results White has achieved after 8 . . . �xd5 9 . tbc3 �c6

White enjoys the technical advantage of the bishop pair, but it will be difficult for him to open up the position and profit from this. Black's set-up is solid and elastic, and the still fluid pawn structure offers him various plans to choose from. In short, this is the sort of position that favours the player with a better understanding of strategy, who will probably win regardless of the colour of his pieces. E) 5. b2-b3 The most popular choice by a big mar gin. White defends c4 once and for all, freeing his pieces to develop. A minor drawback are the weaknesses created on c3 and a3 . E1) 5. b6-b5 Introduced by Adorjan in the 1 980's. It is a curious fact that this is the best per forming, yet the least played move: probably because it is aesthetically un appealing to a positionally-minded Queen's Indian player. The move in it self is logical: it attacks c4 and if White takes on bS , Black will be left with an extra centre pawn. However, this strat egy is accompanied by a certain delay in development.

The fact that there are four other equally valid alternatives here ( ...aS , ...cS , ... �c6 and ...�b4+) is testimony to the strate gic richness of this line. However, the number one choice for top players is 7 ...dS . It looks bad to leave a backward pawn on c7, but Black's idea is to close the centre and play on the queenside.

Until now no one has been able to come up with a convincing plan for White. This appears odd when you con sider that the semi-open c-file is ready to be exploited and the a7 and c7 pawns appear to be weak. However, with the absence of the usual white pawn on c4, Black's pawn centre seems to be very stable and most of the time the queenside weaknesses have little real impact on the game.

the e4-square by playing. 3 . . . iH8-b4 instead of physically occupying the centre with 3 . . .d5, as occurs in the Queen's Gambit Declined. The Nimzo-Indian is one of the most in structive defences in that it illustrates more than most lines the eternal strug gle of bishop against knight, and the contrast between the dynamic and static elements in a position. Nimzowitsch played it for the first time in 1 9 1 4 (the very same year in which he introduced the Queen's Indian to the world!) . In fact, the move had been played a couple of times 'by chance' in the previous century. The original qual ity of this defence lies in the fact that the . . .d7 -dS advance is postponed, or omitted entirely, in favour of a dark-square strategy with ...d6/ .. . cS or . . .d6/ .. .e5 . The practical advantage of not yet de fining the pawn structure is that the position will be more complex strategi cally, which usually allows a stronger player to dominate. From a strictly tech nical point of view, the doubled pawns on the c-file favour Black in the event of an endgame. However, there is the dis advantage of almost always having to part with the dark-squared bishop, and more than a few games have been de cided by violent middlegame attacks by White. The celebrated 1 9 3 8 Botvinnik Capablanca game immediately comes to mind. It was indeed dark-square play that was the key factor in White's bril liant victory:

On 28.'iha4 �xe4 wins. �d7xa41 As usual, we see positive and negative aspects side by side in the same ope ning, and it is for the individual player to decide which are more important within the context of their personal taste and style. Before looking at White's principal re plies (4.lLlf3 , 4.a3 , 4.f3 , 4=.�c2 and
4.e3 , all of which merit individual at
tention) we will look at some minor lines of interest (4.�d2, 4.'iVb3 , 4.g3 and 4.�g5) . A few 'free thinkers' have given 4.e4? a try, but after 4 ... lLlxe4 5 .'iYg4 lLlxc3 6.a3 (6.'i'Vxg 7 ?

However, it is a natural move (indeed, a beginner's favourite) that has a certain logic (unpin the knight and avoid doubled pawns) , and 1 38 thus it cannot be bad per se. Its defect is that by nature it is a prophylactic move that lacks ambition, and Black equalises without effort.

White has developed more harmoni ously; Black has the two bishops. Now after 1 1 .O-O or 1 1 .O-O-O, the game is dynamically balanced. C) 4. g2-g3 In the past, this line was named after Alekhine: now it is known as the Romanishin Variation. The Ukrainian GM has a marked preference for set-ups in which a kingside fianchetto is teamed with a knight on c3 , as seen in the lines he plays against the Semi-Slav or the Catalan.
4. ... d7-d5
4 .. .c5 is more thematic, but after s .tt:'lf3 you transpose to the Kasparov Varia tion, which is discussed further ahead. It may not seem to be in the spirit of the defence to push the d-pawn, yet this has the advantage of producing a type of Catalan in which White has developed his knight to c3 a little prematurely.

S At (Spassky, C hess Opening Essentials - Volume 3 The bishop move is very natural White responds to the pin with a pin of his own. Compared to the variations with ggs that we have already seen in the Queen's Indian, White has the ad vantage of being able to develop his kingside in a more elastic way (for ex ample, with f3 /e4 or with tDe2 ) . Nev ertheless, the impression remains that
4.�g5 is slightly premature. Black can
(and must) react with vigour (the queenside fianchetto is too slow here) , and therefore the most appropriate move is the pawn push to cS, with or without an intermediate h6.
4. ... h7-h6
There are some who prefer not to play this move and to push ...cS straight away, producing similar lines whose differences are usually irrelevant. How ever, it is generally considered to be ad vantageous to kick the bishop to h4 so that it can no longer return to support the queenside. The following variation is one of the few lines in which it pays to omit the move 4 .. .h6. 4 ...c5 S .dS �xc3 + 6.bxc3 d6 7 .e3 'ii' e7

Indeed, here the pawn sacrifice seems to be even more positionally justified.
7. e2-e41?
This idea of Estrin, soon adopted by the young Portisch, does not refute the line, but it does give Black a position that he will not enjoy playing. Accepting the pawn with 7 .dxe6 fxe6 8.cxb5 dS 9.e3 O-O gives Black evident compensation: whether it is objectively sufficient or not is unclear, but in practice Black's re sults are satisfactory. 7.

tt:Jg8-f6 e7-e6 �f8-b4 I • .t. if/ • �K .tr i .l" i i ,. , .... . We have already discussed this move when we discussed possible transposi tions from the Bogo-Indian. Some au thors have dubbed this line the Flexible Variation as the knight can be devel oped in several ways; however, it is much more frequently referred to as the Kasparov Variation. Rightly so too, given that the boy from Baku repeatedly played it in the 1 98 0's in his classic en counters with Karpov. As a result, this obscure variation became the third most common way of meeting the Nimzo-Indian for a period of time, and it is still popular today. Depending on Black's reply, this knight move has the advantage of allowing the option of de veloping the bishop to g5 . Here is a concrete example: Let's say that White is a devotee of the Rubinstein Variation 4.e3 , but does not relish the prospect of meeting the Hubner Variation ( 4 . . . c5 and 6 ... �xc3 +) . If he plays 4.lt:Jf3 , he can wait for Black to play 4 .. .O-O or 4 .. .d5 , 1 43 Chess Opening Essent i als - Volu m e 3 and only then play S .e3 . If instead, Black persists with 4 .. .c5 , White can play the insidious S .g3, which we will examine soon. However, the downside is that it is impossible for White to play the very fashionable Rubinstein lines with tLlge2. It is only natural that there is some type of drawback to this and ev ery other line - an opening that offers everything is yet to be invented. To highlight the chameleon nature of the variation we will list the possible transpositions: 4 . • • d7 -dS - Queen's Gambit with 4 ...�b4. 4 ... b7-b6 S.�cl -gS - Queen's Indian with 4.tLlc3. 4 ... b7-b6 S.e2-e3 - Nimzo-Indian: Fischer /Nimzowitsch Variation. 4 ... c7 -cS S.e2-e3 - Nimzo-Indian: Rubinstein Variation. 4 ...

As you can see, there are not many lines that do not transpose! Here are the vari ations that strictly belong to the Kasparov Variation:

9.Rb3
Chess Open i ng Essentials - Volu m e 3 Nimzo-Indian. White puts the question to the bishop and calls Black's bluff; in addition, he keeps the diagonal open for the c 1 bishop with the future option of playing his f-pawn to f3. It is as if he were saying to Black: OK pal, let's see if you can stop me on the dark squares. Experience has shown that Black does have in fact the resources to do this. However, the resulting games are dou ble-edged and they appeal to aggressive players. This line was relatively popular at the end of the 1 92 0 's (even though it never threatened the· supremacy of 4.e3 or
4.'ilfc2) , following Friedrich Samisch's
successes with it: he beat no less than Grii.nfeld, Reti and Capablanca (to be fair, we should point out that in a mo ment of distraction Capablanca lost a piece on the tenth move! ) . In the 1 950's, it was often played by Kotov, Bronstein and Geller, allof whom ob tained good results with it. In the 1 960's, Botvinnik used the Samisch more than once in his two matches with Tal. In fact, Botvinnik often played an interesting version of a Samisch de ferred with 4.e3 and 6.a3 , but we will discuss this line further on. At the beginning of the 1 9 70's effective defensive measures were discovered and interest in the Samisch has declined to such an extent that its sister variation
4.f3 is much more frequently played.
It is worth stressing that anyone wish ing to deepen their knowledge of either of these two lines ( 4.a3 or 4.f3) would be wise to study both of them, given their conceptual similarities and the frequent mutual transpositions that oc cur. Another reminder that it is a mis- 1 48 take to think of opening theory as a tidy series of neat compartments; experi ence with other lines helps us to play our own openings better. It is also important to note that while the overall performance of the Samisch is nothing to write home about, the draw rate is one of the lowest in the whole Nimzo-Indian, which is a defi nite selling point for some.

After this exchange White's centre has been weakened. . . or reinforced, de pending on how you look at it. To be precise, White's centre is in effect more compact and the d4 pawn is supported by its colleague on c3 , which means that White can advance e2-e4 uncon cerned about Black's pawn push ...c7 -cS . It is the c4 pawn that is weak, and it will be become Black's chief tar get. Often this pawn is eventually cap tured, but in the meantime, White's ini tiative on the kingside begins to take on worrying proportions! Black has five playable replies, remem bering that S ... dS is a mistake on prin ciple. It is not very logical to allow White to free himself of his doubled pawns without getting anything in re- Tai. turn. After 6.cxd5 exdS 6.e3 ! , followed by .¥i.d3 and tt:Je2, White's initiative is dangerous-looking. A) 5 . ... tt:lf6-e41? Not often played, despite the fact that it has an optimum performance and there is little theory to study. Tal used it four times in his match with Botvinnik in 1 960 ( 4 draws) . Black cannot capture on c3 as after 'iWc2 he would lose the knight: the idea is to now play . . .£7 -fS , knowing that 6 .f3 is not playable at the moment because of the check on h4.

However, it must be taken seri ously as many strong players have adopted the line; more importantly still, it has scored well.

Keres's old idea is still considered to be the best. The move is odd-looking, but at the same time highly logical.

d1 -c2 1 60 l2Jg8-f6 e7-e6 ..Bf8-b4 I � .t 'i¥ • K .l i i i i i i i � • The variation starting with 4.'ii' d1 -c2 is named after the great Cuban champion, who used it frequently from the end of the 1 920's on. In fact, Alekhine used it much earlier in 1 9 1 5 (therefore only one year after the defence's debut) . This comes as no surprise as 'iYc2 is a natural move (it prevents the doubling of pawns and at the same time controls the key e4-square) , and natural moves are always the first to be explored. In hon our of its many years of service, some authors have dubbed it the Classical Variation, but given that this adjective has been somewhat overused, we prefer this more informative name. Until the 1 9S O 's, this line was the most popular way to meet the Nimzo-Indian; then it was thought that adequate Black countermeasures had been found, and it was greatly overtaken in popularity by the Rubinstein Variation 4.e3 . However, when both Kasparov and Kar pov began to play the Capablanca Varia tion in the 1 990's, rather inevitably the line became fashionable again. At the time of writing, 4.'Y/Vc2 continues to be more popular than 4.e3 , but there are signs that this is changing.
4.'li'd 1 -c2 is by nature a solid move, but
in practice, it sometimes leads to some very sharp lines. This is because Black no longer creates doubled white pawns in compensation for conceding the bishop, and thus tries to exploit his ad vantage in development, accentuating the tension. However, he can also con tinue more quietly if he wishes, con ceding the advantage of the bishop pair with confidence as the position is rela tively closed. We should remember that in many variations White too can con tinue solidly with a2-a3 in order to take one of the two bishops, or make the ag gressive e2-e4 advance so as to conquer the centre. This plethora of possible ap proaches explains why the Capablanca Variation has acquired so much theory in recent years, with the unsurprising result that many players now seek refuge in less theoretical lines ( 4.f3 and
4.tt:Jf3 ) .
Before examining Black's five main re plies, we would like to mention Vito linsh's move 4 ...b5 , which could well merit an exclamation mark for its origi nality: with S .cxbS a6 Black creates a type of Benko Gambit, but after 6.bxa6 �xa6 7 .tt:Jf3 O-O 8.e4! Ul 9.<it'xfl , compen sation for the pawn is insufficient and a question mark may in fact be the more appropriate annotation symbol. A) 4 . ... d7-d6 Used by Smyslov. The idea is not so much that of supporting an . . .e6-e5 push, but rather to advance . . .c7 -cS and to recapture with the pawn after dxcS.

B) 4 . ... .!Llb8-c6 It cannot be bad to develop a piece and at the same time attack an undefended pawn! This is known as the Zurich Variation, and in the 1 930's it was con sidered Black's best reply (nobody is quite sure why) . However, it has steadily declined in popularity over the years, and it is now less popular than the three lines that follow.

This can create a highly tactical game in the lines in which Black seeks to capitalise on his advantage in development by playing . . . tt:le4 and . . . Wi aS . The move 4 .. . d5 was considered to be the best in the 1 940's, following 1 62 Botvinnik's famous victory over Keres. However, when Kasparov found im provements for White, players started to abandon the move. At the time of writ ing, 4 .. .d5 is the second most popular move.

It is worth reiterating what a deep game chess is: even the odd-looking 6 ...�e8 has been played, with accept able results. In various lines the queen supports ... eS , in others it aggressively shifts to hS after . . . tLle4 and . . .fS , and in still others it transfers to a4 whenever White advances his pawn to b4! E1 ) 6 . ... b7-b5!? This gambit is a violent attempt to make the most of the weak light squares. Like 4 ... b5 at the beginning of the section, this is an idea by Vitolinsh, but this time the move has more positional justifica tion. Initial scepticism (the move ap peared in 1 98 2) gave way in the face of good results: 6 ...b5 has been played in hundreds of games, scoring extremely well! So it is no coincidence that in the early 2 1 st century it started to pop up in the games of super GM's. The fact that it is still not so popular (only in I 0% of games) may be explained by questions of style - Nimzo-Indian players usually prefer to adopt a strategic approach.

As we mentioned before, Akiba Rubinstein's 4.e2-e3 has always been the main competitor to 4.�c2 in terms of popularity, notwithstanding the fact that it is a difficult move to understand and would appear unnatural to a begin ner (and more advanced players too!) : why would you deliberately want to close in the c l bishop? In fact, 4.e3 is a very flexible move. As in the S .e3 Varia tion of the Semi-Slav, White calmly prepares to further advance the pawn to e4 once his development has been completed. The idea is that the c I bishop will then come into its own, es pecially in the absence of its counter part on the black side. In addition, White has the other plan of playing tLlge2 in order to take back on c3 with the knight, and thus avoid compromis ing his pawn structure. The absence of direct threats allows Black to choose from a wide variety of approaches. As a result, this line is one of the strategically most complex in all opening theory. Now Black has five replies, which we will examine in ascending order of im portance: 4 ... tLlc6, 4 .. .d5, 4 .. .b6, 4 .. .c5 and 4 .. .O-O. A) 4 . ... ttJb8-c6 This move of Taimanov's does not look good at first, as it blocks the path of the c-pawn. In fact, it is an elastic move that is reminiscent of the Black Knights' Tango, which is discussed on page 1 4 of this book.

O-O line merits its own individ ual section as it is of historical impor tance and also because of the large number of associated sub-variations. 2O.Rc3 This normal developing move has al ways been the most played. Now White has the same options available to him as after 4 .. .cS, namely tbe2 and a3 , �d3 and tbe2, ti:Jf3 and ..td3 . The move S .a3 is an interesting additional option. It transposes to the Samisch Variation; however, the two preceding moves 4.e3 and 4 .. .O-O limit the options of both players. A) 5. tt:lg1 -e2 Reshevsky's use of this move helped to make it popular, and today it is more played than ever - probably in order to avoid the excessive quantity of theory attached to the other lines. White slows down the game, but avoids all the risks associated with the doubled c-pawns.

4."iYc2 in the 1 990's. Now it is less
played than other lines, but the name has stuck. However, we are not talking 1 92 about some relic of the past: it is still popular with top players who like a positionally complex game. With 1 O .. . 'iWc7 , Black keeps a tactical eye on the c4 bishop and prepares to advance . . .e6-e5 . This advance is not played in order to open up the position, which with White's two bishops would be against Black's interests, but in order to grant freedom to the c8 bishop and to create an initiative in the centre. Sometimes after the f3 knight is ex changed for its opposite number on e5 , the white kingside remains dangerously lacking in defence. Even if the exchange on e5 does not occur, the advance . . .e5-e4 can give Black a nice kingside initiative. White's task is above all to ac tivate his dark-squared bishop - some times this is done by playing his pawns to f3 and e4 after the exchange on e5 ; at other times, the bishop goes directly to b 2 with the hope of a c3 -c4 advance. The extraordinary depth of this positi on is made clear by the fact that White can choose from ten (!) or so playable moves. For reasons of space, we will not look at all of these, but instead we will try to make clear the common plans. A) 1 1 . �c4-b5 A subtle move, perhaps too much so. Having decided to move the bishop, White first plays it to b5, to encourage Black to play ...a6, weakening the b6-square; the bishop willnow retreat to e2 or to d3. Curiously, the same idea is present in the 7 .a4 variation of the French Winawer (see page 2 1 3 of the first volume). In both cases, the refinement seems to be of only academic interest. 1 1 . ... a7-a6 1 2. �b5-d3 Or 1 L �Le2 . 1 2. ... e6-e5 In comparison with Variation F, it does not seem to make any great difference whether the pawn is on a6 or on a7.

Playing this way, Black does not oppose White's central expansion in the same way as in the Nimzo-Indian, and there fore after 3 . tb b 1 -c3 he cannot prevent White gaining possession of the centre. By playing 3 ...�g7 , Black allows the im mediate push e2-e4, which we willsee in the King's Indian. Before looking at that defence, we willexamine the Griinfeld Indian Defence, which be gins with the move 3 ... d7 -dS. This move temporarily prevents the e2-e4 advance, in the full knowledge that after an ex change on dS , the advance has been de layed for one move only. This is exactly the idea of the defence - concede the centre and then attack it. When the defence appeared in 1 9 2 2 in the games of the Austrian Ernst Grunfeld, the Orthodox Defence to the Queen's Gambit reigned supreme. You can therefore imagine how bizarre the idea must have seemed, even if the Alekhine Defence ( l .e4 lLlf6) , which has the same strategic theme, appeared one year earlier. However, within ten years of the Grii.nfeld's debut it had already become evident that the defence had great dy namic potential and was based on sound strategic principles. So much so, that great champions such as Alekhine, Flohr, Botvinnik, Lilienthal and Spielmann started to use it with a cer tain regularity. It has remained relatively popular ever since; in the 1 9S O 's and 6 0 's the patronage of Smyslov, Boleslavsky, Uhlmann, Gligoric and Filip increased its appeal. In more recent years, Adorjan, Jansa, Ftacnik and Smejkal have used it as their main weapon against 1 .d4. When you add the names of Kortchnoi, Leko, Svidler and former World Champions Fischer and Kasparov to the list of play ers who have endorsed this defence, you can see that it has a lot to recom mend it. Before we examine the Grunfeld in the strict sense of the term, we will exam ine the alternatives in which White de lays the development of his knight to c3 . In this case, Black needs to be care ful. After the . . .d7 -dS advance, White can exchange pawns and then push e2-e4, and now with no white knight on c3 , Black's dS knight must retreat, which is a problem for Black. 1 97 Griinfeld Chess Opening Essen tials - Vol ume 3 1 . d2-d4

White has a nice centre, but the fl bishop does not have a natural square to develop to: e2 is for the g l knight, �d3 would leave the d4 pawn undefended and �c4 is not possible. White therefore makes preparations to castle queenside or otherwise advances his pawn to f4.

This is a positional approach, which may not be the strongest objectively, but which will probably irritate Black, who, in choosing the Griinfeld, has in dicated a fondness for asymmetrical positions. A) 3 . ... c7-c6 (!) So that after a . . .d7 -dS push Black can recapture with the c-pawn. Any ope ning expert would agree that this is technically the best move. Indeed, 3 . . .c6 is Black's best performing move and it is very difficult for White to ob tain any concrete advantage when play ing against it. So why is it so little played? The answer is: because of the very high draw rate, and also because Black will find it very arduous indeed to win with such an arid position.

i� .t 'iV • .t i i i i i i i i t2J � !'::, !'::, !'::, £::, £::, !'::, !'::, :s jl��jltLJ:S From a conceptual point of view, the d5 capture with subsequent centre expan sion by White is the critical line. White accepts Black's challenge and takes con trol of the centre; it is now Black's job to demonstrate that he can create ade- 2 1 0 quate counterplay. It is therefore natural that this line immediately established it self as the main anti -Griinfeld line ( 1 92 2) . It is worth noting that it would be around ten years before the effec tiveness of the set-up with �c4 and tt::l e2 was appreciated; the variation then quickly became the main hne and it still is today. It must seem incredible to a young player who has grown up in the world of the Internet and chess engines that it could have taken this long. How ever, not that far in the past a theoretical novelty could remain a secret, despite being used on more than one occasion! After 4 .. . tt::l xd5 White can respond with the thematic e 2 -e4 advance. However, before looking at this line, we will take a quick look at some minor variations. Remember that 5. tt::l f3 transposes into other hnes, and 5 .g3 leads into the Fianchetto Variation.

This move is often attrib uted to Smyslov; in fact the former World Champion used to play �d2 af ter 5 .tt::l f3 .tg7 ; then, instead of advanc ing the pawn to e4, he would continue with 7..l::!. c 1 . 5 . ...

9. d4-d5 tt:lc6-e5
1 0. 'iYd1 -b3!? This is a relatively unexplored position that offers chances to both players. C) 5. tt:lc3-a4 � � i. 'if � .i. � �-.t.. i i A: i i This paradoxical idea of Ashot Nadanian first appeared in 1 99 7 . White moves his only developed piece to the edge of the board, where the knight is notoriously less active! In compensa- G riin fe]d I n d i a n Defen ce tion, it prepares e2-e4, and prevents the immediate push ... c7 -cS. Given that this move quite flagrantly violates the sound strategic principles that have been drummed into us since our very first lesson, we will take time out to make a few comments that we hope are perti nent (apologies in advance if we go on a bit) . What would Tarrasch say if he were confronted with 5.tt::l a4? He would probably be saddened to see the mod ern 'disregard' of time-honoured prin ciples (as does every passing genera tion) . Whereas we are sure that an indefatiga ble innovator such as Bronstein must have been enthusiastic at the idea of such an important novelty appearing on the 5th move of such an oft-played opening - without doubt, he was aware that the move had been tried! Which of the two is the correct approach? With the data at hand - the latter; like it or not, 5 .tt::l a4 has achieved acceptable results. So are established principles no lon ger relevant? That is certainly not the case. To challenge dogma does not mean you can do as you please. Cer tain principles will always be valid, and this is true not only on the chess board. One must be cautious when something appears to contradict ac cepted wisdom: if, after due consider ation and analysis, an unconventional move proves itself demonstrably good, this does not mean that the principle itself is wrong, but just that it should not be interpreted mechani cally. It is obvious that it is generally 2 1 1 C h ess Opening Essen t i als - Volume 3 better to avoid distancing the knight from the centre. However, in the case at hand, the move appears to bring with it compensating advantages. So why not play it? After 5 . tt:Ja4, White is ready to advance the pawn to e4 without the possibility of Black's knight capturing on c3 . Is it worth it? One cannot say in advance - at times you cannot even say afterwards! This complicates but enriches the game: every position is unique. This is without doubt the greatest contribution of computer technology in recent years: the chess engines have forced us to take seriously those 'ugly' moves that we have always instinctively disregarded. Who knows? The next proposal could be s.tt:Jb 1 ! After so much philosophy, it is time to examine the moves themselves:
5. ... e7-e5!
Probably the best. Here the established principle of responding to premature action on the wings by playing in the centre works! For this reason, White at times delays tLla4 one move, and plays it after S .tLlf3 �g7 , but in this case f2-f3 is no longer possible and thus 6 . . . �fS ! is good for Black. The 'normal' S . . . �g7 6.e4 tLlb6 is play able. So is the 'counter-provocative'

7. tt:lg1 -f3 There is a little confusion regarding the names of the Exchange Variation's two main systems. In some books the varia tion with tt::l f3 is called the Modern Variation, as opposed to the Classical Variation with �c4 and tt::l e2. The name modern came about due the boom in the popularity of 7 . tt::l f3 that started in the late 1 97 0 's, and which ended 7.�c4's 50 years of supremacy. However, as we noted at the beginning of the section, tt::l f3 was virtually the ex elusive choice in the 1 9 20's, and there fore it is curious to call the line modern, given that it was played before the Clas sical Variation even existed! You may well wonder why it took so long for such a natural move to gain as cendancy. The answer is that in the past it was thought that . . .�g4 gave Black an easy game. In reality, it is not quite that simple.

fl % lished. However, there still remains much that is unexplored. For obvious reasons of space, we will have to limit ourselves to a quick examination of the most important points. What is the idea behind this rook move? In the ltJf3 line the best square for the bishop is e2, but we have seen that the immediate 8 . ..te2 is dubious. By playing this rook move, White post pones the development of the bishop and thus denies Black much of his counterplay. The rook attacks b7 in or der to discourage ...�g4, and it is taken off the dangerous dark-square diagonal so as to have the option of playing d4-d5 after . . . ltJc6. It looks like the per fect move, but as always, there is a prob lem: in this particular case, it is the a2 pawn (Variation B4) .

The fact that the material-con scious chess engines give White the ad vantage is significant. 1 1 . l2Jf3xe5 �g7xe5 What has Black gained? He has re moved some of the pressure by ex changing off his opponent's active knight and he has fixed White's pawn structure.

�a5xa2 We are at another critical position of the Grunfeld. White has no immediate threats, and at first sight, it is hard to figure out what his compensation is. In the King's Gambit (which is consid ered by many to be dubious) and in the Poisoned Pawn Variation of the Najdorf, compensation is evident: the open f-file and the easy-to-attack f-pawn in the former; and the sidelined queen (which, indeed, often risks be ing ensnared in the tt:ld4-b3 line) , but more importantly an advantage in de velopment in the latter. Here, as we have said, White has neither an apparent initiative nor the ability to immediately create one. In effect, White has a good centre, but any advantage in development is modest. As far as Black is concerned, there are no problems bringing the queen back as it can enter into pLiy via e6, and his two passed a- and b-pawns will repre sent a deadly weapon in the endgame - and it is Black's turn to move! Notwithstanding these considerations, data from hundreds of games reveal that White's performance is clearly better than you would expect. Here, the usual psy- 2 1 7 ► w OAAA £ Chess Opening Essen t i als - Volume 3 chological consideration that it is more diffi cult to defend than to attack is not a factor. White has objective strengths in his favour. Let's examine what they are: • As is so often the case with the Grunfeld, the d-pawn quickly turns into a dangerous passed pawn, and it is closer to the promotion square than its black rivals are. In addition, even if this pawn never makes it to the promotion square it has a para lysing effect on the adversary's posi tion when it is pushed to dS or d6. • Black's kingside is somewhat lacking in defence without the f6 knight, and White is often able to launch sudden and unexpected attacks on the black king. • It is not easy for Black to push his a and b-pawns without creating weak nesses. • Black is yet to develop his queenside pieces and the queen on a2 must find a better home. In the absence of immediate threats, Black has many playable moves to choose from. We will limit ourselves to examining the five most common re plies so as to give you an idea of the typical manoeuvres that characterise this complex line. B41 ) 1 2. ... �a2-e6 1 3. 'i¥d1 -c2 �e6-c6

Normally, this is an anti-positional move that would not be taken into con sideration, but in this position, the black a6 pawn changes everything. The capture is now no longer just playable, but excellent - another example of not letting consideration of general princi ples blind you. Let's have a look at the advantages offered by this weird-look ing move: it stops ...b7-b5 ; the b7 pawn can now truly be taken; the b6-square is weak and this can sometimes be ex plaited tactically by means of c5-c6 and �b6; the d4-square is available for acti vating the knight; and the cS pawn, though ugly and doubled, is still an extra pawn. 1 2. ... �d8-c7 1 2. .. tt:Jas 1 3 . �d3 Wic7 1 4.tLld4! l::t fd8 I S.'ife2 e6 1 6.f4! , and White is better. 1 3. tt:Je2-d4! e7-e6

'iYd8-c7 The Smyslov Variation is so named in honour of the former World Cham pion's victory against Gligoric in 1 959. It is both a logical and natural move. The queen has its eye on the unde fended c4 bishop and vacates the d8-square for the rook. This line was played by Levenfish in I 9 3 9, and it was also employed by Fischer in two his toric games with Spassky in 1 966 and 1 97 0. In both of these games the Amer ican champ was soundly beaten. .. but these losses were not the fault of the opening. Today the line is still very popular. 1 1 . t!.a 1 -c1 .ll f8-d8 One of the drawbacks of this line is the weakening of f7 . 1 2. �e3-f4! It took a while before people figured out that this was the best move.

An interesting-looking move is 1 2.f4, but it proves to be too ambitious: Chess Opening Essen t i als - Vo l u m e 3 1 2 . . . �g4 1 3 .fS tt:'laS ( 1 3 . . . gxfS 1 4.h3 !) 1 4.�xf7 + ! ? �xf7 I S . fxg6 + �g8 1 6.gxh7+ �h8 .

This capture was played in the 1 9 70's and it quickly revealed itself to be stronger than imagined: Black's pieces are badly coordinated and poorly placed - in particular the c8 bishop, which will have problems finding a good square to develop to. These factors are enough to justify the capture on cS . After 1 3 . dS, Black appears to obtain ade quate counterplay with 1 3 . . . ttJeS 1 1 4. .Bb3 ( 1 4.�xeS ! ?) 1 4. .. bS 1 S .h3 aS !. 1 3. ...

Karpov used this line 4 times in this historic encounter. Al though the results were not exceptional (+ 1 - 1 =2) , Karpov obtained promis ing positions in every game, and the variation enjoyed a subsequent boom. The move 1 2 . .Bxf7 + used to be played one move later ( 1 l . ..cxd4 1 2.cxd4 tbaS 1 3 . 11Lxf7 +) , but it was not popular. It was thought that Black had an easier game without the pawn exchange. However, Karpov demonstrated that Black still has an uphill battle ahead. Winning the pawn is not White's main objective as Black achieves good dy namic play in compensation. White's intention is to profit from the resulting pawn structure (c3 /d4/e5 and the pawn on gS) and to make the g7 bishop passive. Against the Griinfeld this is no small achievement! Curiously, at the time of writing 1 2...txf7 + is considered to be the most solid choice as it minimises White's losing chances - even if at the same time it reduces the likelihood of his winning too. 1 2. ... 1 3. f3xg4

1 5. c3xd4 c5xd4 e7-e51 Ivanchuk's idea is considered to be the best antidote to the Seville - for the time being anyway. The old 1 5 .. .'ir'b6 1 6.�g 1 'i!Ve6 1 7 .'i\Yd3 ! has proved to be favourable for White. 1 5. .. e5 is paradoxical; it grants White a supported passed pawn and limits the scope of his own bishop! However, there are many pluses to offset the mi nuses: the blocked bishop will find a better diagonal (c1 -h6 or a3-f8) ; the aS knight will go to the optimum d6-square; with a blocked centre, the queenside majority could become meaningful; and the white knight, which is denied the e4-square, will struggle to find activity. 1 6. �f1 -g1 ! . Perhaps for the above reasons, nobody has played 1 6.d5 for several years: 1 6. .. tbc4 1 7 .jLf2 ( 1 7.'iYd3 ! ?) 1 7. .. 'iYf6 1 8.�g 1 .a'.f8 1 9.' �e 1 �h6 20.tbg3 'fV a6! (threatening 2 1 ..

The bishop on e6 cannot really be taken as its counter part on d3 would be captured by the queen. Testimony to how fast theory changes is the fact that 1 6.�h6, which until a few years ago was the most popular and best scoring move, is now almost never played at top levels. Also the old main line, the strange 1 6.J:lb 1 (the idea is to stop the check on b6) , is very rare nowadays. 1 6. 'ti'a1 -d4!? Until recently, this move used to be considered harmless, even by weighty books devoted entirely to the Grunfeld. At the time of writing, this strange-looking queen move is by far G r iinfeld Indian D efen ce and away the most popular choice. It defends the bishop on d3 and thus makes the threat of dxe6 real, with the additional advantage that it denies Black the typical tactical resource of the queen check on b6. On the downside, White increases the chances of a queen exchange (usually unwelcome for a player who has made an exchange sacrifice) . 1 6. ... �e6-f7 After 1 6. . .�d7 , the move 1 7 .e5 ! has scored excellently for White. 1 7. �e3-h6 J:lf8-e8 1 8. .ltd3-b5 e7-e5!

It has remained a favourite, and it is second only to the Exchange Variation in popularity.

And White has the centre. Not that this will concern Black; temporarily con ceding the centre is the defining con cept of the Grunfeld. Now Black's problem is exactly how to develop counterplay against White's oc cupation of the centre. The Russian Variation has different ad vantages and disadvantages compared to the Exchange Variation. Let's look at the positive aspects first: • all the pieces are still on the board, which favours the player with more space, namely White. • the queen on c4 makes it more diffi cult for Black to respond with the classical advance to ... c7 -cS , and thus Black is forced to adopt more com plicated and riskier plans to find ade quate counterplay. • the presence of the knight on f6 makes the e4-e5 advance a latent possibility. • in many lines, White has the aggres sive option of castling queenside, which is not possible in the Ex change Variation . On the debit side: • the queen is somewhat exposed to attack on c4 and Black's minor pieces can gain valuable tempi by striking at her. • in the Exchange Variation, the f6 knight and its counterpart on c3 have been exchanged, thus removing an important defender and making the kingside vulnerable to dangerous at tacks along the h-file; here Black's castled kingside position is some what more solid. • Black has the small advantage of be ing slightly ahead in development, which allows him active piece play in the initial phase of the game. We will now turn our attention to the specific moves. Black has five principal replies, ignoring the playable 7 ... tt:lfd7 ! ?, which normally transposes to B or E. A) 7. ... c7-c6 Preparing ...

The idea is to drive off the queen with . . .b7-b5 so as to be able to play . . .c7-c5 ; in addition the bishop can be developed to b7, from where it can attack the e4 pawn. The drawback of this move is that attacking the queen with pawns instead of pieces neglects development, and White will be in a position to launch a dangerous counterattack.

C h ess Opening Essen t i a l s - Volume 3 King's Indian Defence 1 .d2-d4 l2Jg8-f6 2.c2-c4 g7-g6 3.l2Jb1 -c3 .Bf8-g7 The King's Indian, like the Griinfeld, is an ambitious defence. After 1 .d2-d4 t2Jg8-f6 2 .c2-c4, Black chooses to es tablish a kingside fianchetto with 2 ... g7 -g6 instead of playing the solid 2 ...e6. He then responds to 3 .tLlb 1 -c3 with 3 ...�f8-g7, which allows White to take possession of the centre with
4. e2-e4
Black will then attack the centre with either . . .c7-c5 or . . .e7-e5 . This is most definitely a modern idea, even if the first noted game is when Paulsen (whose name is famously asso ciated with the Sicilian variation) used it in 1 8 79. There is always someone way ahead of the times! What is truly astonishing is to fmd the famously dog matic Siegbert Tarrasch on the list of players who used the defence in 1 8 8 5 . However, these were just impromptu appearances, and it was only in the 1 92 0 's that the King's Indian started to be used with greater conviction by a few top players, in particular Yates, Reti and Euwe. It was to be another 2 0 years before the defence really took off, after its patronage by several Soviet players. In particular, Bronstein, Boleslavsky and Geller made an enormous contribution to both its development and to its pop ularity. Other champions who further advanced the defence were Gligoric, Najdorf, and Fischer, and more recently Stein, Uhlmann, Nunn, Gelfand and of course Kasparov. Why is it called the King's Indian? As we have noted the term Indian was coined in the 1 92 0 's by Tartakower. While reading an old German journal he came across an 1 8 7 5 game played by two Brahmans (!) that began with 1 .d4 t2Jf6 ; thereafter, he jokingly referred to this as the 'Indian Defence' . Evidently, before then 1 ... t2Jf6 belonged to that poor group of irregular opens that did not warrant a name! It makes you won der how the future generation of chess players will look back at us in a hundred years time! The word 'King's' obviously refers to the fact that Black opens the fianchetto on the King's side. 1 ilAAAAil

Tartakower. Fianchetto Variation 1 .d2-d4 t2Jg8-f6 2.c2-c4 g7-g6 3.g2-g3 (with ... d6) We will now return to the third move. Let's start with
3. g2-g3
If he wishes, White can open the fianchetto one or two moves later - af ter either t2lc3 or tLlf3 , or both. How ever, it is best to delay the e2-e4 ad vance as long as possible, as often it is not advisable to make this advance when the bishop is on g2. By fianchettoing the bishop, White puts pressure on the queenside while im proving his kingside defences, which is something that should not be neglected when facing a defence that is so often characterised by a flank assault on the white king. However, many of the typical black at tacks on the kingside are rare here, as a pawn assault on the wings is a risky af fair when the centre is fluid. Obviously, this increased security comes at a price: when you reduce the number of dy- namic options available to Black, you also reduce your own number of possi bilities. Therefore, the game becomes more positional than in other varia tions. The draw rate is obviously higher, but the overall performance remains the same as that of other lines. The Fianchetto Variation should therefore not be underestimated and it is well suited to players who enjoy a slow strategic battle. 3.

. I:t � 'if :a: -� This is called the Panno Variation in honour of the strong Argentinean player who made it popular in the 1 950's. The aim is to play .. J:tb8 and then push the b-pawn to bS . It is usually a good idea to exchange a flank pawn for a central one. The problem is that sometimes the c7 pawn becomes a weak backward pawn on a semi-open file, and the hole on c6 willbecome a factor. Be it good or bad, this is a fighting defence, and for this reason it is very popular.

To the classically trained eye White should be better, as the backward d6 pawn on a semi-open me is weak. However, the modern school of chess attaches more importance to piece ac tivity than was done in the past, and therefore Black's position is now con sidered to be acceptable. 02) 8 . ... c7-c6

Needless to say, 4 .. .d5 is a transposition to the Griinfeld. At this point of the game, few people like 5 .e3 as it is too passive. 5 .�f4 makes less sense here than in the Grii.nfeld as Black's d-pawn is on d6. Nonetheless, it is an interest ing possibility.

However, it can be dangerous - espe cially ifBlack plays mechanically. White's plan is somewhat basic, but at times effective! After the centre be comes closed, White intends to play tbg3 followed by h4-h5 , and if now Black responds with ...h7-h5 , White will continue with �g5 and �e2xh5 , with an attack that in practice is very difficult to deal with, if not necessarily winning.
5 . ... O-O
Fearful of this attack, Black sometimes postpones castling and instead plays 5 . . . a6 followed by . . . c6 and . . .b5. How ever, such nervousness seems to be un warranted.
6. ttJe2-g3 e7-e5
The most played, but as always, 6 . . .c5 is a valid alternative: 7 .d5 e6 8 .�e2 exd5 9 .exd5 (9 .cxd5 ! ? transposes to the Benoni) , with a tiny advantage for White.

Even though this line was employed by Reti, Tarrasch and Tartakower, it has always been a minor variation. Since the 1 990's, it has been played with compar ative frequency, chiefly because of the influence ofBagirov and Krasenkow. S .h3 is a flexible move: it stops . . . tt:lg4 after .te3 (or after .tgS-h6-.te3) ; it keeps open the option of developing the knight to e2 or f3 ; and after the cen tre becomes closed, the h-pawn sup ports a g2-g4 advance. The idea of this is not necessarily to stop Black's the matic push to fS , but to give White new prospects with the opening of the g-file. It is worth mentioning a rare but play able alternative: Black can profit from the absence of a knight on f3 and im mediately play 5 . . .eS ! ?.

The Seirawan Variation helped the American GM make a comeback in the early 1 990's. This means of development was adopted by Samisch as far back as 1 92 5 . King 's I n d i a n Defen c e Yet for many decades, it was dogmati cally dismissed because it creates a weakening of the d4-square. The line fell into such disrepute that it was barely mentioned in opening manuals ofthe 1 970's. However, the fortunes of an opening line can change very quickly; within a few years, this line had appeared in thousands of games, and it was eventu ally to become one of the most popular variations. It also appears with a certain regularity in the games of top-notch players such as Bareev, Dreev and Ivan Sokolov. White's strategy is simple and effective: the f-pawn remains mobile, and if Black continues classically with . . .eS, . . . ti:JhS and .. .fS , White will gain an advantage by replying with exfS and f4 (or tLlg3 ! ? so as to take back with the f-pawn) . Black's most reliable plan is to apply pressure to the weak d4-square. 01) 6 . ...

Black has conceded the centre and White grabs all the space he can. This is not a mistake in itself. However, pawn moves help devel opment but are not developing moves themselves, and White runs the risk of being infiltrated with a classic counter attack: as we all know, pawns that have been advanced too far cannot go back. We have already seen this theme in the Four Pawns Attack in the Alekhine Defence, and as with that attack, the de bate about its merits often takes on a re ligious fervour. However, the truth is too complex to justify a simple black-and-white assessment, even if these two colours do have a natural ap peal for a chess player; the intelligent use of statistical analysis allows today's commentators to make assessments that are based on something more concrete than subjective opinion. The perfor mance of 5 .f4 is in line with other White variations. The real surprise is that the draw rate is equivalent too, H if

Unlike the 'Benoni' variation with cxdS, the capture with the e-pawn robs the position of its dynamism, but it has the 'advantage' of being less risky We have already seen similar positions in the minor variations of the King's In dian: here the presence of the f-pawn adds a little spice - if White manages to advance it to fS he may gain attacking K in g ' s I n d i a n Defence prospects; if on the other hand Black succeeds in blocking the pawn's ad vance, it could represent a weakness.

However, this was not the first time the Russian GM had used it with success. In addition, it had also been used by Ivkov with good results. More recently, it has been adopted by noted players such as Alburt, Uhlmann, Farago, Kaidanov, Petursson, Yakovich and Bareev. With the two bishop moves, White prevents the characteristic ad vance 6 . . .e 5 ? (after the exchanges on e5 and d8 , 9 . tiJdS wins material) : it is true that Black can precede . . .e5 with 6 . . .h6, but in the positions after 7 .�e3 e5 8 .d5 Black's pawn would better off on h7 , both for the weakness on g6 and also because of a possible 'iYd2 , which would attack h6. If Black does not want to play 6 . . . c5 with the resulting Benoni-like pawn structure, the mod ern trend is to leave the bishop on g5 and to prepare for an ... e7-e5 advance with 6 . . . ttJbd7 or with 6 . . . ltJa6 .

.i � .t tv � .i i i i i i .t i i � · S.f2-f3 was first used by Samisch when he played against Yates in 1 9 2 5 , and from that time it has been second in popularity only to the Classical Varia tion. As in its Nimzo-Indian namesake, White occupies the centre with pawns in order to launch a kingside attack. Naturally, the strategic themes are com pletely different here. White does not have to concern himself with doubled c-pawns, but Black conserves the bishop pair. The factors that are com mon to both lines are central expansion and a space advantage. What is the point of this move, given that the e-pawn is already defended? Gufeld also suggested that you ask the g 1 knight for its opinion of 5 .f3 ! It is highly likely that Black will soon castle kingside and White intends to continue along the lines of the Yugo slav Attack in the Dragon with �e3 , 'fid2 , g4, h4, h S , �h6 and possibly tt::l d5 to exchange off the last defender of the castled king. However, in the real world, this noble plan rarely comes to fruition, and White is obliged to be flexible and adapt to the various defensive options available to Black. In this sense, the Samisch can also be an effective positional weapon, and the imposing White centre can simply be a means to limit Black's mobility. The list of champion players who have frequently used the Samisch is a long one: among the most devoted there is Gheorghiu, Spassky, Portisch, Karpov, Knaak, Timman, Dreev and Sakaev. Let's take a step back: as we have seen before, Black can castle instead of play ing 4 . . .d6, usually resulting in a simple move inversion. However, in this case after
4. ... O-O
5. f2-f3
Black can try 5 . ... c7-c5!? i b b b t2J 8 b b b b 1::1 � 'iY w � tt:J � The idea is that after the capture 6.dxc5 , Black can reply with the promising
S
Al 1AA1A 6 . . .b 6 ! ? (after 7 .cxb6, the move 'iYxb6 applies pressure to b2 and prevents cas tling) . Aware of this, White could opt for
6. d4-d5
With a transposition to the Benoni. For this reason, many texts say that if White wishes to play the Samisch, he should play 5 .�e3 ! , and only after 5 . . .d6 con tinue with 6.f3. All this, presuming it is true, has be come irrelevant since it was discovered that the gambit 6 . . . c5 against the Samisch is perfectly playable, and White's best reply is probably the ad vance to d5. We will discuss this at fur ther length later on. Let's return to the usual sequence: after
4. ... d7-d6
5. f2-f3
Black can decide not to castle and in stead play 5 . . . e5 6.d5 (6.tt::l ge2 ! ?) 6 . . . tt::l h5 7 .�e3 f5 8 ."i¥d2 f4 9 .�f2 �f6 ! ? 1 0 .tt::l ge2 �h4 l l .g3 �g5 , but White maintains an edge. However,
5 . ... O-O
is easily the most popular reply, and in the past White responded almost exclu sively with 6.�e3 so as to prevent 6 . . .c5 . However, when it became clear that the pawn push was in fact possible, two previously marginal lines became very popular: 6.tt::l ge2 and 6.�g 5 . A ) 6 . tt:Jg1 -e2 Much loved by Alexey Dreev. It comes as no surprise that he also likes to play the Kapengut Variation in the Benoni, in which this move is a common fea ture. Kin g ' s I n d i a n D efen ce

A minor drawback i s that i t i s impossi ble to play 7 .�d3 or 7 .tt::l h3 , which in the 'normal' Sarnisch has proved itself to be most effective against 6 . . .c6 and 6 . . . tt::l bd7 respectively.
6. ... e7-e5
The classical reply in the King's Indian, but certainly not the only option: be sides the two moves that have just been mentioned, Black has at his disposal all the other lines that are playable in the 'normal' Samisch and it is not easy to say when the possibility of �g5 repre sents a true advantage. 6 . . . tt::l c6 or 6 . . . a6 are invitations to transpose to the Panno Variation, whereas 6 . . .c5 7 .d5 (7 .�e3 ! ?) 7 . . .e6

has such a good performance that you could almost wonder about the viability of the . . .e 7 -e 5 advance. However, the reality is that Black can survive, even if the process is somewhat gruelling. 2 8 1 Benoni. Chess Open ing Essen t i als - Vol ume 3 :i ,.

6. �c1 -e3
At this point, Black has a healthy choice of six playable replies, besides the flexi- King 's I n d i a n Defence ble 6 ... a6, which allows Black to post pone his decision until the next move. For example, if White plays 7 .�d3 , Black can enter an improved version of the 6 . . .c5 line with 7 . . .c5 ! (as played by Kasparov) . However, as White almost always continues with 7 .� dl or 7 .tLlge2, this refinement seems to be academic. It is worth noting that the curiosity 6 . . .aS has been tried (only a few times if the truth be told! ) . After 7 .�d2 a4! ?, what can you say? Is this genius or madness? The fact that some chess en gines only give White a minimal advan tage at this point is certainly food for thought ! A) 6 . ... b7-b6 The Double Fianchetto Variation. However, the aim is not to fianchetto the bishop on b 7 , but rather to support the advance . . .c7 -cS , without the risks of the sacrifice. It was quite often played in the 1 9 60 's and 7 0 's, but now it is rarely seen.

On the other hand, this knight is nicely located on h3 , and were it not for the d7 knight, which stops . . . ltxh3 , this move would be impossible. From h3 the knight can go to f2 , so as to control g4, or possibly to d3 . The traditional role of a knight on e2 - namely to sup port d4 - is less important here, given that it is impossible for Black to attack d4 with . . . ttJc6.

�t t��.-'if w k tD� � As in the Fianchetto Variation, also here the line with the knight move to c6 is called the Panno Variation. This line first came to light in the 1 950's but it quickly became one of the most popular variations. It was a firm favour ite of both Fischer and Kasparov. As is so often the case, 6 . . . tt'lc6 had actually been played several times before; indeed, it featured in the previously mentioned 1 92 5 debut game of the Sanusch Varia tion. However, this move was originally a preparation for the . . . e7 -eS push, and after White played d4-d5 the knight would retreat to e7. This is what Black does in the Mar del Plata Variation, which is discussed further on. However, here White has some advantages: he has already played f2-f3 and he is ready to start a queenside initiative, whereas in the earlier variation, White has to lose tempi in fmding a better home for the f3 knight. Panno's insight was to connect 2 8 5

If White exchanges on bS, Black gets a central pawn majority, while if White does not exchange, Black can open the b-file and activate his rook. In addition, if the White knight leaves e2 (it usually goes to c 1 , clearing the diagonal for the fl bishop and preventing . . .bS) , Black will take advantage of the weakened d4-square by advancing his e-pawn to eS and then installing the knight on d4. For his part, White can play positionally with the manoeuvre tbe2-c 1 -b3 , but more usually he will attack the black king by castling queenside and advanc ing the g- and h-pawns. As you can imagine, this results in com peting attacks on both wings, produc ing scintillating skirmishes that appeal to players who are looking for an adrenalin buzz. The extraordinary duel between Bagirov and Gufeld from 1 9 7 3 immediately comes to mind; it is de servedly one of the most famous King's Indian games of all time. It is no easy matter to catalogue this line as White can continue in three different ways: • play 'ii' d2 without tbge2 • play tbge2 without �d2 • play both tbge2 and 'iVd2 01) 7. 'i¥d1 -d2 a7-a6

It therefore comes as no surprise that it took over half a century to understand the true nature of this position1 We now realise that in fact Black has his trumps: the f2-f3 advance has not only weak ened the dark squares, but also made kingside development complicated; the c6 knight is ready to jump threaten ingly to b4 or to the hole on d4; the g7 bishop is more active than its white counterpart; and the f6 knight can also get into the act by going to eS via d7. When you add Black's slight lead in de velopment to all this, it comes as less of a surprise that an ample database of games shows Black's performance to be superior to 50%! We do not want to suggest that Black is objectively better; that would be an ex aggeration. However, making the safe assumption that the average white player will usually have a less sophisti cated positional understanding than Karpov (who had excellent results with the white pieces) , these positions are easier for Black to play.

The aggressive and appealing Uhlmann Variation is truly in the spirit of the King's Indian and it is thus a popular choice, regardless of whatever objective defects it may have.

� .. � 8 8 8 ttJ ttJ 8 8 � 8 8 8 1:[ � 'iY � .a: Now we have come to the favourite weapon against the King's Indian, namely the Classical Variation. It was adopted more than once by Colle in the 1 9 2 0 's (he did not exclusively play the system to which his name is so fa mously associated!) . The epithet classi cal is not just a reference to the line's longevity and predominance. It is also common to refer to set-ups character ised by the moves ti:Jf3 and �e2 as clas sical. Once White has occupied the cen tre, he will continue with natural moves and postpone aggressive action until development has been completed. Compared to the wide range of options that are frequently employed by Black against the Samisch, here Black almost exclusively plays
6. ... e7-e5
In fact, both 6 . . . ti:Jbd7 and 6 . . . ti:Ja6 are possible (they are usually used as a means of avoiding the irritating Ex change Variation) , but after the subse quent . . .e7 -eS advance, you transpose to the lines discussed below. Also 6 ...c5 does not lead to a distinct line; if the white d-pawn advances to dS you transpose to the Benoni, whereas if White plays 7.O-O, after 7 . . . cxd4 8.ti:Jxd4 you are no longer in a Queen's Pawn Opening but in a Mar6czy Bind against the Accelerated Dragon in the Sicilian. 6 . . . �g4 is an alternative worth looking at. I .. 'if I . l i � � � .t � � .. � It applies pressure to the d4-square, which is now somewhat 'weakened' by the previous pawn advances to e4 and c4. After 7 .i.e3 ! ti:Jfd7 ! (White permit ting, the idea is to play . . . ti:Jc6, take on f3 , push . . . e7 -eS and install the knight on d4) 8 .ti:Jg l ! ?

This line's lack of popular appeal can be explained by the fact that the resulting Maroczy Bind pawn structure is too positional to appeal to a typical King's Indian enthusiast. We now return to 6 . . .e 5 . There are four main paths available for White: • Exchange Variation 7 .dxeS • Gligoric Variation 7 .�e3 • Petrosian Variation 7 .dS • Main Line 7 .

C h ess Opening Essen t i als - Vo l u m e 3 This line was made popular by the Yu goslav GM in the 1 9 60's. Curiously, he developed the Gligoric Variation to avoid another ' Gligoric Variation ' , namely 7 . ..Ci::, c6 after 7 .O-O. Indeed, his theoretical contribution to this last black line (which, as we'll soon see, was labelled the Mar del Plata Variation) is such that the variation could almost be named in his honour. The variation 7 .�e3 is very dangerous, especially if Black plays mechanically. For example, if Black plays the sponta neous 7 . ..Ci::, c6, after 8 .d5 CiJe7 9 . CiJd2! - unlike the 9 . CiJd2 variation that we will see in the Main Line - White has a bishop on e3 without having castled; this is clearly advantageous.
7. ... CiJf6-g4
Highlighting the downside of the bishop move; this has always been the most popular move. However, Black has many other alternatives that are more or less playable: 7 . . . CiJa6 ! ? 8 . O-O transposes to the line that we discuss in the next section; 7 . . .h 6 ! ? - Nunn's favourite - with the idea of controlling g S before playing . . . CiJg4; 7 . . . exd 4 8. CiJxd4 l:Be8 trying to establish active piece play; 7 . . . "V/Iie7 applies pressure to e4 and en courages White to capture on eS or push d4-d5 ; and lastly 7 . . .c6, which is a preparatory move with the option of a more effective exchange on d4. As you can see, we are dealing with a very complex variation that has many unexplored possibilities.

Blocking the path of the g 7 bishop.
9. �g5-h4
Some prefer 9 .�c 1 . It could seem odd to make three bishop moves only to find the bishop back on its original square, but Black's g4 knight will need to use tempi to relocate, and the f6 pawn is most certainly not on its ideal square. After 9 . . . CiJc6 l O .dS CiJe7 l l .CiJd2 CiJh6 1 2 .b4 f5 1 3 .c5, we have a typical position characterised by com peting wing attacks, and it is difficult to say which one will succeed first.

[diagram]
i i i i � i � i � � ttJ ttJ � � � � � � l:t if � � This line was played as far back as the 1 92 0's and was often used by the Ar menian champion from the 1 95 0's on wards. It reflects the philosophy of the former World Champion; it was said that Petrosian would neutralise his op- King 's Ind i an Defence ponents' threats before they had even thought of them. In this line White plays �g5 to stop the typical manoeu vre tt:lh5 and f5 , and if Black kicks the bishop with . . . h6 and . . .g 5 , White re ceives positional compensation. The problem with this prophylactic strategy is that White's d4-d5 push represents a premature commitment. Against the King's Indian, it is usually better to wait for Black to force the advance with . . . tLlc6 ; on e7 the knight is more pas sively placed than on d7 and it requires an extra tempo to get it there. The Petrosian Variation was a favourite for a long period, but now it is much less played. However, this does not mean it has fallen into disrepute. Far from it; players of the calibre of Vallejo Pons and Kramnik frequently play the line. Black has two principal alterna tives, excluding 7 . . . tLla6 , which is play able, but not much liked because of 8 .tLld2 ! ? (Black can no longer advance his pawn to aS) . 7 . . . tt:Jh5 has also proved to be unsatisfactory as there is

Chess Opening Essen t i a l s - Vol u m e 3 With a sort of deferred Petrosian Varia tion in which ...c6 and . . . tt:la6 seem to be of less effective than White's kingside castling. However, it must be pointed out that White no longer can play the h2-h4 pawn break (see Keres's move on page 302) and thus Black can more confi dently weaken White's kingside by pushing his pawns to h6 and g5 . D) 7. ... e5xd4 Conceding the centre so early has al ways been considered premature: this assessment is probably correct as Black, after some initial piece play, will find himself with a slightly cramped, infe rior position and with none of the broad strategic objectives characteristic of the King's Indian open to him.

Not bad, when you consider it was not even mentioned in Volume E of the 1 9 7 8 edition ofECO. When you think of the enormous amount of theoretical data that the Mar del Plata has accumulated, it is not sur prising that players seek ways of winnin g that do not just require a perfect memory. It is worth noting that in order to avoid the Exchange Variation some people play ... tt:la6 on the sixth move and make the ...e7-e5 advance after 7 .O-O.

Also here we have dedicated an entire section to a single variation in recogni tion of its historical and strategic significance. The first thing we will discuss IS Its name. Ignoring sporadic appearances in minor tournaments in the 1 9 3 0 's and 40's, the first example of 7 . ..ti:Jc6 in high-level play was in 1 95 2 . In the Rus sian Championship of that year, Taimanov won two important games against Bronstein and Aronin with the move 1 0 .�e3 . However, in the spring of 1 9 5 3 , in the Mar del Plata tourna ment in Argentina, Gligoric won two games with the black pieces against Najdorf and Eliskases. Najdorf actually played 1 0 . tt:ld3 , but the breakthrough was that in the first game Gligoric used the move sequence that was to become standard for any King's Indian player:

This is the starting position of the Mar del Plata Variation. White is faced with the prospect of a Black kingside attack. He has five logical ways to establish his de fence and create queenside counterplay. A) 9. �c1 -d2 A simple developing move which al lows White to postpone the decision as to where to best develop the king's knight. This was very rarely played be fore 1 9 7 1 .

This knight move prevents . . . tt:lhS , pre pares to support the centre with f2-f3 and after c4-c5 , the idea is to transfer the knight to c4, where it will be ideally placed. Naturally, there are also draw backs: compared to the knight on d3 in Variation E the d2 knight does not sup port the advance c4-c5, it blocks the 3 1 2 path of the c I bishop and it allows Black to play . . . �h6 .
9. ... a7-a51
By a good margin, the most played : now White will need to make two moves before advancing his pawn to b4 (a2-a3 and .l:.b l ) . Unlike the lines that we will see in Variation E , a number of games have demonstrated that it is pru dent for Black to take preventive mea sures before attacking the white king. For example, after the direct 9 . . . tt:ld7 I O .b4 fS I I .f3 f4 1 2 .c5 ! tt:Jf6 1 3 .tt:lc4 gS 1 4.�a3 ! tt:lg6 I S .bS tt:le8 1 6.b6, White's attacking forces have arrived, whereas Black is still some distance from threatening the white king. The same can also be said for 9 . . . tt:le8. A radical alternative is 9 . . .cS. It was cho sen by Fischer in his famous 1 9 7 1 Can didates' match with Larsen, which ended in a remarkable 6-0 whitewash. Although it is true that the knight can no longer go to c4, White can still ob tain good play on the queenside with I O J�b l tt:le8 l l .b4 b6 1 2 .bxc5 bxcS 1 3 .'iWa4 �h6 1 4.tt:lb3 . There is also the very old 9 . . . �h6 , with the idea of getting rid of the bad bishop, even though nobody plays it anymore. It is indeed hard to justify moving the bishop three times only to exchange it for its counterpart still on its original square. It is also important to remember that as far as the bishop is concerned, 'bad' does not always mean 'worthless' ! As Tarrasch wrote: Before the endgame, the gods have placed the middlegame. For example, in the absence of the g 7 bishop, after the push . . .f7-fS , White can more confidently take on fS as

This makes it safer to undermine White's centre with . . .c7 -c6. However, the main advantage is that White will have difficulty to develop a constructive plan on the queenside. The c4-c5 advance has been stopped for the time being, and playing tbb3 in order to support this pawn push denies White the possibility of transferring the knight to c4.

White has obvious compensation for the pawn, with a slightly better game. 3 1 3 Chess Opening E s s e n t i a l s - Vol u m e 3 D) 9. b2-b4 This was a marginal line for decades, and then it suddenly became highly popular in the 1 990's after its adoption by Bareev, Epishin, Van Wely, and, most influentially, Kramnik. At the time of writing, it is the number one choice and it is the most serious challenger to the Mar del Plata Variation. White does not take precautionary measures against . . . ti:JhS and . . .fS , but immediately turns his attention to the c4-c5 advance. The direct thrusting na ture of the move inspired the name Bayonet Attack. At the beginning, it was considered harmless enough, but in the 1 990's, new improvements were discovered that quickly revealed how dangerous it is (see 1 0 J:re 1 ! ) . For a while, Black continued to try various aggressive replies in the hope of gain ing an advantage. However, this ap proach backfired and allowed White to gain excellent results. With the estab lishment of the Bayonet's reputation, players appreciated that it was necessary to approach it with more caution, and in 2 00 5 , its performance was back in line with other King's Indian variations. This is a common phenomenon; with the discovery of a novelty, performance statis- 3 1 4 tics are marked by sudden ups and downs, but after a while effective coun termeasures are discovered and results enter the normal band. It is worth re membering that in recent times openings that were once considered to be doubtful have been re-evaluated and they are now considered perfectly playable - the Albin Counter-Gambit, the Chigorin De fence, the Evans Gambit and the Buda pest Gambit, just to mention a few. It is therefore impossible to imagine that an established line such as the Mar del Plata Variation willever be refuted. Let's return to the specifics. The critical continuation is obviously

With the idea of activating the knight on f4 and making an .. .f7 -fS advance. Another attempt to highlight the short comings of 9.b4 is 9 . . .a5 , which ex ploits the fact that it is impossible for White to play a2-a3, and thus Black can break up White's pawn front. The result is an atypical pawn structure character ised by a semi -open b- file, which forces Black to defend b 7 , but at the same time denies White the chance to make pawn breaks.

What is mind-bog gling is that this move did not come to light until 1 99 5 . The Bayonet had been played again and again over a 40-year period at the highest levels, yet after all that time such a strong novelty was dis covered only two half-moves into the variation!

E) 9. tt:Jf3-e1 This move used to be the most played, but now it has slipped to second place. The plan, besides the usual objectives of stopping . . . ti:JhS and preparing f2-f3 , is to move the knight to d3. from where it can support the c4-c5 advance and con trol the important b4-, f4- and eS-squares. In addition, it is sometimes usefully posted on f2 so as to defend its monarch against a kingside attack.
9. ... tt:Jf6-d7
The plan is to quickly prepare for .. .£7 -fS . which in effect is the only plan available to Black in this line. Sometimes Black does in fact play 9 . . . tbe8 with the same idea, but given that the knight almost always ends up on f6, it does not change much. Only in a few lines do we see small differ ences. Generally, it is preferable to place the knight on d7 as it makes the c4-c5 advance more difficult. In addi tion, a possible f2-f4 push becomes 3 1 8 less appealing for White with the d7 knight ready to occupy eS. The only advantage of playing . . . tbe8 is to con trol the c7 -square, which can be useful in a few lines in which White quickly opens the c-file. That said, it is worth noting that Kasparov played 9 . . . tbe8 a couple of times in the 1 99 0 's; perhaps his inten tion was to encourage I 0 .�e 3 . In deed, in the line I O . . .fs 1 I . f3 f4 1 2 ..�.. f2 gS it is true that, unlike in Variation E2 , White can immediately play 1 3 . cS ! .

At first glance White seems to be clearly better, but a more accurate examination would suggest that Black's counterplay is sufficient to maintain the balance. Probably White's best response to 9 . . . ti:Je8 is 1 0.f3 fs 1 l .g4! along the lines of Variation E 1 , in which the knight cannot be developed to cS . We will now return to 9 ... tbd7 and discuss White's three principal options: 1 0.f3 , 1 0.�e3 and 1 0.tLld3 .

However, there are some who rightly call it the Kortchnoi Varia tion in honour of this man's significant contributions to the line from the 1 980's on. The line has been the subject of debate, and it is one of the sharpest variations in the entire King's Indian. The bishop on e3 favours the .. .f5-f4 pawn push, with an acceleration of Black's attack, and once the bishop is on f2 , it is exposed to the pawn advance to g3. However, it also equally true that on f2 the bishop can ef fectively contribute to White's queenside assault by attacking a7 and controlling the important b6-square. In short, we are dealing with a race. Per formance results reflect the small advan tage that White always has.

Otherwise, there is 1 4.'it>h l so that h 2 can be defended by iit.g 1 . But the most energetic is a sacrifice.

At this point, it is no simple task to give a con crete evaluation of each side's respective prospect on the wings.

The strategic concept is to eliminate the fundamentally important c8 bishop after 1 3. ..a6 1 4.tLla7. Do not forget that Black's chances of successfully attacking the kingside are reduced to practically zero without the light-squared bishop, which supports . . .g5-g4 and attacks the h3-point. This is true not only in this line, but for all the Mar del Plata variations. The tactical justification for the move lies in the fact that after 1 4. .
