Preface This is an ideal book for the active club player who wants to und.erstand what's going on in the opening of a chess game. I believe Chess opening Essentials is: a Comprehensive: it covers all main variations likely to arise . Easy-to-use: importanr moves and key positions are highlighted in colour o LonS-IastinS: it doesn't outdate quickly because it is about the basics, not the latest fashions . Complete: it explains the plans and counterplans for both white and Black o Down-to-earflr: simple, verbal introductions (no database-dump full of dead trees) o Conzsenienf: every opening is illustrated with a number of instructive games. The authors quite lucidly explain the plans behind rhe various openings, as well as many subtle similarities and differences between them. This way, without giving endless variations, they manage to get across the essence of every opening. Also, the often colourful history of variations is elaborated upon in an entertaining way. Although Chess Opening Essentinls is about understanding the ideas behind the openings, and not about following the latest fashions in top-level chess, we could not do without a limited amount of updating. This volume of the originally Italian series Capire Ie Aperf zre (published in 2 0 0 5 ) has been brought up to date with new develop- ments and games unril rhe beginning of 2009. The colours in this book we believe to be a great help for the reader to navigate more quickly, and to distinguish between, for instance, main lines and others. Col- oured text highlights important moves, and also key initial positions and positions arising after important sequences. Bold type, be it in black or in colour, indicates main lines, which are also classified and sub-classified. Lines given in italics areun- sound lines that should be avoided. But this is not all. There are also numerous graphic fearures highlighting moves, plans, and suong or weak points. We believe that all this makes foi a highly pleasant and accessible presentation, and hope that you, our readers, will agree. I am convinced that by studying this book, beginners, casual players as well as club players can improve their game and enjoy a deeper understanding of the game ofchess in its entirety. For even stronger players it can be a tool to test and review their opening repertoire.

Chess Opening Essentiols - Volume 2 After 1. e4, Black can ler White occupy the two centre squ;ues - by playing the French, thg far.6-Kann or the pirc - also after 1.d4 Black can ignore White's threat to push his pawn ro e4 and play
1...e6, 1...d6 or 1...c6. Here White is
allowed the opporrunity to play Z.e4 - naturally, transposing into one of the semi-open games. However, most of the time, a l.d4-player will choose ro play 2.c4 so as to remain within the realms of the Queen's Pawn Game. Throughout our book, we use the term Queen's Pawn Game in its most general sense, i.e. for any chess opening which starts with 1.d4, regardless of whether White follows up with an early pawn advance to c4, or not. Let's go back a step, and repeat the question we asked at rhe beginning of the firstvolume: What is thebest move in thispositionT The classical approach is still to occupy the centre with pawns. But which pawn should we move first, given that there are two centre pawns to choose from? As we noted before, our great-grand- parents had few doubts: the move 1.e41 It favours the development of the king's bishop and the queen.It also has the ad- vantage of moving the strategic centre of gravity to the kingside (where we usually find the two kings afrer cas- tling), laying the groundwork for an at- tacking initiative against the black mon- arch, something which is less common in the Queen's Pawn Game. WeIl, if all this is true, why is rhe move
1.d4 equally popular and equally
strong? The answer to this question lies in the fact that after Black's principal re- sponses, White can continue with
2.c4t, leaving the c4 and d4 pawns
aligned, with strong control of the cen- ue. This is not something that happens in a King's Pawn Opening;well, at least not in the open games, or when Black plays the Sicilian, with the very inren- tion of denying White the opporrunity to align the rwo centre pawns. Tio put things simply, you could say that with 1.e4, Whire has the honourable intention of delivering a quick check- mate to the black king; while the move
1.d4 represents a more patient attempt
to control the centre, acquire greater piece mobility, gain some material and win in the endgame. Therefore, we have the popular conceprion that l d4 is a positional move, while l.e4 is an ag- gressive, tactically orientated one. Even if this way of seeing things is to a certain extent true, one should keep an open mind. For example, the young IGr- pov - the quintessentially solid player - preferred to open with 1.e4; Kasparov in the 1970's and 80's - when he was prob-

Let's go back a step, and repeat the question we asked at the beginning of the first volume: What is the best move in this position? vantage of moving the strategic centre of gravity to the kingside (where we usually find the two kings after cas- tling), laying the groundwork for an at- tacking initiative against the black mon- arch, something which is less common in the Queen's Pawn Game. Well, if all this is true, why is the move
1.d4 equally popular and equally
strong? The answer to this question lies in the fact that after Black's principal re- sponses, White can continue with
2.c4', leaving the c4 and d4 pawns
aligned, with strong control of the cen- tre. This is not something that happens in a King's Pawn Opening; well, at least not in the open games, or when Black plays the Sicilian, with the very inten- tion of denying White the opportunity to align the two centre pawns. To put things simply, you could say that with l.e4, White has the honourable intention of delivering a quick check- mate to the black king; while the move 1 .d4 represents a more patient attempt to control the centre, acquire greater piece mobility, gain some material and win in the endgame. Therefore, we have the popular conception that l.d4 is a positional move, while l.e4 is an ag- gressive, tactically orientated one. Even if this way of seeing things is to a certain extent true, one should keep an open mind. For example, the young Kar- pov - the quintessentially solid player - preferred to open with 1 .e4; Kasparov in the 1970's and 80s - when he was prob-
ABAB&BAB
The classical approach is still to occupy the centre with pawns. But which pawn should we move first, given that there are two centre pawns to choose from? As we noted before, our great-grand- parents had few doubts: the move 1.e4! It favours the development of the king's; bishop and the queen. It also has the ad- ably even more aggressive than at the end of his career - usually chose 1 .d4. With 1.e4, it is doubtlessly true that White often has a good initiative against the black king from a strategic point of view - one only has to think of certain lines in the Sicilian. However, there are more than a few variations af- ter l.e4 in which Black castles queen- side, taking the king away from the heat of the battle, with the intention of forc- ing a slow strategic struggle - the Clas- sical Variation of the Caro-Kann imme- diately comes to mind. There is also no doubt that 1.d4 is the more solid choice; however, there are certain lines in the Four Pavms Attack of the King's Indian (which we discuss in Volume 3), and, even more so, in the Botvirurik Yariation of the Semi-Slav, which are absolutely hair-raising for even the most seasoned attacking player. The point is that it is fine to know and respect the general principles that have shaped our chess thinking since the times of Wilhelm Steinitz. However, they should be utilized with the aware- ness that every position has its unique characteristics, and therefore generali- sations may be irrelevant in any given position. Here is a useful example to make this idea clearer: if you employ three tempi to exchange a bad bishop for a good one, you perform a strategically justi- fied manoeuwe. However, if in those three tempi your opponent can launch a winning attack against your king, your manoeuwe was simply a fatal er- ror. Thus, we see the difficulty and beauty of chess: the necessity to be able to weigh up the interconnected relation- ships between dynamic and strate- gic/positional elements. 1l The point is that it is fine to know and respect the general principles that have shaped our chess thinking since the times of Wilhelm Steinitz.

Black has the possibility of an inrerest- ing plan: to place the g8 knight on e7 instead of on f6. Compared to the Benoni there is the disadvantage of ex- erting less pressure on the centre, but there are positive features as well: on e7 the knight is less exposed to rhe the- matic pawrr push e4-e5; Black's pavrn advance to f5 is easier to execute, and best of all... there is llttle theorv to study!

Consistent. Black wishes to develop his g8 knight without allowing the ex- change on f6, in the full knowledge that this expansion on the kingside creates weaknesses. At this point White can continue in two ways: C1) 4. e2-e3

The most thematic: White pins his hopes on a structural advantage, but he can also proceed normally with 4.e3, or try to transpose to a favourable variation of the Staunton with 4.f3. In both of these cases Black will have no problems equalising the game.

White can play this pawn push after de- veloping his kingside pieces, but once again, for the sake of convention we will examine the move when it is played at this point in the game. Black has two fundamental approaches to choose from: . llyin-Zhenevsky: play the d-pawn to d6 - either now or later on. . Stonewall: play the d-pawn to d5 - el- ther now or later on. When Black chooses the first option, he usuaily develops his bishop to e7 and then plays his pawn to d6. On the other hand, with the Stonewall Black usually plays ...d5 immediately (or after 4...c6) so that he can develop his bishop to d6. From the minor alternatives, it is worth mentioning 4...s'b4+!?

1-0 When Black chooses die first option, he usually develops his bishop to e7 and then plays his pawn to d6. On the other hand, with the Stonewall Black usually plays ...dS immediately (or after 4...c6) so that he can develop his bishop to d6. From the minor alternatives, it is worth mentioning 4... .b4+!? (a subtle move that we also find in the Catalan, King's Chess Opening Essenticls - Volume 2 Indian and Bogo-Indian, and which is obviously not possible if White delays the c2-c4 push) S.AdZ AeZ and unlike in the normal variations, Black hopes to demonstrate that the white bishop is worse off on d2 than it is on cl. In effect the bishop can no longer develop to b2 or to a3, the queen no longer defends d4 and the bishop on d2 often comes under attack with the move ...he4. However, these factors are academic considerations given that games with
4...4b4+ and 4...4e7 have more or less
the same performance results. llyin-Zhenevsky

d7-d6 We have now come to the key position of this variation; Black can pick from rhe three variations that are indicated by arrows. Black's plan is to prepare an ...e7-e5 ad- r-ance with active kingside play, employ- rrg the queen on h5 or 96. White for his Dart will rry to prevent the ...e5 push with o3 and Ab2, or he will follow the classic rdvice that is taught h insuuction manu- als and defend against Black's kingside at- ack by opening up the centre.

A) 7. ... £jf6-e4 Not often played, but probably a better move than its reputation would suggest. Freeing the f6-square for the bishop seems logical. In addition, the thematic advance e2-e4, if not prevented, is at least delayed. Alekhine sometimes played this one move earlier (in the po- sition without d6 and 4bc3), but post- poning the move seems more reliable, even if it is less flexible. We have now come to the key position of this variation; Black can pick from the three variations that are indicated by arrows. Black's plan is to prepare an ...e7-e5 ad- vance with active kingside play, employ- ing the queen on hS or g6. White for his part will try to prevent the ...e5 push with b3 and 51b2, or he will follow the classic advice that is taught in instruction manu- als and defend against Black s kingside at- tack by opening up the centre. With that objective in mind, White will prepare the e2-e4 advance with Rc2 or •el. Black can physically prevent this by planting a knight on the e4-square; otherwise, he can allow the advance, and after the exchange on e4 hope that maximising his piece activity will com- pensate for the weak e6-square. More rarely, Black will respond to the e2-e4 push with a counter-push to f4, which can lead to a dangerous initiative against the white king, however, it ap- pears to be positionally questionable as it leaves White with an imposing centre of three aligned pawns.

To prevent this Black must play actively, generally on the kingside, or more rarely in the centre with ...b7-b6 and ...c6-c5.It is interesting to note that un- til the 1950's the Stonewall was consid- ered to be a Queen's Gambit variation, rather than belonging to the Dutch. This is because the ...f/-f5 advance was played after ...e6 as a radical method to prevent an e2-e4 advance. This ap- proach is still used today in various variations of the Semi-Slav, in particu- Iar when White solidly plays his pawn to e3 and denies his bishop the possibility of going to f4. To make this concept clearer we wi-ll look at the following move sequence: I .d4 d5 7.c4 c6 (Slav) 3.af3 e6 (Semi-Slav) 4.4c3.

At first this may appear odd; if the weakness on e5 is the Achilles' heel of Black's position, what could be more natural than to exert control over it with Qf3? The answer lies in the fact that experi- ence has taught us that the best config- uration for the white knights is when they are on d3 and f3, from where they both bear down on eS; this placement is even more powerful after an ex- change of the dark-squared bishops. Chess Opening Essentiols * Volume 2 Let's have a look at the following two diagrams: In both cases White needs 5 moves to get his knights to d3 and f3. However, in the second case, if Black plays ...Ado - as he so often does - White has the option to exploit the weaknesses on the dark squares with Af4. Naturally this is only the case if the knight is still on h3, from where it can take the black bishop without compromising White's parvn structure with gxf4. This also explains why the move hc3, which is so common in other Dutch variations, is far less frequent here. From c3 the knight requires a mini- mum of four moves before it can exert its influence on the e5-square. Let's go back to

From c3 the knight requires a mini- mum of four moves before it can exert its influence on the e5-square.

However, sometimes the idea of enter- ing into a highly theoretical duel is not appealing, and White can choose from a number of reasonable alternatives in which he simply goes about developing his pieces without 'wasting time'with the c2-c4 advance. These alternatives offer White less control of the centre. but this is compensated for by the fact that the resulting positions are generally easier to play and do not require you to stay up to date with the latest novelties.

Hang on, there must be a mistake! Doesn't Black play 1...d5 in order to make 2.e4 imoossible? It is true that 2.e4 has some theoretical dignity as an answer to the Dutch - which indeed aims to make e4 as diffi- cult as possible to play. This is because after 1...f5 the pawn sacrifice is justified by the resulting weakening of Black's kingside. However, the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit is another kettle of fish entirely. If this gambit were sound, it would com- pletely change the way we view the Queen's Pawn Game as a whole. And this it most certainly does not do. Even with best play White does not gain an advantage of any sort, and indeed he must usually struggle even to maintain equality. You may then well ask why the Black- mar-Diemer Gambit attracts so marry en- thusiasts lf it ls such a disaster (no grandmaster fans, if the truth be told). Indeed, there must be something to rec- ommend it. Otherwise it would not have inspired the many books that have been entirely dedicated to it, not to mention the many respected defences that carry the names of great players of the past who believed the gambit to be suffi- ciendy problematic to merit their atten- tion. Despite all this, the latest edition of ECO has seen fit to make no reference of any sort to the Blackmar-Diemer. The gambit's appeal is that it brings back memories of the Romantic School of play, which still has many devotees, es- pecially at lower levels of competition.

Hang on, there must be a mistake! Doesn't Black play l...d5 in order to make 2.e4 impossible? Chess Opening Essentiols - Volume 2 weapon in quick games, and even in a long game its surprise value can lead to fatal errors by Black. Let's have a look at some of the varia- tions:
2. d5xe4
For the faint-hearted there is always the choice to transpose to the Caro-Kann with 2...c6, or to the Frenchwith 2...e6.
3. Abl-c3 6g8-f6
One thing that is sure to sadden the hearts of devotees of this opening is the dreary possibility that Black will re- spond with 3...e5!?, which leads to arid equality after the queen exchange that follows 4.dxe5 (the other fourth move alternatives do not impress). As an anti- dote to this, some creative players have tried playing 2.Q:8 and 3.e4 only after
2...4f6 has been played. However, rhe
solution to one problem has created yet a bigger one: 3...4xe4! (instead of the mechanical 3...dxea) gives Black the advantage.
4. I2-t3
Here is the idea: White hopes to get compensation by opening the f-fiIe.
4. e4xf3
For those who like a quiet life, 4...e3 is a good alternative.
5. Ag1xf3
Let's look at the posirion: Black has no weaknesses, but White enjoys a good space advantage and open lines; in addi- tion his pieces are ready to be devel- oped actively: bishops on c4 and 95, rooks on fl and e1. Isn't this enough to justify the gambit? To repeat, the an- swer is still probably no. However, opinions do differ, and at rimes they are expressed with an almost religious fervour! Now we will have a quick glance at the three most common defensive options: A) 5. g7-96 The Bogoliubow Defence.

Chess Opening Essentiols - Volume 2 Ignoring Lasker's advice to develop knights before bishops! However, in this era of great pragmatism these max- ims are often disregarded. This opening first came to light in the 1930's and it is the brainchild of the Bra- zfian champion Octavio Tiompowsky. It remained a rarity until the 1980's, when it was used with ever more frequency by many English players (in particular by Hodgson) who wanted to get away from book and play something that gave greater scope to the imagination; as a re- sult, the Trompowsky was to become the most popular of the so-called minor lines. So much so that it is difficult to imagire Black being taken aback by the opening anFnore, and the time is ripe for experimental players to look for greener pastures if they wish to surprise their adversaries. With his second move White shows that he intends to exchange his bishop for the knight, if Black allows it, or oth- erwise to 'lose' a tempo relocating it af- ter 2...4e4. The Trompowsky Opening continues to be a popular choice against the Nimzo-/Queen's Indian and King's Indian/Griinfeld. After 2...e6. White will play 3.e4, whereas against 2...g6, the ideal response is 3.Axf6. However, it is important to note that these contin- uations do not necessarily give an ob- jective advantage to White. Nonethe- less, we can safely say that the resulting positions are not generally to the taste of a black player who plays these well-studied openings, hoping to have an advantage by virtue of their better knowledge of theory. Now we have come to Black's principal responses in order of ascending fre- quency: A) 2. g7'96

Colle System This opening system became popular since the 1920's thanks to the Belgian champion Edgar Colie, who played the opening with great virtuosity and at- tacking flair. After
1. d2-d4 d7-d5
(in those times 1...4f6 was a rarity) White continueswith
2. Ag1-f3
and in response to
2. 6g8-f6
or
2. e7-e5
he plays
3. e2-e3
The Colle System in the strict sense of the term requires 4.4d3 and 5.c3 after Black pushes his pawn to c5, E ArAge-€, E r# $rtr x* *rffi ll " awg tr reaching the position that knowledge- able players will recognise as a Semi-Slavwith a move in hand.

It is a curious fact that the Semi-Slav is famous for its ambitious and aggressive nature, while the Colle - the same for- mation but with an extra move - is con- sidered to be solid and conservative at higher levels! Indeed, the opening's performance statistics are not extraordi- nary, but at the same time its straight- forward nature makes it a frequent choice for lower-rated players. Like the Exchange Yariation of the French, it is often seen as an 'easy' way of drawing against a stronger player; an outcome that in fact does not usually occur as Black still is left with many ways ro win! The Colle produces balanced positions that grant both players opportunities, with the advantage that there is not a lot of theory to study. In the past, the Colle System only re- ferred to the diagrammed position. However, now it can be viewed as a uni- versal system for White that will see d4, Af3 and e3 played even when Black employs Indian sysrems, i.e. those defences that are initiated with I ...4f6.

€aa tr The move 2.c4 (mentioned by Polerio as far back as 1575) immediately puts pressure on Black's centre: it is the strongest and most common response to d5. Most of the time after 2.c7-c4, Black will defend his pawn with either
2...e6 or 7...c6. or otherwise take the c4
pawn. However, Black has various other minor alternatives available to him and recent practice has shown them to be much better than their previous reputations suggested. The ever-more-frequent use of minor systems is a trend of modern chess. There are two reasons for this phenom- enon: the first is the development of the Internet and information technology now means that the catalogued games of any tournament in the world are im- mediately available, with an overabun- dant amount of accompanying analysis that has no precedent. It is therefore natural that players who do not have the time to constantly check the latest de- velopments will be attracted to varia- tions which involve less theory; the sec- ond reason is the widespread use of chess engines (free 'rhinkers'by defini- tion).

The move 2.c4 (mentioned by Polerio as far back as 1575) immediately puts pressure on Black's centre: it is the strongest and most common response to dS. Most of the time after 2.c2-c4, Black will defend his pawn with either
2...e6 or 2...c6, or otherwise take the c4
pawn. However, Black has various other minor alternatives available to him and recent practice has shown them to be much better than their previous reputations suggested. The ever- more-frequent use of minor systems is a trend of modern chess. There are two reasons for this phenom- enon: the first is the development of the Internet and information technology now means that the catalogued games of any tournament in the world are im- mediately available, with an overabun- dant amount of accompanying analysis that has no precedent. It is therefore natural that players who do not have the time to constantly check the latest de- velopments will be attracted to varia-

4. Qd1-a4+
A nice finesse, defending a2 and pre- venting Nc6, before recapturing the piece. The normal 4. Exb I is also play- able: 4,..Rxd5 5.a3 Nc6 6.Nf3 O-O-O
7.Rc2!? (freeing himself of the pres-
sure on the d4 pawn by giving it up!)
7...6xd4 8.Nxd4 Rxd4 9.g3, with
good compensation.
4. ... c7-c6!
Black would hardly be enthusiastic about the prospect of playing the end- game after 4...Rd7 5.Rxd7+ xd7
6. Exbl £gf6 7..$.d2 Nxd5 8.e4 <&5f6
9.f3.
5. Ba1xb1
5.dxc6 Nxc6 6.Exbl would just make
Black's task easier after either the con- servative 6...Rxd4, or the more aggres- sive 6...e5!?.
5. ... Qd8xd5
6. f2-f3
The most ambitious; however, most players opt for the solid 6.4bf3 Nd7 (with the idea ...Nb6 and ...Rxa2)
7.a3 <£gf6 8.e3 Rf5! 9.3al eS, with a
satisfactory position.
6. ... e7-e5
6.. .£tf6 7.e4! Nxe4?! 8.Nc4 Rf5
9.fxe4! Qxe4+ 10.Ne2 Wxbl
I l.Rb3, with a decisive advantage for White.
5. ... Ha8-b8!
The best way to defend b7 .
6. Nc1-f4 <Ng8-f6
7. h2-h3 Af8-e7
8. e2-e3 a7-a6
9. Nb1-c3
It is not easy for White to gain any tan- gible benefit from his slight space ad- vantage. D) 3. c4xd5 The conceptually critical move; Black has not adequately defended the d5 pawn, and White takes it, seeking to make the most of the exposed black queen.
3. ... Af5xb1
A A A AAA
Naturally, Black will not allow Nc3. It seems reckless to move a bishop twice only to exchange if for an undeveloped knight.
7. d4xe5 ab8-d7
8. e2-e4 Rd5xe5
9. Q.g1-e2 Q:d7-c5
10. Ra4-d4 Re5-e6
11. 6e2-c3
White's good centre and possession of the bishop pair must in theory give him a small advantage. However, in practice the position is complex, which means that Black is not without resources. Bouton,Christophe Raetsky,Ale*ar.de" Cappelle Ia Grande I 995 (3)

While can also postpone the ex- change for another move if he wants, but by swapping pawns now there is the plus that you can delay the develop- ment of the g 1 knight and immediately play £jc3, Af4 and e3 with the possibil- ity of the gl knight going to e2. How- ever, with accurate play Black can achieve equality also here.

The only drawback is the weakening of the b6-square, which in many variations permits White to push his pawn to cS without concern: after ...b6 we nor- mally have cxb6, with an improved white pawn structure. It is worth noting that the f'8 bishop can also be developed 'normally' to e7, d6 or to b4, and in some variations it can be fianchettoed. It is this very flexibility that attracts contemporary players, who are con- stantly looking for unconventional lines that will favour the stronger player! White now has a wide range of plans that are more or less equivalent: here we will look at the most frequently played. The move 5.cxd5 is not in- cluded; although a common choice, it

e-, ll This is the starting position of the CIas- sical Variation of the Slav: by taking on c4, Black concedes the centre, but at the same time, he threatens to support the pawn with ...b7-b5, thus'forcing' White to play a2-a4, which will weaken the b4-square. Black can now prevent the immediate e2-e4 push by playing ...AfS and ...4U+. It is true that after suitable prep- aration, White often succeeds in ad- vancing his pawrr to e4, but in the meantime, Black can establish counterplay with pawn advances to either c5 or e5. The most common move in the dia- gram position is
5. a2-a4
which we will deal with soon; but first let's take a glance a couple of interesting alternatives in which White allows Black to support the b5 pawn. A) 5. e2-e3 b7-b5
6. a2-a4

Now White will move his a2 knight to b3 via cl, and Black must try to rid himself of the backward c6 pawn be- fore it is blockaded. This is the starting position of the Clas- sical Variation of the Slav: by taking on c4, Black concedes the centre, but at the same time, he threatens to support the pawn with ...b7-b5, thus 'forcing' White to play a2-a4, which will weaken the b4-square. Black can now prevent the immediate e2-e4 push by playing ...AfS and ... Lb4.

Black's position has proved itself to be playable, notwithstanding his compro- mised pawn structure and White's pair of bishops. At this point, you may well ask: doesn't this contradict basic posi- tional concepts? The answer is that that factor only represents a strength or a weakness if it can be exploited. In the case in question, White can only make the most of his bishop pair (the cl bishop is very passive) by opening up the position, but the doubled f5 parvn has the important duty of preventing or delaying the desirable e3-e4 push. Even if after the preparatory f2-f3 White does manage to make the advance, the resulting centre must be adequately supported. Otherwise, it would be a weakness instead of a strength. Another point in Black's favour is that often his pawns end up on light squares, and, in effect, he has favourably exchanged what would have been a bad bishop. At this point, your next question could well be: if that is the case, isn't Black better? The answer is no. It would be un- wise to exaggerate the positive aspects of Black's position. The truth is that White can carry out a dangerous plan based on a g2-g4 push. Let's have a look.

The truth is that While can carry out a dangerous plan based on a g2 g4 push. Let's have a look.

and now we see what White is up to: by undermining the f5 pawn White estab- lishes the necessary conditions for a more effective e3-e4 advance and a sub- sequent kingside initiative.

29Ad5+ 1-0 This opening is mentioned as far back as the 17th century (!) and it was played several times by Alexander MacDonnell against Louis de la Bourdonnais in their celebrated mara- thon match of 1834. It was later fre- quently employed by Alekhine. Today it is as popular as ever with highly ranked players wishing to create live- lier play than that associated with the Queent Gambit Declined, but with- out running the risks inherent in the Indian Defences. The classification of gambit is nomi- nal. Unlike in the King's Gambit, Black is usually unable to hang on to the pawn. The exceptions are a few very aggressive lines by White (e.g. the 4.4c3 variation), but of course it is White's choice not to oursue the pawn. Let's look at a representative line that shows how disastrous an irrational de- fence of the c4 pawn can be:
3. e2-e3l? b7-b5?!
4. a2-a4l c7-c6
5. a4xb5 c6xb5?
6. gd1-f3
and the a8 rook is lost. By taking on c4, Black seeks room for his pieces by opening up files and diagonals. In doing so, he concedes White a central parvn majority; however, Black hopes to counterattack the cenfre pawns with ei- ther a ...c7-c5 or an ...e7-e5 advance: a type of precursor to the Griirrfeld. With correct play, White preserves the small advantage that is the colour's bir*uight. Nonetheless, the ensuing strategic ten- sion gives Black reasonable chances, and therefore the defence is suited to players who have a superior understanding of positional play. Let's have a look at the specific lines. In the past, it was considered almost obligatory to play

The move 3...c5 is also playable: after 4.Axc4 cxd4 5.exd4, you reach a minor line of the Panov At- tack of the Caro-Kann in which White gains smoother play than in analogous positions with an isolated queen's pa\ rn.

The move 7...4b+, with the possibility of a fork on c2, is highly dubious be- cause of 8.4e2!; while 7...Ab7 is rightly or wrongly considered to be doubtful due to 8.e6!; whereas 7...c6 is revealed to be inadequate after 8.axb5 6xc3 9.bxc3 cxb5 10.4g5!, with good attacking possibilities for White. There- fore, Black is left with two possibilities: A) 7. e7-e6!? This move is now very popular, which is a comparatively recent trend that be- gan in the 1980's.

The position is almost symmetrical, but there are the following differences: the b6-square is slightly weaker because the a-pawn is on a6, the d1 rook is already at work, and Black is still to decide on what to do with his king. These things may not be enough to allow us to speak of an objective advantage, but in prac- tice, if Black makes even a small slip-up, he can find himself in trouble.

We have already dis- cussed the pro's and con's of 2...c6 in our introduction to the Slav.

Whether this is best done on the third move, as in the Tarrasch Defence, or at some later stage, is another question. Black intends to solve the problem of the light-squared bishop's development later on: usually placing it on b7, or somewhere on the natural c8-h3 diago nal if White makes the common deci- sion that it is opportune to play cxds.

At this point, if White does not want to transpose to normal variations with

Then in 1969 Spassky chose to play the Tarrasch no less than five times in his World Championship match with Chess Opening Essentiols - Volume 2 Petrosian, gaining four draws and a win - a decisive factor in Spassky's victory. Petrosian was famous for his deeply po- sitional style, and he was the last player in the world that you would want to face when employing a positionally du- bious defence. Needless to say, the fact that Spassky used the Tarrasch with such success against so formidable an opponent gave the defence's reputation an enormous boost. Its more than occa- sional use by Kasparov was another ma- jor factor in ensuring that the Thrrasch came to be viewed as a major defence. At the beginning of this century the most noted admirer of the Tarrasch was the powerful Russian player Grischuk. It is worth noting that this defence is not so popular at the lower levels of compe- tition, where there is a general reluctance to play with an isolani.

Positionally demanding, but playable. The d5 pawn ls less weak in this varia- tion, and the queenside pawn majority could become a trump card. On the downside, Black's game is less smooth and White can focus his strategy on centre play with Ae5, and breaking up Black's pawns with b2-b3 or e2-e4.

B) 3. gf8-b4 The Marshall Yariation is a hybrid that combines features from the classical Queen's Pawn Game and the Nimzo-Indian. In contrast with the lat- ter, Black has not yet developed his g8 knight and may perhaps play it to e7. However, this is probably of little signif- icance. More important is the less flexi- ble nature of slack's pawn structure. Black no longer has available to him those typical Nimzo-Indian lines based on the pushes ...d7-d6 and possibly ...e6-e5 or ...c7-c5 which aim to con- serve his light-squared bishop after having conceded his dark-squared one.

However, in practice White has optimum chances because of his good centre control and the pres- sure exerted along the e-file.

1. d2-d4 d7-d5
2. c2-c4 e7-e6
3. Abl-c3 6g8-f6
if White wishes to play the bishop to f4, it is a wise idea to first play
4. 6g1-f3
and then wait for 4. before playing
5. Ac1-f4
Now there is 5. Af8-e7
6. e2-e3 c7-c5
This is the most thematic, as the white bishop does not exert central pressure from,f4: indeed, this freeing pawn push is doubtful in the variations with Ags.

Black will require a couple of moves to complete development, but his position is solid. With the queens off the board and the absence of threats to the black king, White will find it difficult to gain anything concrete from his small advantage.

exd3 32.Ec1 d2 0-1 Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 2 Before we go any further, we should take a glance at an interesting alterna- tive reply to 5.Af+ (and to 5.4g5) that is starting to get people's attention:
5. Rd1-c2
The concept is to develop aggressively with Ag5 and Edi or O-O-O, with a probable future e2-e4 advance.
5. O-O
6. Acl-95
This move discourages ...c7-cS due to the resulting pressure on the d5 pawn. It is wise for Black to play acrively, which explains the eccentric move:
6. 6b8-a6!?
6...dxc4 7.e4 8],c6 8.8d1 b5!? is play-
able but risky.
7. a2-ag c7-cs
8. d4xc5 6a6xc5
Now after
9. Ea1-d1
or the aggressive 9.O-O-O!?, the position is too complex for a simple evaluation. Roiz,Michael Abramovic,Bosko Zlatibor 2008 (6)

This move discourages ...c7-c5 due to the resulting pressure on the d5 pawn. It is wise for Black to play actively, which explains the eccentric move:

g W&A g Strangely, until a few years ago this highly natural move was considered to be doubtful. It was thought that after Black's ...c7-c5 advance, the weak dS pawn (which results from cxdS and dxc5) was a significant factor. However, tournament play over recent years has demonstrated that the active piece play that Black acquires is enough to balance things out. There are some who prefer an immedi- ate 5...c5, but given that this is almost always followed quickly by castling, there is usually a transposition. Also here it is important to remember that While often exchanges on dS be- fore playing JlgS. In this case, after S.cxdS exdS 6.Bg5 O-O (or 6...c5) you transpose to the main line.
6. e2-e3 c7-c5
7. c4xd5 e6xd5
And now the reason for the term 'pseudo' becomes clear: in the analo- gous position in the Westphalia proper (with ...febd7 instead of ...O-O) White plays 9.-Nf5!. Here f5 is controlled by the c8 bishop.

However, in some ope- ning manuals it is called the Improved Tarrasch (3...c5!? players would not agree!), or in others, more correcdy, the Tarrasch Defence Deferred. Postponing ...c7-c5 by a move com- pletely changes the strategic nature of the game. This is because after cxdS, Black can take back with the knight and therefore avoid the isolated d5 pawn that characterises the Tarrasch proper. The game takes on a much more strate- gic nature and both colours run fewer risks: it is not surprising that the overall performance of the two sister defences are the same, however, in the Semi- Tarrasch the draw rate is much higher. Remember that the advance ...c7-c5 is possible in the diagram position; how- ever, it is dubious after 4.495, as we will see later. $ 5. e2-e3 White contents himself with having an extra tempo in a symmetrical position.

How- ever, in the Semi-Slav if White does nor immediately play 5.e3, he runs the risk of not being able to take the c4 pawn, and he will have to play a double-edged game that may not be to the taste of a conservative positional player. Even after 5.e3 the continuations can be tactically complex as we will see when we examine the Meran Variation; all of which explains the increasing popular- ity of the Semi-Slav as an effective means for Black to play for the full point.

With optimum compensation for the exchange. Maybe a chess engine could maintain the balance with the white pieces, but for a flesh-and-blood player it is an exacting task to defend a posi- tion that offers no possibility of counterplay. However, as you can see in the diagram, Black's pawns form the characteristic triangle that we associate with the Semi-Slav. Ignoring the similarity in pawn geometry, the simple fact is that nowadays this position is almost always reached by means of the Semi-Slav. Many players who include the Meran in their repertoire have neither the time nor the desire to studv the Botvinnik Variation (s...dxca) after 5.495, and instead fall back on 5...4bd7 6.e3 WaS, which takes them to the position in question. It would appear that for these players the Cambridge Springs has the benefft of being easy to study, but at the same time sufficiently combative to offer Black winning chances. Let's look at the typical move order that Ied to the Cambridge Springs in recent years:
1. d2-d4 d7-d5
2. c2-c4 c7-c6
3. 691-f3 Ag8-f6
4. Ab1-c3 e7-e6

The defence acquired its name after its repeated use in the famous tournament held in the U.S. spa town of Cambridge Springs in 1904. Its use became wide- spread in the 1920's and '30's, espe- cially at arnateur level, where the many pitfalls for White were, and still are, a big selling point. However, its popular- ity waned over the following decades to the point that it was almost completely forgotten. The dynamic approach to the game that stailed in the 1980's ended a long period dominated by highly dog- matic theory, in which the queen sortie Semi-Slav Delence to a5 was considered to be premature. The modern trend is to interpret the position flexibly free of the constraints of rigid dogma. A good example is that in the 1970's the Sveshnikov Variation in the Sicilian was dismissed as unsound: now it is one of the most played lines! A notewort\ outing for the Cambridge Springs was when Smyslov used it at the highest level in his Candidates' match against Kasparov in 1984: even though Smyslov drew two games and lost the other two, this was not the fault of the defence. Indeed, Smyslov left the ope- ning phase in good shape, proving the validity of the defence and reviving in- terest in this old line. From the modern positional viewpoint - where the creation of dynamic play takes precedence over positional con- siderations - the queen move is consid- ered to be more than acceptable. As with many other variations, the pres- ence of a bishop on 95 whose retreat path is blocked by the pawn on e3 justi- fies an early excursion by the queen in order to exploit the weakened queenside. The Tlompowsky, the Torre Attack and various Sicilian lines are examples of this idea in action. In the Cambridge Springs, Black also has annoying tactical themes such as ...6e4,...4U+ and ...dxc4, which allow the queen to attack the 95 bishop along the fifth rank. This can be so oppressive for White that he will sometimes feel obliged to sacrifice a pawn in an attempt to get something from the opening. Enough of theory.

The best reply to 10.4bb3 has proved to be the excellent 10...Ra4!.
10. ... c5xd4
11. <Nd2-b3 Ra5-b6

8. Ag5xf6 Nd7xf6
9. <5?jd2xc4

9. ... Ra5-c7
10. 3a1-c1 Af8-e7
11. g2-g3
Obviously, it is possible to develop the bishop toe 2 ord3.

and White has nothing better than to give perpetual check himself. Lasker Defence 7...6e4 The defining move of this defence. Black is aware of the principle that ex- changing offa couple ofpieces favours the player with a cramped position. More specifically the black queen has a nice destination on e7, and the rooks would then be ready for action. Natu- rally, the downside is that moving the knight a second time neglects develop- ment. The other negative aspect of the move - though at this stage of the game, perhaps a little academic - is that the black bishop that will be exchanged off is the good one, and thus in an end- game Black may have the disadvantage of playing with a bad bishop. This defence has the plus of denying White the opportunity to complicate play, and therefore even though the over- all performance is not less than with other lines, predictably the draw rate is higher. Whether this is a good or a bad thing depends on Black's ambitions. Af- ter decades in the doldrums, this line be- carne very popular at the beginning of the 1980's when Yusupov demonstrated its viability more rhan once ar dre high- est levels of competition.

At this point, without the two pawn moves 15...aS and 16.a3, White would play Rb8+ and Rxa7. However, now
23.Rb8 + would be followed by
23...Rc8, and everything is defended.
Therefore, White has no other choice but to play
23. Rf4-c7
It appears that Black will lose material, but he still has resources: The defining move of this defence. Black is aware of the principle that ex- changing off a couple of pieces favours the player with a cramped position. More specifically, the black queen has a nice destination on e7, and the rooks would then be ready for action. Natu- rally, the downside is that moving the knight a second time neglects develop- ment. The other negative aspect of the move - though at this stage of the game, perhaps a little academic - is that the black bishop that will be exchanged off is the good one, and thus in an end- game Black may have the disadvantage of playing with a bad bishop. This defence has the plus of denying White the opportunity to complicate play, and therefore even though the over- all performance is not less than with other lines, predictably the draw rate is higher. Whether this is a good or a bad tiling depends on Black's ambitions. Af- ter decades in the doldrums, this line be- came very popular at the beginning of the 1980's when Yusupov demonstrated its viability more than once at the high- est levels of competition.

Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 2 It is difficult to say if this attack will work: White's assault looks menacing, but in reality Black has control of the dark squares, and even a pawn sacrifice to open the h-file will not necessarily create what is needed for a winning attack.

Black has achieved his strategic objec- tives: he has exchanged a couple of pieces and with this pawn advance he opens the long diagonal for the c8 bishop. However, his backward devel- opment is a problem and he faces an uphill march. C41) 13. Ac4-b3!? As in Variation E of the Lasker Defence, White plays a useful waiting move. The thinking is: 'Black wants to finish his development and bring the bishop into play followed by the rooks. To do this he has to move the d7 knight. However, While has a disagreeable initiative: the f7 pawn is weak and the rook on the 3rd rank is ready to slide across to f3 or g3. Perhaps Black's safest bet is :
16.... Nc8-e6l?
17. Nb3xe6 f7xe6
which takes the dynamism out of White's position at the cost of an ugly-looking pawn on e6. In addition it makes the weakness on d4 more signif- icant. This theme is also present in those variations with an isolated queen's pawn in which Black takes back with the b-pawn after <5 xc6 so as to Chess Opening Essentiols - Volume 2 achieve counterplay against d4 without having to worry further about a pawn break on d5. C4D 13.d4xe5 This is a less refined approach. White is interested in opening up lines of attack on the black king by pushing the f-pawn.

Slightly better for White? Equality? This is one of many positions in which a temporary initiative eventually peters out against correct play. We can there- fore say that with opponents of equal rank a draw is very likely most of the time, but once in a while White man- ages to chalk up a victory.
