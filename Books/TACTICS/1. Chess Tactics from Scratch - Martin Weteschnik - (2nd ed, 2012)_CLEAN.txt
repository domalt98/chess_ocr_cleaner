Foreword by Tibor Karolyi Dear Reader, When my friend and former pupil Martin asked me to write a foreword to his book, I did not expect that I would learn so much from reading this work, but that is what happened. The first reason is that, in addition to some classic examples, he has found tactical examples that I did not know, thus avoiding one problem of many combination books. The second reason is rather different. I start working with pupils when they have already reached a high level, which means I can find a style for my pupil according to his or her natural talent and then pass on the required technical knowledge. However, I rarely work on combinations. In contrast, Martin learned chess quite late and worked hard at it, which gives him great insight into the difficulties of improving, in the same way that adults who become fluent in a foreign language see it differently from native speakers. Working through this book will help the reader to understand combinations and tactical play much better. Martin's advice is very useful. His carefully selected examples are not only instructive but very entertaining as well: many of them make a great artistic impression. I am sure that studying this book will not only bring great joy, but also improve your chess considerably. Tibor Karolyi International Master Tibor Karolyi is a successful author and a renowned trainer who has worked with Peter Leko and the Polgar sisters. Foreword by the Publisher The original edition of this book, Understanding Chess Tactics, is hailed as "a modern classic". Chess Tactics from Scratch is an expanded and updated version that benefits from major improvements. All text and analysis has been revised and improved. Also, two completely new chapters on Overloading and Candidate Moves have been added. Many readers of Understanding Chess Tactics suggested that they would like more exercises to test the understanding they gained by reading the book. So this book concludes with 300 brand-new test positions of varying difficulty. We hope that Chess Tactics from Scratch is as well received as its illustrious predecessor. John Shaw January 20 1 2 What is this book about? Chess is a visual game. A chess player must be able to recognize elementary patterns, therefore the tactics in this book will be primarily explained graphically. This approach is supported by a large numbers of diagrams, which will also allow the reader to study this book without a chessboard. Chess is also a game of logic. Logic, in the same way as chess tactics, depends on collecting and processing information. This book will show you how to accurately find the elements of tactics, and work with them creatively. This book is divided into the following parts: Chapter 1 Becoming Familiar with the Pieces! 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

It is an illusion to assume that after 1 .g4 the black queen could take the white queen, because Black must defend against �c8 mate. That is also why the black bishop has no time to take the white queen. In this chapter you will learn (among other things) to safeguard yourself against illusions of this kind. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 a b 1 ...�h7t! c Chapter 2 The Pin d e f

The theme of this chapter is the chain o f three points that constitutes the formation of a pin: • The pin's interaction with other pieces and squares on the board. • How to recognize the pin if it is in a pre liminary state (only two points out of three) . • How to create a pin and work with it.

g h This is the end of a nice combination by Tal. The black queen gave check on f6 forcing White to take. But the black pawn will take back with a check and reload itself with deadly force. Thus White has no time to save his rook. What the first piece occupying f6 (the black queen) did not achieve on this square, the following piece will do. The reloading of pieces is explained here and - strangely enough (and deservedly!) - recognized as a tactical motif in its own right and finally given a name in chess literature.

Overloading is when a piece has a responsibility on two important squares.

In this chapter we will learn how to organize and effectively prune the calculation process when working with tactics. This chapter brings it all together: from the easy questions such as 'How many retreat squares does a piece have?' to finding complex combinations like the one above. The previous eleven chapters are largely about what to look for. This last chapter is about how to look. Well, I called Chapter 1 2 the final chapter and that is true up to a point, as then it's time for the reader to stop reading and start working! Next are 300 puzzles to test your newfound understanding. I will say more about the puzzles on page 233. Introduction Tactics can be broken down into basic elements and systematically analysed. Therefore everybody should be able to understand tactics and use tactics successfully in his or her games. Steinitz, the first official World Champion, once pointed out that combinations are not coincidences or strokes of genius but the results of concrete positions. He taught us how to analyse any given position for its elements. The same method used to analyse positions can be applied to combinations. They too can be broken down into their elements. Although tactics sometimes can be very complicated, there is good news: tactics consist of basic elements that can be learned like a language or mathematics. Some years ago I trained for about two years with the former trainer of Peter Leko, Tibor Karolyi. With Tibor I mainly studied openings, middlegame strategy, and endgames. During this time I also solved a lot of combinations to sharpen my tactical skills. I had developed my own little routine. Whenever I thought I had discovered some mechanism or characteristic of a position, I started taking notes. The work on thousands of positions grew first into a collection of unsorted tactical insights, but finally resulted in a structured overview of tactics. Over time seemingly unconnected information turned into a coherent concept. The book you are now holding in your hands is my attempt to communicate this understanding of tactics. Most of the positions discussed in this book are original pos1t1ons from my notes. It does not really matter for teaching purposes whether these examples are well known or not. However, my experience when teaching club players is that most players did not know these positions. When I was asked to train a local club team, I thought it might be a good idea to have a look at their games from a team championship in order to find out about their playing strength. I saw the following position.
8 T
[diagram]
White is a piece down but has just played Rh4-f4, and I wondered why they were asking for training if they could play moves like this! Black obviously did not know what was going on, as he now played: 1 ... cic6?! Now I was expecting White to win back his piece. Surprisingly the player from my future club moved his queen back to h4. Now I knew they definitely needed my help. Let's look at the diagram again: 1 4 Chess Tactics from Scratch 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.

After studying this book, you will immediately realize the combinative idea of the solution to the diagram position. It is the typical pattern for a discovered attack. The game should have continued:
2.�xe7 tvxf4

3.�xe8t hes 4.�xe8t tvf8 s.�xf8t @xf8
6.tlle6t
Forking king and rook.
[diagram]
From being a piece down at the beginning of the combination, White could have forced an equal pawn endgame. To calculate this over the board might have been difficult for you. Nevertheless, with the knowledge of this pattern (the discovered attack) you might have found it after all. This book will teach you two things: 1) It will systematically introduce you to all the elementary patterns and tactical formations. 2) It will teach you how to create and use them 1n your games. Another game from this club will illustrate quite dramatically what happens when a player is not familiar with the basic patterns and elementary motifs.

Introduction 1 5 Holger Witt, the translator of this book, brooded over the board for half an hour and found an "ingenious" fourth possibility: losing the game. . . A few weeks later Holger, who had just started to translate this book, was playing in a tournament. A couple of days before this tournament he had been working on the chapter on double attacks. The basic pattern in mind, he had already seen a possible double attack on c2 against king and bishop. Finally the time had come to cash in on the idea he had been harbouring in his mind for quite a while. Schwappach - Witt Deizisau 200 5

Holger finished the game with the decisive double attack: 2 ...�c2t The difference between the two games was that Holger had learned to recognize a basic tactical pattern, which he then used in the game. As in the previous example, most amateur chess games are decided tactically. Therefore, the quickest way to improve your chess is to study tactics. However, solving tactical puzzles with out fully understanding the underlying mechanisms is not the most efficient way to learn. Instead you must first understand the elements of combinations. Do not exercise what you do not understand! Working through this book will help to improve your understanding and your results just like the players of the club I coached. On average the players improved by between one hundred to two hundred rating points and the club's team has been promoted twice in three years to a higher league. And maybe one day you will be able to uncork tactical champagne like this: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 !:::,.
[diagram]
Black is threatening mate with . . .Rh3 or . . .Rh4. Obviously White is desperately looking for a good reply. Again you notice the visual and obvious structural components of a tactical motif: three pieces in a row constitute a pin, here the gl -rook and Black's king and queen. Based on this basic pattern of a pin, White could have found the answer: 1 6 Chess Tactics from Scratch

[diagram]
With this move White covers both threats and is threatening mate on h7 himself. If Black took the queen, White would simply take the bishop on f3, winning back his queen with a material advantage. I am sure that by reading this book you will understand elementary tactics completely and you will successfully implement them in your games. The first twelve chapters of this book are not about solving puzzles (that comes later!) so I purposely did not give detailed analysis for each position unless I thought it necessary. For a successful journey through the first twelve chapters I would advise you to concentrate on reading and understanding rather than solving the problems. Consequently, you will find a lot of diagrams in this book enabling you to read it without a chessboard. You will benefit most from this book if you read through everything once and then go back to study certain themes more closely. My own experience taught me that I have trouble finishing a chess book when I lose myself in unnecessarily detailed analysis. I have read many of the classics from start to finish, such as Steinitz, Tarrasch, Lasker, Nimzowitsch, Reti, Capablanca, Alekhine, Spielmann, Tartakower, Kmoch, Euwe, Averbakh, Bronstein, Fischer and Vukovic. But, apart from them, my bookshelf is a graveyard for unfinished chess books that feature endless variations and sidelines. At the end of the book 300 puzzles are given to test the reader's newfound und�rstanding. Do not despair if you cannot solve many of them, as some are rather demanding. Consider the exercises as small lectures: they help you to understand the subjects of the relevant chapters. Understanding is the first and most important step. If you are willing to take another then you have to practise combinations and venture into practical play. Chapter 1 Becoming Familiar with the Pieces! This small chapter is a reminder that you need the simple things at your fingertips. As an example we might take a look at the knight. For many people calculating knight moves over the board seems to be difficult. Here is a little diagram that might help you to avoid nasty knight tactics.
[diagram]
The numbers in the diagram indicate the moves the knight needs to reach these squares. Imagine you are in time trouble. You have to find a safe square for your king. The clock is ticking and you cannot afford a long calculation. Now you know where to put your king in order to avoid forks for some time. For example, by placing your king on a square with the number 4. The next diagrams might look even more trivial. 8 7 6 5 But this pattern might turn up in con1plicated situations. Only if you know these simple patterns by heart, will you be able recognize them in very difficult circumstances. In the Ruy Lopez there is the following variation:
1.e4 e5 2.tllf3 ttlc6 3.�b5 d6 4.d4 �d7
s.tllc3 tllf6 6.O-O �e7 7.gel 1 8 Chess Tactics from Scratch

If Black castles there will be a series of forced exchanges resulting in the elementary pattern given above. 7 ... O-O? 8.�xc6 �xc6 9.dxe5 dxe5 10.YNxdS �axd8 1 o . . . :gfxd8 also loses. 1 1.�xeS he4 12.�xe4 �xe4 13.�d3 f5
14.f3 �c5t 15.�xcS �xc5 16.�gS!
[diagram]
Black will lose the exchange. Another thing that should be etched into your brain is the specific attacking tendencies that derive from the characteristic movement of any piece.
[diagram]
Black to move Although Black will queen first, he will lose the game due to the characteristic movement of the queen. Because of this the white queen will skewer Black's king and queen. In the next example it is the bishop that skewers the king and a piece. The basic pattern in mind, we just have to take the bishop to set up the skewer:

BiAjot Becoming Familiar with the Pieces! 1 9 this kind will be looked at while discussing the different motifs. Even though simple exchanging operations do not belong to the realm of tactical motifs, you should always be aware of these simple mechanics of piece movement. In any case, we will come across these mechanics while going through the motifs. In Chapter 1 1 especially we will have a look at the relations between the pieces. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6. a b c d e g If we examine the status of the f6-knight we recognize that it is defended by the e7-bishop. If in this position we could substitute a rook for the bishop then the f6-knight would be lost, as it is no longer defended. Thus: IJ�xe7 gxe7 2.�xf6 Winning two pieces for the rook - analysis position from Szabo - Van Seters, Hilversum 1 947. Another piece of advice! Even when you occupy yourself with such simple things as piece movement, important lessons can still be learned. A lot of people smiled when Mikhail Tai admitted that he liked to watch children's chess programmes on television. But, despite being a World Champion and one of the greatest tacticians of all time, he claimed that he was still learning from these simple patterns. Everybody knows how to move the pieces. Yet sometimes their freedom of movement is restricted. This may seem trivial but obviously it is not easy to see. Otherwise, how could you explain the number of blunders made while calculating a variation over the board? Often people think that a certain piece can move when it really can't. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
Over the board you could save calories not calculating moves like W'xe8 or W'xh4 as the white queen is pinned. Therefore, it is only able to move on the diagonal between its king and the opponent's bishop. You might also take the bishop. But all other moves are not an option. Beware of these optical illusions. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.

You may be under the impression that this is a blunder as it leaves White's queen en prise. But from h3 the queen was perforn1ing an all-important duty: covering the back rank mate by the white rook on c8. Consequently the white queen is untouchable. Right from the start the freedon1 of movement of Black's queen was restricted. The following examples show how the freedom to move can be restricted. This can be the consequence of: 1 . Restriction by other pieces
2. Restriction by an obstacle
3. Restriction by obligations
4. Restriction by tactical motifs
1. Restriction by other pieces
The knight is not able to move.
2. Restriction by an obstacle
The rook cannot jump over its own bishop. When a bishop is restricting a rook, as in the example above, you should look out for discovered attacks.
3. Restriction by obligations (e.g. defending
a mate) The bishop is not able to control the knight, as the pawn is threatening to promote.
4. Restriction by tactical motifs
The queen is only able to take the bishop. On the other hand the freedom of movement might be regained by: Becoming F amt ·tar with th p· 1·

Try to find the games, then put the positions on a board and try to figure out why these pins came as surprises. Don't be satisfied with just being able to pinpoint the exact mistakes. Always try to understand the underlying causes of your defeats. In some sense all defeats are caused by lack of understanding. So the question one must ask oneself after a loss is: What more do I need to understand in order to improve my chess? Essentially a pin is a chain of three chess pieces. The first point in this chain is the attacking piece, the second point is the pinned piece, and the third piece is the target of the pin. In this chapter I will at first take a closer look at the different kinds of targets, then I will examine the pinned piece, and finally the attacker. The final points to examine are the conditions to set up and to break a pin. I. The target
1. The King
When the king is the target of a pin, the freedom of movement of the pinned piece is always radically reduced. A knight becomes totally immobile; other pinned pieces are only able to move on the line between the attacker and the king. So the pieces lose the attacking and defending functions they might have had before. In the following diagram the white queen is only allowed to move diagonally between g2 and d5 as it is pinned against the king.
[diagram]
Consequently Black's rook and queen are not under attack by the white queen and there is no mate on h7 either. The next two diagrams show how the defensive function of the queen disappears with the pin. She can neither defend the rook: Nor defend a square (mate) :
24 Chess Tactics from Scratch
The next example demonstrates the loss of function of a pinned piece rather drastically. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Shumov -Winawer St Petersburg 1 875 1 6.

Black will lose the queen or be mated. As the black queen is pinned by the white queen against the king it loses all its attacking power concerning the white rook on c l and its mobility to defend the c8-rook against :B:cl xc8 with mate.
[diagram]
If the target is the king the pin is always effectual and we can draw the following conclusions: The freedom of movement of the pinned piece is radically (in the case of the knight totally) reduced. The piece is only able to move in the line of fire of the attacking piece. Therefore, the pinned piece has no chance to defend itself against additional attacks. Bearing this in mind, it is not very difficult to see that these consequences of a pin against the king also have strategic repercussions. In an endgame the weaker side will try to hold the game by neutralizing the opponent's advantageous pawn structure or even an extra pawn with a piece. What the weaker side is trying to avoid is the exchange of this very last piece. One of the strategic consequences of a pin against the king would be the elimination of a remaining piece by setting up this pin and exchanging the last important piece, transforming the position into a won king and pawn endgame.

If White wants to stop the e-pawn the king has to move to the f-file. So in this position White resigned because:

"It is always dangerous when your king and the opponent's queen are on the same l ine." Tarrasch Now we know how dangerous it is for other pieces to enter into the line of attack between queen and king. With regard to the great value of king and queen we can also see that there will always be a threat of pinning if two of our own pieces are on one line or diagonal. Therefore you need to train your vision for these configurations on the board that might turn into a pin. The example of king and queen is the best to bring out the general principles of the pin.

on the board: the black queen was opposing 1.• •b4?! the white rook. The only thing you had to do With this move Black entered a little was to create that missing third point behind adventure. the queen against which she could be pinned. If the king is somewhere near, then it is not 2.tllxc6 YM:xflt 3.@hl .Bg4 4.YMcl .Bf3 difficult to turn him into the target of a pin. If you understand how simple it is to set up a pin against the king, then you will later recognize more easily other pins or possibilities for pins as well. This example also shows the need to create the elements of a tactical motif, which does not only apply for the pin. Good players will threaten to create only the second of the three conditions of this motif and their opponents, in order to stop them, might get in to a desperate situation on other sections of the board. Good players, therefore, work with the motifs, and they are able to do so as they understand every component of the motif they are working with. Let's stay with the king as a target for a little while: Gelbmann - Gyimesi European U-20 Championship, Siofok 1 996

it looks as if White is not able to take the bishop on f3 or to defend against the mate on the h-file. Yet Gyimesi (with an excellent poker face!

[diagram]
The h-file would be covered, White would be threatening mate on h7, and if Black took the queen, White would uncover the pin of queen against king by taking the black bishop with the pawn. Although two pawns had been covering the pin we have to spot the elementary configuration of rook, queen, and king on one file. Once we have spotted this configuration we are able to use it to our advantage. White did not see this during the game and played

giving Black the chance to eventually set up a perpetual check and so the game ended in a draw. If both players had been able to see the three po ints of the pin more clearly, the game would have taken another course. We can see how important it is to recognize the configuration of the pin as early as possible and we have to see all three links of a pinning chain. One of these poi n ts is the target. To see a possible target when the piece is the king is fairly easy. But it is not only the king that can turn into a target: it could also be the surroundings of the king. Often pieces around the king have important defensive duties to perform. This gives ample opportunities to set up tactical operations. Van den Berg - Eliskases Beverw.ijk 1959 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

Superficial analysis might arrive at the conclusion that the pawn on f6 is attacked twice and defended twice. Yet after White has gained a tempo attacking the bishop with his queen the picture changes completely as White is now able to set up a pin.

1-0 The pinning chain of queen, queen and king makes it impossible for Black to save his queen. In this example we first had the pin and then a sacrifice to win material. In the next example we will see the sacrifice first and then the material is won back by the pin. The effect of an elementary motif may occur in the beginning of a combination or later. It can either support another motif or be the winning motif itself. It is important to recognize the configuration of the pin as early as possible and we have to see a l l three links of a pinning chain.

Again the second king plays a decisive role. White's pinning piece is attacked twice, pinned against its own king and so unable to capture the black queen, but even so White's pin is enough to win the game. We have seen how to win the pinned piece in a pinning chain. Remember that this piece can be attacked from all other directions but the king's direction as the pinned piece is not allowed to expose the king to an attack. In the game Makogonov - Chekhover, Tbilisi 1 937, Black played:

Once again the pinned piece was able to perform its pinning task. Furthermore, we have to remember that in a counter-pin both defending pieces can lose their defensive properties.

The next example shows that the target can be conquered with tempo, especially when the king is around somewhere.

White played: 1 .�d8 And won. Let's take a closer look at this example in order to train our visual abilities for pins against the king. The black queen is pinned against the king. Therefore her freedom of movement is severely restricted and you have to see that at once. No matter what the queen seems to be attacking, the c3-g7 diagonal is the only way the queen is able to move due to the pin. Therefore that is the only movement of the black queen we have to take into account. Consequently, we need not think about the black queen as a defender of any other squares that are not on that diagonal, such as d8, nor is this queen defending any pieces such as the rook on f8. So when we are calculating this position we should actually see the queen not as in the first diagram but rather like this: The Pin 33
[diagram]
Going back to the original position, the f8- rook is defending the already attacked queen on f6; this rook is on the same line as its king. If we pin the rook, both pieces will have lost their defence! Taking into consideration that often tempos can be won _against the king, you will not hesitate to play 1 .�d8 in the initial position. After: 1 •••�xc3 2.�xf"Bt Qg7 3.�g8t

The white rook has reached a safe haven and White ends up with an extra piece.
2. The pin against more valuable and more
important pieces Having learned that the king is an excellent target of a pinning chain, it is not too far fetched to assume that a pin is increasingly effective the more important the target in the pinning chain is. The value of the king is obvious. This is also clear in the case of a queen being protected by a pawn against the attack of a bishop. But what about when the value of the target is lower than the pinned piece? With decreasing value the target will also receive decreasing attention. The material value of the pinned piece is often unimportant for recognizing a potential pin. What is important is the target piece or square in order to create a pin. But this target piece or square can often be created with exchanges, attacks or by assigning a piece or square an important duty. In principle every attacked piece standing in front of a colleague has to be seen as pinned.
3. Pinning against an undefended piece
The importance and value of the target is not so relevant if the target piece will be lost when the pinned piece moves and is not able to defend the target piece.

[diagram]
34 Chess Tactics from Scratch
In this position it would be suicidal if the black knight took the pawn. The black knight would be lost after :ge 1 as it is not able to move out of the pin and defend the rook, which therefore remains undefended. But sometimes it is not necessary to defend the target directly.
8 T
[diagram]
In this pos1t1on (inspired by an example Tarrasch gave) Black has won a pawn on e5 and White pinned Black's knight against the rook. Yet with 1 ...�g6 Black threatens to fork White's rook and king if White takes the rook. Think twice when you set up a pin against an undefended target because there is more than one way of defending a piece. A pin against an undefended piece as a target does not always aim at this target. Quite often it is enough to employ this motif to render the pinned piece in1potent. The restriction of the performance of a pinned piece can have both a tactical and strategic meaning. The restricted performance of a pinned piece can have both a tactica l and strategic significance. White to move would immediately win a piece by capturing the knight. The pieces are not able to defend each other, neither directly nor indirectly. You can also see in this example how easily the pinning chain of rook, pawn and bishop can be detected. On this simple optical impression we have to build our tactical ability to use a pin. From here the most complicated configurations can be understood and created. Now that we have seen how we can use the pin against an undefended target tactically let us turn to the strategic side of this motif. Klebaner - Maleha Correspondence 1 965 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 l::,.

White threatens mate and at the same time sets up a pinning chain, as the pawn on f6 is not able to close the diagonal without exposing the black queen to the attack by its white opponent.
8 T
[diagram]
One undefended piece or square should already set off alarm bells with regard to any tactical motif. With two such points in a row and the last point undefended, it is pinning time. When looking to set up a pin, it is better to focus on the funda mental configuration rather than being too concerned about the value of each component. Indeed, searching for any tactic you should concentrate on the function of the pieces rather than on their value. If we are looking for the three components of a pin, it is better to look for the fundamental configuration rather than for the value of each component. This recommendation is nicely illustrated by the next example. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Bisguier - Pomar Malaga 1 97 1
[diagram]
1. •• Y=Yc7 Black set up a rather unusual pin. After:
2.�g6 e5 3.�xf8 exf4
The white knight was trapped and Black had a good game with two pieces for a rook and a pawn. Again I would like to stress, and this is applicable to all other motifs, that it is easier to find all the information for a tactic when you concentrate on the function of the pieces rather than on their value. When sacrificing to give mate we do not care about the value of the pieces. It is the function that counts. Opening lines to the enemy king, or cutting off the king's escape route as in a smothered mate, takes priority over the value of the pieces used in these operations.
36 Chess Tactics from Scratch
Concluding this part about the pinning of an undefended piece, we should be aware of the danger of creating undefended targets ourselves.
8 T
[diagram]
The natural desire to develop the bishop on c8 by 1 . . .�d7 creates a pinning chain and the pawn on d5 will be lost after 2.ttJxd5. Similar motifs occur after castling when the king gives up a possible defence of d7 and e7.
4. Setting up a pin against a square or motif
The last point in a pinning chain can also be a square. As this concept is a little more difficult to see, let's start with a simple example. The pawn on h6 is pinned against the h7- square. If it moved, White would give mate on h7 with his queen. II. The pinned piece As with the target piece in a pinning chain, any chess piece can become a pinned piece as well. But in contrast its value must always be lower than the value of the piece it is covering. Its line of communication with the target piece is of special importance. Sometimes it might be able to move out of the line of fire and defend the target at the same time. This is why it is sometimes important to control its retreating squares. Often it is not difficult to overload the second piece with duties, especially when the target piece is an important one. As the pinned piece must already perform an important task it becomes increasingly difficult to fulfil other obligations. On the other hand we have to keep in mind that the pinned piece in some cases might turn the pin into a discovered attack. This special case will be examined later. III. The attacking piece Not every piece can turn into a pinning piece during its chess career. Kings, knights and pawns can never be the attacking piece of a pinning chain, as they cannot pin other pieces. Generally it is a mistake to believe the pinning piece must be of lesser value than the pinned piece. This misguided concept will keep you from thinking about setting up a pinning chain as in Bisguier - Pomar, page 3 5 . O f crucial importance is whether the pinning piece needs to be defended or not. In Shumov - Winawer, page 24, the pinning piece was undefended, but won the game anyway, whereas in Donner - Huebner, page 32, material was won with tempo thanks to the pinning piece being defended. So always keep in mind the status of your pieces. As we have already seen, it makes a big difference for any of the three points of the chain of a pin if that point is defended or not. The Pin 37 IY. Pinning and unpinning To set up a pin, a chain of three links must be completed. We have already sufficiently examined each of the three points: the pinning piece, the pinned piece, and the target. But what should be regarded as a precondition for a pin? Which link in the chain should already exist before considering setting up a pin? The primary conditions that make up the single links of a pinning chain are found in the role and position of each link in this chain, whose presence, value and status disclose to us the idea to use and to set up a pin. The king quite often fulfils the condition of presence, a queen often that of value, and a piece with a specific defensive task assigned to it the condition of status. All three promise an advantageous use of a pin. Therefore it is best, when setting up a pin, to start thinking of the desired result. Only if we can gain an advantage will we consciously resort to the elementary motif of the pin. Therefore the reason to intentionally apply the motif of the pin should be: a) The gain of material b) Taking away the ability to fulfil duties c) Tactical and strategic elimination of pieces It is best, when setting up a pin, to start thinking of the desired result. Only if we can gain an advantage wil l we consciously resort to the elementary motif of the pin. a) The gain of material To find a good reason for searching for the possibility of a pin and to set up this motif can first of all be found in the prospect of cashing in on an attack against the pinned piece or the target piece. The aim is the pin itself. Let's win with the pin:

Although Alekhine wisely refrained from taking the white knight on g7, he could not avoid the loss of the game. We wil_l see a little later that Alekhine in this match also knew how to use the pin to his advantage. In the next game, Evans - Bisguier, USA 1 958, the pinning side is out to win with an attack against the target piece (square) :

So winning the pinned piece directly may be the first thing we are looking for, but as the last example showed (with the possibility of a knight fork on d2) other motifs may also be possible on squares not related to the pin itself Thus we should consider the neighbouring squares in connection with other motifs. Often the threat of attacking the pinned piece or the target piece is enough to win material elsewhere.

To understand how the pin can be related to other motifs, let's take a look at the following game. Gligoric - Szabo Venice 1 949 (analysis)

White has just played 1 .�d l -d6. This seems to be a blunder as it cuts off the defence of the knight on e7. Yet after: 1 ... i.xe7 2.he7 YMxe7? 3.�d7! White has set up a pin. If Black takes the rook with his queen, he loses his queen. If he takes with the bishop the result will be the same. We should consider the pin's neighbouring squares in connection with other motifs. The aims of this pinning operation can be classified as follows: • Gain of material through a pin • Control of squares through a motif (the knight remains untouchable although 1 .�d 1 -d6 has cut its line of defence) • Combination of two motifs (discovered attack and pin) b) Taking away the ability to fulfil duties (Rendering your opponent's pieces useless) The effect of a pin increases with the value of a pin's target. This might go as far as totally restricting the freedom of movement: the pinned piece is rendered completely immobile. Kasparov provided an example in his game against Browne in Banja Luka 1 979:

Mate along the second rank or loss of the queen would follow. 1-0 Looking at the starting diagram you will easily see that the pawn on f7 has several tasks to fulfil. Firstly, it is defending the bishop on e6. Secondly, it is also blocking the formation of a queen and rook battery on the seventh rank with the lethal threat of a mate on g7. Two elements of a pinning chain already existed: the rook on a7 - the pinning piece, and the The Pin 4 1 pawn on f7 - the pinned piece. What was still missing was the target. In the initial position the pawn had only one task to perform: defending the bishop. It might be a good idea to overload its capacity by giving it another job to do. If we could lure the king behind the pawn: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

[diagram]
We would have completed the pinning chain with the black king as a perfect target. Consequently we would render the pawn immobile. The white bishop is the bait that forced the king into the pin. In order to activate the mechanism of the pin you needed to be able to see this possibility right from the first diagram.

Anything that was protected by the pawn on f7 is now en prise due to the pin created by the check of the white bishop. This is a little gem that shows how pawns and pieces can lose their power when they are pinned against a valuable piece. Discovering the possibilities of a pin and creating a pin are closely connected. The next example also shows very graphically how helpless a pinned piece can become. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Henneberger - Bernstein Zurich 1 934

The rook loses all the power it had over the g-file. Its actual value is decreased drastically as the job it is performing at the moment could also be performed by a feeble pawn. When I started studying tactics I always looked at the conditions that made a combination possible. This way I learned a lot about strategy, too. I found out how to avoid certain situations and conditions {such as undefended pieces; as John Nunn aptly remarked: Loose pieces drop off. ..) . A very simple example: I realized the importance of the weak squares around the king when a lot of combinations occurred in the absence of a fianchetto bishop. I understood that the offer of a rook for the fianchetto bishop is often to my advantage. When solving exercises, you should always consider why a combination has worked. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

Besides Black's weakened king position you should have noticed in the diagram above the awkward positioning of the a8-rook and the b8-bishop. It is exactly this inept placement of the b8-bishop that gave White the possibility for his mating attack (I.i.g7t and 2.gc8t) . The black bishop on b8 is disrupting the vital defensive line of the black rooks on his back rank. If Black were allowed to take the b8-bishop right off the board, he would have had good chances to survive the game! Sumets - Oney Istanbul 20 1 1 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

From the mistakes of others you can learn to recognize and avoid ugly strategic set-ups. Thus it is possible to learn from tactical examples how to play strategically. One of the simple lessons I learned from looking at tactics, which helps to eliminate the reason for many losses, was: avoid placing your pieces awkwardly! Even sacrificing material is sometimes a better option. There is often a superior solution to misplacing a piece, as the harmonious piece co-ordination in most grandmaster games demonstrates. A useful aid might be to ask whether Tai or Kasparov (or any other of your favourite players) would have played an intended but somehow awkward-looking move. If it looks awkward, it probably is. Be aware of such simple principles and you will automatically play one class better. The Pin 43 c) Tactical and strategic elimination of pieces It is not only the loss of the defensive power of a pinned piece that can have dramatic consequences. The inability to move can also become the beginning of the end. Hickl - Pelletier Switzerland 20 1 0

This kind of strategic pin that is constructed around the inability of the king to move has already been examined in the section on pins against the king. Frequently this motif occurs during the endgame, where it becomes very difficult to get rid of it as material is reduced on the board and a further exchange of pieces could result in a lost pawn endgame. However, a pin can be very annoying during the opening stages of a game as well. Weteschnik - Ruck Koszeg 1 996

and Black has to invest more tempos to get rid of the pin in order to develop. White clearly has the initiative. The art of unpinning - trapping the trapper The principle of unpinning is quite simple. Either the target piece or the pinned piece attacks other valuable pieces or sensitive squares of the pinning side. Usually it is the pinned piece that performs this trick but the target can spring to life as well. 5 � � "if- 4 �- � �� -���.-�
[diagram]
c d e f g h Both the queen (target) and the bishop (pinned piece) can attack the pinning white rook by pinning it to the king. Now, let's see an example of the pinned piece breaking the pin, which is the common case. (Analysis of Gipslis - Rashkovsky, The Pin 45 Dubna 1 976, where Black played . . .�f7 instead of . . .f4 as in the example.) 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
White advantageously dissolves the pin with 1.�f5! as the white knight is heading for greener pastures (mate on h6!) so he is willing to offer his queen to the pinning piece. ( I .ltJg4?! also escapes the pin but Black can equalize with 1 . . .�f7!) . Note that with 1 .�g4 White could also have dissolved the pin by moving the target piece of Black's pin.
[diagram]
So unpinning by an attack on the pinning piece brings about a change in the status of the first piece in the pinning chain. The attacker is turned into the attacked. If the initial attacker was undefended or of too great a value, the unpinning manoeuvre turns into a discovered attack as also seen in the next game. This is an example of a target that turns into an attacking piece. This is also an example of how closely pins and discovered attacks are connected in principle. Alekhine - Yates Hamburg 1 9 1 0

[diagram]
With his last move ( 1 .ttJd4-e6) White deliberately pinned his own knight against his queen (target) . Although this appears to be suicidal, there is a snag for Black: the white knight discovered an attack on the black queen, so the rook cannot take the knight even though it is pinned (the d l -rook would take the black queen with check) . What is worse, Black's bishop is en prise and, to make things even more complicated, White will open the h-file once he has taken the bishop on g5, discovering very unpleasant threats to h7 and the black king. So Black has to move his queen first, but then White will take the bishop burdening Black with nightmares about his h-file. So the pinned knight on e6 turned out to be the protector of its queen, buying time with the discovered attack on the black queen for White to gain material. The target piece, the white queen on e4, had nothing to worry about.

Although this all seems rather trivial even the greatest players sometimes buy their way out of a desperate situation by knowing just a trifle more about elementary tactics than their opponent. The next example is well known but it is, for teaching purposes, a classic. Bobby Fischer demonstrates how to change the status of the points in the chain of a pin. Here the attacking piece is uprooted and deprived of its defence. Th us a pin is changed into a discovered attack. Fischer - Shocron Mar del Plata 1 959 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

The future World Champion seems to be in deep trouble. It looks as if Fischer had overlooked that his rook could be pinned against his queen by:
1.. .�c8
Black cannot immediately take the rook with 1 .. . fxe6 2.'Rxe6t �f8 3.'Rxe5 because the dominating white bishops would lead to Black's doom. So here we are: the black queen is the attacker, the rook the pinned piece, and the white queen the target. Both the white rook and queen cannot move without drastic consequences. What is more, the black rook on b8 protects the attacker. Time to resign? Not yet! White's idea is to lure the queen away from the eighth rank so it is no longer defended.
2.cid7!!
Now it really was time to resign, but it was Black who had to stop the clock.

The bishop proves to be the final ·temptation for the queen. If Black takes the bishop with 2 .. . 'Rxd7, White will play 3.�xg6t and the pin has transformed into a discovered attack, as the rook on the eighth rank no longer defends the black queen. The lesson to be learned here is quite simple: always be on the lookout for drastic changes in a pinning chain. Don't miss your chances of turning an attacking piece into a potential target of a counterattack by destroying its defence or luring it into dangerous territory where it is no longer defended and the pin turns in to a discovered attack. Things can also become messy when the attacker has to perform another important task thus suffering from overwork. Creating such a scenario might sometimes prove difficult but taking advantage of it, when it already exists, should be something everybody can easily achieve.

If White retakes with the pawn the black bishop unpins by taking the pawn with check and then, no matter what White does, he will lose material. You, too, would have performed like a World Champion at this moment had you seen that you can unite the two unpinning principles we have discussed: the second piece (pinned piece) is unpinning with tempo, giving check and discovering an attack on a piece that it is not well enough defended. So a pin should not cause us horror and desperation unless it can be turned in to a real advantage. Even when our opponent is turning the heat up, the pinned piece might not be lost.

Although the black knight is not really defended by the pawn on d6 as this pawn is pinned against the queen, the knight is still not en prise on e5 as the knight on f3 is pinned against the undefended rook on fl . • • • • Summary Always be on the lookout to create or prevent a pin. A piece pinned against the king is extremely vulnerable and often totally immobile. King and queen on the same file or diagonal always constitutes a motif for p1nn1ng. Every undefended piece is a potential candidate for a pin. • Every attacked piece of yours standing in front of another of your pieces should be considered as pinned. • In a pinning chain the function and not the value of each piece is what matters most. • Take note of already existing parts as preconditions for a pin. • • • Two pieces of the same colour on a diagonal or file should already be regarded as a precondition for a pin. Consider possible changes of the po ints in a pinning chain. A pin can turn into a discovered attack. Chapter 3 The Discovered Attack The discovered attack has a strong schematic resemblance to the pin. As in the pin there are three pieces in a row. But in contrast to the pin there is a fourth point. The first piece and the discoverer are pieces of the same side; the third point is a piece or square of the other side. The fourth point is taken or occupied by the discoverer. What sounds complicated in words is simple in pictures. So take a look at the next diagram for a simple example:
[diagram]
The discovered attack consists of four points: 1 . rook = the principal attacker
2. bishop = the discoverer
3. queen = the victim point (victim piece/
square)
4. h7 /king = the discoverer's target
We have two pieces of the same side: White's e I -rook and e4-bishop. Then there is the third piece, the black queen on e5. These three pieces together look like a pinning chain. As already mentioned, that similarity in formation is why a pin can transform into a discovered attack and vice versa. The difference compared to a pin is an additional target - the king on g8 and the h7-square. We will call this the discoverer's target. After White has played I.irh7t we have a situation similar to a double attack: White is attacking two pieces: the rook is attacking the queen, and the bishop is attacking the king. As Black is not able to answer both threats with one move, he will lose his queen. A discovered attack is a simultaneous attack against two points where one attack against the first enemy piece is discovered by the attack on the second. The attacker and the discoverer in this mechanism have to be pieces; their targets can be either pieces or squares. First we are going to take a look at the pieces you need for a discovered attack: principal attacker and the discoverer. Then we will look at the victim piece, paying special attention to the king. Finally we will have a look at the discoverer's target. The principal attacker Looking back at the first diagram, you will easily understand that the principal attacker can never be a king, a knight or a pawn. This
52 Chess Tactics from Scratch
leaves only the long-range pieces (queen, rook and bishop) as possibilities for the principal attacker. This may sound trivial but it helps to discover the vital formation over the board, especially in complex positions. If the principal attacker is to attack the victim piece, it has to be of lower value if the victim piece is defended. If the victim piece of this attack is undefended, value does not matter with regard to the principal attacker. If the victim point in the discovered attack is not a piece but a square there has to be a winning trick the principal attacker can perform from its new square. Always keep in mind the long-range impact of the principal attacker. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 With 1. •• tl)xc5 Black wins the c5-pawn and its colleague on e4 is lost as well. This shows the impact of the d8-rook, the principal attacker of this discovered attack, which is felt beyond the third point, the d4-pawn (which was pinned) . Sometimes the principal attacker in a discovered attack does not need to take the victim piece. In the case that the principal attacker is pinning the victim piece and rendering it immobile, other pieces or squares that were formerly defended are now defenceless and the discoverer might take them at will. The following diagram shows the arithmetic of the discovered attack: 78 � 78 � 78 � � 8 ��,� 7 6 6 6 •,,,,,� 6 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 Initially the pieces do not exert any control down the file. If you removed the bishop, all squares on this file would be attacked once. If the bishop moved, one square is attacked twice. In the last case one move made by the bishop would mean a sudden control of three times (!) on that square. Bearing this in mind, you always have to include the control of the first piece in your calculation. Sometimes you may be able to defend a piece indirectly this way, as you can see in this game: Tai - Kolarov Austria 1 970 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 �

But who would not have liked to play on a bit against the 'Magician from Riga' . . . We can also learn from this example that the principal attacker in our pattern for the discovered attack can be undefended if the discoverer discovers the attack with tempo. The discovered attack may be used to defend a piece indirectly. Sometimes it is enough to put the principal attacker in place, threatening a discovered attack. Take a look at Thimann - Felbecker, Correspondence 1 968:

[diagram]
So here we are again: the second discovered attack set up by the black queen, but this time not horizontally but vertically. Two pieces in a row (the queen on d4 and the d6-bishop) and a third piece (the queen on d7) that can be attacked by moving the bishop to h2 with check and gain of tempo. Although it is quite clear that after 4.Bxc3 Bh2t Black will hardly gain a decisive advantage by winning White's queen, you can notice how fate changes by knowing how to create threats using tactical motifs. After all, it was White who misjudged the pin in the beginning while Black was working nicely with the motif of the discovered attack that improved his position. At times it is possible to force your opponent into a discovered attack by sacrificing material. This example is taken from Miles - Martin, Birmingham 1 977: In this position we already see the discoverer and the victim piece of the pattern, the discoverer being the c5-rook and the victim piece the undefended queen on d6. Now Miles lures the bishop to a square that is in the line of fire of the future principal attacker of the discovered attack. The bait is a pawn: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6. a b c d e f g

56 Chess Tactics from Scratch
You will note that we have an undefended black queen as a possible victim piece, and the f4-knight as a possible discoverer on the same diagonal. If the white queen were on g3 the black queen would be lost. So all Marshall had to do was to clear the g3-square:

[diagram]
Visual chess! This is what you should have envisioned: the chain of three pieces - the queen on g3, the f4-knight and the queen on d6. Try to grasp formations of this kind optically. Then you will find them automatically in any given position. In regard to this chain it also helps to notice that the black queen is undefended and that the discoverer (the f4-knight) has a target in the nearby black king. We will see how to collect this kind of information more systematically in Chapter 1 1 , Status Examination. Mating threats in connection with the threat of a discovered attack can also be poison for your future opponents. Take a look at the game Keres - Gligoric, Yugoslavia 1 959: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2
1 L.
[diagram]
l.�xg7t! �xg7 2.Yf g4 Keres has set up the pattern: the queen on g4 as principal attacker, the f5-knight as discoverer and the queen on d7 is the victim piece. Black had to give up his queen for insufficient material compensation or else he would have been mated. The discoverer The discoverer in the pattern of the discovered attack is the piece that is discovering the attack of the principal attacker against the victim piece. At the same time it is threatening to gain material or a tempo, or creating and supporting other tactical motifs on the discoverer's target. Contrary to the principal attacker, every chessman can be the discoverer in a discovered attack, as the discoverer in the mechanism does not necessarily need to be a long-range piece. The discoverer need not only gain material at its target, but could also perform all kinds of tactical tricks from there afterwards. Occasionally though it is enough for the discoverer to create weaknesses other pieces might exploit; or it changes the situation of the victim piece in the discovered attack. The most dangerous form of discovering an attack on the victim piece is a check by the The Discovered Attack 57 discoverer, as this threat must be answered. To illustrate this consider Anderssen - Morphy, Paris 1 858.
[diagram]
In this situation White was able to play
1. c5!
as the c5-sql1are was only seemingly defended twice. As White is able to discover an attack against the king with the d4-pawn, it is White who is controlling the square. After
1.. .�c7
White should have continued with:
2.dSt! Qgs
Other moves are worse.
3.d6
Winning a piece as otherwise the passed pawn, supported by the bishops and the rook, would be fearsome. (This would have been much better than the game continuation of
3.Bc4. In the game White had to wait for
hours before Black finally resigned - in an endgame where he had missed some possible drawing chances.) In the previous example an attack by the principal attacker against a victim piece had to be defended. In the next example it is the threat of the discoverer against the king that does the trick. Take a look at Alekhine - Em. Lasker, St Petersburg 1 9 1 4:
8 T
[diagram]
White has just played 1 .�d7?. This creates two points of the pattern: the d7-rook is the victim piece and the d5-knight is the discoverer. Obviously Alekhine ignored an important rule: Moving behind a piece that is able to give check means inviting the creation of a discovered attack. And remember: just creating the mechanism might be fatal for the defender as he might lose a crucial tern po once the discovered attack is threatened. Thus Lasker played: 1 ..J �d3 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
5 8 Chess Tactics from Scratch The discovered attack formation has been completed (:gd3-CtJd5-:gd7 with the king on b 1 as the discoverer's target) . Now just moving the d7-rook away would not help because of 2 ... :gd l t 3.@c2 CtJe3t winning the g2-rook. In dire straits, Alekhine sacrificed the exchange only to lose the game in a long endgame. The enormous scope of the discoverer can easily be seen in the next diagram.
[diagram]
If White's queen were to take the h8-rook then a white king on any of the marked squares would be a target within reach of the discoverer, the c8-bishop, and the white queen would be won by the a8-rook. The most dangerous form of discovered attack on a victim piece is to give a check with the discoverer. If you analyse any given position and find a discovered attack with check, as in the diagram above, then the discoverer may be able to interrupt the line of communication between its own pieces without losing anything. Take a look at the game Gruenfeld - Steiner, Moravska Ostrava 1 933:
8 T
[diagram]
Here White has been able to play l .Bf5-c2 as the b2-bishop remains defended, although it is seemingly cut off from the defence of the queen on e2. Yet you will already have discovered that Black's 1 .. . 'W'xb2 will run into
2.Bxh7t.
This mechanism also works in a reversed form against the defender. Sometimes the discoverer is just interrupting lines of communication. As mentioned earlier, the discoverer is not always the aggressor. It sometimes is enough to offer extra options for other pieces. Consider Duenhaupt - Kuenert, Correspondence 1 952/53: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2
1 L.
[diagram]
White played: The Discovered Attack 59 I . .Bd8 Interrupting the communication between the black rooks, so they do not defend each other anymore. Thus the queen on f3 is now attacking the undefended a8-rook. The small step by the bishop also discovered an attack on the f7-square: it is a double attack by the white queen on the a8-rook and f7. So it is decision time for Black: either lose a rook or lose the game straight away. Interrupting lines of communication was also the trick in Osnos - Yuhtman, USSR 1 968. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
Black has just played l . . .Bf4-e3! creating two threats in one move. The e4-rook is en prise now, as it is cut off from its defender, the e2-queen. Additionally, Black threatens to win the fl -rook. This was simply too much and White threw in the towel. Sometimes the discover is just interrupting lines of communication. Now that we know that the discoverer in a discovered attack can bring death and destruction into the ranks of the defender, it is time to look at what the discoverer can do for the principal attacker. Here is an example from Krogius - Sergievsky, USSR 1 959: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
I.tllg6!! 1-0 Knights are nasty pieces. Here the horse jumps to g6, discovering an attack on the black queen. If Black plays 1 . . .Rxf5, White strikes back with 2.ctJ xe7t winning the rook, forking queen and king. So the knight defends the white queen indirectly. Occasionally it may be possible to defend a piece directly as well. Take a look at Travnicek - Janata, Czechoslovakia 1 96 1 . 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
1.�d4
This shields the white queen against the attack of the d8-rook. At the same time it is opening the d3-h7 diagonal for its queen, threatening mate. Thus the rook as the
60 Chess Tactics from Scratch
discoverer in a discovered attack is directly defending the queen. White is winning, for example:

White is going to win all of Black's pieces, as the black knight is trapped. You can see again how powerful the connection of two tactical motifs can be, in this case the discovered attack and the double attack. The strongest pieces, if pinned 1 · against the king, lose all their power • The victim point: the king Nothing is better than an attack against the king. Even if your opponent gained your whole queen's wing, if you could find a mate all his material advantages will not matter. The strongest pieces, if pinned against the king, lose all their power, and even a check by a feeble little pawn has to be answered. Discovered checks are among the most devastating weapons in a player's tactical arsenal. When they come as double check it is usually Game Over, as you will see in the next game, Petroff - Szymanski, Warsaw 1 85 1 :
8 T
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 a c e g White has just played Lig4-f5 . The queen has no escape square at hand. Even worse, the queen cannot take the offending bishop, as White would simply fork queen and king with the knight on d6. So the only option here is
1.• •�xf3
which runs into
2.�f6t @f8 3.YMe8 mate
The discovered check by the knight has to be followed by a king move from Black, so there was no escape. b d f h The Discovered Attack 6 1 Creating a double check is often done by luring the king to the crucial square with a sacrifice or by eliminating parts of the king's pawn shield. In Katalymov - Muhin, USSR 1 976, we see an example of the first case:

The victim point: the other pieces It was not difficult to recognize the king as a potential victim piece of a discovered attack. It is a little more difficult with other pieces. Nevertheless, looking for two pieces in a row is not too complicated and so you may find all the possibilities for a discovered attack in Orehov - Petrusha, USSR 1 967:

7 6 5 4 3 2 1 a b d e f g h You score one point if you found the configuration g3-queen, g4-knight and g8- rook; two points if you also discovered the c l -bishop, b2-rook and a3-queen; three points if you spotted the a3-queen, b3-pawn and g3- queen. Wait a minute, you may want to ask, the last one is not really a possible discovered attack as there is a white pawn on f3 in the way. That is exactly what Black changed with his next move:
1.. .
.Be4t Now it is either mate after 2.<i>al 'Rxa2t or White will lose the queen after 2.fxe4 bxa2t
3.<i>al 'Rxg3.
This should be an important lesson for you: no matter how many pieces and pawns are in-between two long-range pieces or a long range piece and the king there is always the potential for a discovered attack as there is always the potential for a pin. Pieces might disappear or be cleared away with tempo and suddenly you find yourself trapped. If there is nothing on the square where we would like a victim piece to be, then we have to persuade a piece to go there as in Veltmander - Cherepkov, USSR 1 950. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6
[diagram]
After studying the position for a few seconds you will have noticed the necessary
66 Chess Tactics from Scratch
configuration of two of your pieces: the h3- bishop and f5-knight sharing one diagonal is a good start for constructing a discovered attack. You may also have noticed that the knight can evacuate the f5-square with check, so all you need is a victim piece to complete the discovered attack. This is why Veltmander played:
1.�c8 YNxc8 2.�e7t
Winning the queen. Sometimes a victim piece already occupies the desired square but the value of that piece is too low. In this case an exchange on this square might help to increase the value of this point considerably. As an example consider Chigorin - Steinitz, Havana 1 889: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6
[diagram]
The board is pretty crowded but you still might have spotted the chain of the queen on a4, the c4-knight and the d4-bishop. Again, the knight is able to discover the attack with check. The only problem is that the bishop is not really a big fish. But with a queen on d4 it would be a different story. So White cashed in on this configuration with: 1 .�xd4 exd4 2.�xd4! Now the queen is unable to recapture on d4 without meeting a dreadful end after 3.4Jd6t. The next instructive example features a queen sacrifice in order to enhance the value of the victim piece.

Black finally has to accept the gift of a bishop in exchange for his queen. So far all these operations have been rather materialistic. But sometimes it is not material you are interested in, but changing the function of a victim piece. Eliminating a defender might be an operation well worth considering, as in Polugaevsky - Gulko, USSR 1 975:

Within seconds you will have spotted the three points of the chain: e l -rook, e4-knight and e6-knight. The knight is defending the g7-square that is coveted by the white queen. So White used a discovered attack to eliminate the knight:
1.�d6!
Not 1 .ttJ g5 ? Rxf6. 1-0 The knight is attacking both the queen on f5 and the e8-rook, while even more importantly opening the line of fire for the e I -rook, which is ready to sacrifice itself on e6, removing the defender of g7. A discovered attack might also be changed into a pin. The chance of this happening increases when there is more than one piece in the l ine of fire of the principal attacker. In most of the previous examples the boards have been quite crowded. Here is an example where it is fairly empty. Nevertheless, the solution found in Bagirov - Holmov, USSR 1 962, is rather pretty.

The chance of this happening increases when there is more than one piece in the line of fire of the principal attacker.

Now the discovered attack produces a totally different result:

Pinning the queen against the king, which is, as you will remember, an absolute pin and White is winning. In the next diagram you can see another combination of discovered attack and pin. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Shabalov - Ramirez

It is important to notice that this operation was only possible because the black king was on e8 and because the knight on d7 (g6 eyeing f4 would be a sensible square) is not doing anything except blocking escape routes for the king. Tactics reflect and punish inadequate strategic play. We might say that from tactics we can learn prudent strategic play. The victim point in a discovered attack does not necessari ly have to be a piece: quite often it i s a square of great importance. The last example of this kind shows another important possibility to modify the status of the victim piece before you can play a discovered attack.

If White takes the knight, Black would simply play 2 .. .e4, opening the b8-h2 diagonal and gaining the g3-square for the black queen. On g3 the queen has a double attack against the king and e3-bishop and, all of a sudden, White's attack has vanished in a haze. If the "victim" is a square rather than a piece, the discovered attack can be difficult to spot: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Deshauer - Meier Correspondence 1 953 Look closely at this position and you see that the black king is unable to move.

White wins the queen as otherwise it would be Game Over for Black. The discoverer's target Concluding this chapter, let's take a look at the discoverer's target in a discovered attack. As you will remember, the discoverer's target is the square the discoverer moves to in order to discover the attack of the principal attacker on the victim piece or victim square. In rare cases the discoverer can move to the discoverer's target even without any direct impact on the position. For example, there is a small finesse in the endgame of queen versus rook:
[diagram]
The Discovered Attack 73
[diagram]
White has just played 1 .Rd5 setting up a discovered attack formation. Even a check by the rook will give White a tempo because the white king's move will give check. It is common for the discoverer to gain a tempo on its target. The classic example is a check and_ in this case you are advised to observe the consequences of this on all other points in a discovered attack. Let's examine Kan - Botvinnik, Moscow 1 936:
[diagram]
It is not difficult to see what the h2-pawn is dreaming about: becoming a queen. Unfortunately, the al -rook will have none of it. But if you could cut off the white rook from the defence of h l , the pawn would rapidly decide the game. But there is another problem: if later you put the black rook or the black bishop on fl , White's knight would simply snatch the h2-pawn. Consequently the knight has to be chased away first. 1 .• •hd4 2.�xd4 �fl! White resigned here, and with good reason: now the knight cannot help to stop the h-pawn. In addition, if the white rook tries to defend from h 1 it will be lost: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.

Botvinnik is finally able to use the discoverer's target (the king on b5) to support the pawn. This is the moment when we should remember that we can leave a piece or pawn without direct protection if it is "defended" by a possible discovered attack. The attacked white rook cannot take the pawn because of 4 .. . i.fl t.

An exchange on the discoverer's target has to be analysed carefully, otherwise the discovered attack might not deliver the desired result, as in this position, which is analysis of Kirillov - Botvinnik, USSR 1 93 1 :

[diagram]
White hoped to win a piece as he thought his a2-knight was defended by the discovered attack against the d4-knight. But Botvinnik had prepared an intermediate move: 1 .• • ti:)xf3t After White recaptures the knight, Black can take on a2, as now the discovered attack would only regain a pawn. Summary • A discovered attack is always created by three points in a row. The fourth point is the target of the discoverer. • Always look at the long-range impact of the principal attacker beyond the discoverer. • • • • • • • Sometimes just threatening a discovered attack might be enough to win. When creating a discovered attack you can use squares near any of the four points as well, employing other tactical motifs. A discovered attack against the king is often highly profitable. As a check from a discoverer is extremely dangerous, moving onto the same line as a piece that is able to give a check provokes the creation of a discovered attack. The discoverer might be able to support the creation of all other tactical motifs (double attack, pin, etc.) . You can create the victim point of a discovered attack by forcing one of your opponent's pieces to move there. The victim point does not have to be a piece. Sometimes empty squares are worthy of a discovered attack, especially in connection with a threat of mate. Chapter 4 The Reloader In the early sixties Billy Wilder directed one of the best film comedies ever: One, Two, Three. It told the story of a soft drinks manager in Cold War Berlin and how he accomplished his jobs just one, two, three, snapping his fingers, "motivating" his subordinates to work harder and faster. The reloader works on the principle of one, two, three; one: you put one of your pieces onto a square for your opponent to take it; two: he takes it; three: you advantageously retake on the same square with another of your pieces. As simple as that. As always in chess, it is not as easy as soft drinks management in Cold War Berlin. For starters there are two varieties of this motif. The first possibility is to reoccupy the square with the same type of piece, as in this diagram: After the bishop has taken the knight on f7, the knight on g5 will take the black bishop, reloading the square with an identical piece. This is the simplest form of the reloader. The rule for this case is: Two pieces of the same kind are able to occupy a square without any loss of impact when it is only defended once. The other possibility is to reoccupy the square with a piece of a different type. The white knight is replaced by the bishop after the black pawn on g7 has eliminated the knight. The rule for this case is: The second piece occupying the square does not have to be of higher value than the first but its action has to compensate for the loss of the first piece. It is important to note that the second piece that is reoccupying the square has to gain something, in our example checkmate. The trick is that the sacrifice of the first piece, which your opponent is not able to turn down, enables the second piece to occupy a square it would not have been able to occupy otherwise. In many cases the occupation of the crucial square by the first piece creates the motif for the second. Therefore, this motif is sometimes difficult to spot. But here is a little trick for you: it helps a lot to be on the lookout for squares you wish to place your pieces on, even if your wish doesn't seem possible. The dream square might become reality by moving
C' 71
76 Chess Tactics from Scratch
another (!) piece to that square first, paving the way for you to occupy it once more; this time with the piece you initially envisioned for that glorious square. This way you will spot the motif and also find a way to clear the path for the second, reloading, piece. Let's take a closer look at the first case of the reloader. In the following diagram we see a black king in trouble. With a closer look, you will easily discover that the black king would be mated if you could put the rook on a6 without it being taken. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 �
[diagram]
The only thing remaining to do is to clear a6 of all influence by Black.
1.'iNa6t bxa6 2.�a6 mate
The trick worked because the a6-square was only defended once but attacked twice by pieces with similar abilities, i.e. to move vertically and horizontally. Therefore, either queen or rook could have given mate on a6 if it had not been defended at all. The destruction of the protective pawn structure around the enemy king, as in the previous example, is a common use of this mo ti£ In the next position (analysis of Tai - Smyslov, Yugoslavia 1 959) it is the combination of queen and bishop that proves a deadly force:
[diagram]
1.YNxf6t .Bxf6 2. i.xf6 mate
It is not important whether the first piece captured a piece or not; the important thing here is that the second piece is able to occupy the square. The devastating effect of the second piece is the characteristic of the reloader. Another characteristic is the provocation of your opponent or, as the Godfather would have put it, you are making an offer he cannot refuse. Gutop - Roshal
USSR 1 963

[diagram]
The Reloader 77 1 .• • �xdS! 0-1 White has to accept the offer, as otherwise it would soon be mate: 2.Bxd5 Bxd5 . The bishop reloads on d5 with the same diagonal quality as the queen. Now a rook and bishop mate (the initial idea of the combination) is unstoppable as the only move that would save the day, f2-f3, is prevented by a pin from the c5-bishop. This is a fine example of how different motifs can work together with deadly force. If the initial idea of giving mate is prevented by your opponent, you have to look for elementary tactics to realize your aim. The reloader may be used to eliminate a defender with the first piece and to create a tactical situation for the second piece. But you have to be careful here not to open escape routes for the king with the elimination of the first defender. In this case your tactical- fireworks will backfire on you as you have changed the preconditions for the tactics of the second piece with the first. (See the first diagram on the previous page. After 1 .�a6t bxa6 the b-pawn might have created a flight square for the black king. In this case nothing really changed because the white king still covered the square from which the pawn had moved.) A common motif of the reloader is its mission right at the frontline of the king's position. Take a look at the next diagrams: Black has to take the knight. But the knight is replaced by the bishop (or in some cases even the pawn) , which will assist the queen for the mate. 1 ... .Bxf6 2.tiJxf6t @hs 3.�xh7 mate 1 .�h6! might very well have been the initial move. The second piece, the g4-knight ready to reload with mate on h6, made it possible for the first piece to occupy that square. So far we have seen examples where the first piece makes the occupation of the second, the reloading piece, possible. There is also the possibility that the second piece comes to help when the first piece is already in place: Stein - Portisch Stockholm 1 962 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.

78 Chess Tactics from Scratch
We will come across this example once more when looking at mating patterns. White is threatening ttJe8t with an attack on the black queen. 1 .Wff3 The second piece is coming to the aid of the first piece (the f6-bishop) , which is already in place.
8 T
[diagram]
Now Black cannot escape, because even if he took the f6-bishop, after l . . .�xf6 2.Rxf6 the white queen would have reloaded on f6 (threatening 3.ttJf5t and 4.ttJh6 mate) . Black's fate is sealed as refraining from taking on f6 is also hopeless: 1 . . . <i>g8 2. ttJ f5 or l . . .�xfl 2.ttJe8t or 1 . . . h6 2.ttJe8t. Note that 'reloading against the reloader' (countering 1 .Rf3 by strengthening the e7- bishop with l . . .Rd8) was not possible because the d I -rook controls the dB-square. Again a good look at Black's position clearly tells you why the tactics are starting to work against him: note not only the exposed position of his king but also the placement of his rooks compared to the active white rooks. The same applies to nearly all of Black's pieces compared to their white counterparts. Black's extra piece does not provide compensation for his positional deficits. As with the other motifs, the points of this motif's pattern can be created in more than just one order. In the following example the reloader is already completely set up: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Lundin - Botvinnik Groningen 1 946
[diagram]
The future world champion played: 1 ...f4! He was not afraid of the exchange of queens on g6, as the reloading piece, a pawn, would win the knight on h5. For this reason Lundin did not exchange queens. 2 . .ifl Now Botvinnik exchanged queens himself, disrupting White's pawn structure. 2 ... Y*fxd3 3.exd3 b4! Locking in the white pieces. Guess who won .. . To spot a reloader, be on the lookout for diagonals and files into your opponent's camp and for squares where you could, for example, nicely perch a knight, especially around your opponent's king. The Reloader 79 Now for the reloaders with different types of pieces replacing each other. This type of motif can be more difficult to spot, as the second piece is of a different type and consequently performs different tricks on the square that has been cleared by the first. Therefore, imagining what you could do on a particular square with different pieces is very important if you want to discover the motif. Gofshtein - Afek Israel 1 992

It is increasingly difficult to spot the key move when the first piece greatly changes the conditions on the square for the second piece to perform a special tactic on this square, which the first piece would not have been able to perform there.

Yet all his expertise did not help against: 1 .�e6! Suetin was faced with the "pleasant" choice of losing his queen, if the knight is not taken, or being mated. The pawn on f7 is defending its king against the check of the bishop on dS . Consequently, it is not able to perform other tasks such as defending the e6-square. Therefore, after its elimination, the bishop reloads on e6 and the game is over: 1 .. . fxe6 2.he6t @ffi 3.Y;Yhs mate d

This example shows very nicely that even very strong players are prone to overlooking motifs like the reloader; this is your chance and it might happen in any game you play. The reloader enables pieces to occupy vital squares that are defended by the enemy's pawns or pieces. In the next case discovering the reloader was a small step on the road to the World Championship (this is a further explanation of an example we have already seen in the chapter on the pin) .

When looking for this motif, there is a simple guideline: Think about what a defending piece could do if it moved to the square of the piece it is defending. Another thing to remember well is that if you use the reloader against the enemy king, it will almost always mean a gain of tempo. And, as we have learned from Tal, in chess a gain of tempo can make all the difference. (So when will using a reloader against the king not gain a tempo? In those very rare cases when the

After the ingenious, yet not unusual, application of the reloader by World Champion Tai, let's look at a final example where the reloader appeared in a quite unusual fashion.

An unusual, slightly delayed, but very pretty reloader. The second rook on h8 is decisive as the white queen is bound to the h6-square. • • • • • • Summary Two pieces of the same kind are able to occupy a square without any loss of impact when it is only defended once. The second piece occupying the square of the first does not have to be of higher value but it has to compensate for the loss of the first. The reloader may be used to eliminate a defender. The reloader enables pieces to occupy vital squares that are defended by the enemy's pawns and pieces. Think about what a defending piece could do if it moved to the square of the piece it is defending. If you use the reloader against the enemy king, it will almost always mean a gain of tempo. Chapter 5 The Double Attack Imagine you are preparing pancakes for breakfast. There you are in front of the oven and in the pan are delicious golden pancakes; they are just about ready. The telephone rings. Now you face a tough choice: either answer the call and let the pancakes burn, or say 'stuff communication, I'm hungry' and do not answer the call. This is what the double attack is about: one piece is attacking two enemy pieces and only one can be defended or moved. If, for example, both pieces are undefended or of greater value than the attacking piece, one of the two attacked pieces will be lost. The explanation is trivial yet a lot of players, and very good players as you will see in this chapter, forget about it: in chess you are allowed to move only one piece at a time. Every chess piece has the ability to perform this tactical trick. It is the most common motif in chess. So beware. If we create a scheme for the double attack we could break it down into three points. There are two poi n ts which are attacked. I will call them tactical target 1 and tactical target
2. They are marked with a box. The third
point is the square from where the attacker is threatening the two enemy pieces. I will call this point the tactical base and it is marked with a circle. Tactical Target 1 Tactical Target 2 This graphic shows the moment when you can take advantage of your opponent's situation to create a double attack. All three basic components of the double attack are there to see. But this chapter is not only about the components and their character, it is also about the timing and how to create the situation represented by the scheme given above. And although this motif is called double attack and the scheme shows only two tactical targets, there might be more. Who has not dreamt of a knight forking king, queen and rook? Whenever you start to create the situation of a double attack, it does not matter where you start, whether it is the tactical base or one of the tactical targets. Sometimes you might even start from scratch. And there is no set sequence in which you have to construct your double attack. You can start with either tactical target or the tactical base. Because the formation of the double attack is sometimes incomplete, it is difficult to see the hidden motif.

In connection with the double attack I have also called the attacked opponent's pieces tactical targets. This is not to make things more difficult for you, but simply to avoid confusion when tactical targets are squares or motifs. I will start my lesson on the double attack with the tactical base, paying special attention to the knight. Then I will take a look at the tactical targets, and here the king, as always in tactics and in chess in general, naturally plays the most important role. The Tactical Base The tactical base is the square that a piece has to occupy in order to attack two or more of the opponent's weaknesses at the same time. As every chess piece (knights, pawns and king included) can perform this nasty trick, the rules and recommendations for the tactical base apply for every piece on the board. However, from Orwell's Animal Farm we know that some animals are more equal than others, and in the case of the double attack, it is the pawn and the knight that are special. A double attack by a pawn is often devastating, as the pawn itself does not have great material value. If it is lost in the course of the operation it does not really matter, as it normally faces pieces of greater value. But the real specialist for double attacks is the knight. Due to its peculiar way of moving, when a knight attacks other kinds of pieces they cannot strike back and take out the offender. Its strange movement is also responsible for the double attack by a knight being one of the most common oversights in chess. But, before we go deeper into the mechanics of the knight, let us take a closer look at the tactical base in general. It is important to note that after a piece has landed on a certain square all points it could reach from this point are prospective squares for a double attack. These squares are the possible tactical targets of your double attack. The diagram below shows every possible square of the rook on dl .
[diagram]
In the next diagram the circled squares are the sensible tactical bases from where the rook would be able to perform a double attack on two tactical targets marked by a box.
[diagram]
So much for the theory, now let us see what it looks like in a real game. The following position is from one of the games Paul Morphy played against Schulten in New York 1 857. The Double Attack 8 5 1 .• • Y;Yf6 did not solve all his problems. The game continued:
2.Y;Yxf6 gxf6 3.�g4 Qg7 4.�xf6
[diagram]
If Black takes the knight with his king then two of the three elements of the double attack would already be on the board. Both the king on f6 and the b6-knight are the tactical targets of the d I -rook, which could perform a double attack from d6, the tactical base for this motif More than 1 00 years later the trick was still working. The following position is from Jansson - Pytel, Stockholm 1 975: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6
[diagram]
The tactical base is d4 and it is the white queen that could attack three tactical targets from there: the black queen on c5, the black knight on g4 and the pawn on g7, threatening mate. Wait a minute, isn't d4 defended by the black queen? Only if Black desperately wants to lose instantly. If the black queen takes its opposite number on d4, White would simply play ctJ e?t and, after the forced . . . \t>h8, White mates with �xf8. So the queen cannot leave the c5-e7 diagonal. Therefore, the only possible way to meet
1.YMd4
was to take the white knight with: 1 .. J�xf5 eliminating the threat of mate.
2.YMxc5 �xfl t
However Black did not have full compensation for his queen. Two years later it was possible to see that Pytel had learned his lesson well. In Le Havre he played Lederman and this time Pytel put a piece on a tactical base that was seemingly defended.

1.. .
YMf3! Because the white queen cannot give up the defence of the e I -rook with 2.Wfxf3 as Black would simply play 2 .. . :B:xe 1 mate. This leads us to our first important conclusion about the tactical base: The attacker can occupy a tactical base without risk if the piece on the tactical target defending this tactical base has more important tasks to perform. (In our two examples the queen had to defend against mate threats.) If you examine a tactica l base you always have to take into account all possible tactical targets. You wil l not recognize the ful l potential ofthe tactical base if you only look at the obvious tactica l targets. This applies not only for the tactical base but for tactical targets as well. After l.e4 e5 2.�f3 �c6 3.d4 exd4 4.tlJxd4 YMh4 s . .Be3 YMxe4 6.�b5 YMes the following position is reached: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

[diagram]
You see the marked tactical targets of the b5-knight if it occupied c7. Consequently, the black queen is not defending d5, as it has to prevent the knight from hopping to c7. So 7.YMdS!? is possible in this position. The black queen is overloaded as in our previous examples. There is another important lesson to be learned here: if you examine a tactical base you always have to take into account all possible tactical targets. You will not recognize the full potential of the tactical base if you only look at the obvious tactical targets. As a double attack requires at least two tactical targets, it is easy to recognize the possibility for a double attack if we already have a tactical base and one tactical target. The only thing to do now is to create the second tactical target to trigger the mechanism. Former World Champion Boris Spassky gives a fine example of how to do this. Take a look at the next diagram showing a position from Spassky - Averkin, USSR 1 973. The Double Attack 87
[diagram]
If you played 1 .Re5 you would threaten mate _ on g7 · So g7 is your first tactical target. Looking deeper into this position you will find for the white queen on e5 the only other noteworthy tactical target is c7. This is the only sensible square for the f4-bishop to occupy. Note the unfortunate formation of the b6-rook and queen on a5 . 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6. a c d e f g h On c7 the white bishop threatens to win the exchange. To prevent this, Black has to take the bishop with the c8-rook but then this rook would enter the second tactical target the white queen needs for a successful double attack. So Spassky played: I..Bc7!! Winning the exchange. If the b5-bishop in the a�ove position had been defended only once It would have become a tactical target of the queen on e5 as well. We started our examination of the position from the tactical base, the square from which we could attack something. That gave us our first tactical target. Then we created the second tactical target in order to make the occupation of this square a double attack. Finding a tactical base for a double attack becomes less complicated when the two tactical targets necessary for the operation are already there. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 B.

Everything seems to be calm with no double attack in sight. The game continued:

We now have this position:
[diagram]
As you can see from the diagram, there is a tactical base for a knight on c2 with the two tactical targets of the a I -rook and b4-bishop. The reason why you may not have recognized c2 as a tactical base in the first diagram is the apparent impossibility of Black moving a knight there. 3 ...�b6t 4.<i>fl �e3t s.<i>e2 �c2 The knight finally lands on the tactical base. Therefore, you should always be aware of the configuration for a double attack if there are two tactical targets even if the occupation of the tactical base seems to be unlikely or even impossible at the time. Quite often you, or your opponent, might be able to reach the tactical base with gain of tempo, and suddenly a knight becomes a long-range piece as it is virtually allowed to move twice in a row. And remember: every piece on the board can perform a double attack. So when you are analysing a position always look for the possible structure of a double attack with its tactical base and two or more tactical targets on both sides of the board. (Just collect those damn tactical targets!) b The Double Attack 89 The previous example showed the double attack by a knight. The knight is a good example to look a little deeper into the nature of the double attack. You will also learn a lot about why the knight is such a great piece for a double attack. You have to look for possible tactical targets for a double attack when you are looking for a knight's tactical base. The king and undefended pieces are typical tactical targets for knights. The secret of the knight is its peculiar way of moving over the board. As it moves differently from the other chess pieces, the sudden appearance of a knight on a certain square is sometimes difficult to predict. So we can say about the knight: • Knight moves are difficult to predict. • Knight moves are more difficult to calculate. • The pieces on tactical targets of a knight's double attack often do not communicate, that is, they cannot defend each other. • The tactical targets cannot take the knight unless they are knights themselves. • The value of the knight is often relatively low compared with the value of its targets. You have to look for possible tactical targets for a double attack when you are looking for a knight's tactical base. The king and undefended pieces are typical tactical targets for knights. Marked in the next diagram are two tactical targets for the white knight. Unzicker - Pesch Solingen 1 964 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 �

Looking at this diagram you will easily detect how Simagin with Black won the game against Tolush, USSR 1 952, by sacrificing his queen. All he had to do was to lure the king onto the second tactical target connected with the black knight's tactical base on e2. 1 ...Wgl t! Now after

Black gets back his investment with 2 ...�xe2t with the bishop as the dividend. Queen sacrifices are thrilling; we all would like to impress our friends with such a grand finale. Here is another example, giving you more ideas of how to sac the queen. This time the queen takes the material herself: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Dueckstein -Johannsson Moscow (ol) 1 956
[diagram]
Dueckstein played: 1 .tllf6t As the bishop is pinned against the king by the white queen, Black has only two options: ...�f7 or . . .�h8. Whichever he chooses, White will sacrifice the queen on g7. The king takes and the nasty knight hops to e8, the tactical base for this double attack; White will win back the queen on d6. This combination was only possible because Dueckstein used two motifs together: the pin and the double attack. The next example is more complicated, but the method of finding the tactical base by first looking at the tactical targets remains the same. Levenfish - Riumin Moscow 1 935 (analysis position) 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 a b c d e g If you carefully examine the above position, you will notice that the queen on d6 is a possible tactical target for a double attack by the white knight. This may give you the tactical base on f7. What is still missing is the second tactical target. However, the black king is close to the tactical base, so he might be a likely candidate. The reason why this is a slightly more complicated example is the rather elaborate preparation needed before the actual double attack comes into play. At the moment the tactical base f7 is defended three times: by the f8-rook, g6-bishop and king on g8. So White decides to strip this point of its guards at all costs: h The Double Attack 9 1 t.YMxg6! hxg6 2 . .Bxf7t �xf7 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Now the position is radically transformed. Two protectors of the tactical base f7 have been eliminated and the h-file has been opened. This is where White will strike next, crowning his operation with the motif of the double attack:
3.�hst <tt>
xhs 4.�xf7t Finally, the knight occupies the tactical base, regaining the queen with an extra pawn. Yates - Reti New York 1 924 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.

From the knight's tactical base f3 we can see that one tactical target is the white queen. This alone should be enough to set alarm bells ringing. Furthermore, you can see that there are several tactical targets near the king. 1 ... �dl t 2.@g2 �gl t Now, whether the king takes the rook or moves to h2 he will find himself on a tactical target of Black's knight. Of course, the squares e 1 , d2, d4, and h4 could have been marked as well as tactical targets. On the one hand they were not considered in the tactical calculation, as they were not important. On the other hand, to find this motif you had to take a look at all possible tactical targets of the tactical base in order to decide where a double attack would be possible. Trying to find all the tactical targets will automatically lead, after a little practice, to a sensible selection. Just get used to listing all targets! Taking a close look at a piece's tactical base can do even more than help you to recognize spectacular tactics that win games. Sometimes an examination of the tactical base will also help you to avoid blunders. When Reti analysed the following pos1t1on from Bogoljubow - Alekhine, Hastings 1 922, he remarked that exchanging on e5 until the bitter end would, of course, have ruined White's game .. .

Alekhine played:

If the queen takes the h6-rook, it would have moved onto the tactical target of the tactical base f7. As one of the other tactical targets of f7 is the black king on d8, the rook is defended by the tactical motif of the double attack. In the next game we have a rook defending a seemingly hanging queen, although this example is far more spectacular. Dantas - Wexler Mar del Plata 1 95 1

[diagram]
1 . . . �fl This was too hot to handle for Dantas. If White takes the queen it is mate with . . . !!h2. If he takes the rook, he would first lose the queen and then the game. The last example is an interesting case. Although the f2-rook does not have direct control over e 1 , it is indirectly defending the black queen on this square by a threat of mate. On the other hand, from e 1 the queen is directly defending the f2-rook. Note the possible influence of the tactical base on squares that are not within its direct reach. We have seen that there is no fixed sequence for the occupation of the tactical base and the tactical targets. If one of the tactical targets is originally occupied then the motif of the double attack is more difficult to see. Another difficulty of setting up a double attack might be the creation of the necessary configuration of three or more points. The next diagram is an example of a potential double attack that is not so easy to see.

White has the chance to defend his b7- knight with I ..Bb5 . If Black then captures on b7, White would take the c6-knight, forking rook and king.

Consequently, there are two things you should keep in mind when you study the possibility of a double attack: 1 . Make sure you have checked all possible sequences for occupying the three different points.
2. Keep in mind that you might have to
create the second tactical target. The previous example leads us to the topic of the tactical target but is also a nice illustration of the function of the tactical base as well.

The Tactical Target We have already learned a lot about the tactical target while examining the tactical base. Nevertheless, there are still some points we did not consider and some things that might appear in a slightly different perspective. A tactical target is a piece or a square that can be attacked from the tactical base. If the tactical target is a piece then it is easy to see. If it is a square or another tactical motif, then it becomes more difficult to identify. A good example to illustrate this phenomenon is Miles - Martin, Birmingham 1 977, which we also saw on page 54.

the formation b 1-rook, c 1-bishop and queen on e 1 then this chain should remind you of a pin - and this formation also resembles the main part of a discovered attack.

However, after such a long uphill struggle, White was not up to the task and lost in the endgame. Another tactical target that deserves special consideration is the king. It is a tactical target that is very easy to spot. A simple rule for the king as tactical target applies: a check is generally regarded as a tactical target. It is obvious that the king can become a tactical target in the endgame when he becomes a fighting unit and moves out in the open.

The tactical base for the bS-knight is d6 where it would attack the king with check (tactical target 1 ) and the c4-sq uare (tactical target 2) . Any black piece occupying this square would automatically be lost as the knight strikes with tempo from d6. This is an important point to keep in mind when the king becomes a tactical target of a double attack: a double attack with the king as tactical target usually gives the attacker an extra tempo.

If Black takes the white a-pawn, the white king will catch the black pawn on al while the bishop stops the f-pawn on the newly opened diagonal. During the middlegame it is more difficult to turn the king into a tactical target. Often he has to be 'motivated' by a sacrifice to leave his safe position.

The undefended e4- rook is the first tactical target for the double attack. All other squares on the f-file are possible second tactical targets. You should pay special attention to the squares close to the black king. The trick of this double attack was to force the king onto one of these squares (f6) . Consequently, not only the king but also the squares next to the king have to be considered as potential tactical targets in relation to the king. When you are thinking about a double attack and you have already found one tactical target you should always watch for options against the king, as he is a wonderful second tactical target. Sometimes the king is already where you want him, but if not you might be able to 'persuade' his majesty to move a little to make life easier for you.

Black is a pawn up and his central pawns are threatening to advance. The f-pawn looks rather shaky and the white king needs defence. The only thing that can rescue White is a combined attack with queen and rook against the black king. But the white rook cannot immediately leave the first rank: 1 .�g7?? W c4 t
2.�b l �h l t with mate to follow.
White has to lure the black queen away in order to avoid the check on c4. The motif of a possible double attack assists White's counterattacking plan:

2.�g7
Now the black queen can no longer give check on c4. A draw was agreed shortly thereafter, as the black king cannot find a safe haven. • • • • • • • • • • Summary A double attack consists of a tactical base and two (or more) tactical targets. Every square that can be reached from the tactical base must be considered as a po ten rial tactical target. The tactical base can be occupied if a piece defending the tactical base has a more important task to perform. In order to occupy the tactical base with material gain, you might first have to sacrifice. If you have got a tactical base and only one tactical target you might be able to create the second tactical target. A tactical target can be a piece, a square, or a tactical motif. Look out for undefended pieces! They are likely candidates as tactical targets of a double attack. A check should always be considered as a potential tactical target. If the king is a tactical target, the tactical base will almost always be occupied with tempo (check) . The squares next to the king might be turned into tactical targets. Chapter 6 Overloading Overloading is the opposite of the double attack. It is when a piece rather than attacking two squares of importance, has a responsibility on two important squares. In this case we talk about a piece being overloaded. This is only relevant if the opponent can 1n some way exploit this. In the game Stocek - Prokopchuk played in the 20 1 0 Czech Open Rapid Championship they reached the following position:

However, this allows 2 .. .�e l t with mate next move. Overloading is quite a common theme in tactics and we will come across it throughout this book, often in combination with another theme. 1 02 Chess Tactics from Scratch B. Larsen - Szabo Beverwijk 1 967 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 a b c d e f

because of 3 . . . :8'.xc3 4.:8'.b8t with mate on the next move. Again the rook is overloaded. 8 7 In this case Black looks better at first. He 6 has an extra pawn which is advancing quickly towards glory. However, a few short-term themes are also in the air. The knight on c3 is sort of pinned (although the b8-rook is defending the queen) and Black's back rank is fragile, making the b8-rook overloaded. Bent Larsen managed to take advantage of all of these themes with one surprising move:
1.�b5!!
Szabo had not seen this coming. None of the black pieces can take the rook. 1 . . . :8'.xb5 allows
2.'Re8 mate. 1 . . .Rxb5 just loses the queen -
and after 2.�xb5 Black cannot even recapture without being mated. Finally 1 . . . ttJxb5 blocks the b-file in the middle and so White mates with 2.'Rxb8 (okay, 2.'Rxb2 is the second best move) . Szabo decided to take on f2 and face his problems afterwards. 1 .• • YMxflt 2.@h3 The pin on the knight is gone, but Black is still struggling to keep his back rank in order. 2 .. . :8'.c8 still loses the knight to 3.'Rxc3, 5 4 3 2 1

2 ...�ffi 3.'iMxc3 White has won a piece and went on to win the game. It might be a coincidence, but many of Bent Larsen's most famous combinations involved taking advantage of the opponent's overloaded pieces. In the following example he managed to get his grip into the collar of a reigning World Champion. Overloading is quite a common theme in tactics, often in combination with other themes. Overloading 1 03 Karpov - B. Larsen Montreal 1 979
8 T
[diagram]
There are two themes in play here. One is the double attack of d3 and g2, which the knight can perform from f4. The other is the overloading of the bishop on g3, which has to look after the pawn on h4 as well as the f4- square. Larsen grabbed his chance with: 1 ... cixh4! Karpov now decided to accept the loss of the pawn and tried to hold the position with
2.Re2.
If he had taken on the challenge, he would quickly have been forced to resign:
2.cixh4 gxd3!
The potential knight fork on f4 is devastating.
[diagram]
Often a piece is overloaded without it having any great importance. It is not hard to imagine that a piece is defending several important squares, but the opponent cannot take advantage of it. We should not overstate the importance of this theme; only pay dutiful attention to it, in the same way as we pay attention to other tactical themes. However, it can be quite unpleasant when we find that we have two pieces that are overloaded, which is exactly what happened to Robert Byrne as White in a famous game against Bobby Fischer in the 1 963 US Championship, which Fischer famously won with the perfect score of 1 1 / 1 1 . R. Byrne - Fischer US Championship 1 963

Here Fischer calculated far ahead and played a brilliant combination:

4 ...�xg2!! Black is basing his combination on weakening the light squares around the white king. With two pawns for the piece he is not running an excessive risk, but needless to say, Fischer had calculated everything to the end, so the only risk he took was that there was some oversight in his calculations. Obviously there was not. s.Qxg2 d4! 6.�xd4 .Bh7t

[diagram]
After 8.Y*ffl Y*fh3t 9.<i>gl
[diagram]
White seemingly is holding everything together. But the sad reality is that both his queen and dl -rook are overloaded. Both of them are defending the knight on d4 and the e I -square, while the queen has a third and even more important engagement with the g2- square, where she is defending against mate in one move. When Fischer had initiated his combination he had seen that White would not be able to keep this shaky defence going. The white queen is dislodged from her defence of g2 by two deflectors. First comes 9 • • • �el t!!, which exploits the overloading of the rook by taking it away from the vital defence of the d4-knight. However, there is no choice, so White must play 10.gxel, when it is time to deflect the attention of the queen with 10 ... .Bxd4.
[diagram]
The mission is completed. The combination that started with stripping the white king of his defending pawns and bishop has progressed to removing the overloaded heavy artillery that flew to the king's aid. And not only can the queen not take on d4, due to the mate on g2, she is also pinned and thus unable to defend against the mate anyway. Overloaded pieces are found on the board most of the time. The key is to work out when their dual responsibilities are causing problems. • • • • Summary Overloading is the opposite of the double attack. It is when a piece rather than attacking two squares of importance, has a responsibility on two important squares. Overloading is quite a common theme in tactics and we will come across it throughout this book, often in combination with another theme.

Overloaded pieces are found on the board most of the time. The key is to work out when their dual responsibilities are causing problems. Chapter ? Mate The following statement may come as a surprise, yet there might be a grain of truth in it: The ultimate aim when playing chess is checkmate. Either you are able to attack the enemy king directly, or you gain a material plus which you will use in the endgame to finish off your opponent's hapless monarch. In order to give mate you should know the standard mating patterns. They will save you time and energy. The reason why professionals find more combinations in less time than amateurs is that they have stored countless patterns in their minds. Whenever they are confronted with one of these patterns they will remember it and instantly know what to do. This is not a question of ingenuity but of learning and experience. After a while you too will be able to retrieve acquired patterns. These mating patterns also function as a yardstick to judge the strategic and tactical implications of a position, or a move, that you are considering. But mating patterns can do more for you. They often function as a starting point for a deeper analysis of a position. As with the tactical motifs, looking beyond the circumstances of the current position helps a lot. Once you have discovered the crucial pattern, it is helpful to mull over a position for a while. The mating pattern might function like the beam of a lighthouse. Suddenly you get an idea of how to navigate your ship in order to reach the desired position. It is always easier to devise a plan when you know where you want to go. And if your operation does not result in mate, then the threat of mate may be enough to give you the necessary tempo to gain a crucial material advantage. So try to keep in mind the apparently strange idea of starting your calculations from a final position (an aim) that anticipates the tactical realization, as the final position already comprises the moves leading to it. No other tactical motif will demonstrate this method as well as the mate, because it is the most clear and final tactic in chess. The mating patterns Mate with the queen The queen is the most powerful piece on the board as it combines the patterns of movement of rook and bishop. Thus the queen is able to control a lot of squares around the king and control of squares is crucial when it comes to giving mate. In the following pos1uon, the queen (aided by her king) has control over six of the eight possible squares the black king could move to. 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
1 08 Chess Tactics from Scratch The squares marked with a cross are like the epaulettes, that is shoulder-pieces, of a uniform. If these two squares were controlled by White or occupied by black pieces, it would be mate. This also works diagonally: 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
It is not very difficult to recognize this pattern, yet even good players seem to forget it sometimes. Take a look at the game Stern - Maiwald, Germany 1 992:

The influence of the queen on the squares around the king is often underestimated. Consequently, you have to recognize the squares controlled by the queen in order to avoid disaster.

Although Black will take the queen and White has to sacrifice another rook on h5, Black has no way of stopping White from giving mate on the h-file with the remaining rook. Recognizing the basic pattern of the mate made it possible for White to realize that he could sac queen and rook in order to win. The thing to remember here is the co-operation between rook and bishop. The bishop defends the rook from outside as the rook enters the lion's den to give mate ( 1 . . .�xf4 2.El:xh5 gxh5

Mate with bishop and knight Mating with bishop and knight is more complicated when the kings are the only other pieces remaining on the board, although a mating method can be learned by heart, as the endgame books demonstrate.

The most common form of a bishop and knight mate sees the bishop controlling the squares around the king, and the knight giving mate. 8 7 6 5 Quite often a discovered check by the knight gives the attacker the necessary tempo.

Black resigned anyway. If he takes the bishop, White simply reloads on f6 and the discovered check of the knight becomes a motif again. Quite often the h3- or h6-squares are cleared by sacrificing another piece (e.g. the queen) . After the defender takes with the pawn he loses control over the critical square and the cavalry rides in with a final charge. Here is an example from Fild - Tenner, USA 1 933, where Black sacs his queen.

For example, 7 .. .E!g8 8.Bxg7t E!xg7 9.E!f8t and mate next move. 1-0 Drawing on mating patterns saves time and energy when it comes to calculating tactics against the enemy king. More importantly, they do not restrict your creativity in the game. Mating patterns are rather like cooking methods, and there is still plenty of scope for the chef to vary the ingredients and seasoning. This is where your creativity comes in. So in our final example we see a slightly different design of mate with bishop and knight. In Alekhine - Fletcher, London (simul) 1 928, one of the greatest chess chefs prepared his own specialty bishop and knight mate:

A discovered check to gain the final tempo. 6 ... Qh8 7.�f7 mate
[diagram]
If you look at the diagram of the initial position for this combination you can see that at the beginning there was the idea that a check on the b 1 -h7 diagonal might be lethal for Black. Now that you had the fundamental idea, it was not too difficult to calculate the rest, especially with the mating pattern in mind. Without recognition of the basic idea and some calculation, you might have been under the impression that the white queen had to simply move away and give up the exchange. Only the mating pattern gave the idea that White can sacrifice the queen. Mate with queen and knight (smothered mate) In the bishop and knight mate we could of course replace the bishop with a queen, as the queen moves diagonally as well. But the queen and knight can also perform a special trick that is especially pleasing: smothered mate. The knight, by discovering a check, gains control over a square a second time. The queen is sacrificed, and the piece that captures the queen takes away the last breathing space of the king, then the knight gives mate. As usual, pictures are faster than words, so the following four diagrams show the four steps towards the final pattern. The fact that this mating pattern is famous does not mean that every chess player will manage to defend against it, and sometimes even a world class player can be caught. Look what happened in Timman - Short, Tilburg 1 990. Mate 1 23

In a simultaneous display in Breslau in 1 933 he found a clever solution for the following position. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 With the last diagram in mind, let's take a final look at the characteristics of this pattern: • The knight gains the tern po to get to its final square with a discovered check on the king. • A queen or a bishop controls the crucial diagonal. • The queen sacrifice takes away the king's breathing space. The fact that a mating pattern is famous does not mean that every chess player will manage to defend against it, and sometimes even a world class player can be

Mate with two bishops (criss-cross mate) Since the two bishops each control diagonals and squares of a different colour, they usually create an almost identical mating pattern. They often control a box of four squares in which the king is mated. As is always the case with the bishop, a queen can replace it. And now let's see an example of how this mate happens in practice:

In Karlsson - Rodgaard, Sweden 1 978, White happily sacrificed the rook with: 1 .�xc6t! As he had seen that after 1 . . .bxc6 2.Ba6 was mate. This image is also known as Boden's Mate. 1-0 The initial idea for this mate, especially with more complicated exam pies, is often the control over two squares next to the enemy king by a bishop. The starting point for calculating is the mating pattern with two bishops, and often the second diagonal for the bishop (or queen) has to be opened by force, as in Klitsch - Gratschal, East Germany 1 948: b d f h

With a bishop on fS it is mate. The only thing you have to do now is to change the initial position to match your dream position. Mate with two knights You may already know that mate with two knights against a lone king can only be achieved when the defending side helps with bad moves. But with chessmen around the king a mate with two knights is not so difficult to accomplish. There are two theoretical possibilities. The first is when the two knights cover four squares in the shape of a box. The second possibility is when they control four squares on one rank or file The first possibility is a rare bird in tournament chess but occasionally it is sighted, as in Amsterdam in 1 902 when Speyer played Couvee.
[diagram]
t.YMxh7t To get rid of the defender of g6. 1. •• �xh7 2.tllg6 mate In this position it was not essential to recognize a pattern. In this case it was enough to know that e8 and f7 are controlled by one knight, and e7 and f8 by the other. Interestingly enough, knights do control diagonals, but only very short ones! This thought could be useful in a game if you are searching for a possible way to control two neighbouring diagonal squares. Remember: chess is a visual game! There are countless mates with two knights. They do need the help of other pieces: friendly pieces from their own side or 'persuaded' pieces from the enemy. As we already know, two knights and a king against a king is an endgame with no winner. Often the knights need the kind of help found in smothered or semi-smothered mates. In Chapter 1 1 we will study the technique of taking away the king's flight squares. Mate 127 Nevertheless, when looking at mate with the knights, contrary to most mating patterns, it is not important to visualize specific patterns. Instead try to appreciate their power to control squares around the king. Liss - Kahn Budapest 1 995 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
It is easy to see that if the e5-knight could safely move to g6 it would be mate, because the combined knights control all the king's squares on the back rank. Therefore:

The last example of this kind does not show a mate by two knights, but rather their domination of squares around the king, which leads to a different mate: Ulibin - Bezold Stockholm 1 999 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.

2.Rg6t @h8 3.Rg7 mate, or l . ..@h8 2.Rh7
mate. 1-0 Mate with two rooks This mating pattern is rather easy to see, as two parallel lines controlled by two rooks can be mate. Typically this pattern must be used on the edge of the board if there are no other pieces or pawns available to prevent the attacked king from escaping. The benefit of the edge of the board is obvious: there is no need to control a third parallel line, as the king cannot escape to the i-file. The position Speyer vs. Couvee, "Amsterdam 1 902" (previous page), has been assigned to wildly different countries, dates and tournaments in various sources. In this way chess " history" is as open for discussion as " real " history. 1 28 Chess Tactics from Scratch Here is an example from Pillsbury - Maroczy, Paris 1 900: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.

You may be surprised to find the next example As with the two-bishop pattern, a rook can of in this category and not as an example of a back course be replaced by a queen. But the queen's rank mate. However, it is a brilliant example of Mate 1 29 how to start the calculation with the desired pattern as a focus. In Tarrasch - Walbrodt, Hastings 1 895, Tarrasch started his tactical operation from this position: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

The back rank mate This pattern is created by a horizontal check by either rook or queen. Another essential ingredient is the unmoved pawn formation in front of the king. If a pawn has moved the back rank mate will need extra help to cover the escape square. Such an escape square is commonly known as a luft, which is an abbreviation of the German word Luftloch, meaning an air-hole: kings need to breathe! The back rank pattern is not difficult to see. Consequently the recognition of the pattern is not what catches out the defender; it is his misplaced belief in the soundness of his defence of his back rank or the impression that the attacker would not be able to get to the back rank that leads to his downfall. Therefore, as in the case with a queen and king on the same file or diagonal, even the slightest inkling of a back rank mate should be enough to set off alarm bells. 1 30 Chess Tactics from Scratch Here is an example of an overoptimistic player who thought his back rank was sufficiently defended. In Fontein - Euwe, Amsterdam 1 939, White found out that after:
[diagram]
1 ...�cl!! Neither the fl -rook nor the back rank was sufficiently defended. Of course White cannot take on c 1 because of mate on d 1 . 0-1 Big names have fallen into the same trap, as Reshevsky - Fischer, Palma de Mallorca lnterzonal 1 970, shows.

So next we have an example of a defender who firmly believed his opponent was never going to make it: Wilmtan -Jovcic Correspondence 1 95 5

White has managed to battle his way home to the back rank, blocking the mate and heading for victory, or so he must have hoped. But another bombshell destroyed this illusion. 4 ...YNxcl t 5.�xcl ga8!! After this brilliant resource, which is easy to see here but hard to spot earlier, White must give up a bishop to avoid mate. This mating pattern develops enormous power. The strength of the f8-rook in the initial position was not obvious, especially as White might have consoled himself with thoughts like: "If he moves his rook, I'll create a luft then." The only problem was, when Black finally played the move, White could not find a tempo to do it. Therefore, if you are faced with the potential threat of a back rank mate, take a very good look at the position. Calculating a few moves too many is not as painful as discovering an unstoppable back rank mate after having wasted a few stamps. Finally, a few useful hints about back rank mates. The direction of movement of the blocking piece has to be carefully analysed as the following two examples show: 1 32 Chess Tactics from Scratch 3 2 1

1. •• V!!fl t 2 . .igl V!!f3 mate In both cases the bishop blocked the mate by the queen but only for one move. The last game is an example of how sensitive the back rank is and how easy it is to fall for this pattern, although it seems to be so obvious. In Kwilezki - Roslinski, Poland 1 954, it looks as if the back rank is sufficiently defended but:
[diagram]
l .V!!e5t @£8 1 . . .�h6 2.Rf4t

Now it is easy to see that Black has left the back door unlocked. Both 2 .. .�xe7 and 2 .. .Rxe7 are answered by 3.Rh8 mate. Although the rook is attacked three times and defended only once, Black is unable to take it. 1-0 Other frequently employed patterns Now we will examine other patterns that are quite common but do not fall into any of the aforementioned categories. Nevertheless, as they are fairly common you should become familiar with them, both to use them to your advantage and to recognize a possible threat from your opponent. Naturally, the various patterns all share the idea of controlling squares. The next example, taken from the famous game Levitsky - Marshall, Breslau 1 9 1 2, shows a combination of different motifs. Most likely you will have seen this game before, but it is illegal to omit this position from a tactics book.

The story goes that the spectators showered the board with gold coins after Black's next move: 1 ... V!!g3!!! The only move in chess history that is traditionally given three exclamation marks, Mate 1 33 despite the fact many other moves also win. White wisely resigned as he loses in all lines. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 6. 1

If White plays 2.hxg3 then 2 ... lt:Je2 mate. If 2.fxg3 then 2 ... lt:Je2t 3.�h l E!:xfl mate. And if 2.�xg3 lt:Je2t 3.�h l lt:Jxg3t 4.�gl and, among others, Black can play 4 ...lt:Je2t keeping an extra piece. One important point in our discussion of mating patterns is the position after 1 . . . �g3
2.hxg3 which leads to a mating pattern that
is very common, although the sequence is reversed. That is, the rook is executing the coup de grace after the knight has taken control over the g l - and g3-squares. Two common mating patterns: If the attacking side has no knights then a bishop on f2 does just as well. The recipe for this mating pattern {let's assume an example of Black mating on the kingside) follows the previously mentioned one, two, three process: 1 . The h-file is opened by a sacrifice.
2. A piece that is able to control gl and g3
occupies the second rank.
3. A rook or queen gives mate on the h-file.
Although this sounds rather simplistic it has worked several times in the past. The sequence was changed in Meo - Giustolisi, Italy 1 959:

Black cannot avoid the mate with two heavy pieces after 1 3.:gh4. The quiet move s.:gfl !, bringing the rook int o the attack, should be easy to understand now. So although Anand missed a chance to deliver this classic Greek Gift sacrifice, it was in a very complicated setting. A lack of defenders for the black king (especia l ly there being no knight on f6) is likely to i nvite the bishop sacrifice on h7. This wil l often happen when the knight has been ousted by a white pawn on e5. In many cases the calculations are not so complicated. In Yates - Marin y Llovet, Hamburg (ol) 1 930, we see a typical invitation for the bishop sacrifice on h7: there are no defenders of Black's castled king. Especially there is no knight on f6, therefore take note of White's advanced and ousting pawn on e5, which makes sacrifices like this more likely.

If the knight is replaced by a bishop, then the newly formed gang has other ways to cause trouble. Typically both bishops are sacrificed to open lines against the king and then the queen invites a rook to finish off the king now that he has been stripped of his protection. In Miles - Browne, Lucerne (ol) 1 982, Browne missed two chances to swap bishops on e4. Perhaps time-trouble addict Browne was already suffering from his usual problem, as otherwise he would never have missed this standard mating pattern. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 a b c e L.Bxh7t i>xh7 2.WhSt i>g8 3 . .Bxg7 i>xg7

Although it is a well-known method, it catches players of all levels, although naturally more often in amateur chess than in the higher echelons. The final section in this extravaganza of mating patterns is the rook on the seven th rank. Here it is not the pawn gobbling monster that you should fear, but its ability to restrain the king to the back rank and to aid other pieces to give mate. Here is an example by Petrosian who, quite undeservedly, is not remembered for his tactical brilliance. In this game he was playing against Gipslis in Riga 1 95 8, and after his opponent had weakened his king's position the future World Champion struck with precision. If it were not for the f7-pawn, a rook on the seventh would rule over this rank. Without much further ado, Petrosian changed that:

Often there is a sacrifice against the rook's pawn prior to the mate. 1 ) This frequently employed pattern is often executed along the h- or a-files. The position of the knight is typical.

A possible sacrifice of the two bishops against the castled position. Every piece or pawn aiming at the king should be regarded as having the potential to give mate. Place your pieces actively and try to 2) Standard position of the bishop in this control squares around the king. Then mate, pattern. in whatever form, will crown many of your games. Mate Summary The knowledge of mating patterns is a good compass when visualizing a possible attack against the king. However it is equally important to bear in mind the control of the squares around the king, and look for the forces needed without sticking to patterns in a stereotypical way. A detected mating pattern or a possibility of mate should not be taken lightly. The pattern often becomes a reality earlier than the defending player might have calculated. In this case, miscalculations result in mate. Consider leaving flight squares for your king. Of course, weakening the kingside by h3 or . . .h6 is often unnecessary or even downright bad in a castled position. Nevertheless, when the middlegame shows no more danger of an attack, it sometimes is a good idea to lose a tern po to prevent any later accidents on the back rank. Mating attacks and patterns with their strong and clear targets represent a good way of how to think in chess. These strong motifs represent the ideas from which you should start your thinking and calculating process. You should start from a target, an idea, and then find a way to realize it. 1 4 1 Chapter 8 Gain of Tempo/Intermediate Move Napoleon once pointed out that "From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step." In chess, we call this step a tempo. We talk about a gain of tempo if one player moves a piece and the other player has to respond to this particular move and is not free to move another piece at will. It looks as if one player has gained the right to move twice in a row. A gain of tempo, small as it seems, can have drastic consequences as we have seen in previous chapters. Sometimes it is possible to gain the tempo for a second piece and then this piece might start a tactical operation such as a discovered or double attack. In this chapter we will study three different aspects of the gain of tempo. We will examine: 1 . The gain of tempo in general
2. The gain of tempo against the king
3. The intermediate move
1. The gain of tempo in general
Whenever you want to move a piece you should check whether you could gain a tempo with that piece. This sounds a little cumbersome and you may argue that you will waste a lot of time if you do this on every move. On the other hand, looking for a gain of tempo will soon become second nature to you and after a while you will not be thinking about it consciously any more. If you are planning to relocate a piece, there are two points where you can gain a tempo: either the piece gains the tempo on the way to its target square or right on the target square. The following example illustrates this rather nicely. Black can win in various ways, but the simplest is to gain a tempo: Urankar - Radie Germany 1 980
8 T
[diagram]
1 ..J�f4t The rook's real target is the f5-pawn, but first Black sets up a gain of tempo. The white king has to move. If White plays 2.@h5 then 2 ...�xf5t gains a tempo. Or if White plays
2.@h3 then 2 ...�xf5 would also gain a tempo,
as Black threatens mate next move. 1 44 Chess Tactics from Scratch We have to keep in mind that on every square we put one of our pieces, we might either gain a tempo with the piece that has been moved or for other pieces of our army. This is exemplified in Hort - Portisch, Madrid 1 973: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
L�g4t fxg4 2.�gst i>hs 3.�h6 We have now reached the following position:
8 T
[diagram]
If the queen had moved to h6 directly from f6, the king would still be defending the rook and Black could have played . . . f7-f5, blocking the diagonal of the d3-bishop. But the short stopover on g5 changed the position radically and now mate is inevitable. There are many positions and phases in the game in which you can gain a tempo. Sometimes you feel a desperate need to gain a tempo, in other situations you are surprised by a gain of tempo by your opponent. But if you develop a feeling for the tempo in small tactical operations, you might also be aware of the power of that little extra time when it comes to taking strategic decisions. The next diagram shows a razor-sharp position from a clash between Spassky and Korchnoi,
USSR 1 95 5 .

[diagram]
White urgently needs more time (a gain of tempo) in order to defend against the threat of mate after a rook sac on h3. And he gained this time with an ingenious move:
1.�h2!!
l . .White not only wins time, but also the gan1e. .�xh2 would give White the opportunity to promote his pawn with 2.e8=W'. 1-0 Now, as there are no more tempos to win against the white king, the black king is exposed to a short, but lethal, attack by the newly arrived white queen. This time Black's lack of tempo prevents the black pieces from helping the endangered king. Gain of Tempo/Intermediate Move 145 This example leads us to another important conclusion: You can effectively gain time by stopping your opponent from gaining tempos against your pieces. So the sacrifice of White's old queen destroyed all Black's hopes of winning further tempos against White's king and therefore bought the time to promote the pawn, creating a new queen and the possibility to win tempos against the black king. In our next example it is just one tempo that decided the game. In de la Bourdonnais - McDonnell, London (2 1 ) 1 834:
8 T
[diagram]
Black has to defend against the threat of mate down the g-file. After that, all he has to do is find a way to check the white king, so he played: 1 ... �g6?! An interesting idea, but it actually loses. Better is l . . .�f6!, which wins.
2.hxg6 �el t 3.�xel??
The clever 3. ttJ b 1 ! won convincingly, but the temptation of grabbing the queen proved too great. 3 ...�xel t 4.�xel tl)xel
[diagram]
Now White has only a few spite checks before . . . ttJc2 mate. 0-1 There are many possible motifs we could study in connection with the gain of tempo, but let's stay with cutting the lines of communication and take a look at Zilberstein - Dementiev, Grozny 1 968 . 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6
[diagram]
White needs just one tempo to clear f6 for his queen. I.tl)e8! White cuts the line of communication between the rooks and threatens 2.'Rxf8 mate.
146 Chess Tactics from Scratch
If Black re-establishes communications by taking on e8 with either rook then 2.�f6t will lead to mate. Or if Black tries 1 . . . c;t>g8 then
2. tlJxc7 is deadly.
1-0 By the way, 1 .tlJd7? would not have done the trick, because of l. .. ttJd5! when White has nothing better than 2.�xf8t �xf8 3.ttJxb6 ttJ xb6 4. c;t>xg2 c3 with an unclear ending. Evacuating a square in connection with a gain of tempo to enable another piece to occupy this square can be compared to a discovered attack. Simply moving a piece to another square and then replacing it for a winning motif is not very interesting to look at. Things change, though, when the piece that is evacuating a square supports the motif of its successor on this square, as we can see in Radovici - Kolarov, Romania 1 957:
[diagram]
1 ..J �h5!! 2 . .Bxh5 g5 3.cixe8 Rxe8 0-1 The black rook cleared the square for the pawn that will trap the white queen. At the same time the e8-rook was replaced by the black queen and consequently h5 is no longer an option for the white queen. In the next example the black king is in the middle of the board, but it is not time for the endgame yet. In Opocensky - Hromadka, Kosice 1 93 1 , White restricts Black's king and finally gives mate. After seeing the solution, you may argue that breaking up an en passant possibility is a structural change rather than a gain of tempo. I am inclined to agree. Evacuating a square is not a motif in itself but is about winning a tempo for a subsequent motif. The knight will perform the tempo theme here. In this position tempos are gained in order to execute a motif, a mate. Even if I am completely wrong, you will at least enjoy a pretty combination:
[diagram]
1.�xd5t cxd5
The sixth rank is opened for the a6-rook cutting off all the king's backward escape routes.
2.tild.3t
Evacuating the f4-square for the white f-pawn with a tempo while simultaneously eliminating the black e-pawn with its en passant possibility . . .exf3. White will therefore be able to play 3.f4 mate. 1-0 You are already quite familiar with Miles - Martin, Birmingham 1 977 (pages 54 & 95), but the gain of tempo here shows very clearly how tactical operations {motifs) are often introduced with a gain of tempo: Gain of Tempo/Intermediate Move 1 47 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

[diagram]
1.a4!
The move order can be decisive when we consider the gain of tempo. The next position is similar to Capablanca - Reti, London 1 922, where I placed the black rooks differently for instructive purposes. This is how a gain of tempo influences positional play.
[diagram]
1.�acl ! �b8
And only now:
2.d5
With 1 .d5 White would have closed the diagonal of the c4-bishop and rendered a discovered attack by the bishop against the black queen and king impossible, failed to gain a tempo for the development of the a l -rook, and would have allowed Black to develop the a8-rook to c8 without the awkward placement of the black queen on b8. The gain of tempo against the king A gain of tempo against the king means giving check so the piece that is giving check can move a second time. Again, it looks as if you are allowed to move twice in a row. In the course of a combination this check can come at any stage. If it is somewhere in the middle of the sequence we call it an intermediate move, and this will be dealt with a little later. With a few rare exceptions, tactical chess is always connected with a gain of tempo, as we want to be able to move again and again without allowing our opponent a moment's peace. Therefore the king is a great target when it comes to planning tactical operations. Here are some things you should remember about the king in connection with the gain of tempo: • The gain of tempo against the king permits putting pieces on squares they could normally only have reached in two moves. This even turns a knight into a long-range piece. • Suddenly you are able to control squares you would not have been able to control without the gain of tempo against the king. • A gain of material and tempo can be combined if we take another piece while giving check. • Sometimes one tempo is enough to escape an otherwise indestructible mating net. • If you promote a pawn with check in an endgame, this one tempo often proves decisive as the other player could be losing a crucial move in a pawn race.

Mag 1 48 Chess Tactics from Scratch Let us take a look at a few examples. Transferring a piece to another square using a check does not need special explanation. But keep this situation in mind when you are analysing your opponent's possibilities. Let's have a simple example of what we are talking about: Nimzowitsch - Capablanca St Petersburg 1 9 1 4
8 T
[diagram]
Black wants to transfer his queen to c5 . From there it would exert pressure down the c-file and also keep an eye on the a7-pawn. So you could play 1 . . .W c5 but there is a better way to get there. 1 . •• YNhSt 2.Qgl ¥Nest Black has transferred his queen to c5 without any loss of time and after
3.Qh2 d5
White resigned a couple of moves later. Quite often this transfer with gain of tempo is not so obvious when it is connected with other tactical motifs. We have seen this in Malevinsky - Gefenas, in the chapter on mating patterns, page 1 28.
[diagram]
1 . •• �xh2t Black is able to gain more tempos and transfer the queen to the kingside where it will join the remaining rook to give mate. The transfer route of the queen is . . . 'Qc6- c2-h7. During this journey the queen gains a tempo on c2, because this is a check against the king on h2. Here the technique of gaining a tempo against the king is part of a mating combination. Botvinnik created another fine example as Black against Bondarevsky in the following game played in the USSR in 1 94 1 . 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

With mate next move. Of course, White's position was calamitous right from the Gain ofTempo/lntermediate Move 1 49 start of the operation, and Botvinnik could have played 1 . . .�xh3 as the first move of this combination. Nevertheless, playing it as a second move, gaining a tempo towards an uninterrupted combination, was more precise, as now the sacrifice could no longer be declined. 0-1 You might argue that the gain of tempo in the last example was rather irrelevant but the next game graphically illustrates that the move order is often crucial for success. In Petursson - Short, Reykjavik 1 987, Black continued accurately with:
[diagram]
1.• •�h1 t 2.@n �xf4t
If you changed the move order with 1 ...�xf4 it would allow the counter strike 2.�xg7t! �f8! with a very complicated position. Short's move order gave the whole sequence a forcing character and left no way out for White. Botvinnik and Short's move orders are the no-nonsense approach to tactics, not allowing any hope for their opponents. The gain of tempo within a combination helps to create a forcing sequence of moves. In the game White was not given the chance to play 2.�xg7t and lost a few moves later:
3.gxf4 �xh2t 4.@el �g3t s.@e2 .Bc4t
6.@dl �d3t
White resigned. Here is a simple example from Maxim Bloch's Combination Art in which White gains a tempo against the black king. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

The knight wins the pawn with check. Thus White makes sure he does not lose the right to move. He takes the pawn first and then, on his next move, the knight:

We saw another example of the importance of move order in the game Donner - Huebner on page 32.

Black wins because the c l -rook can be taken with gain of tempo. Black takes the rook first: 2 ...�xcl t And only then plays:

Of course, the other way round would have lost Black the game. It is the tactical wizard Tal who shows the tricks of the trade in Tai - Lutikov, Tallinn 1 964. 8 �

Black has grabbed a pawn on a2 and now he takes the rook, reckoning that he might hang on in the endgame.

We have seen in the previous example how many tempos can be gained against the king. However, sometimes losing only one tempo is like missing the decisive penalty kick in a football match. And sometimes the tempo gained by a check is the only path to safety, as this adaptation of the game Medina - Sanz, Olot 1 975, shows. In order to keep the beautiful mate while underlining the need to find a saving tempo, I have added the rook on a8 to the original position. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

Gain of Tempo/Intermediate Move 1 5 1 We know there is symmetry in chess, so it is not only the gain of a ternpo against the king that can lead to the downfall of a proud kingdom, the loss of a tempo can have the same disastrous effect.

White gained a tempo and Black lost it and with it the game. 1-0 Capablanca, although better known as a strategist rather than a deadly tactician, was superb in deal ing with elementary tactics. A thorough study of Capablanca 's games will teach the reader a great deal about the subjects you wi ll encounter in this book. Obviously you have to protect your king against a gain of tempo by your opponent. If you fail to pay attention to this issue you might ruin the work of a whole, long game within a second. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Capablanca - Alekhine St Petersburg 1 9 1 4
[diagram]
In this position Capablanca played: I.'iMeS! This wins much more easily than 1 .Rf6 would have. A queen exchange is the only remedy to save the black king from mate. 1 .Re5 prevents 1 . . .Rd6 coming with a check and a tempo, as White blocks the diagonal to his king. Black had to give up another pawn first by playing: 1 ... £6 In order to exchange queens after:
2.'iMxf6 'iMd6t
He resigned two moves later. Capablanca, although better known as a strategist rather than a deadly tactician, was superb in dealing with elementary tactics. Therefore, a thorough study of Capablanca's games will teach the reader a great deal about the subjects you will encounter in this book. In Capablanca's smooth positional style you will also discover why some tactics just don't work against players of his class. Their pieces always work together harmoniously. 1 52 Chess Tactics from Scratch Without "loose ends" (like undeveloped and If, from the first diagram, Black tries another undefended pieces) there is unlikely to be any plan, he will not survive either: tactical misfortune. When it comes to an endgame, a tempo often decides the game. So the result of an 80-move struggle might be decided by the smallest difference in timing. 8 6 4 3 2 1 Grigoriev 1929

Black loses his queen. There are many endgame studies where promoting with check is the key to the solution, and gaining or sometimes losing a tempo (triangulation) is often the clue to "solving in style". When it comes to an endgame, a tempo often decides the ga me. The result of an 80- move struggle might be decided by the smallest difference i n timing. Gain of Tempo/Intermediate Move 1 53 Here is an example of a promotion during a middlegame. The following position from Baseler - H. Mueller, London 1 962, looks rather complicated. But looking beyond the circumstances of the current position will help you to find the solution.

If we could get rid of the f5-bishop and the white king, the pawn would promote. As the pawn would promote with check if the king were somewhere nearby, we could afford to sacrifice heavily to make this happen. And there you have it:

Another common use of the tempo against the king is the situation when the pawns defending the king have been attacked and the king is exposed to the enemy pieces. Sometimes entire pawn chains are pulverized this way as Filipowicz - Ujtelky, Budapest 1 976, shows. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 All of White's last moves came with tempo .. . When the opposing king is attacked with tempo, it is sometimes possible for the attacker to sac one piece after another to finish off the king. abode abode f g h Gain of Tempo/Intermediate Move 1 5 5 So what have we learned so far about the gain of tempo against the king: 1 . Be on the lookout for enemy pieces that might change their location with check
2. A gain of tempo against the king practically
enables the attacker to move twice
3. If you can gain a tempo against the king,
look for possible elementary motifs on the new square of the checking piece
4. A gain of tempo might unpin pinned pieces,
if the target of the pin is not your king
5. A gain of tempo might be the last resort in a
desperate position The intermediate move What exactly is an intermediate move? An intermediate move is a move that is inserted into a seemingly forced sequence of moves. The intermediate move is not the main move of the sequence and it is not the final move that is finishing the sequence. So why bother with it? Because the intermediate move can change the tactical situation on the board: the intermediate move can create a follow-up motif or prevent a follow-up motif, or the intermediate move can guarantee an uninterrupted series of moves. If the intermediate move is a check then it interrupts the opponent's tactical operations, and this is why the intermediate move often comes as a surpnse. The trick is to start a sequence of moves, then insert a move in-between that gains a tempo, so that the initial operation can be finished without losing the initiative. Before we all get lost in definitions, let's take a look at a position and everything will be clearer. A common motif in a series of exchanges is an in-between capture of a piece with tempo before restoring the material balance. This motif plays a role in the following opening analysis of the Sicilian Dragon.
[diagram]
It looks as if White will win a piece. But after: 1 .. . Y;Ya5 2.i.xf6 Black does not take back immediately but plays the intermediate move: 2 ... i.f5!? If:
3.hg7 Y;Yxa2
Then Black wins time with the threat of 4 .. . Wa l mate, and as White's queen also has to protect c2 against mate, White will either lose his queen or his king. An even more effective, but less pretty, variation is 2 . . . �a3t 3.�b l with another intermediate move: 3 . . . ile6! An i ntermediate move is a move that is inserted i nto a seemingly forced sequence of moves. In the previous example a piece was saved that seemed lost. In the next example, constructed by Maxim Bloch, we see a different kind of save. 1 56 Chess Tactics from Scratch

[diagram]
Black would love to play 1 ... :R:xe3 but after an exchange of queens, this seems to leave the e8-rook hanging. How can the rook be saved? Maybe with the help of an intermediate move? Yes, help is on the way: 1. •• �xe3 2.�xf3 And now an intermediate move solves all the problems: 2 ...�c8t! 3.@bl �xf3 Black has won a piece. Black just postponed the main move, . . . :R:xf3, until after the other rook was out of trouble. Postponing retaking is not the only use of the intermediate move in combinations. Sometimes a combination only works because somewhere on the way to the final position the attacker gains a tempo with an intermediate move. This gain of tempo often comes as a surprise; therefore a combination with an intermediate move is harder to spot and defend against. But the most stunning feature of the intermediate move is that it allows a combination to start before certain obstacles have been removed and before creating any weaknesses in the opponent's position. Sounds incredible? Well, have a look at Rossetto - Sherwin, Portoroz lnterzonal 1 958:
[diagram]
1. •• �bl 2.�xd6 f3t If Black had started the combination with 1 . . .f3 t, creating the target by drawing the king to f3, it would not have worked. White would have found time (and the e3-square for his rook) to defend against . . . :R:b 1 with :R:e3. But now the b3-bishop is taken with check. The next example is an altered version of Vladimirov - Kharitonov, USSR 1 977, where the bishop on g6 was a pawn in the original example!

1 58 Chess Tactics from Scratch And in the game this worked. But bringing the h I -rook into play should have been too slow if Black had found the best defence. It is true that in this complex position Black's queen does not have many good retreating squares. Perhaps that is why Tal, who never wanted to play a dull game, went for 5 .�he 1 . But if Black had found the correct squares for his queen, Tal surely would not have enjoyed the uphill struggle after 5 . . . 1Wa5!.

So sometimes even world champions can go wrong with intermediate moves, but they definitely consider intermediate moves at all times. So don't forget intermediate moves, and try to make use of them in your games! Vt QD Vi KI L_F| " Gain of Tempo/Intermediate Move Summary Whenever you want to move a piece you should check whether you can gain a tempo with that piece. You can also gain time by stopping your opponent from gaining tempos against your pieces. Tactical operations (motifs) are often introduced with a gain of tempo. A gain of tempo against the king permits putting pieces on squares they could normally only have reached in two moves. This even turns a knight into a long-range piece. It becomes possible to control squares that were out of reach without the gain of tern po against the king. A gain of tempo within a combination helps to create a forcing sequence of moves. An intermediate move allows a combination to start before certain obstacles have been removed and before creating any weaknesses in the opponent's position. 1 59 Chapter 9 The X-ray Attack In an X-ray attack one of the pieces controlling a square is exercising this control indirectly, all the way through an enemy piece. This sounds almost incredible, defying the laws of chess physics, but a look at the next diagram will help explain the concept. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 either two rooks or a rook and a queen, or on a diagonal by bishop and queen, as the next two diagrams illustrate.

White can play 1 .E!f8t because f8 is already defended by the white queen, although the black queen seems to block this control. This is the important thing to remember with the X-ray attack. Although it does not look like it, effectively the attacking side is controlling the key square more often than the defending side. The enemy piece finds itself sandwiched between two attackers. There are two different types of X-ray attack. The first can only be performed by the long range pieces. In the first type the attacking pieces share a connection, that is, they move in the same direction. This can be achieved by 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

Again the attacker is reloading on a square he hits more times than the defender. The value of the reloading piece is not important ("3 points") ; it is its performance that matters. In a way the X - ray attack is a special case of the reloader: one piece is sacrificed on a certain square and the second occupies it after the first has been eliminated. 1 64 Chess Tactics from Scratch As with all other tactical motifs, the X-ray attack can be combined in many ways. For example, pins and interrupting lines of communication as in Tukmakov - Gufeld, USSR 1 972, with Black to move:

2.<j;>h 1 would run into 2 . . .�e l t and the X-ray
attack is a prelude to mate. So instead the white king has to go to fl and turn itself into the target of a pin by the black queen on the d3-rook: There can be an overlap between an X - ray and a discovered attack. If we have a potential discovered attack, then the attacking piece could be said to have an X - ray influence through the piece that may move away.

Cutting off another line. 0-1 Remember that the d3-rook is not defended by its colleague on d 1 , as this rook is also pinned against the king. 3.lt:Jxe3 Rxd3t would not help White. Summary • In an X-ray attack the piece controlling a square exercises this control indirectly, all the way through an enemy piece. • In some cases the X-ray attack can look like a special case of the reloader: one piece is sacrificed on a certain square and the second occupies it after the first has been eliminated. The only difference is the sandwich position of the defender in the X-ray attack. • As with all other tactical motifs, the X-ray attack can be combined in many ways. • As we shall see in the puzzle section, there can be an overlap between an X-ray and a discovered attack. If we have a potential discovered attack, then the attacking piece could be said to have an X-ray influence through the piece that may move away. Chapter 10 Opening and Closing Lines of Communication The first diagram shows no line of communication between the pieces. In the second diagram a line of communication exists as the rook defends the bishop. If both pieces move in the same way we can say that there is a two-way communication: The tactician is interested in these lines of communication as they can be opened or closed and this might be crucial for the success of a combination. As a simple example, the next diagram shows the final position of a combination that would have been reached in Pogrebissky - Levenfish, USSR 1 939, if Black had not resigned two moves earlier! 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6. a b c e f g h With 1.�e3 the knight opens a line of communication with the d l -rook. Thus White eliminates the pin and holds on to his material advantage. Let's have another look at the game Krogius - Sergievsky, USSR 1 959. A line of communication is advantageously established between two pieces of different movements.

Opening and Closing Lines of Communication 1 69 Therefore, you should check whether a piece that is performing a significant role can be lured away from its initial square in order to cut it off by interrupting its line of communication with the initial square. If the king is involved the interruption may be achieved with tempo. If the king is the interrupting piece, it usually inflicts enormous damage on its own side. With 1.�g8t the queen forces the king to the seventh rank, cutting the line of communication between the black rook and queen. In M. Pytel - Mathis, Zurich 1 989, we see an interruption of the line of communication. The interrupting piece occupies its new square with tempo. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6. a c e I.cie5 Cutting off the queen from the defence of the f5-pawn. 1 ... O-O 2.cixf5 ! White gains another tempo through the discovered attack on the queen by the d l -rook. Again you can see how two motifs are put together in one combination. Sometimes it is possible to interrupt the line of communication on a square that seems well defended by a piece. When the defender has more important tasks to perform it is often unable to reopen the line of communication by itself. Chigorin - Davidov St Petersburg 1 87 4 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.

Consequently, this piece's control over a line or diagonal can very easily be cut off. All the pieces behind the point of interruption lose their defence. If there is not enough time to move away, they are lost. The next diagram shows this quite well. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.

Before the black knight appeared on d3, the d4-knight was defended twice. Now that the line of communication has been interrupted it is no longer defended. And, as the interrupting piece moved in with tempo, there is no time to move the d4-knight. Taking on d3 with the queen would be a fine solution, except the g5- bishop would be abandoned. The next position shows a similar dilemma for the defender: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.

Chapter 1 1 Status Examination A few preliminary thoughts about status examination Consider the game Borisenkov - Mezenev,
USSR 1 950:
8 T
[diagram]
At first glance it looks as if this position is winning for White. Both sides of the board seem to be under his control. The white king has a firm grip on the black bishop, and the rook might sacrifice itself (using a check on the f-file) for the f-pawn if it advances, then White could win by pushing the h-pawn. The only way to deal with the rook check would be to put a piece between the king and the rook when it turns up on f8. But if the bishop moves it is taken. The prospects look rather grim for Black. The frustrating word zugzwang must ring in Black's ears. If he moves his king, then White's h-pawn will queen. For example: 1 . . .�e3 2.h4 �f4 3.E!:xf3t! and even if Black tries to be clever and goes after the pawn with 3 ...�g4 instead of 3 . . .�xf3, White answers: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
4.E!:h3!

Again offering the rook while saving the pawn. Black would lose because of zugzwang as the black king can only temporarily block the white pawn. The individual elements of this analysis may be correct, but there is a crucial point missing: the interaction of the two sides of the board.

This is a good example that understanding all the individual elements of a position does not necessarily mean understanding the whole position. After you have learned about the elements of tactics, you need a method that will enable you to analyse a position as a whole. Otherwise you might arrive at faulty conclusions, as in the initial analysis of the position above. This method has to be easy to understand and it also has to be easily applicable. Above all, the method should not turn into a tyrant. If it required you to go through every step every time it was your move, you would not use it. If you tried, you would lose on time. On the other hand it makes sense to have some kind of checklist, in the same way pilots do. You cannot take back moves on the board. Decisions are final in chess. It is a bit like flying a plane where every mistake could be the last. Nevertheless, there must be a safe way for pilots as every day thousands of planes fly around our globe, landing safely at their destinations. The status examination provides you with similar checklists. Advanced players might not need any of these checklists. Nevertheless, they will still benefit from reading through this chapter, as some of the points made will deepen their understanding of tactics. Initially weaker players will benefit from these checklists as they help them to become aware of and avoid blunders and oversights. But they should abandon checklists whenever they feel they have become useless routines. The points dealt with in this chapter will hopefully turn you into a high-flying chess player instead of an accident-prone wood- pusher. . Status Examination The status examination does exactly what its name says: it takes a close look at the status of each piece on the board. Principally, you have to look at two things with each piece. First, you have to find out its current status: whether it is attacked, defended, hanging, pinned, etc. Then you have to see this piece as an element of a picture, which is related to other elements. Ask yourself how the status of this piece changes the status of other pieces. If you find out, for example, that a knight is pinned against your king, the status of the knight is absolutely pinned. The king cannot be exposed to an attack. Consequently, the status of all other pieces that were formerly defended by the knight is affected. If they were only defended by this knight, they are now en prise if they are attacked. Status Examination 1 79 The basics of the status examination Im partial stocktaking is what the status examination is about. Neither ideas about the original tactical value and dynamic potential of a piece, nor any premature strategic conclusions about a position, should stop you from going through the basic status examination. Assessing the pieces' status dispassionately before you move is necessary. You should do it for the situation before and after the move as a change of position by one piece might alter the whole situation. And here Orwell does not apply: all pieces are equally important. Do not be fooled by jumping to any instant conclusions. For exam pie, looking at the board, you discover you could win a pawn but your opponent would get some strategic compensation for it. Without further ado you calculate the operation and execute it; after all, you do not want to end up in time trouble. Yet continuing the status examination of the position, you might have noticed the possibility for an even more profitable continuation. So before you move you should look at the following: 1 . What is the status of each piece? (Is it defended, does it have duties to perform, restricted movement, etc.) What is the new status of the piece if moved to its new square? Does it have a retreating square and, equally importantly, how has it changed the status of all other pieces connected with it?
2. Which squares can be occupied? Here
you have to check for direct occupation and indirect occupation. Remember, sometimes a square only seems to be defended.
3. Are there further connections of pieces and
squares in more complex positions? The status examination is not about restraining intuition. The status examination is a safety device for your intuition. Let's start with a simple example. Take a look at a position arising after:
1.e4 e5 2.tLlf3 tLlc6 3.�b5 a6 4.�xc6 dxc6
5.O-O f6 6.d4 exd4 7.tLlxd4
8 T
[diagram]
This is a normal opening position where 7 • • •�c5? is not an option due to 8.YMhSt. You can either find this when looking at the black king (always consider possible checks) or the white queen. A seasoned competitor will automatically become aware of these things in a split second, but for many amateurs it does no harm to gain the same information a few times during the process of calculation. In any case, many of these things will eventually become routine, but first we need to work methodically on what will become automatic later. Status examination does exactly what its name says: it takes a close look at the status of each piece on the board. 1 80 Chess Tactics from Scratch The status of a piece It may sound a little banal but it remains true anyway: start your analysis of a position looking at the status of each piece. If you do not know the status of each piece, you are flying your jet with your eyes closed, and who would like a pilot to do this? Yet even the famously careful and prophylactic Tigran Petrosian sometimes forgot about this, as you can see in the next diagram: Petrosian - Bronstein Amsterdam 1 956 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6
[diagram]
Petrosian played 1. tLl g5??. This shows that even the greatest players sometimes need to run a systematic basic check-up before they make a move. Perhaps Petrosian was so preoccupied with positional questions that he forgot about the basics. And if you can learn something from a world champion here, it is that relying on a rough estimate will give you a rough ride. You should start your analysis of each piece by looking at its current situation. When you are clear about the status you can go deeper into the position. Loboda - Pankevich

Furthermore, you will notice that it shares a diagonal with the black king and of course you remember that two pieces in a row constitutes the precondition for a pin. Just this information would have been enough to start you looking for a possible combination to exploit the results of the status examination of the c5-rook. Start your analysis of a position by looking at the status of each p iece. When you are clear about the status you can go deeper into the position. Status Examination 1 8 1 The previous example was a fairly trivial combination, but much more complex operations might be triggered by simply looking at the status of each piece as Sax - Jansa, Yugoslavia 1 982, shows. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6
[diagram]
The result of the status examination of the d7-bishop should be that it would be attacked if the d-file opened. The status examination of its defenders (marked with circles) shows that they can be eliminated. The outstanding tactician and Olympiad gold medallist Gyula Sax (I really enjoyed training with him a few times) therefore played:
1.e5! dxe5?
Black had to grovel with l . . . ttJe8, but he probably thought he had it all under control.

There is no escape. If 3 . . . ttJ dS then 4.ixdS exdS 5 .ttJxdS Rd8 6.4J f6t! triggers a deadly attack. In this line if Black tries 5 . . .Wb 7 then White has an even quicker win with 6.ttJaS! ltJxaS 7.ttJxe7t <i>h? 8.Rh4 mate: a familiar mating pattern.

The four queens on the board should not distract you from spotting that the status of the e4-sq uare is undefended, as both the f6- knight (defending g8) and the g6-queen (defending g7) are bound to the defence of the king. Therefore: Lie4! This wins as the bishop will take out one of the king's bodyguards. Black has a clever try to confuse the issue. 1 .. .�hl t!? 2.<i>xhl! The only winning move.
2.ixh l leads to equality after 2 .. .

6.�xe6t is easy (while after 5 .Rd8?? 4J d5!
Black would collect an undeserved point) . There is no doubt that the duties certain pieces have to perform are important for the status examination and possible combinations based on it. Here are some useful questions to ask when it comes to this subject: Is it possible to place another duty on the shoulders of a piece that is already occupied with other important matters? 1 82 Chess Tactics from Scratch In Ratner - Podgorny, Moscow 1 946, White asked himself this question and came up with the following answer: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 �

1.�b2!
If the queen takes on b2, White simply plays 2.�xh6t. And 1 . . .Rg6 runs into 2.i.h5. Therefore .. . 1-0 The status examination of the g7-bishop shows that it has to take back on h6 in order to defend the king. The bishop is unable to defend both the h-pawn and the queen, so the queen is lost. Consequently one answer to our question is: you can overload the defender of one square by giving it another square to defend. Forcing the queen to the b2-square was simply based on the status of the g7- bishop. Another useful question is: Are there any duties that interfere with each other? Can I attack the defender so it is no longer able to perform its task and from which squares can the defender do its duty? Take a look at the game Romanishin - Plaskett, London 1 977:
[diagram]
The status examination of this position should deliver the following results: • The black queen has to defend the f6- knight. If Black loses the knight, he will be mated. • The f6-knight is blocking White's path to the g7-bishop and thus preventing mate. • The g7-bishop is pinned by the white queen against the king and cannot recapture on f6 as long as it is still pinned. • The d7-pawn is undefended as all its defenders are occupied with other important duties. The d7-pawn is attacked by the d I -rook. Taking a look at the list, you will easily see that White can snatch the d7-pawn with

1 .:gd6 does not work because after 1 . . .�xd6 Black no longer fears a check on d5 as . . .�f8- d6 has given the black king a new flight square. After the text move Black cannot take the rook with his bishop or the knight, as this would interrupt the line of communication between the queen and the f7-square. But if the queen takes the rook then 2.Rxd5t leads to mate. If you look even more deeply into a defending piece's position you could also analyse the tactical motifs for other pieces if they took the defender on that square.
[diagram]
1.. .�b6 2.fic7 �bc8
The white queen defending the f7-rook was attacked and had to move to a square where she still defends the rook. There she ran into a pin against the c2-rook. Black is winning. Hence, if you are attacked, examine carefully the flight squares of your defending pieces as well. Consider flight squares as being of the same importance as initial squares. Ifyou see a piece performing a duty you should analyse the status of that piece carefully. Every defender is a possible tactical target. You have to take a close look at the changes of the position of any defender after each move. Another useful consideration is what happens if the defender has to recapture after the piece it was defending is captured? If you see a piece performing a duty you should analyse the status of that piece careful ly. Every defender is a possible tactica l target. 1 84 Chess Tactics from Scratch Balashov - Spragg ett The status examination of the e3-bishop revealed the motif of a pin against the king so Taxco lnterzonal 1 985 the motif would naturally apply for the queen 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.

The answer is:

as well. Accordingly, a square or a defended piece must always be analysed together with the defender. Here are a few more examples of what can be discovered by taking a closer look at your pieces. Sometimes just looking in the direction your pieces move may give you some ideas about tactics as in Safuta - Maletzky, Poland 1 964:
[diagram]
As you probably learned during your first encounter with chess, the queen is able to move both vertically and horizontally. But the key word for this position is diagonally. Thus the following combination is not really difficult to find: 1 .�xc6 bxc6 2.'Rb8t @g7 3.�xh7t @f6
4.'Rf4 mate
This diagonal was too beautiful to miss. Sometimes just looking in the direction your pieces (T1ove may give you some ideas about tactics. Status Examination 1 85 Sturua - Kozlov de Riviere - Morphy USSR 1 975 Paris (match) 1 863 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.

Looking down the g-file may have started devious ideas in White's mind:
1.�g8t!
1-0 The status examination for the c8-rook shows that it is bound to the defence of the black queen. Unfortunately, the poor rook also has to keep an eye on g8 as the following status examination for other pieces and squares reveals. The status examination for the g7 - square will tell you that it is a possible mating square for the white queen. Thus the king on g8 would run into a deadly tempo by Rg3t. You would also have discovered this if you had started your status examination with the position of the black king, especially as you already know that not only the king's position but also the squares around him are of crucial importance (in this example: the possibility of gaining a tempo on g8) . A simple method to find neat tactics is to count how many times a point is attacked and how many times it is defended .. .

White resigned. Black's simple plan is . . . !!g6 and there is no reasonable way to stop it. 4- 1 86 Chess Tactics from Scratch One important feature of the status examination is to consider the both the value of a piece (say, a valuable rook or a mere pawn) and also its method of moving. Whereas moving backwards might be an important option for a rook, it is, of course, never an option for a pawn. The value of a piece also has consequences when, for example, it comes to a status examination of the king's position. So let's take a closer look at each piece in turn. The pawn Apart from the en passant rule, the status examination for the pawn is no different from other pieces. Yet the relatively low value of the pawn compared to the other pieces is of crucial importance in the event of a double attack. A pawn's fork always hurts. A key characteristic is the pawn's lust for expansion, as Nimzowitsch once called its desire to make it to the back rank, dreaming of promotion. The possibility of promoting should always be part of a pawn's status examination, and not only when it has reached the seventh rank as in Lobigas - Micheli, Skopje (ol) 1 972.
[diagram]
You may pity the g7-pawn. Undefended and desolate, it is opposing the enemy king. So far Black has missed three opportunities to eliminate the offending peasant. He will not get a fourth:
1.�xh5!
Black resigned because of 1 . . .gxh5 2.ih?t. So when you look at the status of advanced pawns always keep in mind the possibility of their promotion. The knight As we have already seen in the chapter on the double attack, the knight is a born double attacker. When you do a status examination for a knight, look for possible tactical bases and tactical targets in your own and your opponent's camp. And remember: with an extra tempo knights can suddenly turn into long-range pieces. Another knight speciality is the check it gives. You cannot put a piece in between, so after a knight check the king must move if the knight cannot be captured. If you combine all these simple facts about a knight, you may find something inspired in the following position: Ligterink - Pachman Amsterdam 1 994 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

One important feature of the status examination is to consider both the value of a piece and also its method of moving. The bishop The bishop is a long-range piece. Therefore it can control squares from far away and does not have to be where the action is. This is why the bishop is such a fine piece in an open position. Remember to examine every square on a bishop's diagonal when you do the status examination of this piece. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6

This is a little combination based on the motif of the pin. If Black invested a tempo in defending the knight, the bishop would simply take the knight and the pawns would become unstoppable. Euwe said that when
V
1 88 Chess Tactics from Scratch two connected pawns have no more than four moves combined for both to reach the back rank, a rook cannot stop them. This would be precisely the situation here. So if Black had tried: 2 • • • gc8 3 . .Bxd8 �xd8 4.b6 The pawns are too strong for the rook. The queen and the rooks The queen is the most powerful long-range piece, followed by the rooks. The high value of these pieces often turns them into targets for all kinds of tactical operations. Therefore you should always have an escape route open for the queen and rooks if things become too hot to handle. A boxed-in queen or rook very quickly becomes a target of lethal tactics. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Morphy - de Riviere Paris (match) 1 863 A status examination for the black queen shows that she is immobile. If she could be attacked from the g5-square by the f3-knight she would be lost. Therefore Morphy simply played: 1 . .Bxh6! The king The king is the most valuable piece on the board. Consequently your status examination for the king has to be flawless. However, the precision you will learn in doing the status examination for the king will also help you to become more precise for other pieces. As we have seen throughout the book, the king is the Number One tactical target. We have also seen that not only the king's current square is important but also the squares around the king. These are: 1 . Flight squares for the king
2. Squares next to the king
1. The flight squares
Start with simple check-ups. For the king, the simplest question to ask is which squares he could move to and whether these possible flight squares could be controlled. After all, this is what the game is about: controlling all the squares the king could possibly move to and then attacking him. As most arbiters know, mate ends the game. Looking for possible mating patterns is a good remedy against being caught by surprise. Luczynowicz - Szymanski Poland 1 953

1 .�xg6t In this case it is easy to find the sacrifice, as the king's restriction is evident at first glance. In most cases the opponent is not as co operative as in the last example. But with a little help from you, your opponent may have to change his king's position in a way he would not have done without your persuasion. A good question about the king is how additional squares can be taken away from him. Springer - Ebersbach Berlin 1 958 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.

Here we shall see a classic trick.

Black's king gained no additional squares after the captures on d7. The defending bishop was eliminated without opening any new escape routes.

To avoid giving the impression that this only happens in composed positions, here is one from real life ... This is Zotov - Glebov, USSR 1 975:

Block the pawns in front of the king so they cannot move and create escape routes. As an illustration let's take a look at Friedman - Thornblom, Stockholm 1 973. If you do a status examination for this position you will see a potential mate on g 1 . How would White be able to escape this? The only route is to play e3 and then run. So the only thing that remains is to stop e2-e3 at all costs.

Blocking the f-pawn restricted the black king's position, and prevented the possibility of opening up flight squares. Status Examination 1 93 Look at how many squares the king has available. A restricted king surrounded by enemy pieces should trigger the idea of a mating net. As we are occupied with beautiful pictures, here is another one from a correspondence game: Kilander - Ceki Correspondence 1 967

There is more than taking the pawn on e5! The white king is exposed to the attack of four black pieces. This formidable force would prove too strong if Black cut off the king's escape route from the battlefield. So .. . 1 . . . f6t! This is much stronger than the obvious but weak capture on e5. The idea that pops up when making the status examination of the white king is using a beautiful rook journey with e3-e5-h5-h3. In this box many squares are already under Black's control. After
2.Rxf6 we would have the following skeleton
position:
8 T
[diagram]
Notice Black's 'wall' f5, f4, f3, and f2, which the imprisoned white king will find impossible to climb (the crosses mark additional squares controlled by Black helping the rook to make stops along his journey for mate) . So the following variation is possible: 2 .. .�e5t 3.�h4 �h5t 4.�g3 �h3 mate. Just in case you were wondering: yes, the queen could have sacrificed herself but White's position would be hopeless. White's alternatives are 2.exf6 �e5t 3.�h4 �h5t 4.�g3 �h3 mate, and 2.�xf6 "only" losing the queen after 2 .. .�f2t. In most cases mating attacks run into tough resistance from the defender. As he is fighting for his life he is determined to find every resource. Hence, your examination of the king's position also has to take into account every square both your pieces and the defenders control. An experienced player's intuition will often tell him about possible mating nets. The less advanced player might pick up this idea by looking at how many squares a king has available. A restricted king surrounded by enemy pieces should trigger the idea of a mating net (in the next diagram: the white king and h-pawn already control adjacent squares and the rook and bishop are just waiting to join the action) . 1 94 Chess Tactics from Scratch Note how the increasingly restricted position of the king influences the other pieces in Ivanovic - San Segundo, New York 1 988. It's Black to play and at first his king seems to have little to worry about. However after a few more moves ...

White has sacrificed a pawn in order to take away squares from the king and so weave a mating net.
[diagram]
Rescuing the black bishop would spell mate after Bf3-e4. Notice how the a-pawn, far away from Black's king, was used in this manoeuvre. This should be a reminder that you have to analyse every piece, the whole board, before you embark on such an important operation as a mating attack. In reduced positions like this you have to exploit every resource at your command, otherwise your attack might not succeed. Strangely enough, sometimes the inability to move is the only chance of surviving an attack. Stalemate may be your opponent's last resort, and there is nothing more annoying than dropping half a point because you did not anticipate it. Consequently, stalemate has to be one of the items on the checklist when you are doing the status examination for the king, especially during the endgame. So if your status examination renders the result that the enemy king has no flight square it could be stalemate time. A classic example is Post - Nimzowitsch, Barmen 1 905.
[diagram]
Here Nimzowitsch played: 1 ... �b8! Forcing an immediate draw. In Zweig -Westin, Skopje (ol) 1 972, the black king is stalemated already. If he could get rid of all his pieces it would be a draw. Status Examination 1 95

1 ... �e2t 2.Qh3 gh3t! 3.�xb3 �h2t And a draw was agreed. The king can avoid capturing the rook when it checks on h2 and g2, but a check on f2 would exchange rook for queen and leave White with a rook pawn and the "wrong" bishop. Sometimes creating a stalemate requires cutting off your king's escape routes yourself. Here is an example where the trick is performed with a queen sacrifice. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Kaberel - Tipary Hungary 1 95 5

[diagram]
1. •• Y:Ycl t A double attack on king and queen. The new position of the white queen on c l creates an instant stalemate as the queen, moving vertically, horizontally and diagonally takes away all the flight squares of the black king. All these examples show that the player who is about to lose the endgame has one last option: stalemate. Therefore you should always look for this configuration. There is a little trick to see the stalemate more easily. Ask yourself which piece on which square would take away the final flight squares. And, with regard to the last example, remember that elementary tactics might even be employed on the last move of the game. Just like the opera, it is not over until the fat lady sings. 1 96 Chess Tactics from Scratch As we have already seen with the elementary tactical motifs, it helps to envision a specific target position. In Nismeev - Boltobekov, Correspondence 1 977, after Black found the initial idea (the black king has no squares with a white queen on g6), he also found a way to get rid of his remaining pieces:
[diagram]
l .. . '3xg6t 2.Y:Yxg6 ciflt 3.@xfl Y:Yxf4t Black draws with either perpetual check or stalemate. The following example shows that sometimes you have to try hard a little harder to force the stalemate. Pietzsch - Fuchs West Germany 1 963

The status examination for the white king shows that after:
1.• •
Y:Yc6t The only square he can move to is f5. Unfortunately, he runs into a fork by the knight, which has to be taken. But now Black's king has very few squares left .. . Black offers his last piece on g6 where either capture guarantees stalemate:
2.@f5 ttlg7t 3.cixg7 Y:Yg6t
The next and final example of this kind (composed by the author) nicely demonstrates that we continually have to consider this motif during our calculation process.
8 T
[diagram]
It looks as if Black is in total control of the position and that almost any move should win. In fact, there is only one winning move for Black! White's last chance in this position is stalemate. Black must continually apply the status examination of the white king for every position during his calculation. Strangely enough, this helps us to find the winning move easily. As always (!) we systematically analyse the possible options. Status Examination 1 97 They are: • a black king move • • a black rook move pushing the b3-pawn If the black king moves away from his f2-pawn, it will be lost. Hence only 1 ...�f3 makes sense. But the status examination for White's king after this move reveals it is stalemated. White simply has to get rid of his rook. After l . . .�f3? then 2.:B'.e3t! will result in stalemate or the direct loss of both the b-pawn and the f-pawn thereafter.
[diagram]
The black king blocks the only white flight square e2 from either f3 or e3. This makes
2.:B'.e3t possible.
Thus a king move will not win, so whatever you do, don't touch the king! Alternatively, if Black wants to move his rook, there are only two plausible squares: f4 or b4. Otherwise White will pick up the b-pawn after a check with his rook. On f4 the rook might shield its king and protect the f-pawn. But again the white rook will strike: 1 . .. :B:f4 2.:B'.e3t :B:f3 3.:B:xf3t �xf3 with stalemate. On b4 the black rook supports the promotion of the pawn. But once again we have to look at the remaining flight squares of the white king in order to avoid stalemate: 1 ... :B:b4 2.:B:e4!
[diagram]
Having done the status examination for the white king it is obvious that again e2 is the only remaining flight square. A black rook would control this square if it moved onto the e-file. Thus Black cannot capture the rook in the above diagram because of stalemate. But the undefended b4-rook cannot escape! Moving along the b-file will not solve the problem, as the white rook will shadow the black rook along the e-file. For example: 2 .. . :B:b8 3.:B'.e8! with "eternal rook'', as the Russians say. A rook move will not win either, so hands off the rook! Finally we have found the solution. If there is a win, it must be the only option left: pushing the b-pawn. 1 ...b2! 2.�b8 gh4! Black wins. The winning motif is a well-known procedure in positions of this kind: Black will give up the b-pawn on b2 or b 1 after which he will win the white rook with a check on the first or second rank. This motif does not depend on the position of the black king. If you enj oy positions of this kind, you can make use of them quite effectively by solving endgame studies. Of course, stalemate is not the only way to force a draw. Another, more common, way is a perpetual check or, in short, a perpetual. Here, as with stalemates, the status examination 1 98 Chess Tactics from Scratch of the king shows a restricted freedom of movement. Any piece can perform this lifesaving operation. Our first example shows that sometimes even the strongest player needs a default option in case things go wrong. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Portisch - Kasparov Moscow 1 98 1 Now we can see why l . . .�g8!! was such an ingenious move: the black queen is not pinned against her king. White has two pieces to defend against Black's three possible checks. The white king cannot escape, as with every check one of the white pieces will occupy and close the flight square: 6 ••• V;Yf3t 7.�g2 V;Yd1 t s.V;Yg1 V;Yhst 9.�h2 V;Yf3t And White finally accepted that he could not win this game. The next example shows a cheeky combination of stalemate and perpetual. In Evans - Reshevsky, New York 1 963, the game had reached the following position: 8 7 6 a b c d e f g h 5 The prospects look pretty grim for Black. He 4 needs a miracle move and he finds one: 1 ••• <i>g8!! Now the position is already a draw.

2. The squares next to the king
The squares next to the king are all squares that allow a direct or indirect tactical impact on the king's position. All files, ranks, and diagonals in to the king's position have to be examined carefully. Squares and lines with possible checks have to be analysed for their tactical implications and simultaneously be seen in possible relation to other parts of the board. Does that sound complicated? A simple case is to follow the consequences of a check. Often it pays to see where a check will lead. Block - Felderhof Amsterdam 1 9 1 2 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
White is confronted with a great temptation: his pawn has made it to the seven th rank.
200 Chess Tactics from Scratch
We have already encountered a pawn's lust for expansion but here White's pawn should have stepped on the brakes. White should have noticed that after the possible . . .g7-g5t his king has only one square: a sign of danger. Instead he fell into the only remaining trap:
1.d8=�??
Many moves win for White: l .�xe4t, l .g5 and 1 .f4 among others. 1 . .. g5t! 2.@h5 �f4t! 3.exf4 �xh3 mate Black just had to follow the first check to see that White's second queen would only be a decoration for his triumph. Whenever a piece is directly attacking the king, its check always has an effect on other squares as well. We have already seen many examples of this. But apart from obvious checks there may also be checks hidden in a position. These could be sacrifices next to the king, checks made possible by the opening of lines, or checks that are only created after a certain number of moves. The next two diagrams offer simple illustrations: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
I.est The first check is easy to see, but the audacious pawn is using the fact that the square it has just occupied is rather unhealthy for both king and queen because of the nasty pins the bishop threatens (from d4 or the "new" check on g3) due to the diagonal configuration of king and queen. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
The black king is certainly able to stop the pawn, however ...
1.f8=�t @xf8 2.�f7 mate
The squares next to the king are all squares that allow a direct or indirect tactical impact on the king's position. As we have seen with many elementary tactical motifs, it is sometimes possible to force the king to another square where the motif could then be used. In the case of a double attack, for example, the king often served as a tactical target to win material. But if a mate is possible on one of the squares next to the king, the game could be over very quickly. Sometimes you should check how the king's status would be on his neighbouring squares, too!

You can conclude from this example that every piece defended by the king is a possible target for a sacrifice to lure the king to that square. Rules of thumb like this make it possible for you to research the tactical potential of every king position in a systematic manner. Therefore, tactics (unless strategically motivated) are not strokes of genius and can be learned (as can the judgement needed for most strategic sacrifices by the thorough study of the elements of positional chess) . If you take a look at the squares next to the king in Vanka - Skoda, Prague 1 940: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

The king may not be the fastest piece on the board but here it was certainly fast enough. If a piece runs out of retreat squares and is inadequately defended, it will be in trouble if attacked. In Chapter 1 Becoming Familiar with the Pieces we talked about restricting a piece. There we had a poor knight placed at the edge of the board having no squares to go to because these were controlled by a bishop. This also happened in one of my games:

My opponent could have drawn easily with, for example, 1 .�g 1 . But he forgot to check where his knight would end up after: l.�c7?? �xc7 2.�xc7 .Bc4!

The knight has no retreat squares as the escape route tf:Jc7-a8-b6 is controlled by Black's a-pawn. The black king will attack the knight and so White had to resign a well-played game just because he did not check the status on its new square of his only remaining piece .. . Advancing a3-a4 would save the knight but not the game, because Black will soon be a pawn up in the ensuing pawn ending. Together with the status examination, you should not only take a close look at the piece's current square, but also examine the other squares to which it may have to move. If the defender has to recapture on the square of a piece it was defending, you need to examine this square in advance. If you think you can do without, you may end up like Black in Blau - Donner, Switzerland 1 958.

Donner ran into a fork by the pawn. The black queen has no retreat from the e5-square after 2 .. .Rxe5 3.�f4.

Whenever you move a piece to a certain square you should have a retreat as a default option. Otherwise you are running great risks with your pieces, which might be cut off in the wilderness of enemy territory surrounded by enemy pawns and pieces. Although I do not consider the retreat as a tactical motif in itself, it plays an important role when you are doing the status examination for any piece you want to move. Whenever you move a piece, you are changing the position and a new position calls for a fresh look. And never forget that leaving a square changes things at home as well.

The analysis of complex positions Bringing together the results of the status of each piece is the starting point for combinations. Consequently a combination is always the result of elements that can be discovered by a status examination. There might be only one result of a status examination for each piece but many different ways to combine these results. Status Examination 2 1 1 Looking at the single elements of each position, we are able to unearth combinations we might not have seen otherwise. Another important ability is to envision a position beyond the tangible tactical realities. In a dream you can achieve anything. So why not imagine a position you would like to have, even if it looks impossible to reach at the moment. We have already seen a similar approach when dealing with mating patterns. Discovering the weaknesses of your opponent's pieces and position can still create an image that will give you a target for your plans and calculations. Consider the following position: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Petrosian - lvkov USSR-Yugoslavia 1 979
[diagram]
Petrosian played:
1.�xd4 exd4 2.�e5t Qxg4 3.f3 mate
Recognizing the main motif is not very difficult when you take a look at this position (the black king's position, and the e l -rook's possibility of controlling squares around the king) . Potential elements are part of the analysis of the position above. You have to ask yourself, what would happen if a rook landed on e5. At the moment this move is impossible, or at least ridiculous. Imagining the rook on e5 you will eventually find the solution for the position:
[diagram]
If the knight were defended, it would be mate already. This should have been the starting point of the combination. Now we discover that if Black took the knight the king would run into White's pawn formation with either f3 or h3 mate. Therefore, in the initial position you just have to get rid of the bishop protecting e5. Sometimes it may even be helpful to imagine illegal or impossible moves when you dream of a position, if you can make use of it afterwards back in chess reality. A status examination can be the first step on the way to changing the current position to your dream image. Another step is combining the elements you have learned about in this book. On a basic level you have to see the possible collaboration of two pieces in a rook and bishop mate, for instance, or the three-piece configuration of a pin. The relation between the pieces and the motif is the decisive step. In a dream you can achieve anything. So why not imagine a position you would like to have, even if it looks impossible to reach at the moment. 2 1 2 Chess Tactics from Scratch Erbis - Kempf The rook is undefended and a possible tactical target for a double attack of the white West Germany 1 954 queen on d4.

Only from the c6-square can the f3-bishop force the d7-bishop to move. A look at the c6-square shows that it is defended twice by Black. The status of these two pieces reveals that neither can move (the black queen has to defend e7 against mate). Putting it all together gives you the information that 1 .Bc6 is the move in this position. Take a look at Neukirch - Malich, Gera 1 962: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 �

Black is now blocking the tactical base of the white queen from where she would have been aiming a double attack at the undefended c3- rook and the mate square g7. But Black has just blundered. If you have done the status examination of the d8-rook you will see that the rook is one of two defenders against a back rank mate. A timely e6-e7 (as your pawn moves, your status examination should go along with it!) would control f8, crushing the "saving" move ... ttJ g6-f8. So there is only one defender of the back rank left, the black rook on d8. But this is the one that also has to defend the pawn on d4. So:

Looking beyond the configuration of the actual position we find h4 or f2 as target squares for the black queen. Infiltration into the opponent's position is a theme we often find with attacking players. Of course, they are aiming to establish their most powerful piece in the midst of the enemy's camp. For us this might be a difficult idea to start with, but once we get used to it and get a clear view of the tactical implications we will become more daring in looking for such possibilities. The e l -rook is only defended by the knight, as the d2-bishop has to defend the tactical base e3 of the g4-knight. So whether Black takes on e 1 on the first or the second move, it is only the knight that will be able to take back. Consequently, we can deflect the knight, so the black queen might be able to move to h4. Of course, at the moment the h4-square is defended twice but we already know how we could strip it of one defender. Then only the g3- pawn would be defending h4. And the g3-pawn is already bothered with defending its colleague on f4. If we could get the queen to h4, she would control the f2-square. Remember that the bishop was not able to take on e3, so the line of communication between the queen on c2 and the f2-square remains interrupted. Another square that the black queen would control is h2 as the f3-knight will be deflected and on e l it is no longer controlling h2. The pawn on g3 is the only defender we need to eliminate. So taking on f4 might be the solution for all of Black's problems. This is exactly what Tai did: 1 ... �xf4t! 2.gxf4 One defender is gone. 2 ••• �xel 3.�xel Suddenly h4 is approachable for the queen: 3 ••• YMh4 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6

Collecting the basic information for all the pieces and squares around the king does not tell you how to create a position such as the first diagram of this game. But you will be able to understand this combination and maybe one day you will unleash a tactical firework worthy of Tai. In contrast to the endgame, very few middlegame positions require a status examination for every single piece on the board. As always there are exceptions and here is a spectacular one: 2 1 4 Chess Tactics from Scratch Saemisch - Nimzowitsch Copenhagen 1 923 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.

Black has just played 25 .. .h6!! reaching an unbelievable position: with his last move Black has created zugzwang, which is something usually reserved only for the endgame. Every white move loses!

1 ... �xd5! 2.exd5 h6! Attacking the bishop. The first move might be attributed to the attacking instinct ofTal but the second move was surely found by taking a closer look at the elements of the position. The status examination for the g5-bishop after the opening of several (!!) lines of attack (the e-file, the 4th rank for the black queen, and the h8- a l and f5-b l diagonals) shows only two retreat squares for this piece: f4 and e3. The f4-square is not a safe haven as this square is a tactical target of a double attack by the e5- knight if it hops to d3. The e3-square is not any better. After the discovered attack . . . ctJxf3t the bishop becomes the prey of the e8-rook. Status Examination 2 1 5 The status examination for the white queen shows that she is pinned against the king. So the queen no longer controls the e3-square, which is vital knowledge if the bishop moves there. The status examination of the black queen shows that she cannot be taken without losing a tempo for White as the pawn reloads attacking the a3-rook. The status examination for the b3-knight is of crucial importance for this game. A black rook on e3 would pin the knight against the a3-rook and would be difficult to defend, and the a4-knight might be lost as well. So:
3.�bxc5!
This did not come as a real surprise.
[diagram]
White returns the piece, controlling the tactical base d3 of the black e5-knight and consequently the f4-square becomes a retreat for the g5-bishop. White was just slightly worse in the resulting position. Wow! That was a lot of examination and calculation. Fortunately you usually don't have to analyse such difficult positions as Tai because you (unfortunately) don't play like he did (yet!?) . Summary • Understanding all the individual elements of a position does not necessarily mean understanding the whole position. • After you have learned about the elements of tactics, you need a method that will enable you to analyse a position as a whole. The status examination provides such a method. • The status examination takes a close look at the status of each piece on the board. Principally, you have to look at two things with each piece. First, you have to find out its current status: whether it is attacked, defended, hanging, pinned, etc. Then you have to see this piece as an element of a picture, which is related to other elements. Ask yourself how the status of this piece changes the status of other pieces. • Impartial stocktaking is what the status examination is about. • Before you move you should look at the following: 1 . What is the status of each piece? (Is it defended, does it have duties to perform, restricted movement, etc.) What is the new status of the piece if moved to its new square? Does it have a retreating square and, equally importantly, how has it changed the status of all other pieces connected with it?
2. Which squares can be occupied? Here
you have to check for direct occupation and indirect occupation. Remember, sometimes a square only seems to be defended.
3. Are there further connections of pieces
and squares in more complex positions? • The status examination is not about restraining intuition. The status examination is a safety device for your intuition. Chapter 12 Candidate Moves In his classic work Think like a Grandmaster Soviet grandmaster Alexander Kotov explained how he developed from a promising player into a world-class grandmaster by training his calculation. In the process he brought two new concepts into chess terminology, the tree of analysis and the candidate move. His aspiration to have a human being think like a mechanical device has since been discredited many times over, not the least by the editor of the 1 995 Batsford edition, who points out that even computer programs do not religiously calculate one line to the end. Having said that, Kotov was right on the money when he emphasized the importance of organizing your calculation of variations as well as the importance of looking for ideas. Up to this point this book has been focused on what to look for, more than on how to look. No other approach would make sense; there is no reason to learn how to look, if you do not know what to look for. For this reason we shall use this final chapter of the book to discuss calculation and especially the importance of using candidate moves as a technique. A complicated example Let's start with a complicated example. Nikolov - Papin Zurich 20 1 0 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
Often a player will look at a position such as this and quickly see one or two "obvious" moves and then consider which one to choose based on a more or less random thought process. Before discussing these obvious moves I invite you to look for ideas of your own. 2 1 8 Chess Tactics from Scratch Please come up with at least three ideas before you continue. They do not have to be calculated accurately at all, just make sure that it is more than a random check with no concept of what it is trying to achieve. In this position these would be the rook check on gl and the queen check on g3. Especially the latter seems initially attractive, as there is another check on g7 and then even one on a6, which at the same time is a capture. So in the game White played 1.�g3t? probably looking forward to 1 . . . 'Rg6 2.'Rxe5! and the combination of E!g 1 and ltJ f6t would give White an entirely winning attack. Instead Black danced away with 1.. . @f7!
2.�g7t? <i>e6. White was no doubt happy
to bring another piece into the game with

But after 3 ... i.c6! his attack has come to an end. White lost the game after: 4.�g4 �xg4 5.hxg4 <i>d5 6.i.g7 �hd8 7.�f6 gas

important for us at the moment.

8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
Looking at this position (in our heads) we might get the impression that White's attack has come to an end, but actually he can still keep the advantage with 3.�g5!!:
8 T
[diagram]
The freeing of the g7-square for the knight as well as the attack on the e5-pawn and the open position of the black king in general means that Black has no choice but to give up a piece with 3 ...�xh3t 4.�xh3 i.xh3, when after s.<i>xh3 White has the advantage of two minor pieces against a rook in the endgame. Candidate Moves 2 1 9 To convert this would be tough, but maybe it is possible. A lot of us would be very happy to have seen this 3.�g5-move and proudly shown it to our friends after the game, whether we managed to win the ending or not. However our entire approach to the position would have been flawed. Let's return to the original position and see what ideas you have come up with. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
Here I asked Grandmaster Keti Arakhamia Grant to look at the position for 1 0 minutes in order to see how many ideas she was able to come up with. She quickly rejected l .�g3t because of the lack of a follow-up, but her four other candidates did include l .�gl t and Keti mentioned 3.�g5 in her notes. Let's look at the first idea that came to her head once these two "obvious" checks had been briefly assessed. (Here it is worth mentioning that rather than mechanically looking for ideas first, grandmasters would quickly look a few moves ahead until they find resistance in their calculation, so that they have some feeling of the importance of the idea. This would for example be after l .�gl t <i>f7 2.�g?t <i>e8, when it would take extra effort to find 3.�g5. Some grandmasters might do this and only then quickly assess the consequences, before looking for other ideas. Human beings don't think like computers - and computers don't think like trees!) The first idea was 1 .�g l t:
8 T
[diagram]
The idea is simple: Black now cannot run with 1 . . . <i>f7 because of 2.�fl , winning the queen. Instead he would have to play l . . .�g6, something Keti could not find a great idea against. She gave 2.ttJ f6t <i>f7 3.ltJxd7 �xh6
4.ltJxe5t <i>e8 as unclear.
If she had not found something more promising to investigate, she would have returned to this line and studied it carefully to find improvements - basically, she would have used the idea of candidate moves again on move two, in order to find something better. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6.
[diagram]
White to play - Can you find a powerful move?
220 Chess Tactics from Scratch
We will return to this position, but first let's continue following Keri's thinking. The next idea she got was to give a check with 1 .Wfb3t, with the basic idea that 1 ... Wf f7? would be met with 2.ttJ f6 mate!
[diagram]
But of course Black should not walk straight into mate in one, but put a piece on e6. Keti quickly saw 1 ...Be6 2.:ggl t �f7 3.:gg?t �e8
4.Wf
a4t id? 5 .Wfxd?t and mate in a few moves, but she struggled a bit to find anything after l . . . Wf e6 2.:ggl t �f7 3.:gfl t �g6 4.Wf g3t �xh6 5 .:gf6t:
[diagram]
After 5 . . .�xh5! 6.:gxe6 Bxe6 7.Wfxe5t �g6
8.Wfxe6t �g7 it was not entirely clear to
her that White was that much better in the endgame with a queen against two rooks. However, Keti was attracted to the mate she had seen at first, and she did not want to let go of this check immediately, so she looked for candidates on move 2:
[diagram]
And she quickly found that things had changed slightly and that the black king's escape path had now been blocked, so now is the time for 2.Wfg3t!. Black has no choice but to play 2 . . . Wf g6, when White has 3.Wfxe5 with a completely winning position, as established earlier.
[diagram]
We can see how she benefitted from calculating just a few moves forward from I .WI g3t before rejecting it. As Keti is an experienced player, she quickly understood that the small difference of the queen being on e6 instead of f5 would matter greatly. (Actually Candidate Moves 22 1 many grandmasters will have trained using The Method of Comparison, as popularized by Mark Dvoretsky, where the student is asked to pay specific attention to small tactical nuances and compare their effects on the various plans available to them.) At this point you might have suspected that Keti was completely satisfied and would simply play this. But at this point her attention was drawn towards a different idea, the move that turns out to be the best one: I .�fl !!
8 T
[diagram]
There are not many lines to calculate. If Black takes on fl White will give the queen check on b3: 1 . . . lMfxfl 2.lMfb3t
8 T
[diagram]
Black will have to bring the queen home to f7 this time, after which he is mated. We see how it is this "chunk" (where the queen is pinned and thus cannot take the knight) , 8 7 6 which worked its wonders in Keti's mind and reappeared from one variation to the other. After finding this easy winning move, Keti admitted she rather lost interest in the entire exercise and did not look for more solutions. There were some additional options, such as 1 .�xa6!?, preventing . . . lMf g6 and thus leading to a strong attack. And then there was the strong second move to be found after I .lM!g l t lM!g6. This is 2.lMf a7!!.
8 T
[diagram]
Surprisingly White is absolutely winning again. 1 . lMf a?? was not possible, as Black would have 1 .. . lMfxh3t, but now when the queen is on g6, there is no such check available. Instead there is a direct threat of 2.�g 1 , winning the queen.

It is very hard for Black to come up with a defence. For example 2 .. . Re6 3.�gl t <i>f7: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6

Now White has 4.�fl t! followed by 4 .. . <i>g8 5 .'Df6t or 4 .. . <i>e7 5 .�g5t, winning everything. And after 2 .. .Rc6 3.�xa6:
8 T
[diagram]
Black must resign in view of the queen retreat, 4.Wg l t, which will be devastating. So, White had a number of ways to win the game, only not with the two most "obvious" moves, 1 .Rg3t and l .�gl t. To be able to understand this, White did not have to calculate long variations with tricks and traps along the way, but simply be aware of some different ideas and images, such as the checkmate with the knight on f6. The candidate moves are not the good moves, they are the moves you decide are worth checking out. A common misconception If you go back over the last few pages and look at the lengths of the various variations, you will note that they are three or four moves long and generally without many sidelines. The candidate moves would be the first move, which in Keti's case included 1 .Rg3t, 1 .Wgl t, l .�gl t, l .Rb3t and 1 .�fl . She did not consider l .�xa6, so this was not a candidate for her. In the interesting book Rapid Chess Improvement, De la Maza criticizes Kotov and sets up an imaginary training session where an amateur suggests a move and is told "this is not a candidate move". However, by thinking about the move, the amateur automatically makes the move a candidate. Let me stress this clearly once and for all - the candidate moves are not the good moves, they are the moves you decide are worth checking out. The conclusion does not come before the selection, it quite naturally comes after. When we are talking about looking for candidate moves, we are talking about consciously looking for ideas, not for a list of random moves to calculate. We calculate to find a good move to play, we don't play to calculate as much as possible. Take a look at the next position, taken from the very end of the opening. Candidate Moves 223 Kuzubov - Sivuk Ukraine 20 1 1 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 6. a c e f g White to play - what is the strongest move? Not much has happened in the opening. Both players have developed their pieces and now have to look for middlegame plans. It would not be hard to imagine that Black was focusing mainly on strategic ideas when he put the knight out on h5. Instead he was met with a small tactic that made his situation worse. After 1.i.c7! Black felt he had to hide the queen away on e8, when White had promising control of the position. The reason for this was that 1 . . .�xc7? 2.ttJxd5 �d8 3.ltJxe7t �xe7
4.:gc7 lands with a strong double threat.
8 T
[diagram]
After 4 .. .�c8, which is the only way to avoid losing the piece back immediately, White has many strong continuations. For example 5 .ttJe5 �d8 6.:gac l ttJxe5 7.dxe5 :gb8 8.�xa7 and White wins. After 1.• •�e8 White played 2.�b3 preparing ttJ b5, and won this favourable position after a further 35 moves of great chess. This small tactic did not "win the house", but it did prevent Black from playing . . . ttJxf4. Instead the white bishop was a permanent pain in the neck. At times deep calculation 1s necessary, but many games are decided by the calculation of lines of that are two to four moves long. More ideas about calculation - What is important? Calculation is not only looking for ideas - candidate moves - but also at times going deep into a position; at least this is true at grandmaster level. For most amateurs 99°/o of all important lines of calculation will be two to four moves long. When I say "important", I mean the calculation that decides games. At the level of titled players you will see feats of calculation of long variations, especially in games between world class grandmasters, but just as often you will find that the games are decided by far simpler oversights. To illustrate this I have chosen a game played between two Italian IMs in the 20 1 1 Italian Championship. It is a normal game for the level, with vast complications and thus also a number of mistakes. To someone following the games live on the Internet with an engine buzzing along, these errors might seem silly, but in fact they are a symptom of chess being a difficult game and eventually also of the players running short of time.
224 Chess Tactics from Scratch
I have done my best to reduce the complexity of the game and for this I have used the method of candidate moves. Everything becomes easier to understand once it is structured well. I want you to pay special attention to the way the players make mistakes every time they delve into long variations and how winning the game did not require deep calculation, but instead a concentrated effort in looking at what is really happening on the board. Genocchio - Mogranzini Perugia 20 1 1 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 a b c d e We join the game just after the opening phase, when White has offered Black a pawn in return for opening the f-file. It seems to me that Black should have accepted this offer with 20 . . .exf5! 2 l .gxf5 .Bxf5, as he can defend with . . .!:iJe7 and possibly . . .Rb6, coming to the rescue along the 6th rank if White manages to create any real threats. Instead Black started a misguided tactical operation.
20. ..b3?!

[diagram]
Black's positional aspiration was for play to continue with 2 1 .Rxa5 l:iJxa5, when the knight is coming to c4 and the pawn on b2 would be under severe pressure. This is all based on a tactical idea that arose in the game.
21.�xc6!
The obvious tactical idea. In the short term White wins a piece by removing -the defender of the queen and winning a tempo with the check on c8. However, Black had seen this and planned to win the piece back. 21 ... %Yxd2 22.gxcSt �xc8 23.�xd2 gc2 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

Here we see Black's idea. White cannot avoid returning the piece and the rook is active on f g h Candidate Moves 225 the second rank. The main point is 24.�d l ? bxa2 and the rook on d 1 is severely overloaded and White has no answer to the threat of 25 . . .�xd2!, when White cannot recapture as Black would get a new queen. However this 4-5 move tactical idea does not work, and it appears Black was not in control of the lines he was calculating. Rather than playing the timid 24.�d 1 ?, walking straight into Black's plan, White decided to return the piece immediately.
24.Bc3!
This move is not hard to find once you think about it. White is a piece up and he cannot hold on to it, so what is the best policy? Return the one you care the least for of course, and save the one you like the best. Here the bishop is better, because it can protect the important b2- and d4-pawns. Now suddenly Black's options have reduced drastically. Let's imagine that he plays the first move that pops into his mind, which would be 24 .. .�xe2. White would no doubt exchange the pawns on e6 and then take on b3, securing an extra pawn. Black would get a little counterplay with . . .�h6 and the game would go on, although it is no fun to be a pawn down. I guess this is why Black decided to avoid this line - what more argument would he need? But let's for a moment assume that we are White after 25.fxe6 fxe6:
[diagram]
Sure, 26.axb3 looks reasonable, but if we study our opponent's intentions (26 .. .�h6! with some counterplay) we can see that 26.g5! is the best move, eliminating the bishop from the game. After 26 .. .bxa2 27.�al the rook gets into the game and the a7-pawn is doomed. White looks to be on the way to claiming a full point. Such attention to the opponent's counter chances is usually called prophylactic thinking and is one of the most powerful thinking tools at our disposal. For those who are already rated a good deal over 2000 and are willing to work hard to reach international level, I recommend studying prophylaxis in such high-level books as Strategic Play (School of Chess Excellence 3) by the highly esteemed Russian trainer Mark Dvoretsky. (At the same time I would like to warn all others not to go near it. Studying material that is far beyond you will only dishearten you, not assist you.) Returning to our game, Black could also attempt to complicate matters by bringing in his light-squared bishop with 24 .. .�bS!?.

White has very good winning chances in this ending and we could no doubt analyse even further with the electronic tools at our disposal, but no doubt we have already made at least one mistake in the analysis, which would dilute the value of whatever conclusions were reached. Also - this long line has nothing to do with the game! Obviously it springs from the game and is interesting, but the players were never close to reaching this position. To say that these lines are complicated understates it! We have to look ten moves forward before the 5 Candidate Moves 227 position has any kind of clarity (White has the advantage, but how far this reaches is still not clear) . The fact that we can analyse our way to a final conclusion at home is not so relevant when we are sitting at the board and have to calculate the variations in our heads. Mogranzini is an International Master and a gifted tactician, but he had no chance of seeing all these lines in practice. However, he could have made the correct decision, if he had used The Method of Elimination to compare 24 .. . E!:xe2, 24 .. . .Bb5 and his eventual choice 24 .. .bxa2, in which we line up our candidate moves (here just three of them) and then try to eliminate them one by one, to choose between the ones left standing. This would not be by analysing ten moves deep, but by using our ability to look for candidate moves to see what is wrong with our own candidates. Had Mogranzini used this technique, there is no doubt he would have found the right choice, 24 . . . .Bb5!, but instead he took the pawn on a2. 24 ...bxa2? 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

[diagram]
White to play and win Black was no doubt looking forward to playing . . . .Bb5 and . . . .Bh6, as well as the simple . . . E!:xe2. It is clear that there are many options here for White, just as it is reasonably clear that this could be a deciding moment of the game and that it is therefore justified for him to spend a good deal on time on choosing a good move. Using the idea of candidate moves mechanically, we could get quite a long list:
25.fxe6, 25.f6, 25.ttJf4, 25 .ltJg3, 25 . .Bf3,
25. <i>f2 and so on. Most of these are sensible moves to consider and a quick look at all or most of them certainly makes sense. However, if we do not actually look - and by this I mean spend time looking - we might miss a logical move, as indeed I have deliberately done in drawing up this list. The move itself is innocuous, but the ideas behind it are not obvious unless we spend a bit of time actually looking at what is happening, rather than trying to shoehorn the pieces into fitting our plans. In the game White became excusably confused by the large number of decent-looking moves and went for what appears to be the least logical of all of them.
25.f6?
From the lines we have already calculated, we already know that Black wants to play . . . .Bh6 to activate the bishop. So it does not appear logical for White to provoke Black into playing this move. But you can easily understand White's thinking if you try - and most of us have good reasons for playing the moves we do, only not always the right reasons! In this case White was hoping that the fact that the black king will be under threat of a back rank mate for the rest of the game would matter greatly. But as we shall see, he is giving Black extra activity and thus this dream scenario does not arise. The winning move was to go straight for the a-file with: 25 .E!:al !!

This move might not look aggressive at first, but if you spot the ideas connected with it, you will quickly realize that it is absolutely decisive. First of all, Black cannot simply regain the piece with 25 .. .�xe2, as the rook will be trapped after 26.i.fl :

With the ideas 26 . . .�c2 27.i.d3 or 26 . . .�e3
27.<i>f2!.
Previously Black had been able to play 25 .. . i.bS in many positions, but at this point the other bishop has not yet arrived at h6 and White would have 26.� c l !. 7 6 4 3 2
[diagram]
Winning the a-pawn and thus being a piece up for nothing. Finally there is a more complicated idea, which we have seen before and would think of based on these two lines. Black could play 25 . . .Bh6!?: 7 6 4 3 2
[diagram]
The ideas are to prevent White from playing
26.�cl (and meet other escape attempts by
the knight with . . .�c 1 t, exchanging the rook on a l ) and to assist the black roqk so that it would not get trapped. All very sound reasoning, but we must also remember that White is a piece up and does not have to fight for the survival of the knight (which has nowhere sensible to go!) . Instead he can simply win a pawn with
26.�xa2! when Black's choices are limited.
26 . . . �xe2 27.�xa? Winning a pawn. 27 ... Bc6

Now 28.�c?! is powerful. We don't need to calculate further (or maybe even this far) to Ln tfl oo >

'-A
[> Candidate Moves 229 see that White has a strong attack on the black king as well as an extra pawn. And contrary to previous lines, White is not in danger of getting mated, as the black rook is on e2 rather than c2 and cannot check the king. This is obviously really difficult stuff, but using the technique of candidate moves White would have stood a good chance of finding most of this. And note that the most complicated line he needed to see was again only three or four moves long. The difficult thing was to pick the right move to analyse and to do this in a reasonably organized way. Calculating variations is exceptionally difficult and even the best players in the world struggle with this. The thing to remember is that improvement is always possible, but perfection is not. Chess is a draw with perfect play, but it can end in any of three results in a game between two humans. The best we can do is to prepare ourselves for the fight, so we can take advantage of our opponents' mistakes. Let's return to the game.

25 ... clh6! An easy choice for Black. From here the bishop becomes very active.

Black is faced with a simple choice. If he goes for 27. .. �xe2? 28.�xa2 White is going to take on a7 with serious threats against the black king. Presumably this is the line White was attracted to a few moves ago. But Black does not have to go in this direction. 27 ... .ibS!! A great move. Black stays a piece down in order to gain a tempo to defend the a-pawn. White now cannot play 28.�xa2? ii.xe2 as we have already seen once by transposition. Black has the stronger attack and would win instantly after 29.�xa7? �c l t 30.�h2 ii.f4 mate. White can play 28.ii.fl , but this time Black is better off after regaining the piece: 28 . . . ii.xe2

The ending offers equal chances. A funny little line goes 3 1 .:B:xa7 h4! 32.b4 :B:f2 and Black has perpetual check. But also something like 32 .. .Bf4 would give him enough counterplay, so it is not something we need to see in advance. White decided to stay a piece up for the time being:
28.tLlg3 cic4 29.cifl cih3 30.tLle2

[diagram]
30 ... aS!? There is nothing objectively wrong with this move, but Black could have forced a draw immediately with 30 .. .Bc4. He probably rejected this move on account of 3 1 .�g2, when taking the piece back is not on the cards, as White will move his king to f3 in the end, regaining the extra piece. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 But instead Black can play 3 1 . . .ic l !, with the threat of 32 . . .Bxb2 33.Bxb2 :B:xb2 and 34 .. . :B:b 1 . White needs to be able to meet this with 34.ttJc3 to stay in the game, so he would play 32.�gl !. Here the draw is immediate with 32 . . .Be3t 33.�g2 ic l . I think Black missed 3 1 .. .ic 1 , but there is of course a slim chance that he really liked his position and wanted to play for a win (not really). We should also remember that we are approaching move 40 and both players would be running short of time at this point, considering all the difficult choices they had to make earlier. But again we should note that the solution to Black's problems was only two moves long.
31.<i>g2 a4 32.<i>f3
White has made a little progress, but besides kicking the bishop back, he has not achieved much. At this point Black would retain enough counterplay if he had played 32 . . .Bg5!.
[diagram]
It is not easy to see how White would make real progress and probably he had no idea either. However Black was probably caught out by the psychological trap that, being a piece down, he had to do something. Actually he should just have stayed put when the draw would still be within reach. 1 32 ...cid2?! 33.cixd2 �xd2

White is apparently in a tight spot. Black is about to play . . . :gxb2, which is not such a great problem, but . . . :gd 1 is a more serious threat, and if White played 34.�g2? Black would reply 34 .. . �c4! 35.ltJc3 :gxb2. White correctly evaluated the situation and brought the king closer.
34.<i>e3!
At this point Black should have played 34 .. . :gxb2, even though White would have the pawns under control after 35.ltJc3 with ideas such as ltJc3-b5-a3 or �fl -b5. Instead Black went for a tactical solution: 34 ... �dl? 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 �

White would be a pawn up and would win the rook ending without great difficulty. Some final words This game was rich in tactical moments and shows how important tactics are in modern tournament play. Both players made plenty of mistakes and oversights and a number of them changed the evaluation from lost to drawn and back again. We are not talking about ten-move variations with swinging swords, but 2-4 move long variations with a minimum of sidelines. b
232 Chess Tactics from Scratch
Still, chess is desperately difficult and we can only feel sympathy for the players as they struggled with the variations and their steadily depleting time. The players' tasks would have been easier if they had trained in the use of candidate moves (we will return to this in the exercise section) . Also useful would have been prophylactic thinking, the method of comparison and the method of elimination. But it does not really make great sense to discuss these elaborate methods of calculation at this point, when the emphasis should be on getting into the habit of looking for ideas, using the technique of candidate moves, before they are analysed one by one. If you read the first edition of this book, I hope you have found this new chapter useful and a valuable addition to your concept of chess tactics. Using this technique will help you in the next section, where you will have the chance to put your new knowledge to the test. Please wait a moment before you rush to test yourself with the tactical exercises. There is one more thing I would like to point out: Tactics will only come about in your games if you activate your pieces! Like cannons in a cellar, your pieces will be tactically useless until they are placed on the firing line. Don't let your troops celebrate at home, send them to the battlefield!

Too tough for this book? White to play and win This book has evolved many times since its original self-published German edition, with minor improvements included for each reprint. It is forgiving for the author that the book is never truly finished, and with this new version it is possible for new (as well as old) readers of this book to benefit from the huge amount of feedback I have received over the years. For example, it is now hard to understand why the first edition did not have arrows next to the diagrams showing who is to move .. . Much of the feedback related to the exercises. In previous editions there were a few at the end of most of the chapters, but in total not very many. Readers often praised the understanding of tactics the text gave them, but were frustrated that they did not have more exercises to test their newfound knowledge. So when I started work on this edition I considered writing a complementary volume of exercises, a workbook if you like. I began selecting relevant positions and quickly decided to focus on recent games (even so, a number of Bent Larsen's best combinations are used - this is meant as a tribute to the ferocious great Dane) . When I was quite far along in the process it suddenly dawned on me that my efforts to assist the reader could be seen as profiteering. Although I had around 400 good test positions (a number that equals some of the other puzzle books available) I was not certain the audience would support my efforts. It was for this reason that I, in agreement with the publisher, decided to make the workbook a part of the new edition. It was not a commercial decision, but hopefully neither the publisher nor I will be punished for increasing the printing and transport costs by making the book 1 28 pages thicker! I also decided to eliminate about a hundred of my collected exercises to make sure I only had appropriate positions with clear solutions. Less is sometimes more. The content The sorting of the positions is based first of all on the corresponding chapter earlier in the book. Look at the headers at the top of the page to see where you are. It did not make sense to create exercise sections for Getting Familiar with the Pieces or Double Attack, as most exercises include double attacks and all of them involve moving the pieces! Instead I created sections on Openings and Endings, to add some colour. I could have written chapters on these subjects, but I had to stop somewhere, and there are whole books in print about tactics in the opening or endgame .. .
234 Chess Tactics from Scratch
Within each section the exercises are organized in increasing level of difficulty. I have used the traditional system of 1 -5 stars, but of course opinions will vary about how difficult each position is ("Five stars? I solved it instantly.") . Suggested working method The set-up in this section is the standard format for exercise books by Quality Chess. The diagrams are on the right-hand page and the solutions are on the next page (safely out of sight!) . For this reason I suggest you solve six exercises at a time. Especially I recommend that you write down your solutions! If nothing is written down it is easy to trick oneself into thinking "Oh yes, I spotted that idea." Improvement comes from having measurable results. If you do not write down your solutions, you are not really measuring the value of your solving. The level of the positions This is not the most difficult exercise book on the market. I selected the positions to fit the audience and build up basic skills. When you have tried to solve all the positions in this book, you should be ready for the many other exercise books that are available. I would naturally recommend the Quality Chess Puzzle Book as the next step, to be loyal to my publisher! I rejected a few positions because they were too difficult, including the one on the previous page. Judge for yourselfl It is from Barbosa - Demianjuk, Moscow 20 1 1 :

(295) Giri - Ponomariov, Dortmund 20 1 1 White is a pawn up in the ending. Usually in endings where the rook is in front of the a-pawn, it is best placed on the 6th rank, to allow the white king to hide from checks on a7. However, in this case White can exploit the unfortunate position of the black king. 62.a7! <i>c6 62 .. .�e7 63.f5! is the whole point of it all.
