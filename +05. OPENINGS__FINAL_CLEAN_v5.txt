Introduction (And yes, my karate lessons were getting in the way of my chess studies.) There was only one solution: to try to avoid the sharpest theoretical varia- tions and instead create a solid hiding place for my King. Once that had been done, I turned to dealing with the center, finding a plan, and con- ducting possible attacks. These lessons are contained in Chapters Seven, Eight, and Nine. Beginning players will always get wiped out by more experienced opponents. One of the major reasons is that the King lacks protection. These chapters are specifically designed to prevent all further short losses. You'll be taught to have a safe King and you will be well sup- plied with the insights of classical and modern openings and defenses. Throughout the book, I've diligently tried to state the names of the openings, defenses, variations, and attacks that I describe. This has led to a number of awkward moments. The word opening often refers to what White is doing and defense refers to what Black is doing, but sometimes a favored variation as White is tried with the colors reversed. "I like this opening as White, so I'll play it as Black!" Of course, the converse is also true. A difficult one is the King's Indian Defense, a line of defense favored by a number of World Champions when playing the Black pieces. But if White adopts the King's Indian Defense setup, is it a King's Indian Defense or a King's Indian Opening? In such cases the term reversed is often used. Although the words opening, defense, variation, and attack are often used interchangeably, I've tried to reserve opening for White's play and defense for Black's play. With a game that's 1400 years old, expect some strange nomenclature to have been incorporated along the way. As always, I wish you the very best of success in your endeavors and I hope that this book will stimulate you into buying further books that are more specific about the openings and defenses that you might enjoy. xi

WINNING CHESS OPENINGS

As always, I wish you the very best of success in your endeavors and I hope that this book will stimulate you into buying further books that are more specific about the openings and defenses that you might enjoy. xii

CHAPTER ONE

Early Days Take a look at Diagram 1, the starting position of a chess game. It is the most complicated position in chess. Believe me. Grandmaster David Bronstein, who drew a match for the World Chess Champion- ship in 1951, oftentimes would come to a major tournament game and sit in wonderment staring at this very position. He once spent over 50 minutes on his very first move! And what on earth was this chess genius, this titan, this virtual co-champion of the entire chess world thinking about? "I was wondering what to play," David said. Is the starting position really that complex? The answer is more compli- cated than a simple yes or no. And the complexity grows as the student learns more! When I was playing my first games of chess, I was absolutely certain what was the best move. (Of course, I was dead wrong.) Now as an International Grandmaster, I find myself weighing the pros and cons of the multiple openings I play and I try to imagine which one would give my opponent the most discomfort. As a player's style of play matures, the player's choice of openings goes through subtle changes. When a pet favorite that used to bring home the victories is no longer scoring as well, a shift often proves successful. After trying out different formations, the player makes more changes. Thus the starting position becomes ever

DIAGRAM 1 .

CHAPTER ONE

more complex as an experienced player starts to seriously juggle the possi- ble openings and defenses. Some chess positions with a mere half-dozen pieces seem unsolvable. The starting position with all 32 pieces on the board becomes overwhelm- ing. There are so many moves to think about, and every one of our pieces cries out for attention. It can lead to paralysis of the mind. "Move me!" shouts the e2-pawn. "I'm Bobby Fischer's favorite move!" "Look," says our King's Rook, "I'm cramped and boxed in. Get me into the action and I'll show you why I'm called a cannon!" "Don't be silly!" states our noble Queen. "I'm the most powerful of all! Bring me into the battle. The entire board will bow before me." As I started to play my earliest games, a jumble of voices confused my poor brain. Such a chorus of demands, my goodness! Willy-nilly, I'd choose my favorite piece of the moment. The chosen piece gets to move, jump, or stumble around until the lucky chosen one gets removed from the board. I thought, "What a pity! Just when things were getting good! Well, let's see... That plan was working really well! If only my poor fellow hadn't been captured. Bad luck that. Well, there is another one, let's use it!" And off I would go, until the newly chosen gets slaughtered. How unlucky our pawns and pieces seem to be. "What's this? A check? How on earth did my King get checked? Looks like his majesty has to take a stroll..." If the above thoughts reflect your early efforts, you now realize that your despairs have been shared. I did the very same thing. These early thoughts of victory accurately describe how I got clobbered. Those early losses came quickly and furiously! While most of my very earliest games are thankfully lost to posterity, I remember a number of them quite well. I still recall that some of these losses really hurt. I was so certain of the cor- rectness of my approach, and I'd stubbornly cling to my earliest beliefs. In fact, I was so stubborn, I'm rather disbelieving that I actually became a grandmaster! 2 Early Days Copying the Opponent The following is the earliest game that I can recall. Yasser Seirawan versus Unknown, Unfriendly Foe Follow my moves in silent fascination.

1.d3?

Why this mistaken move? Actually I wasn't sure what to do. Of the chorus this one little pawn seemed to cry loudest. I make this "pass" move as I had already "discovered" a brilliant strategy, which I will soon reveal.

1.. .d5

My more experienced opponent makes a very reasonable move.

2.d4?

This was my brilliant discovery! I would merely duplicate my opponent's move, thereby negating the need for any thought on my part. Clever, no? I would keep a careful eye on my opponent's moves, deduce an error in his plan, and then deviate at the critical moment to score a brilliant victory.

[diagram]
My opponent tries a speculative gambit.

3. e4?

Continuing to ape my opponent, my clever strategy begins to unfold.

3.. .Bg4?

My opponent blunders by putting a Bishop in capture (the French term en prise is the chess vernacular, but I was too inexperienced to have learned this term) to my Queen.

4.dxe5?

Of course, I was attracted to the possibility of duplicating my opponent's move with 4.Bg5, but already my natural talent began to expose itself. Somehow I "sensed" the critical moment to deviate had come. My oppo- nent's move had to be an error and I took advantage of the moment to grab a central pawn. I never considered the best move, 4.Qxg4, for a 3

CHAPTER ONE

single moment. At that time I didn't have a complete grasp of how my pieces were supposed to move.

4...Bb4+?

With this eye-popping move, my opponent announced Checkmate! Hap- pily my opponent began explaining to me how his Bishops were scissor- ing my position and that my King had no moves. He said I shouldn't be upset by this premature loss, because I was his fourth victim of this devas- tating trap. Diagram 2 shows the final position from this game. Today I can only stare at this position with open-mouthed horror. White isn't checkmated at all! By playing any of the moves 5.c3, 5.Nc3, 5.Nd2, 5.Bd2, or 5.Qd2, the check to my King is stopped. Of course, White will lose his Queen and probably the game, so let us quickly turn the page! Now is the time for the first critical lesson from this book: Write down the moves to all your games and save your game scores. Oftentimes you will play quick games or five-minute chess. I can only encourage you to record these games as best you can. Try to record the moves as they are made, but if this is inconvenient, try to reconstruct the game afterward and make a written record. I improved my play enor- mously by doing this simple exer- cise and charting my own progress. The importance of this lesson and its impact on my understanding of chess didn't manifest itself for several months. First it was neces- sary to lose dozens of games. Cannon Fire Another game that typified my earli- est "style" was demonstrated in the following encounter. DlAGRAM 2. 4 Early Days Yasser Seirawan versus Known Unfriendly Fiend In viewing Diagram 1, the starting position, I imagined myself to be Napo- leon -a fine general in charge of an army ready to defy all opposition for their commander. The air is fresh and clean as the individual units stamp their fury, anxious to engage the enemy. Being a commander concerned for each individual unit, I decide to lob the enemy using my cannons! Of course, a little tenderizing of the enemy with cannons is just the right strategy before sending in the cavalry. From the starting position, I formed an image of my Rooks as cannons. They were born to fire their salvos up the files and along the ranks. Backed by my fantasy of com- manding an army, I make use of my Hollywood movie-viewing experi- ences and come to the only possible conclusion: "Light the cannons!" 1,h4? This was my favorite opening move!

1.. .d5

With the advantage of many victories backing his choice, my opponent makes a particularly powerful move. 2,Rh3? I bring my cannons into battle right away so that the enemy ranks would be softened up.

2.. .Bxh3!

This truly excellent move should have been discouraging. Not to be deterred, I conjure up yet another fabulous effort. 3,a4?? This mistake gets a second question mark. After blundering my Rook I should have played 3.Nxh3, capturing the Black Bishop as compensation.

[diagram]
Complacency born from the firm knowledge of previous victories leads to a mistake. Black should retreat his endangered Bishop. 4,Ra3?? 5

CHAPTER ONE

I had a dim awareness that this mind-boggling move was a mistake, but, what the heck, consistency is the hallmark of genius and I was deter- mined to have my cannons blaze away!

4...Bxa3!

What is up with this jerk anyway? He hasn't missed a trick! Now that my Rooks have disappeared, a sudden fear grips my heart. My h4-pawn is open to attack by the Black Queen. Feeling sympathy for the valiant foot soldier, I see no reason to allow its capture. Yes! I see the point of my play clearly now. First I play:

5.h5?

If he misses my point I will play 6.h6 and 7.hxg7 and gxh8=Q winning. . . Diagram 3 shows how I would lose many, many games. It seemed like a cruel fate, but my cannons were hardly ever around after the first dozen moves! By now you should be getting the idea of what a truly hopeless chess player I was when I started out. Later I would create my own philosophy that went like this: "Every mistake should be repeated at least once. In that way the original mistake could be confirmed." How could you be sure if you made a mistake based upon a single loss? So now you're beginning to see that I was a hopeless, stub- born chess player! This brings me to the second critical lesson: Believe in your own ideas. Not all your ideas will be bright ones. In fact, you'll probably have ten false trails for every true one you find. Fine! So be it! But believe in your ideas. Cling to them stub- bornly. Give up on them slowly, only after severe trial and tribula- DIAGRAM 3. tions. If you keep getting clobbered, 6 Early Days then seek an adjustment, but don't be afraid to play your own moves. They might be bad, but you'll learn a lot faster playing your own moves instead of mimicking others. Adjust your ideas by the results of your own practice. At this early point in my career, I still hadn't learned the first critical lesson, but I sure had mastered the second. I knew my ideas were clever; they just needed some slight fine tuning. After about 30 losses of "cannon positioning," I discovered my real powerhouse: my Queen. A whole new array of losses awaited me. Queen Raid After determining that my cannon-fire ideas weren't doing the job, a careful rethink of my opening approach was necessary. This was a criti- cal phase of my chess development. It seemed that chess was far too dif- ficult for my poor mind. Was trying to get better worth getting stomped by my friends? All chess players at one time in their very early career are struck by this telling question. Many decide that, indeed, chess isn't their shtick. Fortu- nately for me, a serendipitous outside influence played a crucial role at this phase in my development. My interest was rekindled when America's own Robert James (Bobby) Fischer defeated the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky for the World Chess Championship in 1972. It was a heady moment for chess players around the world, and for American chess players in particular. While most Americans were undoubtedly proud of their new champion, I had a question: "How could Bobby be champion? He didn't beat me!" Renewing myself, I applied the formidable powers of my young mind to my opening strategy. Carefully penetrating the mysterious veil of the chess pieces, I deduced something wonderful and extraordinary: My Queen is the most powerful piece on the board! 7

CHAPTER ONE

My fault had been not to develop it quickly enough. How simple and obvious: My Queen was a natural-born bully! All that was necessary was to introduce it into the game as early as possible. This faulty strategy is one of the most insidious pitfalls in chess! I fell into it headlong, as every untrained beginner has done! The problem, dear reader, is simply this: The Queen Raid strategy worked! My results against my circle of chess friends immediately improved. Two early examples of victorious play convinced me that I was on the right track. Yasser Seirawan versus Known Unfriendly Fiend This game begins with a good opening move-played with the completely wrong strategy in mind. The intention should be to grab control of the center, not to make room for my Queen! Controlling the center certainly wasn't my intention. 1 .e4 e5 This is the classical answer and a good move. Even beginners occasion- ally find good moves!

2.Qh5?

This was my "new and improved" idea. As the new neighborhood bully, my Queen would knock heads together.

[diagram]
My opponent seizes the opportunity to attack my Queen, but overlooks my real threat.

3.Qxe5+

Simply brilliant! My Queen spears Black's position. Now Black's cannon (Rook) will be eaten.

3.. .Qe7

Black copies my plan of bringing out the Queen. My turn!

4.Qxh8

My Queen happily munches the trapped Rook.

4.. .Qxe4+

8 Early Days What's this? The capture presents danger, but I can block the check and my Rook is safe.

5. Ne2

With this good move, I develop a piece and block the check.

5.. .Qxc2(?)

What a sly devil my opponent is! Now he is conducting his own raid. My goodness, how do I defend the threat of 6...Qxcl Checkmate? A sudden panic overcomes me, followed by a sigh of relief. No! My brilliant fifth move with my Knight protects my cl-Bishop! Happily, I continue my own raid.

6.Qxg8

In a greedy (and good, I might add) move, a mighty Knight is slaugh- tered. My marauding Queen is picking apart Black's army. Isn't chess easy and fun? I'm sure such gleeful thoughts were printed on my face.

6.. .Nc6

Black makes a good move and develops a piece. Now, at the position shown in Diagram 4, 1 had a real think about what to do next. By this time I was experienced enough to make a realization. I had a won position! I've grabbed enough loot-a Rook and a Knight-to have a big edge. Do I need to win more material? The h7-pawn is a very tempting grab as my raid on the Kingside would be completed. How- ever, Black's Queen is quite worry- ing and I must pay attention so that I don't blow my win. Resisting my strong inclination to play 7.Qxh7, I instead decide to attack Black's raiding Queen.

7. Na3!

In another surprisingly good move, and without understanding what I

DIAGRAM 4.

CHAPTER ONE

was doing, I've developed a Knight with tempo. That is, I mobilize one of my pieces and attack Black's Queen at the same time. The realization that "Black's Queen will have to move because I've attacked the Queen!" planted a seed that would take root and grow. This seed would lead me to reevaluate my new Queen strategy.

7.. .Qa4

This is a move I could fully understand and appreciate. Beginners like myself who have discovered the Queen strategy try to throw the Queen right into the middle of the battle. When the Queen is attacked, my natu- ral reaction is to return the favor at once! As my Knight attacks Black's Queen, the Queen responds by attacking my White Knight. Just what I would do! My admiration for my opponent's play was growing. I looked at the captured pieces to restore my confidence. I'm still a Rook and Knight ahead! I love what has just taken place. I've gobbled up nearly half of my opponent's army and I had just attacked Black's Queen. It felt so good that I only considered two moves: taking the h7-pawn or the move I chose.

8. b3!

Playing 8.Qxh7 was nearly irresistible. But attacking Black's Queen had brought such pleasure previously, I just couldn't resist. This time, the thought behind the move was correct. My cl-Bishop protects the Knight and the Black Queen is given another boot.

8.. .Qb4

Black tries to keep his Queen as close to the action as possible. Once more my opponent had completed the very move I would have played. At this stage of my chess career, I rarely saw more than one move ahead. My move always seemed to be spur of the moment and at this moment I was on a roll. Black's Queen has had to react to my previous moves. Without hesitation I plunked down my next move.

9. Nc2?

Early Days What joy, attacking Black's Queen again! My pieces are being brought into play and the game is won. (With the benefit of 25 years' hindsight,

9.Nc4 is a far better move.)

9,..Qc5? I thought this move to be an excellent retort because it follows the reason- ing, "When attacked, counter with an attack of your own." In fact, this move just loses. While Black is quite lost because of his material deficit, a better choice is 9. . .Qe4 to get out of harm's way. Diagram 5 shows the position as we come to one of the proudest moments of my early career: my first combination. Of course, I didn't call my next move a combination (I didn't know what the word meant); it was simply wonderful. 1O.Ba3! I continue harassing the Black Queen. This was the very first move I con- sidered, but because Black's last move attacked my c2-Knight, I was going to give up on this move when I spotted- by sheer luck - that the move has a deeper purpose then merely attacking Black's Queen. 1O...Qxc2 Played with a near yelp of delight, my fiendish opponent wasn't about to be chivalrous and say, "Look here young Yasser, you've overlooked my threat to capture your Knight. Why don't you reconsider?" 1 1 .Qxf8 Checkmate This stunning denouement had an extraordinary effect on my enjoyment of chess. I was as dumbfounded as my opponent, who could only stare in helpless reflection at the final position. I had actually anticipated two moves in a row. I had consciously sacrificed a Knight in order to win back a Bishop! DIAGRAM 5.

CHAPTER ONE

You must understand that at this stage of my chess understanding, captures came only as a result of an oversight by myself or my opponent or due to a mutually recognized immediate trade of pieces. Sometimes captures were ignored all together. This little trick caused a near explo- sion in my cranium. It was possible to sacrifice a piece with a higher pur- pose in mind! From this victory I deduced all the wrong lessons. Now I was more convinced then ever that I was close to solving the mystery of chess and what to do in the opening. I now believed that the key to victory was devel- oping the Queen early in order to raid the flanks, and that in this way an early checkmate was possible. As experience would prove, I was completely wrong. At this time, most of my games were usually lopsided affairs where my opponents would delight in taking my entire army first, before check- mating my King! That was simply the way it was done. Most of the time, I was checkmated without the aid of any of my pieces or pawns on the board. This was another reason why the victory just described resonated so loudly: Black's very own pieces blocked Black's King from escaping. Thus I came to arguably the greatest pitfail for all beginners: an over- whelming fascination with the Queen's power. My concern for its wellbe- ing became so great that the game ceased to be interesting when Queens were traded or-worst of all-lost! Let's look at one more of my typical victories from this period. First I must confess that I wasn't entirely com- fortable with White. I was unsure if I should play l.e4 and 2.Qh5 or 2.Qf3, l.d4 and 2.Qd3, or l.c4 and 2.Qb3. My rate of success was pretty good with all three tries but I was dy-no-mite with the Black pieces! Witness the following epic. Known Fiend versus Yasser Seirawan My chess-playing friends and I fell into a pattern of playing certain open- ing formations that we liked. My friends liked this move because they had Early Days seen Bobby Fischer play it. None of us knew why. My answer would come like lightning. 1 ,e4 d5 This is actually not a bad opening move, and it goes by the name of the Scandinavian Defense-although at the time I didn't know that.

2.exd5 Qxd5

I was already in my glory. My Queen had been introduced into the game with a wide-open field. Now I'd ferret out a weakness to capture.

3. Nc3

This good move attacks my Queen and forces it to move again. This move hadn't yet made an impression upon my young mind, as it had always been my intention to play with my Queen. 3,..Qe6+? My Queen is misplaced here and will be forced to move again. The open- ing theory of the Scandinavian Defense is that 3...Qa5, keeping Black's Queen out of danger, is the recommended move. My choice of move is typical of beginning players. The expression "patzer (weak player) sees a check, patzer plays a check" is appropriate for this move.

4. Be2 Qg6

I've discovered a potential weakness in White's g2-pawn and immediately take aim, as shown in Diagram 6.

5. Bb5+?

Played in true patzer style, this move ignores the obvious threat to capture the g2-pawn. White should defend the g2-pawn by 5.Bf3. In this case White would look to play Ngl- e2-f4 in order to attack Black's Queen.

5...C6! DIAGRAM 6.

CHAPTER ONE

The venerable grandmaster Victor Kortchnoi would describe this very good move as "a blind hand finding a seed." I block the check to my King while returning the threat to White's Bishop.

6.Ba4?

White again overlooks the threat to the g2-pawn; the retreat 6.Bfl is the best move.

6.. .b5

I seize the opportunity to attack White's Bishop once again. A better move is 6...Qxg2, following through on the planned raid.

7. Nxb5?

White sacrifices a Knight for doubtful compensation. After 7.Bb3 Qxg2

8.Qf3 White could have limited his losses to a pawn.

7.. .Qxg2! 8.Nc7+

White happily forks King and Rook. After 8.Qf3 Qxf3 9.Nxf3 cxb5

10.Bxb5+ Bd7, Black would have a clear advantage in force as he has won

a Knight for a pawn. Of course, at this point in my career, this advantage was by no means decisive!

8.. .Kd8 9.Nxa8 Qxh1

As shown in Diagram 7, the Rook trade leaves White in a desperate situa- tion, as his King will soon be exposed. 1O.Kf1 Bh3+! 11.Ke1?? This terrible move loses the game almost at once. After the forced ll.Ke2 Bg4+ 12.f3 (the move my opponent had overlooked)

12...Qg2+ 13.Kd3 Bf5+ 14.Kc3,

White's King is trotting around the board, but it is still a fight.

11...Qxg1+ 12.Ke2 Bg4+

13.f3 Bxf3+!

DIAGRAM 7.

Early Days This fine move separates White's Queen from the protection of the King.

14.Kxf3 Qxd1 +

At the position shown in Diagram 8, White resigns. Unhappy about the loss of his Queen and with no ambitions for the remaining pieces, my opponent gave up. A number of similar victories convinced me of the correctness of my new approach. Developing my Queen as quickly as possible gave chances for an early knockout raid. It was certainly more successful than my Cannon Opening! Destroying the Queen Raid It was at this point that I discovered a coffeehouse in Seattle's University Dis- trict called The Last Exit on Brooklyn. The chess players who met here were far more experienced players than my usual circle of friends. It was here that my Queen Raid approach received a number of nasty setbacks. The harshest lesson was the following game, which left a deep impression. Yasser Seirawan versus Known Experienced Player This was a big game for me. I was playing an experienced adult chess player and was anxious to prove my newfound understanding of opening play. My opening had but one aim: creating an avenue for my Queen to develop. 1 .e4 e5 Black responds with the Classical King Pawn Defense. I didn't know the defense had a name, but it was a standard counter in my circle of friends.

DIAGRAM 8.

CHAPTER ONE

2.Qh5?

Of course I was very happy to play this mistake, allowing my Queen to immediately begin its attack. Naturally, I'm poised to grab Black's eS- pawn.

2.. .NC6

This reaction put the brakes to my plan. Black easily defends my one and only threat. It was time to create another.

3. Bc4

White threatens 4.Qxf7, which is well known as the Scholar's Mate. The term wasn't known to me, but the threat certainly was! How would my experienced opponent react?

[diagram]
In a good move, Black blocks my threat to the f7-pawn and attacks my Queen as well. Undeterred, I retreat my Queen and renew the same threat.

4. Qf3

Thus far I was very proud of my play. Aggressive from the start, I had held the initiative and was really taking the game to my opponent! Surely he felt the same way too?

4.. .Nf6!

Black calmly blocks my threat to the fZ-pawn and develops another piece. Now I fully concentrated to find something creative. After some intense thought, I found a nifty idea.

5.Qb3?

As I was about to discover, this was a mistake. At the time, I really liked this move because it fit perfectly with my newfound knowledge. The fZ- pawn is attacked yet again-how brilliant I am!-and my Queen is per- fectly positioned to grab the b7-pawn if opportunity allows. Yes indeed, things are really going my way!

5.. .Nd4!

Black's excellent response is one my young mind didn't appreciate. Of course Black's Knight attacks my Queen, but my opponent apparently Early Days hadn't realized my threat so I eagerly seize the opportunity to cap- ture a pawn with check, as shown in Diagram 9. 6,Bxf7+ I was certainly proud of this move. My opponent is forced to move his King, I'm a pawn up, and I'd be vic- torious after just a few more stern moves. I was a bit perplexed that my esteemed opponent was not per- turbed by the need to move his King.

6.. .Ke7 7.Qc4

In the far recesses of my mind a doubt appeared. I was surprised that I didn't have an immediate checkmate. What a pity that 7.Qe6 isn't check- mate! In that case, either the d7-pawn or the d4-Knight would capture my Queen. My first idea was to play 7.Qb4+. (My second check in a row! I would be on a roll.) But after 7...Kxf7, I'd lose my Bishop and my Queen would be under attack.

[diagram]
Where did this unexpected move come from? Wasn't I the one making all the threats? Black's move attacking my Queen forces me to give up the protection of my Bishop. 8, Qc5+ Kxf7 I was very sorry to see the capture of my valiant Bishop. After all, this Bishop had forced Black's King to move. Now my hand faltered. I had intended to grab Black's e5-pawn when my attention was drawn to my c2- pawn. My goodness! After 9.Qxe5 Nxc2+ lO.Kdl Nxal, my King will have been checked and I would lose a Rook. 9,Qc3

DIAGRAM 9.

CHAPTER ONE

A rather painful retreat, but I couldn't allow the capture of the c2-pawn and my Queen had to move.

9...Bb4!

Black unleashes another powerful and unexpected move! I had been warned that my opponent was a "good player." But this apparently wasn't true; my opponent has just blundered a Bishop. My hand reached out to grab the Bishop but faltered. Why? Well, my Queen protects my c2-pawn and if I take the Bishop... Yikes! It dawns on me that with 10.Qxb4 Nxc2+, my King and Queen are forked by a Knight. I'd lose my Queen. This means that I can't capture Black's Bishop. What's even worse is that my Queen is attacked again and I must move. I revise my evaluation of my opponent: He is good! He had just set a trap of two moves. He had actually anticipated my move. How on earth had he figured that out? Now my har- ried Queen must move again, but I can't allow the capture of my c2-pawn.

10.Qd3 d5!

At last, a mistake! My opponent has missed my threat of c2-c3 forking Bishop and Knight. Now I'd get the chance to win back the piece I'd lost. Finally, for the last time, my hand faltered yet again. Surely my crafty opponent would not overlook losing a piece? Right, that was the trick! Black's last move introduces the threat of ll...dxe4, winning a pawn, and worse, attacking my Queen yet again!

11. exd5

Fearful of ll...dxe4, I couldn't allow my pawn to be captured. I still had my ambitions. Given the chance, the move c2-c3 would win back my piece. I couldn't believe what had just happened. With another fine attacking move, my Queen was again under attack and had to move. My game is ter- rible. Black's pieces are buzzing about the board and all I have developed is my Queen. The Queen, which I thought was a bully, was getting pushed around. With a heavy heart I abandoned the defense of my c2-pawn and accepted the loss of a Rook. Early Days

12.Qg3

I recall being quite proud of this move. I realized that 12.Qe3 Nxc2+ would fork my King and Queen. Unblinking, my opponent immedi- ately attacked my Queen yet again!

12.. .NH5!

I couldn't believe my opponent had resisted the temptation to play

12...Nxc2+, which I evaluated as

winning. So why this move? Once again my Queen would have to move, but where? Take a look at Diagram 10 and you'll realize my discomfort. Nearly all the squares avail- able to my Queen are guarded!

13.Qxe5

I avoid stepping into the same ...Nd4xc2+ Knight fork, and I console myself with the thought that I have wiped out a pawn. I saw Black's next move but there was nothing I could do.

13.. .Re8!

By pinning my Queen to my King, the cannon had never seemed more powerful! Knowing my Queen was lost, I captured the Rook. 1 4.Qxe8+ Qxe8+ What a disaster! My Queen is captured and my King is checked. Flus- tered by the suddenness of my losing position, I found my last bad move.

15. Kd1? Bxc2 Checkmate

My experienced opponent didn't bother to announce checkmate and instead left it to me to find a move. (See Diagram 11, on the next page.) With my hand on my King and a puzzled expression, I tried moving my King to a few squares. When I couldn't find a square, I looked at my oppo- nent. He gave me a knowing smile and then said, "Checkmate."

CHAPTER ONE

This game left me shaking my head. After 1 returned home, I went over the game very carefully and came to some startling conclusions:

[diagram]
Queen had actually been chased around the board, having to respond to every threat against it.

[diagram]
developing his forces, I was falling behind. The final position, shown in Diagram 11, was a forceful reminder of how lopsided the victory was. Not a single White piece had been developed. I had played 15 moves and nearly all my pieces were on their original squares. The only two pieces that had managed to make it into the game, my Queen and Bishop, had been captured. This sparked a whole new way of thinking and I discovered another principle: While an early Queen Raid against a beginner is effective, a Queen Raid will not work against an experienced opponent who knows how to coordinate pieces. Chess coaches all over the world understand this truism! Beginners are very vulnerable to Queen Raids. Qnce they learn how to coordinate their pieces and pawns and ward off an early Queen Raid, the strategy fails. The early development of the Queen is a detriment for the other pieces and the strategy boomerangs against the raider. Early Days Danny Noble versus Allison Borngesser,

1998 National Elementary Championships

Before moving on to Chapter Two, I'd like to share the following game. During the time I spent writing this book, I received the June 1998 issue of Northwest Chess, the monthly publication for the Washington and Ore- gon State Chess Federations, which reported on the 1998 National Ele- mentary Championships that had been held in April. National Chess Master Carl Haessler, who has been successfully teaching chess to scho- lastic players for years, accompanied several of his students to the 1998 Nationals and shared their successes and sorrows. Carl's report featured the following game.

1.e4e5 2,Qh5

I look at this move with a knowing smile of understanding. How exciting! Will Black see the threat to the e5-pawn?

2.. .Nf6?

No, the threat is overlooked! As I've previously demonstrated, there is no reason not to protect the e5-pawn.

3.Qxe5+ Be7 4.Bc4 Nc6!

Very good. The raiding Queen is attacked and a piece is developed with tempo.

5.Qf4 O-O 6.e5?

Played in the spirit of the raiding Queen opening, White makes threats as quickly as possible. Much better is developing a piece with 6.Nc3.

6.. .Nxe5??

This mistake costs a Knight. As Black's f6-Knight is attacked by a pawn, it should simply move. Black's choices are 6...Ne8, which is a safe retreat, or she can move and simultaneously attack White's Queen with the ambi- tious 6...Nh5. If White plays 7.Qf3 or 7.Qg4, then 7...Nxe5! 8.Qxh5 Nxc4 allows Black to win back the pawn with a superior game.

7.Qxe5

Things are certainly going in White's favor. He has now won a piece and enjoys a winning position. All of this in only seven moves!

CHAPTER ONE

7...d6

Undeterred by the early setback of material loss, Black continues by developing a pawn with tempo. Unfortunately, this move has a drawback: The e7-Bishop is locked in behind Black's f6-Knight and d6-pawn. This is important because the only open file in the position is the e-file and the e7- Bishop is therefore misplaced. A Rook belongs on the e-file! Stronger therefore is 7...d5!, attacking White's Bishop. After 8.Be2 Bd6! White's Queen is forced to move yet again. In this case, Black is coordinating her pawns and pieces and is beginning to get some play for the lost piece.

8.Qf4 Ng4?

The idea behind the move is to play 9...Bg5, attacking White's Queen. As pointed out before, a stronger move is 8...d5! 9.Be2 Bd6, developing Black's forces with gain of time. Diagram 12 shows the current position.

9.h4?

This looks like the start of a bad idea. Is White combining a Queen Raid and a Cannon Opening? Simplest is 9.Nf3, which develops a piece and pre- vents a 9...Bg5 attack on White's Queen. 9,..Ne5 1O.h5? Inis continues to waste time pursuing an attack that is going nowhere. Again, 10.Nf3 is the correct move. White's wasted moves allow Black to get back into the game. 1O...Nxc4?! Although it's not a bad move, it's not the best. Black could make White's position uncomfortable by attacking White's Queen with 10...Bg5!. The Queen is forced to move and to still lend protection to the c4-Bishop. After 10.Qe4 Re8, the e-file has been cleared with tempo and Black has developed some threats.

DIAGRAM 12.

Early Days 1 1 .Qxc4 Be6 A fine move. While Black has mixed good and bad moves, young Allison has a fine understanding of attacking White's Queen while developing her pawns and pieces. Still, it must be pointed out that the e6-Bishop's new station occupies the e-file. Once again the move 11... d5! should have been preferred.

12.Qc3?

White continues to flounder. The Queen is getting bumped around pretty severely. It would have been better to get out of the way by 12.Qa4, or play

12.Qb5 with a potential capture of the b7-pawn. This latter move could

have been expected as it neatly fits the concept of the Queen Raid. White might have been attracted to 12.Qc3? because in combination with the move h5-h6, a checkmating threat against the g7-pawn would have been created.

12.. .Bf6!

Black is on a roll! She attacks White's Queen yet again.

13. Qd3?

White is losing valuable time. He should play 13.d4, blocking the threat to his Queen and releasing his cl-Bishop for action.

13.. .Re8!

With another fine move, Black brings her Rook to the open e-file and creates a tactical threat, as shown in Diagram 13.

[diagram]
Filled with dreams of glory, White is oblivious to Black's threat. White should develop with 14.Ne2, blocking the e-file. This move is typical of inex- perienced players who concentrate only on what they are doing-not what the opponent might be thinking.

DIAGRAM 1 3.

CHAPTER ONE

14...Bf5+!

A shocking double attack, the discovered check by the e8-Rook doesn't allow the capture of the f5-Bishop. White is forced to lose his Queen.

15.Qe2 Rxe2+ 16.Nxe2g6

Black won the game in 39 moves. Many lessons can be drawn from the above game fragment:

CHAPTER TWO

Basic Opening Principles Journeying often to the Last Exit coffeehouse, I found that a whole new understanding of the chess world opened up to me. By playing against experienced players, I gained a new appreciation for the game. All my opening "innovations" were being neatly refuted, and I was completely unable to survive the opening stages. I'm extremely grateful to all the chess players at the Last Exit who took pity on my poor efforts and began to dissect my opening mistakes. I'd especially like to thank Jeffrey Par- sons and James Blackwood, who happily spent many hours teaching me the game's many mysteries. I soon learned the important principles of opening play. These principles were laid down as follows and they are as valid as ever: A chess game has three phases: the opening, the middle game, and the endgame. In the opening, pawns and minarpieces play the key roles. The major pieces-the Queen and the Rooks-do not. This principle brought a newfound awareness. If I was to have any chance against an experienced player, I had to learn how to use my pawns and to develop my Knights and Bishops first. I had to resist the impulse to raid with my Queen or to expect my cannons to blaze away. Of course I could not do this! Only countless telling losses made me understand this principle. My opponents at the Last Exit beat me like a drum. The word "victory" seemed to apply only to my opponent. Finally, like a stubborn mule, I chose to accept the well-worn path to chess mastery and I learned a slew of new opening ideas.

CHAPTER TWO

While I continued to lose many games, I was also fortunate to witness many games between strong players. One thing that confounded me was how vulnerable the King is in the opening. Time and time again a King was checkmated within 10 to 20 moves. Often a player didn't go after the win of a pawn or a piece but instead launched an all-out assault on an enemy King. This invariably happened when the victim neglected to develop his pieces. The idea that a player intentionally sacrificed mate- rial-usually a pawn -for superior development was quite charming. The concept of sacrificing material for a gain in development is called a gambit. This strategy instantly became one of my favorites. First I had to learn a few more opening principles. The purpose of the opening is to get a safe King and an equal middle game. This principle at first saddened me very much. When I sat down to play a new game of chess, I was charged. I wanted to win right away; the sooner the better! That was the purpose of my Queen Raid and I delighted whenever an opponent fell into the Scholar's Mate. It was Jeffrey who con- vinced me of the correctness of this principle. He asked me how often I had checkmated one of my beginner friends in a Scholar's Mate and I proudly stated, "Lots of times!" Jeffrey nodded and seemed to take some time considering my answer and then asked me, "The last time you won that way, what did you learn?" Actually-except for the fact that my oppo- nent was vulnerable to this well-known trick -I hadn't learned a darned thing! Jeffrey made me start to think of new opening ideas and encouraged me to learn a lot of new pawn formations. Until this time, I had never thought of pawn structures at all. Didn't pawns just get in the way? Or get wiped out? I'm as surprised today as I was then to learn how many chess openings there are -each with an unpronounceable name. Before delving into the enormous complexities of these openings, I'll share another prin- ciple I learned: The underlying goal for all openings and defenses is to control the center. Basic Opening Principles This principle had not occurred to my earliest circle of chess friends. We happily traded pieces, pushed a pawn, delighted in a check, and hacked away at the opponent's army of chessmen. The idea that there should be an all-encompassing way of playing any opening was quite a sur- prise. The key squares are the four in the middle of the board: e4, d4, d5, and e5. Diagram 14 shows the key central squares on the board, each marked with an X. The explanation for this principle is astonishingly simple: Put any piece on one of these squares, and it is at its most powerful. That's because the piece controls or influences more vital squares than if it's placed anywhere else. By controlling or occupying these squares, your pieces are more powerful than your opponent's-an advantage you can use to create attacks and win material! Beyond the key central squares, a greater center covers sixteen squares (c3-c6-f6-f3) , as shown in Diagram 15. By controlling this area of the board with pieces and pawns, a player is better able to conduct an attack on the Kingside or the Queenside flanks. Armed with this understanding of the need to control the center, it became much easier for me to understand why some of the moves for

CHAPTER TWO

those peculiar-sounding openings were played. It was at this point that game notation-writing down the moves of my games- became an impor- tant part of my development. I was able to analyze my games at home and learn if what I played was right or wrong. Along with writing down the moves to my own games, I now discovered that I could replay the games of other players. And some of these players were really good! Early Opening Influences The classic book, Alexander Alekhine's Best Games, by Alexander Alekhine (1982-1946, World Champion 1927-35, 1937-46), was inspiring to me. Ale- khine had a turbulent style of play that I could not understand. His tactical flair was marvelous and he played a wide variety of openings and defenses. His play was beyond me, and his books helped me realize that I had a lot to learn. America's Robert James (Bobby) Fischer (1943-, World Champion 1972-75) was another early influence. The 21 games played in his match against Boris Spassky (1937-, World Champion 1969-72) match brought endless hours of analysis with many players offering their suggestions and answering my questions. (If you use a computer program such as Chess Assistant or ChessBase, these games are probably in the database, which makes them easy to study.) During these analysis sessions I learned about the Sicilian Defense, Poisoned Pawn variation, the Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD), the Pirc Defense, and others. Bobby's favorite opening move was l.e4 and it became mine too. One further and important influence was a booklet called "The Max Lange Attack." The Max Lange Attack became my pet variation because of a pattern known as Legall's (Check) Mate. Jeffrey enjoyed testing his young pupil and nearly every day he would set up a tactical quiz of some sort for me to solve. After setting up the pieces, he had me sit on the Black side. He would then let me ask ques- tions about the game that he would select to be replayed. This aspect of Basic Opening Principles chess thrilled me. We could replay any game that had been recorded exactly as it was first played. It was better than watching a movie because Jeffrey brought the play to life by indicating why a movement had been played. The following game is a classic, but sadly I have no idea who the players were. Unknown Opponent versus Unknown Opponent My Cannon and Queen Raid Openings had taken a back seat forever. I now fully appreciated the importance of developing the minor pieces as early as possible.

1.e4e5 2.Nf3!

White develops a piece and attacks Black's e5-pawn.

2.. .d6

Black adopts a defense known as the Philidor Defense. Today's players consider the Philidor to be too passive, preferring instead to defend the e5-pawn with the classical 2...Nc6, or to counterattack White's e4-pawn with 2...Nf6, known as the Petroff Defense.

3.Bc4

White develops a piece while eyeing the f7-pawn. White's other major choice is 3.d4, attacking the e5-pawn and trying to gain a lead in development.

3.. .Bg4?!

Black is playing rather ambitiously by crossing into White's half of the board without the development necessary to back him up- not a particu- larly good idea. A better continuation is 3...Be7, intending to play ...Ng8- f6 and then castle kingside as soon as possible.

4.Nc3

White continues his development, but he has a number of more purpose- ful moves available. Any of the moves 4.h3, 4.d4, or 4.c3 lead to the estab- lishment of a classical pawn center with d2-d4.

[diagram]
Black will be severely punished for this wasted move. Much better is

4. . .Nc6, which develops a piece and controls the e5 and d4 squares.

CHAPTER TWO

Openings

5.Nxe5!

This stunning move completely amazed me. This move puts White's Queen in jeopardy which was all I needed to know to keep me from playing such a move. Without a second's hesitation, I showed my understanding of the position by capturing White's Queen, failing Jeffrey's quiz for that day.

5...Bxd1?

A bad error. Black should accept the loss of a pawn and play 5...dxe5

6.Qxg4 Nf6 7.Qg3 when White has won a pawn with advantage.

6. Bxf7 + Ke7 7.Nd5 Checkmate!

The final position, shown in Diagram 16, thrilled and delighted me. What a checkmate! Wow! Known as Legall's Mate, this mating pattern seemed to brand itself on my mind. I spent my next few games trying to repeat this same pattern on all my opponents! Unfortunately, no one ever gave me such an opportunity and so I was cast back to learning more abouit open- ings from Jeffrey. Readers of the Everyman Chess series will recognize this game from Play Winning Chess. Repeating the pattern again emphasizes what an impact this sacrifice had on my chess development. White willingly lost his queen - a whole Queen! and pulled off a check-mate. Wow! Some beginners give up when they lose their Queen, the only piece they learned how to move. Introduction to Classical Openings As soon as I began to compete with more experienced players, I had a new outlook: I really began to understand chess openings, the principles of play, pawn structures, controlling the center, protecting

DIAGRAM 16.

Basic Opening Principles my King, open files, outposts, gambits, tactics, combinations-and even the names for most of them. Although the task of learning all this seemed Herculean at first, the opening principles are so clear that the moves just seemed to logically follow one another. This brings us to my next principle: Strive to play stronger opponents. Playing stronger opponents means losing lots of games and I certainly don't like losing! So to begin with, I shied away from opponents who would stomp on me with ease. On the other hand, I realized that I learned a lot more from my losses. Summoning up my courage, I began to play those who I knew would clobber me. The effort certainly paid off. Playing stronger opponents is simply the best way of improving your game. Study- ing is fine, but forging yourself in the fires of competition is the best. The term opening refers to moves initiated by White (for example, 'White opens the game with..."), and the term defense refers to Black's reaction. Classical openings fall into two separate groups:

[diagram]
Classical King Pawn openings and Queen Pawn openings, as well as their respective defenses, create different types of middle games. The nature of the play between the two groups of classical openings and defenses are very distinct. I can make some general comparisons: King Pawn Openings Sharp play ensues immediately Queen Pawn Openings The fight is delayed until later in the game The King is less vulnerable Strategic play is fundamental Opening slips aren't as meaningful Memorizing lines is less necessary The game usually lasts longer The King is more vulnerable Calculating variations is fundamental An opening slip can cost the game Certain lines require memorization The game is often shorter

CHAPTER TWO

As you can see, each of the two classical openings has different appealing aspects. If by nature you prefer to attack and you enjoy sharp forcing lines, then a King Pawn opening is a natural choice. If you prefer to build up your position by collecting small advantages, then a Queen Pawn opening is just your ticket. In the next two chapters, I take a deeper look at the Classics. If, dear reader, you find these opening lines overwhelming, you're right! Panic! Chess openings are maddeningly complex. Mastering all the openings mentioned in this work requires years or even decades of study. My aim in this book is to point out these complexities and to offer you a solution. The solution will come later, as you must first understand the challenges faced!

WWWWWWWWWWV WWWM

Classical King Pawn Openings Yoou now understand that the key to getting a good position from the pening is to control the center-especially the four most central squares sometimes called "the sweet center"- with pawns and minor pieces. I'll now introduce a new concept: the idea of equilibrium. Take a fresh look at Diagram 17, the starting position. Both armies are per- fect mirrors of one another. The opposing armies are in balance, or what Wilhelm Steinitz (1836-1900, World Champion 1886-94), the first officially recognized World Champion, called the equilibrium. Generations of chess players have debated the outcome of a game that was perfectly played by both sides. Would the games always be drawn? Because White disturbs the equilibrium by moving first, he gains the advantage of being able to develop his army as well as to lay claim to a piece of the center. Black reacts in such a way as to restore the equilib- rium. Thus there is a constant shift- ing in this elusive concept of the equilibrium. If White plays perfectly, then Black should always be playing catch up until the forces of both armies are exhausted (traded) and the game drawn. Theoretically then, a victory occurs when one side has made a mistake and the equilibrium can no longer be restored. DIAGRAM 17.

Just because White moves first doesn't mean that he can only disturb the equilibrium in his favor. Can't White make a mistake? He certainly can. From the perspective of playing for control over the center, my Can- non Opening (l.h4) disturbs the equilibrium, but is a serious error! By my failing to play for control over the center, Black is given a free hand there and after l...d5, Black has gained a central advantage and White's h4- pawn is a potential target. After many generations of chess players have come and gone and with millions of games being played and recorded, we still resort to the most common opening moves:

1.e4

This opening move makes perfect sense. White's pawn occupies the e4- square and further controls the d5-square- the sweet center. White also opens up the diagonal for the fl-Bishop for quick development. White's Queen also has an avenue for possible development. However, you'll recall that one of the principles introduced in Chapter Two tells us to defer such a decision for now. This opening move is called a King Pawn Opening, because the pawn directly in front of the King moves first. Black now faces a dilemma. White's opening move has seized half of the sweet center. If allowed. White will seize the other half of the sweet center with 2.d4. Black's dilemma is how to combat White's opening move. What should be his approach to taking the center? The classical response is to match White's.

1...e5

The equilibrium is restored. Black's response has all the advantages of White's opening move, and now it is up to White to find a way to disturb the equilibrium in his favor. What do you. dear reader, think of Black's move? Black's move should provoke your thoughts, and you might find it is a very worthwhile exercise to look at this move and ask a number of questions. What has Black accom- plished by this move? What can White do? Black has taken a key foothold in Classical King Pawn Openings the center: wouldn't it be wonderful to attack and remove the e5-pawn as soon as possible? Indeed it would. Virtually every move that attacks Black's e5-pawn and seeks its destruction has been tried and cate- gorized! In chess openings, it seems that nothing is new under the sun. White's most common and I believe best move is:

2.Nf3

As shown in Diagram 18, White develops a Knight, attacks the eS- pawn and covers the d4-square. White uses his move wisely, always with an eye toward controlling the sweet center and developing his forces. Attacking the e5-pawn Before I continue with the main line, consider a few of White's major options:

[diagram]
Although these are viable options, the tries that I'll focus upon are those that seek to destroy the e5-pawn at once. The most consequent is:

2.d4

White immediately attacks the e5-pawn with his d4-pawn and seeks its removal. Black's choices are very limited. Defending the e5-pawn, in gen- eral, puts Black at a disadvantage.

2...d6?! 3.dxe5! dxe5

4.Qxd8+ Kxd8

DIAGRAM 18.

In this resulting position, White has achieved a lot. Black has lost the opportunity to castle and his King has been forced to move.

5. Bc4

White attacks the f7-pawn, develops a piece, and has the superior game. Now consider another line:

2.d4 Bd6?!

Black defends the e5-pawn, but the Bishop move allows White the oppor- tunity to develop with tempo.

3.dxe5! Bxe5

4. Nf3

White attacks the Bishop. If the Bishop retreats by:

4...Bf6 5,e5! Be7

White has seized the advantage. Observe White's control over the sweet center. Furthermore, notice that White has developed two units of his army, his e5-pawn and f3-Knight, whereas Black has developed only one, his e7-Bishop.

6. Bc4!

White has developed his Kingside pieces and is prepared to play 7.O-O, thereby safely tucking away his King and allowing him to face the future with confidence. Examine another approach to defending the e5-pawn:

2. d4 Nc6

Illis move defends the e5-pawn and counters with an attack against White's d4-pawn. This defense by Black is called the Nimzovich Defense. White has two choices. 3.d5 attacks Black's Knight and forces it to move again. The better alternative is:

3.dxe5 Nxe5

White succeeds in knocking Black's e5-pawn off the board, and in its place is a Knight that is vulnerable to attack. White can attack the e5- Knight with 4.Bf4, 4.f4, or:

4. Nf3 Nxf3+ 5.Qxf3

Classical King Pawn Openings White has eliminated Black's developed forces and has two units devel- oped himself. White has gained the advantage. Danish Gambit The preceding lines show that when facing 2.d4, Black should not defend his e5-pawn on move two. Instead he should capture the d4-pawn:

1.e4e5 2.d4 exd4!

This is Black's best move. He wins a pawn and leaves it up to White to decide how to get it back.

3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3

This is known as the Danish Gambit. White sacrifices a pawn but has developed two units, the e4-pawn and the c3-Knight. Black will have to catch up in development and comfort himself with the thought that he has won a pawn. The Danish Gambit is a particularly powerful gambit against beginning players. Center Game If White is not inclined to sacrifice a pawn he can try: 1 .e4 e5 2.d4 exd4!

3.Qxd4

White has developed two units, whereas Black has developed none! On the surface this looks like a pretty good deal for White, except for one fac- tor: White's Queen is vulnerable to attack and Black responds by develop- ing his Knights.

3...Nc6!

This move develops his Knight and forces White to move his Queen again. In this way, Black develops with tempo.

4. Qe3 Nf6

Black has now caught up in development. This opening variation is called the Center Game and its main line continues:

5. Nc3

ChWPTfR THRH While it seems like a good idea to attack Black's Knight with 5.e5, continu- ing with 5...Nd5 6.Qe4 Nb6 gives Black a fair game. Enterprising players might also like the gambit 5...Ng4 6.Qe2 d6! 7.exd6+ Be6 8,dxc7 Qxc7, in which Black sacrifices a pawn for a significant lead in development. We can conclude that 5.e5 would be premature.

5.. .Bb4 6.Bd2 O-O

7 .O-O-O Re8! This is the main line of the Center Game. Both sides have their trumps: White, with his e4-pawn, has more central influence with excellent attack- ing chances on the Kingside; Black has a ready-made attack on the e4- pawn with a possibility of further attacks upon White's Queen. King's Gambit As an alternative to attacking Black's e5-pawn with 2.d4, White has the centuries-old option of initiating the King's Gambit. 1 .e4 e5 2.f4 This line of play is fantastically complicated and dozens of books have been written on this popular gambit. Black can initiate King's Gambit Accepted by playing:

2.. .exf4

White hopes to play Bclxf4, thereby regaining the pawn with a superior position. White's position is considered superior because Black's e-pawn has moved twice (,..e7-e5 and ...e5xf4), while White will have eliminated Black's e-pawn and developed a piece of his own. The two tempi that Black spent moving his pawn would be history. Black doesn't have to accept the gambit. He can play 2...Bc5 to initiate the King's Gambit Classical Declined, or he can try the Falkbeer Counter Gambit with 2...d5. Both variations have been greatly scrutinized by opening theorists who claim that Black gains a reasonable position with either move.

3.Nf3

Classical King Pawn Openings This develops a piece and blocks the possibility of ...Qd8-h4+, which would disturb White's King.

3.. .g5

Black shows his determination to hang onto his extra pawn. Black wants to rule out the possibility of Bclxf4.

4.Bc4

White calmly develops his pieces and plays for the attack. A main alterna- tive is 4.h4, which attempts to break up Black's Kingside.

4.. .g4

In a surprising move, Black also plays for the attack. By giving White's f3- Knight the boot, Black intends to play ...Qd8-h4+ the moment the f3- Knight moves.

5.O-O!?

White initiates the Muzio Gambit and willingly offers a Knight to increase his development. Playing 5.Ne5 Qh4+ 6.Kfl Nf6 with the intention of play- ing ...Nf6-h5-g3+ can be dangerous for White. Such variations require careful study of the opening manuals.

5.. .gxf3

Black accepts the offered sacrifice.

6.Qxf3

White recaptures a pawn for the Knight, arriving at the position shown in Diagram 19. The Muzio Gambit has been analyzed by generations of players. Does White have sufficient compen- sation for his Knight? The answer seems to be yes. Does he have enough compensation for the advan- tage? The answer is no. Most

DIAGRAM 19.

theorists consider the Muzio Gambit to be a draw. I encourage you to read other books to find out why! Main Line, continued To deal with White's crucial attempts to attack and obliterate the e5-pawn on move two, we've wandered a bit afield from the main line:

1.e4e5 2.Nf3

Now reset the pieces and see the most common reaction:

2.. .Nc6

Black defends the eb-pawn and simultaneously guards the d4-square. Petroff (or Russian) Defense Even on move two, Black has another possible defensive move:

2.. .Nf6

This move initiates the Petroff Defense. (In Russia, it's called the Russian Defense'.) Instead of busying himself with the defense of his e5-pawn, Black counters with an attack of his own against White's e4-pawn. The Petroff Defense, while considered a solid choice, is also considered a bit passive. White has two major options for attacking the e5-pawn once more: 3.Nxe5 or 3.d4. The choices are a matter of taste and study!

3.Nxe5 d6! 4.Nf3 Nxe4

Black has regained his pawn. White can muster a small advantage in a symmetrical position by:

5.Qe2 Qe7 6.d3 Nf6

7.Bg5 Qxe2+ 8.Bxe2 Be7

White has a slight lead in development. Although this is not the best play for White, this line shows that White can ensure himself of a small open- ing advantage against the Petroff Defense. Classical King Pawn Openings Ruy Lopez (Main Line, continued) Return once again to the main line:

1.e4e5 2,Nf3 Nc6

These moves lead to the position shown in Diagram 20. White now faces a major theo- retical crossroad. The main line is:

3.Bb5

This move initiates the Ruy Lopez Opening. Most players simply call it "the Ruy." (Another common name for this line is the Spanish Game.) The Ruy is arguably the oldest opening in chess. It can be traced to the sixteenth century, a time when the best players came from Spain. The opening is credited to Spanish priest Ruy Lopez (1530-80), who hailed from Estremadura, Spain. The idea makes perfect sense. White wants to destroy the e5-pawn, which has one defender, the c6-Knight. So if White can capture the c6- Knight, the e5-pawn will likely wobble and fall. Of course, White has other options for move three, which I describe in the following sections.

DIAGRAM 20.

Scotch Game Once again the most direct style of play is to attack the e5-pawn.

3.d4 exd4 4,Nxd4

The opening is called the Scotch Game. Today's highest-rated player, Garry Kasparov (1963-, World Champion 1985-present), has employed the Scotch Game from time to time with enormous success. Black gains noth- ing from trading Knights by 4...Nxd4? 5.Qxd4. White's Queen-although

prematurely developed-is hardly assailable in the middle of the board in this position. Black's best play is thought to be an attack on the e4-pawn:

4.. .Nf6 5.Nxc6

White feels obligated to make this trade. After 5.Nc3 Bb4, the e4-pawn comes under attack yet again.

5.. .bxc6 6.e5

White makes the most of his e4-pawn. After 6.Bd3 d5 7.exd5 cxd5 the game is considered dynamically balanced.

6.. .Qe7

Black resumes the attack on White's e-pawn yet again. 7,Qe2 Nd5 At last, Black's Knight is forced to give way. While White has accom- plished his goal of obliterating Black's e5-pawn, the position isn't all that rosy for him. Black stands but one move away from neutralizing the posi- tion with ...d7-d6, which knocks out White's e5-pawn.

8.c4

White now seeks to boot the d5-Knight to a passive square.

8.. .Ba6

Black pins White's c4-pawn to the Queen and brings about the position shown in Diagram 21. This position from the Scotch Game is one of the most awkward positions for either side to play. Once more, I encourage further study of this position from manuals devoted to this fascinating opening. Italian Game When I began my career, my favorite DIAGRAM 21. opening variation was: Classical King Pawn Openings

1.e4e5 2,Nf3 Nc6

3, Bc4 These moves initiate the Italian Game. Diagram 22 shows the start- ing position of the Italian Game. Besides the sound idea of develop- ing a piece and preparing to castle Kingside, the thematic idea behind the Italian Game is to take clear aim at the f7-pawn and, by extension, Black's King. The Italian Game is a dangerous opening for Black and he has to navigate some tricky tactical lines.

3.. .Bc5

This is a reasonable move, as Black also develops his Bishop. Two Knights Defense and Traxler Gambit A key alternative for Black following l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 is:

3.. .Nf6

Black counters with an attack against the e4-pawn, initiating the Two Knights Defense. White can shore up his e4-pawn by 4.d3 or 4.Nc3, or he can initiate a complex attack: 4, Ng5 This attacking move has been debated for centuries! By continuing to attack the f7-pawn, White plays consistently. But with only two pieces developed, is White's attack premature? In my younger days, attacking was the most enjoyable aspect of chess and I certainly didn't hesitate mak- ing this move. Nowadays I'm no longer sure the attack is correct. It seems that the f7-pawn can't be defended, but the attack can be blocked:

4.. .d5

DIAGRAM 22.

As always there is a key alternative. Black can sacrifice the f7-pawn in a gambit! 4. . .Bc5, called the Traxler Gambit, offers the f7-pawn. White should play 5.Bxf7+, because the natural 5.Nxf7 Bxf2+! 6.Kxf2 Nxe4+ 7.Kgl Qh4

8.g3 Nxg3! has been worked out to a draw. Therefore (l.e4 e5 2,Nf3 Nc6

3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 Bc5) 5.BxfZ+ Ke7 6.Bd5 is the often-played line for White.

Black has lost a pawn and compromised his King. By continuing 6...Rf8

7. Nf3 d6 8.d3 Bg4, Black has ample development for his lost pawn. As

always, I encourage further study of the pertinent opening manuals.

5.exd5

Diagram 23 shows the resulting position, the main position of the Two Knights Defense. Black has a number of ways to play the position, all of which have been scrutinized at great length. One alternative is 5...Na5 6.Bb5+ c6 7.dxc6 bxc6

8.Be2 h6 9.Nf3. White's pieces have been beaten backwards, but Black has

lost a pawn. Play most often continues 9...e4 10.Ne5 Qd4 ll.f4 Bc5 12.Rfl, with a complex game ahead as both players have their trumps. Another major choice from Diagram 23 is 5...b5, the Ulvestad Varia- tion, a surprising move that aims to deflect White's Bishop away from the f7-pawn. Continuing: 6.Bxb5 Qxd5 7.Nc3 Qxg2 8.Qf3 Qxf3 9.Nxf3 Bd7

10.O-O Bd6 ll.Bxc6 Bxc6 12.Nxe5

Bxe5 13.Rel. This line is consid- ered slightly advantageous for White. Fried Liver Attack Return to Diagram 23 and play the main line. To recap:

1.e4e5 2.Nf3 Nc6

3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5

5.exd5 Nxd5

Black has sensibly recaptured the DIAGRAM 23. pawn and is now eyeballing White's Classical King Pawn Openings g5-Knight. Not to be deterred, White boldly plunges ahead:

6.Nxf7 Kxf7 7.Qf3+

With this move, White initiates the colorfully named Fried Liver Attack. White has a double attack against King and the d5-Knight, forcing Black's King into the center.

7.. .Ke6

By placing his monarch in the midst of the battle, Black hangs onto the extra Knight at a dangerous price. White continues to attack the d5- Knight, which is a feint. Black's King soon becomes a target as well!

8.Nc3 Nce7 9.d4!

White makes an excellent move in an attempt to pry open the center.

[diagram]
It would be a mistake to play 9...exd4 10.Nxd5 Nxd5 ll.Qe4+!, whereby White regains his sacrificed Knight. Diagram 24 shows the current position, where Black has defended the Knight once more. Playing the Fried Liver Attack as White brought me hours of joy. I'd do my best to bring my pieces into play as quickly as possi- ble, while Black would try to hang onto his extra piece and to bring his King back to the relatively safe c7-square. Diagram 24 deserves close study, and I recommend playing the position out with your friends to determine which side has best disturbed the equilib- rium! Evans Gambit Return now to Diagram 22 and the Italian Game, which starts l.e4 e5

2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4. Continue with:

3...Bc5

From this position, White has four main options:

[diagram]
I'll discuss each option in turn. The first option, 4.O-O, brings his King to safety, which is quite rea- sonable, but the move isn't considered that dynamic. Black plays 4...Nf6, continuing a balanced game.

4.b4!?

This energetic pawn sacrifice is known as the Evans Gambit. As usual, the idea behind the gambit is to pick up a lead in development. Black must accept the gambit:

4.. .Bxb4 5.c3

White attacks the Bishop in order to support the central thrust, d2-d4.

5.. .Ba5 6.d4

White reveals his strategy. He wants to open up the center, anticipating that his development will bring him the superior game.

6.. .exd4

Some theorists prefer 6...d6! 7.Qb3 Qd7 as the correct defensive continuation.

7.O-O dxc3

Black greedily captures all the morsels being offered. Diagram 25 shows the current position. Black has captured three pawns, but his position is dangerously behind in development. White quickly goes on the offensive:

8.Qb3! Qf6 9.e5!

With a move that is even stronger than 9.Bg5, White also gains a tempo. Black's Queen must now guard the f7-pawn:

9.. .Qg6 1O.Nxc3 Nge7

11.Ba3!O-O 12.Rad1

White's development is a thing of beauty. His pieces are poised for central domination and Black's position is under a great deal of pressure. The two Classical King Pawn Openings pawns are a heavy investment, but Black will almost certainly have to give back his material gains to neu- tralize White's pressure. This is another position with which you should challenge your friends, play- ing alternating sides. Giuoco Piano Another option for White's move four in the Italian Game, which starts l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5, is:

DIAGRAM 25.

4.c3

This is quite a direct attempt by White to grab the center. Just as in the Evans Gambit, White insists on playing d2-d4, which attacks the e5-pawn and, as an added bonus, the c5-Bishop. This move is known as the Giuoco Piano. Black is quick to respond in the center too:

4.. .Nf6 5.d4

White continues to play in the cen- ter.

5.. .exd4 6.cxd4

The position in Diagram 26 makes a very agreeable impression. White's two central e4- and d4-pawns create a formation called the classical pawn center. It seems that White has achieved all that he could hope for and best of all, with tempo! Further- more, Black's c5-Bishop is attacked. But before dismissing Diagram 26 as superior for White, let me ask

DIAGRAM 26.

you a question: Has Black made a mistake? I can't see how Black's previ- ous moves were wrong. Therefore, if Black hasn't made a mistake, has the equilibrium been disturbed to his disadvantage? The answer can only be no! It is these very fundamental, basic questions which will help you in your quest for opening understanding. By constantly asking such ques- tions, you will help yourself find the truth in your favorite openings. How should Black continue?

6.. .Bb4+ 7.Bd2

White blocks the check. White could try 7.Nc3 Nxe4 8.O-O Bxc3 9.d5, ini- tiating the Moeller Attack. Theorists consider this line to be all bark and no bite. By continuing 9...Bf6 lO.Rel Ne7 ll.Rxe4 d6, Black has a fine game.

7.. .Bxd2+ 8.Nbxd2 d5!

In a crucial reaction, White's classic center is destroyed.

9.exd5 Nxd5 1O.Qb3 Nce7

Diagram 27 shows the main position of the Giuoco Piano, which practice has shown to be roughly equal. Max Lange Attack My favorite choice for move four in the Italian Game (l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6

3.Bc4 Bc5) is:

4,d4!? This move starts the Max Lange Attack. I enjoy making this para- doxical sacrifice. Black has geared his development toward control- ling the d4-square and undeterred, White places a pawn squarely in Black's jaws. This startling move makes a lot of sense in the Italian DIAGRAM 27. Game. With the Evans Gambit and Classical King Pawn Openings Giuoco Piano, White aims for d2-d4 with a preparatory move, spending a tempo. My attitude: Why waste a move? Black gleefully accepts the offering:

4.. .exd4

This is the main line of the Max Lange. A key alternative is 4...Bxd4

5.Bg5 Nf6 (5...f6 6.Nxd4 Nxd4 7.Be3 Ne6 8.O-O completes White's devel-

opment and gives him a chance to attack with Qdl-h5+) 6.Nxd4 Nxd4 7.f4 d6 8.f5, in which White has sacrificed a pawn for an annoying bind. My opponents usually preferred the main line:

5.O-O Nf6

Once more, Black can avoid the main line by 5...d6 6.c3 dxc3 7.Nxc3, when White has shed a pawn for a dangerous lead in development.

6.e5 d5!

In many variations of the classical King Pawn openings, this rejoinder is a key counterpunch. If Black is forced to move his f6-Knight, disaster strikes quickly: 6...Ng4? 7.Bxf7+ Kxf7 8.Ng5+ Kg8 9.Qxg4 Nxe5 10.Qe4 d6 ll.Qd5+ Kf8 12.f4!, when White wins.

7.exf6 dxc4 8.Re1+ Be6

9.Ng5

This was my early favorite line of opening play. What a joy it was to play this position (shown in Dia- gram 28) as White! Black has but one saving move:

9.. .Qd5!

I enjoyed a number of victories after the weaker 9...Qxf6? 10.Nxe6 fxe6 ll.Qh5+ g6 12.Qxc5! spears a Bishop. Another bad mistake is

9... O-O? 10.fxg7 Kxg7 (10...Re8

ll.Qh5 Bf5?? 12.Qxf7 Checkmate!) ll.Rxe6! White wins a Bishop with a

DIAGRAM 28.

raging attack, and Black can't regain the lost piece by 11... h6? 12.Rxh6! because White's Rook seems to enjoy a charmed life. Every time Black tries to capture the invading Rook, he loses his Queen. From Diagram 28, the Max Lange Attack continues:

10. Nc3!

A wonderful move! I derive pleasure from moves where I place my pieces in capture, but they can't be taken. This is life on the edge! In this position, it is a good move; White develops with a gain of tempo. 1O...Qf5 The Queen has to move. The Knight is quite safe: 10...dxc3?? ll.Qxd5 wins the Queen.

11. Nce4 O-O-O

Black escapes the center and the Ringside while he has the chance. Cap- turing the f6-pawn by ll...gxf6? 12.g4! Qe5 (keeping the c5-Bishop pro- tected) 13.f4! d3+ 14.Kfl Qd4 15.Be3 is excellent for White.

12.g4!Qe5 13.fxg7 Rhg8

14.Nxe6fxe6 15.Bh6

The current position is shown in Diagram 29. I enjoy playing this main line Max Lange Attack position, scoring heavily with the White pieces. From this line, you should have gained an appreciation for the complexity of this classical opening variation. Yet it isn't even the main variation! I've led us far astray. Alternatives to the Ruy Lopez Main Line Return with me to Diagram 20 (l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6). From this position,

DIAGRAM 29.

Classical King Pawn Openings

3.Bb5 initiates the Ruy Lopez Opening. It has long been held that White's

third move puts the most pressure on Black's position. There is the con- stant threat of White's capturing the c6-Knight and snipping the e5-pawn. Black's earliest defenses include:

[diagram]
Steinitz Defense Making a sensible decision, Black reinforces his e5-pawn.

3.. .d6

Nowadays this move, called the Steinitz Defense, is considered too passive. Black locks in his f8-Bishop and gives White a free hand in the center:

4.d4! exd4 5.Nxd4 Bd7

The effects of the opening moves have favored White. He has better con- trol of the center and freer piece play. Many games continue thus:

6.O-O Nf6 7.Nc3 Be7

8.Re1 O-O

Practice has shown that White has the advantage. Cozio Defense Black covers his c6-Knight but also compromises his f8-Bishop in a line called the Cozio Defense, which is favored by few players today.

3.. .Nge7 4.O-O d6

5.d4 Bd7

Black reveals his point. He hasn't been forced to trade his strong e5-pawn.

6.Re1 Ng6

Black continues to keep his e5-pawn protected. In return, however, White now gains a d5-outpost:

7.Nc3! Be7 8,Nd5 O-O

Black has a safe, if passive, game. Berlin Defense Not concerning himself with the e5-pawn, Black attacks White's e4-pawn as in the Petroff Defense.

3.. .Nf6

This move initiates the Berlin Defense, which continues to be popular even in modern chess tournaments. Theoretically, White should avoid playing 4.d3 Bc5! because he will need to utilize the strike d2-d4 to prove an advantage.

4.O-O

White leaves the e4-pawn en prise, reasoning that he will soon win the pawn back.

4.. .Nxe4 5,d4!

This is White's point. With Black's King still in the center, White wants to rip open the e-file. The Berlin Defense continues:

5.. .Nd6

It would be unwise to play 5...exd4? 6.Rel d5 7.Nxd4, leaving White with the dangerous threats of Nd4xc6 and f2-f3.

6.Bxc6 bxc6

The Berlin also offers the intriguing ending 6...dxc6 7.dxe5 Nf5 8.Qxd8+ Kxd8, which at first glance seems bad for Black. This line was champi- oned by Emanuel Lasker (1868-1941, World Champion 1894-1921), the second official World Champion, who felt that Black's two Bishops were sufficient compensation for losing the right to castle and the doubled Queenside pawns.

7.dxe5 Nb7 8,Re1 Be7

9,Nc3 O-O 1O.Qe2 Nc5 Classical King Pawn Openings Diagram 30 shows the main position of the Berlin Defense. Theory con- siders the position slightly better for White. Bird Defense A second leap of the Knight, called the Bird Defense, represents a radi- cal solution by Black.

3.. .Nd4(?!)

He moves the same developed piece twice, which gives me a chance to introduce another principle: Whenever possible, avoid moving the same piece twice in the opening. This principle should serve as a guide and a warning. It is not to be taken as a rule! If a piece is attacked and is forced to move, then by all means do so! The principle is that players should develop all their forces as quickly as possible. By singling out just one piece, a player is neglect- ing the rest of the crowd. The purpose of the Bird Defense is to get away from White's Bishop and to control the d4-square. Play continues: 4,Nxd4! exd4 5.O-O c6

6.Ba4

White moves his developed Bishop twice-violating my latest principle- but is forced to do so. The Bishop is attacked.

6.. .Nf6 7,d3d5

8, Bg5 dxe4 Weaker is 8...Be7 9.Bxf6 Bxf6 10.exd5 Qxd5 ll.Rel+ Be6?! 12.Bb3, which gives the advantage to White.

9.dxe4 Be7 1O.e5 Nd5

11,Bxe7Nxe7 12,Bb3 O-O 13,Nd2

DIAGRAM 30.

Diagram 31 shows the result of the Bird Defense, which theorists con- sider advantageous for White. Classical Defense Another response to the Ruy Lopez Opening is the Classical Defense.

3...Bc5

Black ignores White's play and instead develops his own Bishop. This reasonable decision asks White how he intends to further his DIAGRAM 31. central influence.

4.c3

As we've seen, White prepares to establish a classical pawn center with d2-d4.

4.. .Nf6

Unimpressed, Black responds with a counterattack to the e4-pawn. This line is quite comparable with the Giuoco Piano variation (Diagram 26); the key difference is that White's Bishop is on the b5-square instead of the c4- square. This difference means that the sting of a possible . . ,d7-d5 counter will be missing.

5.d4 exd4 6.e5!

Now Black's f6-Knight is forced to move. The counter 6. . .d5? 7.exf6 would cost Black a piece.

6.. .Ne4 7.O-O!

White exploits a crucial nuance. Black's forces in the center are awkward. Black had expected 7.cxd4 Bb4+ 8.Bd2 Nxd2 9.Nbxd2 O-O ll.a3 Bxd2

12.Qxd2 d6 with a balanced game.

7.. .d5

Capturing by 7...dxc3? 8.Qd5! c2 9.Qxe4 cxbl=Q (this is a busy pawn!) lO.Rxbl gives White a grand lead in development for the price of a pawn. Classical King Pawn Openings

8. Nxd4!

This move is even stronger than

8.cxd4 Bb6 9.Nc3, which is also

favorable for White.

[diagram]
Diagram 32 shows the current posi- tion.

9. Bxc6!

White avoids 9.Nxc6 bxc6 10.Bxc6 Ba6!, rightfully concerned that the coordinated attack on the f2-pawn would be good for Black.

9.. .bxc6 1O.f3!

This is stronger than 10.Nxc6 Qh4, where Black again attacks the f2- pawn.

10.. .Ng5 11.Be3 Ne6

12.f4

White has the advantage. Schliemann Defense The Schliemann Defense is a plain old ornery reaction to the Ruy. Black reasons that since White's Bishop isn't patrolling the a2-g8 diagonal, he can counterattack White's center with this dangerous pawn thrust.

[diagram]
Black takes a risk by loosening up the defenses around his King, but White has to be careful to prove an opening advantage:

4.Nc3

The cautious 4.d3 fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 7.Qd3 Be7 8.Qc4 is slightly bet- ter for White because Black has weakened himself on the a2-g8 diagonal.

4.. .fxe4 5.Nxe4d5

Black goes all out for the fight for the initiative. White can no longer play cautiously and must ride the tiger.

DIAGRAM 32.

6.Nxe5 dxe4 7.Nxc6Qd5!

This leads to Diagram 33, which is a mess. Theorists have wrestled with this position for some time. White should continue:

8.c4 Qd6 9.Qh5+ g6

1O.Qe5+Qxe5 11.Nxe5+c6

12.Ba4

There is an important trick worth memorizing: After 12.Nxc6? a6!

13.Ba4 Bd7!, Black snares a piece.

12...Bg7 13.d4exd3

14.Bf4

These moves provide a sharp game that isn't unfavorable for Black. The Schliemann Defense remains one of the sharpest adventures in the Ruy. Players be warned! This variation requires careful preparation! Morphy's Defense (Main Line, continued) Return now to the Ruy Lopez main line (l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5).

3...a6!

This move, introduced by Paul Morphy (1837-84), puts the question to White's Bishop of its intentions. It is based upon the tactical resource 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.Nxe5 Qd4!, when Black recaptures the e-pawn under favorable cir- cumstances. Morphy's Defense has become the favored move for a century. White is faced with a choice: Should he trade his Bishop for a Knight, or should the Bishop retreat? Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation The Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation has had entire books devoted to it.

4.Bxc6 dxc6

DIAGRAM 33.

Classical King Pawn Openings Diagram 34 shows quite an enigma. Which player profits best from the trade? Most grandmasters prefer Bishops to Knights, but no less a player than Bobby Fischer liked to trot out the Exchange Variation on occasion. White has a long-term endgame advantage due to the dou- bled pawns, but Black has a middle game with two Bishops before him. Standard play continues:

5.O-O

5.Nxe5 Qd4 6.Nf3 Qxe4+ 7.Qe2

Qxe2+ 8.Kxe2 Bg4 is a comfortable variation for the second player.

5.. .Bg4!

Black puts his Bishop to work immediately. Another favored choice is

5...f6 6.d4 Bg4 7.dxe5 Qxdl 8.Rxdl fxe5 9.Rd3 Bd6, with approximately

equal play. 6,h3 White borrows a page from Black's opening book by questioning the Bishop's intentions.

[diagram]
A snappy retort! Black wants to keep the pin as long as he can. White has a small plus after 6...Bxf3 7.Qxf3 Qd7 because Black's pawn structure has been compromised. Worse, 6...Bh5?

7.g4 Bg6 8.Nxe5 Bxe4? 9.Rel will be

disastrous for Black. Diagram 35 shows the current position. White has to navigate his

DIAGRAM 35.

way to an advantage with care. It is easy to go wrong. As you might guess, capturing Black's Bishop is a direct path to disaster. (Take heart, I took the Bishop and lost the first time I reached this position.) Best is:

7. d3!

Capturing the Bishop opens up the h-file to a checkmating attack: 7.hxg4? hxg4 8.Nxe5? Qh4! 9.f4 g3 and White can resign with confidence. There are no hidden brilliant moves to stave off checkmate. Nor can White pull off a central buildup like in the Italian game: 7.c3 Qd3! Black threatens to capture White's Knight and double up White's pawns. Continuing: 8.hxg4 hxg4

9.Nxe5 Bd6! 10.Nxd3 Bh2+ ll.Khl Bd6+ ends in a draw by perpetual check.

7.. .Qf6

This early development of the Queen is correct in this position. As we've seen. Black aims to double White's pawns. 8, Be3 White develops his pieces and acquiesces to doubled pawns. He could have tried 8.Nbd2, preventing Black from completing his threat, but his development is thereby blocked. Black would continue with 8...Ne7 men- acing ...Ne7-g6-f4. Once more, continuing 9.hxg4? hxg4 10.Nh2? Qh4 works splendidly for Black.

8.. .Bxf3 9,Qxf3 Qxf3

1O.gxf3 Bd6 The position is considered equal. Ruy Lopez (Main Line, continued) Because the Exchange Variation results in an approximately equal position, White's Bishop usually retreats (l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6):

4.Ba4

Diagram 36 shows the current position of the main line. White retains his Bishop and keeps up the pressure on the a4-e8 diagonal.

4.. .Nf6

Classical King Pawn Openings Black happily brings his Knight into battle, confronting White with the issue of what he wants to do about his e4-pawn. If he was so inclined, Black could play 4...b5 5.Bb3, with play similar to the Italian Game. Playing 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 b5 5.Bb3 is favorable for White when compared to 3.Bc4 for several reasons. On the b3-square, White's Bishop is less vulnerable than on the c4-square- especially when Black tries varia- tions with the ...d7-d5 shot. Fur- DlAGRAM 36. thermore, the b5-pawn is a potential weakness. White might play a2-a4 to expose such a weakness.

5.O-O

Countless games have proven that only this move offers White a chance for an advantage. Defending the e4-pawn by 5.Nc3 Bc5 6.d3 d6 is a harm- less line. Equally timid is 5.d3 Bc5 6.c3 b5 7.Bc2 d5, when Black has good play. White's final defensive try is

axb5, with equal play. The current position, shown in Diagram 37, brings Black to a major crossroad. He has to choose between the Ruy Lopez Open Varia- tion with 5. . .Nxe4, or the Ruy Lopez Closed Variation with 5...Be7. The Closed Variation is the deci- sion preferred by most grandmas- ters and constitutes the main line. ire > DS>

DIAGRAM 37.

Ruy Lopez Open Variation How does the Open Ruy work?

5.. .Nxe4 6.d4!

White seeks to open the position to his advantage by forcing pawn trades. Keep in mind that White's King is nice and safe whereas Black's King is several tempi away from vacating the center. Opening the position poten- tially endangers Black's monarch.

6.. .b5

It would be a mistake to play 6...exd4? 7.Rel d5 8.Bg5, as Black would be in a precarious situation.

7. Bb3 d5!

Black reins in his ambitions of winning pawns. Black avoids 7...exd4?

8.Rel d5 9.Nc3! Be6 (9...dxc3 10.Bxd5 Bb7 ll.Bxe4 Be7 12.Qe2 freezes

Black's King in the center) 10.Nxe4 dxe4 ll.Rxe4 Be7 12.Bxe6 fxe6

13.Nxd4! because White would recover his pawns with advantage.

8.dxe5 Be6

This leads to the key starting position of the Open Ruy shown in Diagram 38. The position is extremely dynamic and hard to judge. Black's Queen- side is extended and vulnerable to a possible a2-a4. The d5-pawn is also a possible target but this isn't usually Black's Achilles' heel. Black's advanced d- and b-pawns have left the c5-square lacking protection and as play unfolds, White tries to conquer this square. On the plus side, White's e5-pawn isn't having a disruptive impact. Black's pieces are all potent and he has every expectation of a fighting game. White's three major tries are 9.Qe2,

9.c3, and 9.Nbd2. A number of

these variations have transposi- DlAGRAM 38. Classical King Pawn Openings tions. All three lines are extremely complex and books have been devoted to them! My recommenda- tion for White is to play the forcing:

9.Nbd2

Threatening to capture on e4, White disrupts Black's position. The bene- fit of this move is that it forces play into a narrow line.

9.. .Nc5 1O.c3

White makes room to retreat his b3- Bishop.

10.. .d4 DIAGRAM 39.

Practice shows that this move is required. White gets a favorable bind fol- lowing 10...Nxb3 ll.Nxb3 Be7 12.Nfd4! Nxd4 13.cxd4, and he has control over the c5-square. Diagram 39, after Black's tenth move, shows the key position of the Open Ruy Lopez.

11.Ng5!

Practice has shown that this incredible move makes life difficult for Black. The tactical justification for this move is that ll...Qxg5?! 12.Qf3 Kd7

13.Bd5! is good for White. I encourage you to do further research on this

exciting and dynamic position. Ruy Lopez Closed Variation (Main Line, continued) In the meantime, return to the main line (l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6

4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O):

5...Be7

This initiates the Ruy Lopez Closed Variation. Black quite contentedly develops his Bishop and prepares to exit his King to safety. White again is

asked to find a way of disturbing the equilibrium to his favor. The path is rather narrow. Delayed Exchange Ruy Lopez White has two key choices. He can play the main line, 6.Rel, defending the e4-pawn. Or he can play the Delayed Exchange Ruy Lopez:

6. Bxc6

Besides these two main variations, White can play 6.d3, simply shoring up the e4-pawn and planning to complete his development. This, however, is the move that Black has been waiting for. Black so far has avoided ...d7- d6, fearing the immediate reaction d2-d4. Once White has played 6.d3 d6!, Black doesn't have to worry about d2-d4 and the pressure on his position is quite tolerable. The stutter step by White's Bishop, Bb5-a4xc6, seems to lose time.

6.. .dxc6

Isn't Black better off than in the usual Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation? Yes and no. White reasons that the extra moves presented to Black have pre- vented him from utilizing defenses based upon ...Bc8-g4 or ...f7-f6 and that the e5-pawn is under more pressure than before.

7.Re1

After this move, Black is in a bit of a quandary. How will he defend his eS- pawn? Both 7...Bd6 or 7...Qd6 are met by 8.d4, whereupon 8...exd4? 9.e5 will cost Black material. Neither does 7...Bg4 8.h3 suffice. Black can't play 8...h5? 9.hxg4 hxg4 10.Nxe5, as White wins a piece. In this case, Black no longer has an attack down the h-file. Thus the Delayed Exchange Ruy Lopez has its fans. Black's best move is:

7.. .Nd7 8.d4 exd4

9.Nxd4 Nc5

Diagram 40 shows the current position. White has given up the two Bishops for a structural advantage. The position is approximately equal and is another good position to play against a friend. Classical King Pawn Openings Ruy Lopez Closed Variation (Main Line, continued) Most grandmasters prefer not to give up their a4-Bishop at move six and instead continue (l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7):

6.Re1

This move reinforces the e4-pawn and renews the threat of Ba4xc6 and Nf3xe5, as shown in Diagram

41. While this sixth move of White

is the most common choice and indeed the main line, it also is a violation of my latest principle! White moves the same piece, his Rook, twice. Isn't this move a waste of time? This is one of the great chess debates. When a player castles, he moves both King and Rook at the same time, the only moment when mov- ing two pieces at once is allowed. Many centuries ago, the movement of castling was considered so valuable, the player was charged with two moves. A player would first move his King and then after his opponent had moved, he would then be obliged to move his Rook. Castling is a wonderful privilege that should be coveted. The King sprints to a flank and is usually out of harm's way. The Rook is developed and put into action. The rules of chess clas- sify castling as a movement of the

DIAGRAM 40.

DIAGRAM 41.

King. Thus, players would argue that White doesn't waste a tempo by moving his Rook to the center. I urge you to review the principles listed in Chapter Two in order to form an opinion about this move. Although the move is classified as a King move, I believe that when castling the Rook is also developed. After castling, I much prefer to leave the Rook right on the square where it lands unless I'm obligated to do otherwise. In Diagram 41, White's Rook reinforces control over the sweet center. More importantly, however, White didn't have a convenient way of defend- ing his e4-pawn. As we've seen, White is trying to create a classical pawn center by playing for both e4- and d4-pawns to stand abreast of one another. If White plays 6.d3, then Black responds 6...d6 and has nothing to fear. Similarly, 6.Nc3 b5 7.Bb3 isn't so useful. Black plays 7... O-O and asks White if 8.d4 is his intention. Quiz. Can you figure out what Black would do after l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Nc3 b5 7.Bb3 O-O 8.d4? The solution is at the end of this chapter. This brings me to another opening principle: To be effective, Rooks belong on open files. When there are no open files, centralize your Rooks to the e- and d-files. On the e-file, White's Rook provides potent backup to the e4-pawn. If Black tries to play ...d7-d5 and knock the e4-pawn out of the way, White's Rook will then be open for operations down the e-file. White's 6.Rel restores the lingering threat to capture the c6-Knight and then the e5-pawn. Black addresses this threat with a tempo by:

6...b5 7.Bb3

White moves his Bishop for a third time in the space of seven moves! Is this not terrible? Well, yes it is. White has spent a lot of moves upon his Bishop, but he didn't waste these moves. He moved his Bishop when it Classical King Pawn Openings was attacked by Black's pawns. While Black has developed his pawns with tempo, their advances can also be argued as a potential weakness. The squares that these pawns once controlled have to find other means of protection. Black now moves his King to safety:

7. ..O-O

This move brings us to the position pictured in Diagram 42, a position that has likely been seen more often "

DIAGRAM 42.

than any other opening. The play of both sides has been sensible and straightforward. Both players have been developing their forces and protecting their Kings, all while playing for central control. Which side stands better? This question really has no answer, for the game is still beginning! From this position, reams of analy- sis and opening ideas have been catalogued. White has three main moves: 8.a4, 8.d4, and the main line, 8.c3.

DIAGRAM 42.

Ruy Lopez Anti-Marshall Variation The Ruy Lopez Anti-Marshall Variation offers a bit of a surprise and a marked departure from the usual focus upon the sweet center.

8.a4

This move aims to prove that Black's b-pawn sticks out like a sore thumb and deserves a little attention. White's obvious threat of 9.axb5 provokes a response:

8.. .Bb7

Black protects his a8-Rook and eyes the e4-pawn.

9.d3

At long last, White commits his d-pawn.

9.. .d6

And Black does the same. With the e5-pawn now firmly protected, the question of an advantage is decided by which player will best activate his pieces. 1O.Nc3 White develops with tempo, and the b5-pawn is still a target.

10. ..b4 11.Ne2

Seeking to reposition the Knight on the Kingside, White has fewer pos- sibilities for an advantage after DIAGRAM 43. ll.Nd5?! Nxd5 12.Bxd5 Na5!

11...Na5 12.Ba2 c5

13.Ng3

In this position, shown in Diagram 43, White is considered to have a small advantage due to a likely Kingside attack. Certainly, chess books are filled with games played from this position. Still, most grandmasters prefer to play the main line. One other interesting try is going after the center:

8.d4

This move involves a sacrifice:

8.. .Nxd4! 9.Nxd4

White has to sidestep 9.Nxe5?! Nxb3 10.axb3 Bb7 due to Black's powerful Bishops.

9.. .exd4 1O.e5

White must avoid 10.Qxd4? c5! ll.Qdl c4, which snares the b3-Bishop.

10.. .Ne8 11.c3!dxc3

12.Nxc3

White has sacrificed a pawn for superior development. Theorists don't consider this gambit to be good enough for White. Classical King Pawn Openings Ruy Lopez (Main Line, continued) The main line (l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Rel b5

7.Bb3 O-O) remains the most often played moves.

8.c3

White's whole strategy has been geared toward commanding the center and establishing a Classical Pawn Center. This is another major theoretical crossroad for Black. He has the fan- tastically complex choice of the Marshall Gambit, 8...d5, or he can play the main line, 8...d6. Ruy Lopez Marshall Gambit One of America's strongest players was the renowned Frank James Mar- shall (1877-1944). Marshall was a wonderfully inventive player who came up with a number of attacking ideas. He will forever be immortalized due to his discovery of the Marshall Gambit. According to legend, Marshall would sleep with a pencil and paper by his bedside so that in case he woke up in the middle of the night, he could quickly scribble down his inspira- tion. "You never know when you might get an idea," he would intone. In 1909, Marshall was recognized as one of the top players in the world when he agreed to play an exhibition match against the then- unknown Cuban chess talent, Jose Raul Capablanca (1888-1942, World Champion 1921-27). The match was to be a tune-up for the well-known veteran, and the whole chess world was shocked when Capablanca soundly thrashed Marshall by the one-sided score of 8-1 with 14 draws. (In 1921, Capablanca would become World Champion by defeating Eman- uel Lasker.) For Marshall, his loss to Capablanca was a heartfelt one and he prepared his revenge. Marshall came up with the idea for his gambit and spent the intervening years waiting for the moment to spring his sur- prise upon Capablanca. In 1918 the perfect circumstances presented themselves, and Capablanca fell right into Marshall's surprise weapon. However, many years of diligent preparation couldn't match the natural

talents of Capablanca. Over the board, Capablanca played a near- perfect game and won! Marshall Gambit games have been played ever since. The Marshall Gambit is reached by (l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6

4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Rel b5 7.Bb3

O-O 8.c3):

8...d5

Diagram 44 shows the current posi- tion. Based on the principles I've described, this move is a fine one -except that Black loses a pawn in free- ing his game. Is it worth it? Play is now forced:

9.exd5 Nxd5 1O.Nxe5 Nxe5

11.Rxe5 c6!

Marshall's original idea was ll...Nf6, aiming at ...Nf6-g4 and ...Be7-d6 with an attack on the h2-pawn. Later it was discovered that the d5-Knight sits on a fine square and should stay put as Black wants to play ...Be7-d6 and ...Qd8-h4, leaping to the attack. The most common moves are 12.d4 Bd6 13.Rel Qh4 14.g3 Qh3 15.Be3, with countless games being played. Go to your local library, check out a book on the Marshall Gambit, and enrich your knowledge of this fascinating gambit.

DIAGRAM 44.

Ruy Lopez (Main Line, continued) Not every player likes to gambit a pawn, especially as Black. While the Mar- shall Gambit is a fearsome weapon, preference is usually given to the solid (l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Rel b5 7.Bb3 O-O 8.c3):

8...d6

Classical King Pawn Openings Black takes a stand in the center, protects his e5-pawn, and prepares to develop his Queenside pieces. White now plays a paradoxical move as his main choice:

9.h3!?

Diagram 45 shows the position and draws us to my next principle: Every opening move should have a purpose. Most opening moves should be motivated by one of the following reasons:

[diagram]
Of the four reasons in this principle, the one that most often guides opening decisions is playing to control the sweet center. Capturing, retreating, and protecting the King will become second nature. Such moves are made automatically and are in the minority. Controlling the center motivates most moves. With this in mind, how can White's ninth move of the main line Ruy Lopez be the culmination of centuries of master games? Certainly, 9.h3 doesn't fit with any of my principles and it might even be argued that this move even weakens the King's pawn shield. Why waste a precious tempo on such a move? White's opening moves are guided by his desire to control the center. For some time he has been winding up for the move d2-d4. Why didn't White just play it? After 9.d4 Bg4!, White faces an awkward pin upon his f3- Knight. This pin in turn puts pressure upon White's center. Many games have continued with 10.Be3 Na5! (10. . .Nxe4? ll.Bd5 wins a piece-another

trap worth remembering!) ll.Bc2 (ll.dxe5 Bxf3 is considered an even game) 11 . . . Nc4, and Black has proven to have an equal position. As this straightforward try failed to prove an advantage, White players tried another tack: l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Rel b5 7.Bb3 O-O 8.c3 d6 9.d4 Bg4 10.d5. In this way, White achieves a central pawn wedge. It took some time, but the way to an even position was dis- covered: 10...Na5 ll.Bc2 c6! 12. h3 Bc8! 13.dxc6 Qc7! After this series of precise defensive moves, Black would recapture the c6-pawn with good piece play. Dissatisfied by the effects of the annoying pin, ...Bc8-g4, White spent a whole tempo stopping it. Diagram 45 is too rich in its choices for Black. It would take a series of opening books just to get through them all. I'm choosing but one and calling it the main line. First let me list popular alternative moves to the main line.

[diagram]
Each of these alternative moves has something unique about it, which makes them all worthy of study. To my mind, the most consequent choice is:

9.. .Na5

Anticipating that White will one day push his d-pawn up the board, Black's Knight gets out of the way while seeking to push the b3-Bishop to a less powerful diagonal. 1O.Bc2 White gets the hint and retreats his Bishop to safety. In general, grand- masters are quite protective of their Bishops and prefer them to Knights.

[diagram]
Classical King Pawn Openings 'Illis was Black's deeper plan. He brings another pawn into the battle for supremacy of the sweet center. Note how often the players aspire to attack the sweet center.

11.d4!

At long last, after what seemed like lengthy delays, White has established his classical center and now seeks to complete his development. The first piece of happy news is that Black's e5-pawn is now under attack.

11.. .Qc7

Having first developed a number of his pieces, Black feels the time has come to introduce his Queen into battle. Black defends the e5-pawn and begins a little pressure along the c-file. His goal is to harass the c2-Bishop.

12. Nbd2

White develops a Knight, with the intent of maneuvering over to the King- side in a classic Ruy Lopez.

12...Bd7

Black has to carefully choose where he wants to develop his Bishop. Both 12,..Bb7 and 12...Be6 invite 13.d5, shutting off the Bishop's future. Black chooses this safe square and vacates the c8-square for a Rook.

13.Nf1

White continues to redirect his Knight toward the Kingside. Brom there, he can use the g3-square to jump to the fb-outpost, or he can use the e3-square with the option for the d5-outpost. White's last move leads to Dia- gram 46 and the end of this survey of classical King Pawn openings. The ideas and plans shared should leave you with the impression that while there is much to learn, the ideas

behind the moves are easy to understand, especially when you consider the principles of opening play. SOLUTION. The problem for White after l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3,Bb5 a6

CHAPTER FOUR

Classical Queen Pawn Openings Icn the same manner as I did in Chapter Three, in this chapter I survey lassical Queen Pawn openings and their defenses. I'll follow a main line while considering a large number of deviations along the way. At all times, I'll discuss the fundamental ideas and the principles involved. Queen Pawn openings, as their name suggests, begin with White mov- ing the pawn in front of his Queen:

1.d4

Proponents of l.d4 make an excellent argument for their favorite opening move. White's d-pawn strikes and occupies the sweet center, avenues for both the Bishop and Queen are opened, and the pawn is supported by White's Queen. Recall that in Chapter Three, White's e4-pawn was con- stantly besieged and required protection. In Queen Pawn openings, the d4-pawn has built-in protection. Proponents of l.e4 make a counterargument: l.d4 doesn't help the development of White's Kingside forces and White's King must remain in the center for at least an extra tempo or two. So you must weigh the pros and cons in making an opening choice. Using Steinitz's theory of equilibrium, Black's reply is expected:

1...d5

Black establishes a pawn in the center and stakes a claim to White's e4 and c4-squares. How is White to follow up? White has four main options, which I discuss in turn:

[diagram]
CHAPTER FOUR

[diagram]
Chigorin Variation White has taken several approaches in playing for control of the center, including:

2.Nc3

White plays directly in the center, trying for e2-e4 and quick development. This move is called the Chigorin Variation. If White is able to play e2-e4, the variation works well for White and he gains an advantage. Black can put a stop to White's plans by:

2...Nf6

This makes it difficult for White to reinforce his control over the e4- squarc. White now has two direct choices:

[diagram]
Richter Attack The Richter Attack begins (l.d4 d5

2.Nc3 Nf6):

3,Bg5 As shown in Diagram 47, White's aim is to eliminate the f6-Knight so that he can play e2-e4 with a lion's share of the center. Black can respond to this aggres- sive try with 3...Bf5, developing a Bishop while covering the e4-square; or 3. . .Nbd7, defending the f6-Knight.

DIAGRAM 47.

Classical Queen Pawn Openings Black should expect White to sacrifice a pawn and to try to force through e2-e4. Often the f5-Bishop becomes a target.

4. f3

White revs up for his central push and Black doesn't have an easy choice to make. If he tries 4...e6?, 5.e4! will be powerful due to the pinned f6- Knight. Black must play:

4.. .Nbd7

Black's Bishop development is premature.

5.e4 dxe4

6. Bc4

White's lead in development leads to a dangerous gambit. This line is par- ticularly potent against beginning players. The Chigorin Variation in combination with the Richter Attack (l.d4 d5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Bg5) is not to be trifled with, and Black has to play with care. I prefer the second choice for Black:

3.. .Nbd7!

4. f3

Once more White winds up for his center push.

[diagram]
Black responds with his own counter in the center.

5.dxc5

White could play the defensive 5.e3, but this negates his strategy of play- ing for e2-e4. Black would play 5. . .e6 with a fine game. Neither would the immediate 5.e4 cxd4 6.Qxd4 e5! work, when Black has seized the center and has the better position.

5.. .e6

Black prepares to recapture the c5-pawn.

6.e4

White completes his plan but at a cost. Black's counter in the center has been quite timely.

6.. .Bxc5

CHAPTER FOUR

7.exd5

White has won a pawn but his position is weakened on the gl-a7 diagonal. By continuing:

7.. .Qb6

Black has the superior position. Blackmar-Diemer Gambit Clearly, Black can handle the Richter Attack (l.d4 d5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Bg5 Nbd7!) with confidence. Therefore a favorite continuation of club players is the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit (l.d4 d5 2.Nc3 Nf6):

3.e4

White immediately gambits a central pawn for quick development. Black should not be intimidated: he has played two reasonable opening moves and collects the offering.

3.. .dxe4

4.f3

White attacks the e4-pawn in order to continue his development.

4.. .exf3

5. Nxf3 Bg4

White has a slight lead in development and open lines for his pieces. It is doubtful that he has full compensation for the pawn. Nevertheless, the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit remains a favorite. Mason and Levitsky Variations Besides developing his Queen Knight on move two, White has also tried developing his Queen Bishop by (l.d4 d5) 2.Bf4 (the Mason Variation) and 2.Bg5 (the Levitsky Variation). Both of these moves have as their aim setting up a solid central position with e2-e3. White wants to first develop his Bishop outside the pawn chain (f2, e3, and d4). The problem with both these moves is that they don't put sufficient pressure on Black's center. By proceeding cautiously, Black obtains a fine game: Classical Queen Pawn Openings

2.Bf4 Bf5 3.e3 e6

4.c4

White tries to disturb Black in the center. Without this move, Black would just play . . .Bf8-d6 with a balanced game. But in view of what happens, the text is too risky for White.

4.. .Bxb1!

In a surprising move, Black trades a developed piece for an undeveloped one. But Black's plan of ...Bf8-b4+ is quite strong.

5.Qa4+

Aware of Black's threat of 5...Bb4+, White first tries to guard the b4- square before capturing the Bishop.

5.. .Nc6 6.Rxb1 Bb4+

7.Kd1 Bd6!

Diagram 48 shows that White cannot castle, and Black can face the future with confidence. Similarly, the Levitsky Variation (l.d4 d5 2.Bg5) isn't much of a prob- lem for Black. Black can play:

2.. .Nf6

3. Bxf6 exf6

With the two Bishops for the dou- bled pawns, Black has the advan- tage. Or he can try the aggressive:

2.. .f6

3,Bh4 Nh6 Black lays plans to eliminate White's h4-Bishop by playing ...Nh6-f5.

DIAGRAM 48.

CHAPTER FOUR

Queen's Gambit (Main Line) By an overwhelming margin, White's favored second move is:

2.c4

White immediately attacks the d5-pawn and threatens to capture and elim- inate Black's center. By commencing the Queen's Gambit, White hopes to entice Black into capturing the c4-pawn, and after a subsequent recapture. White would then have a lead in development. The Queen's Gambit is shown in Diagram 49. If White is allowed to play c4xd5 unimpeded. Black's center is destroyed. Black has several choices:

[diagram]
Queen's Gambit Accepted The Queen's Gambit Accepted (QGA) follows White's plan of knocking Black's d5-pawn out of the center. Play begins (l.d4 d5 2.c4):

2...dxc4

White can play 3.Qa4+, immediately recapturing the c4-pawn. But this action causes a premature develop- ment of White's Queen. It is better for White to try to recapture the c4- pawn with the fl-Bishop. The sim- plest move is: DIAGRAM 49. 3,e3 Classical Queen Pawn Openings A key alternative is 3.e4. Expanding upon the same idea. White gains a larger share of the center. The problem with this is that Black is also quick to react in the center: 3,..e5 attacks the d4-pawn. After 4.Nf3 (it is a mistake to try to win the e5-pawn with 4.dxe5? Qxdl+ 5.Kxdl Nc6, when Black gets a good position) 4...exd4 5.Nxd4 Nf6, Black has an even game. In the QGA, Black usually allows White to recapture the c4-pawn. He hopes that he too will attack the center with his own . . ,c7-c5 to reestablish the equilibrium.

3.. .Nf6

4,Bxc4 White has accomplished his goal: The d5-pawn has been removed and he has gained a lead in development. Play usually proceeds:

4.. .e6 5.Nf3 c5

6.O-O

Diagram 50 pictures the main position of the QGA. White has a lead in development, which gives him an advantage. Black aims to equalize by trading pawns on the d4-square. The QGA is an excellent defense for those players who like to counterattack. Its drawback is that if White plays accurately, he will keep an advantage for a long while. Slav Defense One of the most solid defenses to the Queen Pawn opening is the Slav Defense, which was favored by Vasily Smyslov (1921- World Champion 1957-58) and Mikhail Botvinnik (1911-95, World Champion 1948-57, 1958-60, 1961-63). The Slav Defense begins (l.d4 d5 2.c4):

2...C6

DIAGRAM 50.

CHAPTER FOUR

Black bolsters his d-pawn and offers White a symmetrical position after:

3.cxd5 cxd5

This position, shown in Diagram 51, is known as the Slav Defense Exchange Variation. White has a small advantage in having an extra tempo for development.

4. Nc3 Nf6 5.Nf3 Nc6

6.Bf4

This results in a slightly better posi- tion for White. When confronted with the Slav Defense, many players pre- fer not to trade central pawns. They reason that the c6-pawn blocks Black's b8-Knight from the useful c6-square. However, if White decides not to trade pawns on the d5-square, he has to keep an eye out that Black doesn't capture the c4-pawn and then play . . ,b7-b5, keeping the pawn forever. The preferred way to meet the Slav Defense (l.d4 d5 2.c4 c6) is to pro- tect the c4 and d4-pawns with:

3.e3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6

5.Nf3 Nbd7

Diagram 52 shows the position reached. This line of the Slav Defense is known as the Merano Variation. It is an extremely rich and fascinating position preferred by the young lions on the interna- tional chess circuit. Black intends to play ...d5xc4 and ...b7-b5-b4, with play similar to the QGA.

DIAGRAM 51.

DIAGRAM 52.

Classical Queen Pawn Openings Besides choosing the Merano Variation, White can also play (l.d4 d5

2.c4 c6):

3. Nc3

This leaves Black with the choice of 3...dxc4 or 3...Nf6. The latter is the most common choice. But White has to be aware that 3...dxc4 4.e4 (the Alekhine Variation) b5 5.a4 b4 6.Na2 e5 leads to a very sharp position, for which he should be prepared!

3.. .Nf6

White often keeps the tension in the position by playing:

4. Nf3

Once again Black faces a crossroad. Should he capture the c4-pawn with

4...dxc4 or reinforce his center once more with 4...e6 (the Semi-Slav

Defense)? This decision seems to be an even split.

4.. .dxc4

Diagram 53 shows the current position. Black's capture is what gives the Slav Defense its unique flavor. Black intends to play ...b7-b5, hanging on to the captured c4-pawn.

5.a4

With this move, the Alapin Variation, White prevents the protection of the c4-pawn. Play now proceeds:

5.. .Bf5 6.e3 e6

7.Bxc4 Bb4 8.O-O O-O

White, with a slight advantage, will try for the central break e3-e4, but for the moment, Black controls the e4-square. Besides the Alapin Variation, White can sacrifice a pawn (l.d4 d5

2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nf3 dxc4):

5.e4

White doesn't prevent ...b7-b5 and instead grabs the center.

DIAGRAM 53.

CHAPTER FOUR

5.. .b5

6.e5

This is called the Geller Gambit, which is shown in Diagram 54. Play continues:

6.. .Nd5

7.a4

White has a grip in the center but is a pawn behind. After a great deal of practice, theorists consider Black's position to be sound. DIAGRAM 54. Semi-Slav Defense Besides the ...d5xc4 capture which distinguishes the Slav Defense, Black can also play the Semi-Slav Defense (l.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nf3):

4.. .e6

Black reinforces the d5-pawn. White could play 5.e3, which transposes into the Merano Variation, or continue with the aggressive:

5. Bg5

White develops his Bishop and threatens to play e2-e4, now that the f6- Knight is pinned. This move, the Anti-Merano Game, is the prelude to one of the most difficult theoretical puzzles in chess:

5.. .dxc4

Black decides that the time is now ripe to capture the c4-pawn. White's move is expected:

6.e4

White grabs the center and is primed to capture the c4-pawn with a large lead in development.

6.. .b5

Black holds onto his c4-pawn.

7.e5

Classical Queen Pawn Openings Taking advantage of the pinned f6- Knight, White threatens to win a piece. Black has to break the h4-d8 pin.

7.. .h6 8.Bh4g5

9.Nxg5!

White isn't about to allow the pin to be broken.

9.. .hxg5

10.Bxg5 Nbd7

This is the Semi-Slav, Botvinnik Gam- bit. Diagram 55 shows the position. Black is temporarily up a pawn, which White will soon recapture. Current opening theory now continues:

11.g3 Bb7 12.Bg2 Qb6

13.exf6 O-O-O 14.O-O

Black has sacrificed a pawn for a Queenside majority, open lines on the King- side, and play in the center. The resulting position is one of the sharpest posi- tions in opening theory. The world's highest-rated player, Garry Kasparov, has played some sparkling games in this variation.

DIAGRAM 55.

Queen's Gambit Declined (Main Line, continued) The oldest line in the classical Queen Pawn openings is the Queen's Gam- bit Declined (QGD), which begins (l.d4 d5 2.c4):

2...e6

Black protects the d5-pawn and prepares to develop his Kingside pieces. The problem with this move is the obvious plight of the c8-Bishop. It is now locked inside Black's pawn chain and will remain inactive for some time.

CHAPTER FOUR

Grau Variation While the QGD is a solid defensive choice, players have looked for ways of activating their c8-Bishop before committing their e-pawn. The most common tries for Black are 2...Bf5 (the Grau Variation) and 2...Nc6 (the Chigorin Defense). The Grau Variation begins (l.d4 d5 2.c4):

2.. .BI5

Black develops a Bishop and controls the sweet center, but this move has a tactical drawback that earns White an advantage. This allows a moment to introduce another opening principle: Develop your Knights before developing your Bishops. This is a principle that is easily violated and not so easily punished. For this reason, many chess teachers don't emphasize this principle. Nei- ther do I. Nonetheless it is a principle worth knowing-even if you don't pay strict attention to it. The idea of the principle is that in the early open- ing, you're not sure how the position will shape up. Will a diagonal remain open or closed? Will the Bishop have to move again soon? Sometimes, as in the Ruy Lopez, the Bishop move on move three is considered White's best. Other times, as in the Mason and Levitsky Variations, the Bishop moves seem premature. In the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit, Black must be very careful in developing his c8-Bishop. In the Grau Variation, White is quick to take the d5-pawn:

3.cxd5!

This is stronger than 3.Nc3 e6 (now Black is comfortable playing this move) 4.Qb3 Nc6 5.e3 Bb4, when White has only a small advantage.

3.. .Bxb1

Black moves his developed Bishop yet again. The move is actually forced, as 3...Qxd5? 4.Nc3 will be a quick disaster. Black's Queen is attacked and is forced to move again. Further, White will soon play e2-e4, grabbing the center and developing with tempo.

4.Qa4+!

Classical Queen Pawn Openings Only this move, which violates the principle of not developing the Queen early, gives White the advantage. After the recapture 4.Rxbl Qxd5, Black's Queen has taken up a stable square in the center. The a2-pawn is attacked and Black can face the future with confidence. The Grau Varia- tion is particularly effective against beginning players who won't see the necessity of White's fourth move.

4.. .c6

Black makes a forced response. After 4...Qd7 5.Qxd7+ Nxd7 6.Rxbl Ngf6

7.Bd2 Nb6 8.f3! Nbxd5 9.e4, White has gained the advantage with his two

Bishops and a classical pawn center.

5.Rxb1

White recaptures the bl-Bishop. He can also consider 5.dxc6 Nxc6 6.Rxbl e5! 7.Bd2 (to prevent ...Bf8-b4+, which would be quite unpleasant!)

7...exd4 8,g3, with a slight advantage for White.

5.. .Qxd5 6.Nf3 Nd7

7.Bd2

White must avoid 7.Bf4?? Qe4!, which launches a double attack against the f4-Bishop and bl-Rook.

7.. .Ngf6

8.e3

Diagram 56 shows the current posi- tion, where White has an advantage due to his two Bishops and superior central control. Chigorin Defense An altogether different and tricky problem is presented by the Chig- orin Defense (l.d4 d5 2.c4):

2...Nc6

DIAGRAM 56.

CHAPTER FOUR

Black plays for piece play and an open game. Unconcerned with the fight for the d5-square. Black plays for a counterattack against the d4-pawn and seeks to play . . .e7-e5 with an explosion in the center. White's most reliable reaction is to cover the e5-square.

3. Nf3 Bg4

Black intensifies the fight for the e5-square.

4. cxd5

White strips Black of his central bulwark. Black must play energetically to stay in the battle.

4.. .Bxf3!

This move weakens the protection of the d4-pawn. Weaker is 4,..Qxd5

5.Nc3, which gives White a nice advantage.

5.gxf3

After 5.dxc6 Bxc6, Black is doing well. He isn't behind in development and he has control over the sweet center.

5.. .Qxd5

6.e3

White would dearly love to play 6.Nc3, developing with tempo, but first he must fortify the d4-pawn.

6...e5!

7. Nc3! Bb4!

Diagram 57 reveals excellent play by both sides. Black is fighting to avoid the loss of a tempo with his Queen.

8. Bd2 Bxc3

9. bxc3 Nge7

White has a broad center and the two Bishops. White's position is considered to be better, but Black will have play against White's

DIAGRAM 57.

Classical Queen Pawn Openings doubled pawns. His aim is to play ...Ne7-g6-h4. The Chigorin remains a viable defense worthy of study. Queen's Gambit Declined (Main Line, continued) The Queen's Gambit Declined (l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6) has been a favored defense of nearly every World Champion. That fact alone is enough to convince me of its soundness. White has a hard time knocking out the d5- pawn and he immediately puts pressure on this pawn.

3.Nc3

This is the most aggressive move. White can also play 3.Nf3, which often transposes into the main line. Catalan Variation A crucial alternative at this juncture is:

3.g3

White prepares to fianchetto his fl-Bishop so that it can pressure the d5- pawn. The idea of a fianchetto is considered a modern concept. Classical players preferred to leave their Kingside pawns on their original squares so that after castling, the Kingside has no weak squares. (I'll discuss the Kingside fianchetto at length in later chapters.) I'm quite fond of this third move, which introduces the Catalan Variation. White's fl-Bishop will move to the long diagonal hl-a8, which intensifies White's pressure in the sweet center. The drawback of the Catalan is that White's c4-pawn no longer receives the protection of the fl-Bishop. Thus, if Black captures the c4- pawn, White will have to find another piece to recapture with. Black can meet the Catalan by capturing the c4-pawn with ...d5xc4 (the Open Cata- lan) or by blocking the long diagonal with ...c7-c6 (the Closed Catalan).

CHAPTER FOUR

Open Catalan Variation Deciding to capture the c4-pawn is a sensible reaction because the c4- pawn lacks protection.

3.. .dxc4

White intends to recapture the pawn soon. First he completes the fian- chetto:

4.Bg2

White shouldn't be too anxious to recapture the pawn; 4.Qa4+ Bd7 5.Qxc4 Bc6 6.Nf3 Bxf3! 7.exf3 Nc6 8.Be3 Qd5! leaves a fine game for Black.

4.. .Nf6

Black proceeds with his development. He can also consider 4...c5 5.Qa4+ Bd7 6.Qxc4 Bc6 with approximate equality.

5.Nf3

After 5.Qa4+ Nbd7 6,Qxc4 c5, it is highly likely that the game will trans- pose to the line we are investigating.

5.. .Be7

This is the solid choice for Black because he intends quick castling. Black has also tried 5...c5, 5...Nc6, and 5...a6. These enterprising alternatives aim to retain the captured c4-pawn.

6.O-O O-O

7.Qa4

At last White decides it is time to recapture the c4-pawn. In the tempi that it costs White to complete this task, Black aims to neutralize White's fianchetto with one of his own.

[diagram]
Black threatens to secure the c4-pawn with ...b7-b5.

8.Qxc4 b5

9.Qc2 Bb7

In Diagram 58, we see a key starting position of the Open Catalan. Many games have been contested from this position with White playing 10.Bd2,

10.Bf4, and 10.Bg5 as his most popular choices.

Classical Queen Pawn Openings The battle lines are fairly simple: White will try to establish a classical pawn center and outposts on the c5 and e5-squares. Black will play for ...c7-c5, trying to create a symmetri- cal pawn structure and an equal game. Closed Catalan Variation The Closed Catalan is designed to keep the long diagonal blocked. It begins (l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.g3):

3.. .C6

Black hopes that in this way the g2- Bishop will bite on granite. Black's last move, however, contains a trace of poison. White must be watchful for a change of plans by Black. He might grab the c4-pawn and then play ...b7-b5, holding the extra pawn as in the Slav Defense. Worried for the safety of the c4-pawn, White plays:

4.Qc2

Although White is uncomfortable moving his Queen so early, the Queen isn't easily attacked. White has to be aware of a dangerous trap in this line. White can't just play 4.b3? to defend the c4-pawn, because after 4...dxc4

5.bxc4? Bb4+!, White will lose the d4-pawn.

4...Nf6

Black has another major choice at this moment. He can radically change the complexion of the game by trying to control the e4-square.

DIAGRAM 58.

Dutch Stonewall Defense What a marvelous name for a defense: the Dutch Stonewall. Just as the name implies, Black creates a fortress of pawns (d5, f5, c6, and e6) in the center and plays for control over the e4-square. Play begins (l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.g3 c6 4.Qc2):

4...f5

CHAPTER FOUR

Diagram 59 shows the position after Black's fourth move. Clearly, White is going to have a hard time liberat- ing the center with e2-e4, but on the other hand, Black has created a hole, the e5-square, which beckons a White Knight. Play usually proceeds:

5.Nf3 Nf6 6.Bg2 Bd6

7.Bf4

Despite the blocked nature of the position, White has the advantage because he has a superior Bishop and more space. The Dutch Stonewall Defense remains a favorite of amateur players because the ideas for the defender are simple to follow. Trade the pieces that land on the e5-square and move your pieces to the Kingside.

DIAGRAM 59.

Closed Catalan Variation, continued While the Dutch Stonewall is an intriguing defense, most players prefer not to commit their f-pawn so early. In the Closed Catalan (l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.g3 c6 4.Qc2 Nf6), Black aims for quiet development.

5.Bg2 Be7 6.Nf3 O-O

7.O-O

Both players aim to complete their development. Black has a problem of what to do with the c8-Bishop. It's stuck inside his pawn chain, blocked behind the e6-pawn, as shown in Diagram 60.

DIAGRAM 60.

Classical Queen Pawn Openings

[diagram]
Quiz. How would you try to activate the c8-Bishop? The solution is at the end of this chapter. Queen's Gambit Declined (Main Line, continued) At this moment in the QGD main line (l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3), Black can play

3. . .c6, transposing back to a Slav Defense, or he can play 3. . .15 with a Dutch

Stonewall. Because White has developed a Knight hitting the e4-square and the d5-pawn, Black opposes him with a similar scheme:

3...Nf6

Black tries to invite White to trade pawns on the d5-square. Such a trade would benefit Black for the moment! Why? If White tries 4.cxd5 exd5, then Black's c8-Bishop would no longer be blocked and its development would be unimpeded. Tarrasch Defense Because Black is trying to provoke a trade of central pawns, one of the definitive practitioners of classical chess, Siegbert Tarrasch (1862- 1934), devised the Tarrasch Defense, which begins (l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3): 3".c5 From the perspective of fighting for central control, Black's reaction is quite sensible. (See Diagram 61.) White can play 4.e3 Nf6 5.Nf3 Nc6,

DIAGRAM 61.

CHAPTER FOUR

producing a symmetrical position with White having the move. In general, this line of play offers White only a minimal advantage. Therefore, on move four, White's main line is to capture in the center:

4. cxd5

Black should be pleased at having provoked this capture. He now has to decide between 4...cxd4 (the Schara-Hennig Gambit) and the usual

4...exd5, recapturing in the center.

Schara-Hennig Gambit The Schara-Hennig Gambit is an excellent weapon for beginning players. Black aims for rapid piece development (l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c5 4.cxd5):

4...cxd4

This capture provokes White's Queen to develop early so that Black can attack it with gain of tempi.

5.Qxd4 Nc6!

This is Black's key move. The d5-pawn is pinned and White has to move the Queen. Diagram 62 shows the position and how Black's Knight is developed with tempo. White withdraws the Queen:

6.Qd1 exd5

7.Qxd5

White has won a pawn but has made several moves with the Queen, which has cost him time.

7...Bd7

Black continues developing while preparing ...Ng8-f6, also with tempo. Black has tried 7...Be6

8.Qxd8+ Rxd8. Black's play dis-

plays the results of a classical gam- bit. Although Black is a pawn

DIAGRAM 62.

Classical Queen Pawn Openings down, its sacrifice has been for quick development. Still, White is con- sidered to have an advantage in this middle game position.

8.e3 Nf6

9.Qb3

White will try hard to catch up in development while Black will try to coordinate an attack. Practice favors White. Tarrasch Defense, continued For those players who don't like to gambit pawns as Black, the Tarrasch Defense (l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c5 4.cxd5) is the natural reaction.

4...exd5

White has tried a large number of moves here:

is the Tarrasch Gambit, and after the theoretical recommendation

lent position.

[diagram]
are 5.Nf3 Nc6. Black rein- forces the pressure on the d4-pawn. White can now try

6.e3 Nf6 7.Bb5 cxd4 8.Nxd4

Bd7, which is slightly better for White. Or he can play the popular fianchetto varia- tion, called the Schlechter Variation: 6.g3 Nf6 7.Bg2 Be7 8.O-O O-O 9.Bg5. This is shown in Diagram 63.

DIAGRAM 63.

CHAPTER FOUR

Modern practice has shown an advantage for White due to the pressure that White's pieces have in the center. From Tarrasch's view as a classical player, he was certain that Black had achieved an equal game. The Tarrasch Defense was a favorite of Garry Kasparov during his early career. Queen's Gambit Declined (Main Line, continued) White now has several moves available that very often transpose to one another. After l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6, he can try:

[diagram]
played at nearly any moment in the moves ahead, but it is best delayed for the moment.

[diagram]
On which square will he develop the cl-Bishop? 5.Bf4 only encourages 5...Bb4, which puts White on the defensive. White's best move is therefore 5.Bg5, which is very close to the main line. For the sake of accuracy, 1'11 play the correct order of moves.

[diagram]
4.Bg5 is the most effective. I agree with them.

(Besides these main moves, White can also play 4.Bf4, which mis- places the Bishop. After 4...Bb4!, Black pins the c3-Knight and intends a quick ...c7-c5 and ...Qd8-a5 attack. The development of the f4-Bishop doesn't help White counter Black's plans.) My preferred order of moves is (l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6):

4.Bg5

This move (see Diagram 64) makes a lot more sense than the alternatives. The defending f6-Knight is pinned, and White immediately threatens its capture and, if possible, the win of the d5-pawn. To defend against this possibility Black's two main defenses are 4...Be7 (the Tartakover Varia- tion) and 4...Nbd7 (the main line). Classical Queen Pawn Openings Tartakover Variation Chess theorists are evenly split between Tartakover and main line adherents. The Tartakover Varia- tion begins (l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5):

4.. .Be7

Black prepares to quickly castle while breaking the pin on the f6- Knight.

5.e3 O-O

White must make a fundamental decision. Does he intend to delay the development of his gl-Knight with moves such as 6.Qd2, 6.Qc2, or

6.Rcl -or simply develop the Knight? Each of these moves contains its

own peculiarities and Black must be familiar with each of them. Because developing the gl-Knight is the most natural, I'll follow that line:

6.Nf3

This leaves Black with the choice of:

[diagram]
Lasker Defense A favorite defense of former World Champion Emanuel Lasker was (l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.e3 O-O 6.Nf3):

6.. .Ne4

This defense now bears his name. Black's plan is to trade a few minor pieces and gain a reasonable position.

7. Bxe7 Qxe7

DIAGRAM 64.

CHAPTER FOUR

Diagram 65 shows the Lasker Defense. White can choose 8.Nxe4 dxe4 9.Nd2 f5, which is considered about equal. Or he can choose

8.cxd5 Nxc3 9.bxc3 exd5 10.c4,

which is slightly better for White. With the main move. White develops a Rook and defends the c3-Knight:

8.Rc1 Nxc3 9.Rxc3 c6

1O.Bd3dxc4 11.Bxc4b6 This line provides a small advan- tage to White.

DIAGRAM 65.

Neo-Orthodox Defense The Neo-Orthodox Defense begins (l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7

5.c3 O-O 6.Nf3):

6...h6

This puts the question to White's Bishop: Will he exchange Bishop for Knight or move away? (The reason for the strange name, "neo," is that while Black is playing an Orthodox Defense, the idea of inserting the move ...h7-h6 is relatively modern. Classical players didn't like weaken- ing their Kingside.)

7.Bh4 b6

Following the usual retreat, Black decides to fianchetto his c8-Bishop as in the Closed Catalan. This variation is called the Tartakover, Makogonov, Bondarevsky Variation. A mouthful you say? That's why its also called the TMB Variation. I discuss this position (see Diagram 66) and its strategies extensively in Winning Chess Brilliancies (Microsoft Press, 1995), on pages 2-15. In this game (Robert James Fischer versus Boris Spassky, Reykjavik 1972, Game 6), Black retains a solid central position. Classical Queen Pawn Openings Queen's Gambit Declined (Main Line, continued) Return now to the main line (l.d4 d5 2,c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5):

4...Nbd7

Black will try to provoke the trade c4xd5 ...e6xd5, so that the c8- Bishop will develop on the c8-h3 diagonal. With Black's fourth move, he reinforces his f6-Knight, the defender of the d5-pawn.

5.e3

White prepares further development. How many players have fallen into the cunning trap 5.cxd5 exd5 6.Nxd5?? White has thought that he has won a pawn due to the pin on the f6-Knight. Look at Diagram 67 and see if you can spot White's oversight. Black continues 6...Nxd5, which has been quite a shock for many. The Knight isn't as badly pinned as first thought! 7.Bxd8 Bb4+! is Black's point. White has to return the Queen. After 8.Qd2 Bxd2+

9.Kxd2 Kxd8, Black has won a

Knight for a pawn and has a winning advantage in force. White should also avoid: 5.e4?! dxe4 6.Nxe4 h6, which puts the question to White's Bishop at an annoying moment. After the subse- quent moves 7.Bxf6 Nxf6, Black has the preferable position.

DIAGRAM 66.

DIAGRAM 67.

CHAPTER FOUR

5.. .h6

Black puts the question to White's Bishop. White doesn't benefit from the trade 6.Bxf6 Nxf6, so he retreats the Bishop:

6.Bh4

As seen before. White should avoid 6,Bf4?! Bb4!, which provides good play for Black.

6.. .Be7

Black commits his Bishop to break- ing the pin. Black could also try

6...Bb4, but without the possibility

of ...Nf(i-e4, such an attack would be premature. Diagram 68 features our main line position. Now an interesting fight for a tempo ensues. White wants Black to play ...d5xc4 so that he can play Bflxc4 in one gulp, while Black wants White to play c4xd5 so that after ...e6xd5, a path is cleared for the c8- Bishop. On such nuances the question of an advantage resides. White has two choices:

[diagram]
DIAGRAM 68.

Queen's Gambit Declined, Exchange Variation If White wants to clarify the pawn structure, then the Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation is the preferred choice.

7. cxd5 exd5

8, Bd3 White's Bishops have taken up active squares, but Black has retained a solid central position.

8...C6

Classical Queen Pawn Openings Black further cements the center.

9.Nf3

White finally develops his Kingside in preparation for castling. The move

9.Nge2 is appropriately named the

Chameleon Variation. It is more flexi- ble than 9.N13 because it allows a pos- sible f2-f3 and e3-e4 plan, but the Knight is less active on the e2-square.

9. . .O-O

10.O-O Ne4

This leads to the same trading idea of the Lasker Defense. Diagram 69 shows the position, which is considered a standard one for the Queen's Gambit Exchange. Black intends to hold the e4-square as firmly as possible. Theory considers the Exchange Variation to be only slightly better for White. My view is that Black has an easy game. Queen's Gambit Declined (Main Line, continued) Return to the main line (l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Nbd7 5.e3 h6

6.Bh4 Be7):

7.Nf3

Instead of resolving the central tension, White develops a piece and hopes to take advantage of his superior development after 7...dxc4? 8.Bxc4. Black isn't about to aid White's pieces and plays:

7. . .O-O

Black tucks his King safely onto the Kingside.

8.Rd

White knows that Black will soon have to develop his c8-Bishop. This means he will try to fianchetto the Bishop or resolve the central tension.

DIAGRAM 69.

CHAPTER FOUR

White is ready to play down the c- file in either event.

8...a6

Black shows his cards. He intends to capture on the c4-square and then play ...b7-b5, accelerating his Queenside development. The posi- tion is shown in Diagram 70. White must decide if he wants to resolve the center with 9.cxd5 exd5, as in the Queen's Gambit Exchange Variation. He has gained the develop- ment move Ral-cl in return for the move . . ,a7-a6, which should give White the advantage. Even so, after 10.Bd3 c6 Black's position is quite solid. At Diagram 70, White can play 9.a3, still awaiting a resolution in the center. Continuing with 9...dxc4 10.Bxc4 b5 ll.Ba2 c5 leaves an approxi- mately equal position. Having a better understanding of the classical openings makes it eas- ier to understand the modern ones. Although learning the names of the openings and defenses is hardly a requirement, the key to good play is understanding the ideas of central control, quick piece development, and a safe King.

DIAGRAM 70.

SOLUTION FOR DIAGRAM 60: In such circumstances its very conve- nient to remember the plan of a fianchetto. With 7...b6! Black intends to oppose White's g2-Bishop on the long diagonal. Usual play proceeds: 8.Rdl Bb7 9.Nc3 Nbd7, When White has only a small advantage. Black plays for ...c6-c5 and White for e2-e4, with lots of trades expected to occur in the center.

[diagram]
Modern King Pawn Defenses This chapter, unlike the two previous ones, does not have a "main line" which we plow through while considering alternatives. Instead, it provides a brief sketch of some of the main lines of the more popular modern defenses to White's opening challenge of l.e4. The Steinitizian principles of equilibrium practically compelled all leading chess players to meet White's opening move in classical style by playing l...e5. The same was true with Queen Pawn openings when l.d4 d5 was considered practically forced. Gradually, players began to experiment with a number of different defenses. Their aim was no longer to seek to "establish or re-establish the equilibrium;" in many cases the aim was to attack's White's opening move at once or allow White to occupy the cen- ter. There were a large number of experiments and not all of them worked very well! However a number have withstood the test of time. As you fol- low the openings in this chapter, notice how both players play for the center, development, and a safe King. This will be a theme of future chapters. Alekhine Defense Sometimes when approaching a game of chess, a player has to be down- right surly in his mental attitude (not in personality!) and question the opponent's every move. For a moment, cloak yourself in this same mind frame. White has just played:

1.e4

You haughtily take offense at this move, and you must immediately set about trying to destroy the e4-pawn. You can attack the e4-pawn with moves like ...f7-f5 or ...d7-d5, or you can try to lure it forward to its cap- ture. This is what Alexander Alekhine, fourth World Champion, had in mind when he championed the Alekhine Defense: This impudent move is shown in Diagram 71. Black immediately sets out to assault the e4-pawn, with hopes of lur- ing it forward to its doom. 2,e5 White accepts the challenge. He reckons that 2.Nc3 d5 or 2. . .e5 would not punish Black for his challenge.

2...Nd5

Black's Knight takes up an unstable residence in the middle of the board. The Knight seems to be mocking White's army, daring them to attack. A horrible debacle would await Black after 2...Ne4? 3.d3! Nc5 4.d4!, when Black's Knight is being unceremoniously booted about the board. White has developed his center pawns with tempo and can expect to con- duct a swift attack.

3.d4

White calmly occupies the center and opens the diagonals for his Bishops. There is a great temptation to play 3.c4 Nb6 4.c5 Nd5 5.Bc4 e6

6.Nc3 d6(!), which is called the

Mikenas Variation. Most top players feel that White has been overzeal- ous in his treatment of the opening and that Black stands with a fair game.

3...d6

DIAGRAM 71.

Modern King Pawn Defenses The first effects of Black's strategy become apparent: The e-pawn, having been lured forward, is now the object of Black's counterplay. White can take a number of approaches, including 4.Nf3 or 4.Bc4. My preference is for: 4,c4! Nb6 5.exd6 Another popular move, aptly named the Four Pawns Attack, is 5.f4, which keeps a broad pawn center. To play either side of the Four Pawns Attack requires a good deal of study because the lines are extremely sharp and one false slip spells disaster. After White's capture, the position is beginning to take clarity.

5.. .cxd6

The alternative recapture, 5...exd6, produces a symmetrical pawn struc- ture with White having an easy advantage due to his superior space.

6. Nc3 g6

The best chance for the f8-Bishop to have a life is to fianchetto itself.

7. Be3 Bg7 8,c5!

The first eight moves of the Alekhine Defense are shown in Diagram 72. White expects the following moves, with an advantage to White.

8.. .dxc5 9.dxc5 N6d7

1O.Bc4 Scandinavian Defense Having journeyed through the clas- sical openings, you might consider the Alekhine Defense to be a bit rash. As I became a stronger player, I was surprised to discover that my old favorite was an accepted defense called the Scandinavian Defense.

1.e4 d5!?

DIAGRAM 72.

Black attacks White's e4-pawn and forces a reaction.

2.exd5

This capture is practically forced. 2,..Qxd5 This premature developing of the Queen has at least momentarily done its job. White's e4-pawn has disappeared. Black has also tried 2...Nf6 to recover the pawn without developing the Queen. White can then try 3.Bb5+, 3.c4, or the preferred 3.d4 Nxd5

4.c4 Nb6 5.Nc3, with play as in the Alekhine Defense.

3. Nc3 Qa5

Black tries to get his Queen out of danger. The retreats 3...Qd6 and

3. . .Qd8 have also been tried, but preference has been shown for the text.

4. d4 Nf6 5,Nf3 Bg4

6,h3 Bxf3 7.Qxf3 c6 As shown in Diagram 73, White has the advantage of the two Bishops but Black has a surprisingly solid position. The Scandinavian Defense is still played by grandmasters who seek to avoid studying the opening theory necessary for top-level chess. The Scandinavian Defense is a good way of avoiding an adversary's preparation. French Defense The French Defense was an early favorite of mine and one I still play today as a grandmaster. The Ale- khine and Scandinavian Defenses don't properly prepare an assault on White's e4-pawn, but the French Defense seeks to prepare the move ...d7-d5. It is distinguished after:

1.e4e6 2.d4 d5

DIAGRAM 73.

Modern King Pawn Defenses Black attacks the e4-pawn with his d5-pawn, which has been supported by the e6-pawn. White has three major choices about what he wants to do with his e4-pawn. He can trade it, support it, or push it:

[diagram]
Each of these choices has a large body of opening theory behind it to support its use. The French Defense is a wonderfully intriguing defense that shows no signs of being exhausted. Exchange Variation Quite obviously the moves by Black (l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5) represent a counter- attack in the center. If White decides that he wants to avoid some of the sharp lines listed below, he can opt for a small advantage by playing the Exchange Variation:

3.exd5 exd5

Diagram 74 shows the effects of White's pawn trade. The pawn structure is completely symmetrical and White's only advantage is having the right to move. However, being on the move means that White can complete his development just a bit faster than Black and therefore gain a small advantage.

4.Bd3

This violates the principle of develop- ing Knights before Bishops. The idea behind this principle is that the devel- opment of the Bishops should be delayed because the pawn structure

DIAGRAM 74.

in most openings is dynamic. That is, a closed diagonal at one moment sud- denly opens. In the French Exchange Variation this is not the case. The pawn structure is well defined. By the text, White develops and tries to pre- vent . . .Bc8-f5, when the Black Bishop develops to a good diagonal.

4.. .Bd6 5.Nf3 Nf6

6.O-O O-O 7.Bg5 Bg4

8.Nbd2 Nbd7 9.c3 c6

1O.Qc2 Qc7 Both players have completed their development and the game is almost completely equal. Because White has the extra move in a symmetrical position, he has a small plus. French Defense, 3.Nc3 Variations By far the most popular way to meet the French Defense (l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5) is with:

3.Nc3

White develops a Knight and protects his e4-pawn. Black has four main moves:

[diagram]
Once more, all of these choices are fascinating lines leading to posi- tions that are rich in strategy and tactics. Rubinstein Variation One of Black's most consequent decisions in the 3.Nc3 French Defense (l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3) is to employ the Rubinstein Variation:

3.. .dxe4

Black sought the elimination of the e4-pawn and has now achieved that goal. While White will enjoy a greater freedom of movement for his Modern King Pawn Defenses pieces, Black will aim to trade pieces for a solid position:

4.Nxe4 Nd7 5.Nf3 Ngf6

6.Nxf6+ Nxf6 7,Bd3 Be7

8.Qe2

Diagram 75 shows one of the key positions of the Rubinstein Varia- tion. White has the superior Bish- ops and greater flexibility with his King position. He may castle on either side of the board. Black will aim to play ...c7-c5, neutralizing White's remaining center pawn and solve the problem of his c8-Bishop either by a fianchetto or by playing ...Bc8-d7-c6. Opening theorists believe that White has a slight advantage. Winawer Variation Today most French Defense players prefer to play the Winawer Variation (l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3):

3.. .Bb4

Black pins the Knight and threatens to capture the e-pawn. In most varia- tions of the Winawer, Black will trade his Bishop for the c3-Knight and double White's Queenside pawns. The strategic plans for both sides require study and experience.

4.e5

White advances in the center to grab as much space as he can. He can also play 4.exd5 exd5, transposing into an Exchange French with Black having committed his Bishop to the b4-square. Diagram 76, on the next page, shows the main position of the Winawer Variation.

4.. .C5

DIAGRAM 75.

Black now attacks White's center, hoping to follow up with ...Nb8-c6 to eliminate the central pawns.

5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3

White has strengthened his d4- pawn for the moment, but his dou- bled Queenside pawns will offer Black counterchances.

6...Ne7

Black initiates a long-term plan to harass the d4-pawn with ...Ne7-f5 in the future.

7.Nf3

This is White's most common move, called the Rauzer Variation. White has several other choices:

[diagram]
vating his Bishop on a promising diagonal.

[diagram]
White would like to advance his h-pawn to the h6-square so that he can infdtrate on the weakened dark squares.

[diagram]
raid believing such an adventure is justified due to his control over the center. A sharp reaction by Black is 7...Qc7 8.Qxg7 Rg8

9.Qxh7 cxd4 10.Ne2 Nbc6 1l.f4 Bd7 12,Qd3. Black has sacrificed a

pawn for the superior development and an exposed White King. Theorists will argue the soundness of Black's sacrifice well into the next millennium. Have fun!

7...Nbc6

In the Rauzer Variation, battle lines are drawn on opposite wings. Usually Black's King is too vulnerable on the Kingside and he is forced to castle Queenside while White's King goes Kingside. A favored line continues:

DIAGRAM 76.

Modern King Pawn Defenses

8.a4 Qa5 9.Bd2 Bd7

1O.Bd3c4 11.Be2 O-O-O

12.O-O

With a fighting game ahead, practice has favored White. Steinitz Variation Most grandmasters prefer to hoard their Bishops, hoping that as the opening moves unfold and the position is opened, their Bishops will pow- erfully rake the open diagonals. While the Winawer Variation means part- ing with the f8-Bishop, the Steinitz Variation holds onto the Bishop and intensifies the pressure on the e4-pawn (l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3):

3.. .Nf6

White usually reacts by gaining a tempo while attacking Black's Knight:

4.e5

Classical Variation An important strategic alternative for White is (l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6):

4.Bg5

In the French Defense, White usually has difficulties activating his cl- Bishop due to his central d4- and e5-pawns. The idea of this move is to exchange dark-squared Bishops. Play proceeds:

4.. .Be7 5.e5 Nfd7

6.Bxe7

White can play an interesting gambit, 6.h4!?, called the Chatard-Alekhine Attack.

6.. .Qxe7 7.f4

White reinforces his e5-pawn and prepares a future f4-f5 break.

7.. .a6

Black wants to play . . ,c7-c5, but first wants to prevent Nc3-b5 invading the d6-square.

8.Nf3 c5 9.dxc5 Nxc5

1O.Bd3 Nc6

Diagram 77 shows this classical position of the French Defense, with a small advantage for White. Steinitz Variation, continued In the Steinitz Variation (l.e4 e6

2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5), White

doesn't exchange Bishops, reason- ing that Black's Queen will be developed to the good e7-square and keeps the Bishops on the board.

4.. .Nfd7 5.f4

Just as in the Classical Variation, White reinforces his center.

5...C5

Now that the f8-Bishop covers the d6-square, Black isn't required to play . . .a7-a6 to prevent Nc3-b5, and attacks White's center at once.

6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 cxd4

8.Nxd4 Bc5

Both players are developing with an aim for central control.

9.Qd2

Diagram 78 shows the thematic position of the Steinitz Variation. Play often proceeds:

9.. .Nxd4 1O.Bxd4 Bxd4

[diagram]
13.Nb5 Ke7

This line provides an advantage for White.

DIAGRAM 77.

DIAGRAM 78.

Modern King Pawn Defenses Seirawan Variation A relatively modern defensive twist is a variation that I have devised and championed (l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3):

3...Be7

Although this appears to be a strange move, it is in fact a high-class wait- ing move. If White plays 4.Nf3 Nf6 5.e5 Nfd7, play has transposed into a Steinitz Variation where White has committed his f3-Knight and has denied himself the opportunity for f2-f4. If White advances his e-pawn with 4.e5, the advance doesn't come with tempo. Black can now play for the strategically desirable plan of trading light-squared Bishops with 4...b6. Black plays for ...Bc8-a6 with a Bishop trade in sight. White attacks the g7-pawn with 5.Qg4 and hopes to cause some dark-squared weaknesses in Black's camp. Continuing with 5...g6

6.h4 h5! 7.Qf4 Ba6, Black has solved his "problem Bishop" in the French

and can face the future with confidence. White's best test of the Seirawan

4.Bd3!

This provokes:

4...dxe4 5.Nxe4 Nd7

6. Nf3 Ngf6

Play now transposes into the Rubin- stein Variation. I've played this posi- tion in provocative style as Black on several occasions: 7, Nxf6+ Bxf6 8.Qe2 c5

9.d5 Nb6 1O.Bb5+ Kf8

Diagram 79 shows a crucial position in my variation. My personal tourna- ment score is quite favorable with Black, but the position requires careful study! Variation is:

DIAGRAM 79.

Tarrasch Variation As you've seen from the 3.Nc3 vari- ations, committing the bl-Knight to the c3-square invites a pin and makes it awkward for White to defend the d4-pawn after ...c7-c5. With this in mind, White has taken another approach to the French Defense (l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5):

3.Nd2

White defends his e4-pawn while keeping a flexible approach toward the defense of his center. Diagram 80 shows the Tarrasch Variation. At first glance, the move makes a poor impression because it blocks the cl-Bishop from develop- ing. Black can use this temporary central blocking move to attack White's center; 3...c5 and 3...Nf6 are the principle tries.

3.. .C5

This is quite a sensible reaction. Black plays to wipe out White's central pawns.

4.exd5

White decides to trade pawns. White gains nothing from 4.c3?! cxd4 5.cxd4 dxe4 6.Nxe4 Bb4+ 7.Nc3 Nf6, which makes an easy game for Black.

4.. .exd5 5.Ngf3 Nc6

6.Bb5 Bd6 7.O-O Nge7

8.dxc5 Bxc5 9.Nb3 Bd6

At the current position, shown in Diagram 81, White is considered to have a small advantage due to Black's isolated Queen pawn (IQP). The d5-pawn is considered to be weak as it cannot be protected by a fellow pawn and therefore requires the protection of a piece.

DIAGRAM 80.

Modern King Pawn Defenses If Black prefers a game with more of a French Defense flavor, then the following is the ticket (l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2):

3.. .Nf6

White's e-pawn is lured forward.

4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4

In a thematic move that we've seen before, White takes as big a bite of the center as he can swallow.

5.. .c5 6x3

This is the key advantage of the Tarrasch Variation. White is able to fortify his center.

6.. .Nc6 7.Ndf3 cxd4

8.cxd4 Nb6

Diagram 82 shows the Leningrad Variation. Black focuses his play on the Queenside and White focuses on the Kingside. Opening theory favors White due to his central grip. Tarrasch-Seirawan Variation If either of the above lines don't appeal against the Tarrasch Variation, Black can always play: (l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2) 3...dxe4, transposing into the Rubinstein Variation, or he can wait for White to commit himself:

3.. .Be7 4.Bd3 dxe4

5. Nxe4 Nd7 6.Nf3 Ngf6

The game has transposed right back into the Rubinstein Variation. (See page 107.)

DIAGRAM 81.

DIAGRAM 82.

Alternatively, White can play (l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 Be7):

4.Ngf3 Nf6 5.e5 Nfd7

6.Bd3 c5 7.c3 cxd4

8. cxd4 b6

As shown in Diagram 83, Black is once again trying to exchange light- squared Bishops and White has been denied the chance for f2-f4.

9.Qe2 a5!

Black pursues his idea of trading Bishops. White has an advantage due to his central pawns, but the Bishop trade will give Black excellent chances to equalize. The Seirawan Variation nicely solves problems in both the 3.Nc3 and Tarrasch Varia- tions of the French Defense.

DIAGRAM 83.

Advance Variation White can cut across the earlier opening theory by advancing his e-pawn on move three (l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5):

3.e5

This advance was popularized by Aaron Nimzovitch (1886-1935) who brought many new ideas to this move. Thus the Advance Variation often bears his name. Diagram 84 shows how White grabs as much space in the center as he can and hopes to build up an attack behind the broad shoulders of his central pawns. There is, however,

DIAGRAM 84.

Modern King Pawn Defenses a clear drawback to this advance: It doesn't come with tempo. This means that Black can create a quick counterattack in the center.

3.. .C5

Black tries to undermine the d4-pawn, which supports the e5-pawn. Black can also play the thematic move 3...b6, again trying to trade Bishops. Most French Defense players prefer to attack the d4-pawn. Naturally, White plays to keep his d4-pawn intact:

4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 Qb6

Black does his best to increase the pressure on the d4-pawn. He has in view a plan of . . .Ng8-h6-f5, causing the d-pawn to tremble.

6.Be2

White plays to quickly castle. White has also tried 6.Bd3 and 6.a3, which intends b2-b4 and a Queenside expansion.

6.. .cxd4 7.cxd4 Nge7

8.Na3 Nf5 9.Nc2

Diagram 85 shows a crucial position of the Advance French. White tries to keep his d4-pawn secure while Black nibbles around the flanks. White has a small advantage. Caro-Kann Defense In the Scandinavian and French Defenses, Black attacks the e4-pawn with his d5-pawn. The drawback to the Scandinavian is that the Queen is brought out too quickly, whereas in the French Defense, Black suf- fers from a cramped c8-Bishop. The Caro-Kann Defense intends to attack the e4-pawn without these disadvan- tages. 1 .e4 c6

DIAGRAM 85.

Black gives his d-pawn added sup- port in advance.

2.d4 d5

These moves distinguish the Caro- Kann, as shown in Diagram 86. The Caro-Kann has been embraced by Mikhail Botvinnik (1911-95, World Champion 1948- 57, 1958-60, 1961-63) and Anatoly Karpov (1951-, World Champion 1975-85). Every defense has some type of a drawback; the Caro-Kann is not appreciated by the b8-Knight because its best square, c6, has been denied. Well, you can't have every- thing! White has three main tries versus the Caro-Kann Defense:

[diagram]
DIAGRAM 86.

Classical Variation As you've seen from the French Defense, White often defends his e4- pawn (l.e4 c6 2.d4 d5):

3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5

This move shows the advantage of the Caro-Kann Defense. The position is similar to a Rubinstein French Variation but the c8-Bishop emerges at once. The favored move of Anatoly Karpov is 4...Nd7. Black intends to attack the e4-Knight with one of his own. This is an extremely solid choice. White players have chosen a variety of methods to gain an advan- tage, and it hasn't been easy. Currently, the favored method is 5.Ng5!? Ngf6 6.Bd3 e6 7.Nlf3 Bd6 8.Qe2 h6 9.Ne4 Nxe4 10.Qxe4. The position is shown in Diagram 87. Modern King Pawn Defenses Theory considers that White has a small advantage after 10...Nf6 ll.Qe2 b6 12.Bd2 Bb7 13.O-O-O, when White has the superior devel- opment.

5. Ng3

Although White's Knight has been forced to retreat, it does so with tempo.

5...Bg6

Black's Bishop takes up a powerful defensive position on the Kingside. The g6-Bishop is so strong that it is virtually impossible for White to create any meaningful Kingside attack- ing chances. White's best plan is to try to undermine the Kingside and trade Bishops:

6. h4! h6 7.Nf3 Nd7

8.h5 Bh7 9.Bd3 Bxd3

1O.Qxd3 e6 Diagram 88 shows the main line of the classical Caro-Kann. White has achieved an advantage in space and development. Black has a solid for- mation and he will endeavor to catch up in development. Exchange Variation If White wants to play a more open game, the Exchange Variation is the ticket (l.e4 c6 2.d4 d5):

3.exd5 cxd5

DIAGRAM 87.

DIAGRAM 88.

These moves, shown in Diagram 89, open the game a bit. White hopes that having an extra move will give him an advantage. Black is happy to trade away his c6-pawn for White's e4-pawn. White has to make a choice of whether to play c2-c4, attacking the d5-pawn, or whether he would prefer c2-c3 and a quiet existence. Exchange Variation, DIAGRAM 89. Rubinstein Variation Once more we have an opening variation credited to Akiba Rubinstein (l.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5):

4.Bd3

White intends to continue with c2-c3 and aim his pieces toward the center and Kingside. This move stops Black's c8-Bishop from developing com- fortably.

4.. .NC6 5.c3 Nf6

6. Bf4

Diagram 90 shows the position of the Caro-Kann, Rubinstein Varia- tion. White's Bishops have taken up wonderful diagonals and Black will have to neutralize them.

6.. .Bg4

Black wants a solid central forma- tion with his pawn on e6, but he first develops his Bishop before moving his e-pawn. DIAGRAM 90. 7. Qb3 Modern King Pawn Defenses White can acquiesce to a pinned Knight with 7.Nf3, but he wants to harass the b7-pawn.

7.. .Qd7 8.Nd2 e6

9.Ngf3

The position is quite balanced. White has a temporary initiative due to his superior mobilization, but Black's position is solid and he can face the future with confidence. Exchange Variation, Panov-Botvinnik Attack As an alternative to this quiet line, White can stir up a much sharper game by immediately attacking Black's d5-pawn (l.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5):

4.c4

White hopes to use his extra starting move to gain an advantage. This follow-up, called the Panov-Botvinnik Attack, requires a cautious approach on Black's part.

4.. .Nf6 5.Nc3

The careful reader will note a remarkable similarity between this position and the Tarrasch Defense to the Queen's Gambit. (See Diagram 63.) The only difference is that White now has an extra move! If Black were to play

5...g6, it would be like a Schlechter

Variation with reversed colors. Black usually chooses to rein- force his d5-pawn:

5.. .e6 6.Nf3 Be7

Black quickly develops to bring his King to safety.

7.cxd5 Nxd5 8.Bd3 O-O

9.O-O

The key position of the Panov-Botvin- nik Attack is shown in Diagram 91. White has accepted an isolated Queen pawn that will need support,

DIAGRAM 91.

and he hopes to utilize his space and superior development to gain a King- side attack. After decades of prac- tice, White has been able to show a small plus. Advance Variation If White isn't satisfied with defend- ing his e4-pawn or trading it for the d5-pawn, he can advance his pawn (l.e4 c6 2.d4 d5):

3.e5

As shown in Diagram 92, White has grabbed space as in the French Defense, Advance Variation and is pleased to see Black's pawn on the c6-square where it doesn't attack his d4-pawn. But if the Caro-Kann Defense, Advance Variation has a drawback, it is that Black can develop his c8-Bishop outside of his central pawn chain:

3...Bf5

White must now make a decision. Should he seek to attack the f5-Bishop with g2-g4? Should he trade the Bishop with a Bfl-d3? Or should he ignore the f5-Bishop altogether? These are interesting questions and I'll look at four possibilities: 4.g4,

4.Nc3, 4.h4 and 4.Nf3.

DIAGRAM 92.

Advance Variation, Flank Attack The Advance Variation (l.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5) can provoke a radical solution. White decides upon a quick attack on the flank:

[diagram]
This questionable move still has its supporters. White hopes to gain time and space on the Kingside by attacking the f5-Bishop.

4...Be4!

Black provokes White to advance his f-pawn. Modern King Pawn Defenses

5.f3 Bg6 6.h4

White tries to further disturb the Bishop and make the Kingside the theater of battle. White has also tried 6.e6?! Qd6I, when Black has the superior game. Black must stop White's threat of h4-h5 winning the Bishop.

6...h5 7.Nh3 e6!

8.Nf4 hxg4 9.Nxg6 fxg6

Diagram 93 shows White's Kingside attack to be in shambles. 1O.fxg4 Rxh4 White is a pawn down and Black has the initiative.

DIAGRAM 93.

Advance Variation, Flank Attack As you've just seen, if White is set upon a flank expansion he should pre- pare it (l.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5):

4.Nc3

White protects the e4-square so that Black is denied the chance for ...Bf5-e4.

4...e6 5.g4 Bg6

6.Nge2

The position shown in Diagram 94 has led to fascinating games. Grand- masters Jan Timman and John Nunn, two of the most aggressive players on the circuit, like White's position. Black has tried 6...Qh4,

DIAGRAM 94.

thereby preventing h2-h4 and trying to weaken the Kingside. It is usual to counterattack in the center:

6.. .C5 7.h4 h6

Black has also tried 7. . ,h5 8.Nf4 with a sharp game.

8.Be3 Nc6 9.f4 Qb6

With a dynamic position, both players have winning chances. Advance Variation, Flank Attack An interesting twist on the Advance Variation, Flank Attack (l.e4 c6 2,d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5) is this preparatory move:

4.h4

This cunning move is favored by Boris Spassky. Black must avoid playing

4. . .e6?? 5.g4 Be4 6.f3 Bg6 7.h5, when Black loses his Bishop .

4.. .h5

Black reacts with a necessary defensive move. Weaker is 4...h6 5.g4 Bd7

6.h5!, with advantage to White; or 4,..h6 5.g4 Bh7 6.e6! fxe6 7.Bd3!, with a

promising attack for the sacrificed pawn. The drawback of 4. . ,h5 is that the gb-square now falls into White's mitt

5.c4 e6 6.Nc3 Ne7

7.Nf3 Nd7

White's trump is the g5-square and Black's is the f5-square. Both players will use these squares to aggressively post their minor pieces. The chances are roughly equal. Advance Variation, Short Variation One of the most imaginative ways of meeting the Caro-Kann Defense has been championed by the British grandmaster Nigel Short. His idea in the Advance Variation (l.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bfb) is to allow Black's f5-Bishop to "peacefully co-exist." In other words, ignore what Black has done and get on with controlling space in the center:

4.Nf3

Modern King Pawn Defenses This is a radical departure from the other lines in the Advance Variation. It was always considered necessary to harass the f5-Bishop as quickly as possible, lest Black get an easy game.

4.. .e6 5.Be2

White's last two moves really distin- guish the Caro-Kann Advance, Short Variation. (See Diagram 95.) White quietly completes his devel- opment and leaves it up to Black to construct a central, counter. DIAGRAM 95.

5.. .C5 6.O-O

One of the benefits of Short's variation is that the f5-Bishop is often vul- nerable on its square to a Nf3xd4 recapture.

6.. .Ne7

Black has to be careful that his Knights don't trip over one another. For instance, after 6...Nc6 7.c3 cxd4 8.cxd4 Nge7 9.Be3, Black's Kingside pieces are entangled. Black envisions ...Ne7-c6 so that the b8-Knight can go to the d7-square.

7.dxc5

White can consider 7.c3, 7.c4 and 7.Nbd2 as reasonable alternatives.

7.. .Nec6 8.a3 Bxc5

9.b4 Be7 1O.c4

White enjoys more space and Black has good piece play. The position is approximately equal. Sicilian Defense Of the modern defenses to a King Pawn Opening, the overwhelming favorite is the Sicilian Defense:

1 ,e4 c5 This is the granddaddy of modern defenses. The plans are so rich and varied for both sides that hundreds of books have been written about this provocative and complex defense. In an effort not to over- whelm the poor reader, I'll just tread lightly upon the major defenses. As shown in Diagram 96, Black hasn't tried to block White's e4-pawn with ...e7-e5, nor has he tried to attack the e4-pawn with . . .Ng8-f6 or ...d7-d5. Instead, Black has left the e4-pawn alone and has struck out on his own scheme. For the moment, Black controls the d4-square. In viewing Diagram 96, the Classicist would condemn Black's move because unlike White's move, Black's move doesn't support the develop- ment of a Bishop. Infatuated by quick development, it is easy to overlook that Black is using a flank pawn to control the center. His own e- and d- pawns stay behind, awaiting instructions. This is the key to understanding the Sicilian structures: Black isn't interested in occupying the center, he wants to control the center from a distance. From Diagram 96, White has two options: either play for d2-d4, called the Open Sicilian; or do not play for d2-d4, called the Closed Sicilian. The current survey focuses upon Open Sicilian positions. White has several ways of playing for d2-d4. He can do it at once, or he can support the advance with the moves c2-c3 or Ngl-f3.

DIAGRAM 96.

Smith-Morra Gambit In the first scenario, White doesn't waste any time in achieving the desired move. He simply occupies the center (l.e4 c5).

2.d4 cxd4

Modern King Pawn Defenses Naturally, Black isn't about to let White keep a classical center. Now White must decide how to recapture the d4-pawn. If he plays 3.Qxd4? Nc6, his Queen is lured into the cen- ter prematurely, and Black has superior play. He can play 3,Nf3, anticipating Nf3xd4, which will transpose into a variation described later in this chapter. Instead White initiates the Smith-Morra Gambit:

3.c3

Diagram 97 shows the current position. Just as in the Danish Gambit, White offers a pawn for quick development. Smith-Morra Gambit Declined Black can decline the gambit by:

3.. .d5 4.exd5 Qxd5

5.cxd4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Qd8

The position is another famous isolated Queen pawn position, which often transposes from a Panov-Botvinnik Attack in the Caro-Kann Defense. Each IQP position must be looked at specifically. In this case, Black has all the usual advantages and disadvantages, no more or less. Smith-Morra Gambit Accepted Opening theory books rightfully question the soundness of the Smith- Morra Gambit (l.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3).

3.. .dxc3 4,Nxc3

Black should accept the sacrifice and force White to show compensation for the pawn. The problem is that while theory is dry and scientific, facing

DIAGRAM 97.

the Smith-Mor ra Gambit in over-the-board play is tough! Beginners usu- ally get slammed by the gambit. Black has to play very cautiously indeed!

4.. .e6

Black uses this important move to close the a2-g8 diagonal (something he can't do in the Danish Gambit), which makes his defense much easier. This move also takes away the d5-square for White's c3-Knight.

5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Bc4

White tries to bring his pieces to their most active squares. Although the a2-g8 diagonal is closed, the Bishop has no better prospects elsewhere.

6.. .a6

Black spends a whole tempo to defend the b5-square. This dangerous loss of time precludes White's c3-Knight from a potential jump to the dGsquare.

7.O-O Qc7

I know that it is hard to believe that Black should be moving his Queen so early, but he wants to avoid 7...Nf6 8.Bg5, when his Knight is pinned.

8.Qe2

Diagram 98 shows the impressive lead in development that White has achieved. However, Black hasn't created any real targets for White to grasp and Black shows he has kept a flexible and solid position.

8.. .Nf6 9.Bg5 Ng4

1O.Rad1 White had to prevent ...Nc6-d4, which would strip White's defender of the h2-pawn.

[diagram]
Black controls the e5-square and has the slightly better chances. Even so, White's position is very dangerous to the average amateur player!

DIAGRAM 98.

Modern King Pawn Defenses Alapin Variation A great amount of theory exists on the Sicilian Defense, which leads many players to seek refuge in the Alapin Variation (I.e4c5):

2.c3

The Alapin, shown in Diagram 99, has the noble aim of establishing a classical pawn center, but it is really rather harmless.

2.. .d5 3.exd5 Qxd5

4.d4 cxd4 5,cxd4 Nf6

6.Nc3 Qd8

The exact same position is reached as in the Smith-Morra Gambit Declined discussed earlier. Black can try to improve on this isolated Queen pawn position by trying (l.e4 c5 2.c3 d5 3.exd5 Qxd5 4.d4) 4...Nf6 5.NI3 Bg4

6.Be2 e6. In either case, White cannot expect much of an advantage.

Open Sicilian, Main Line In his quest to conquer the center, White realizes that he will need to play d2-d4. As the prelude to an Open Sicilian, he decides to utilize his gl- Knight (l.e4 c5):

2.Nf3

Black has to decide how he wants to play with his center pawns: 2...d6 or 2...e6. While often transposing, these moves also lead to vastly differ- ent formations. Scheveningen Variation This variation offers a quintessential example of the Open Sicilian Defense (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3):

2.. .d6

DIAGRAM 99.

Black awaits White's center push.

3.d4

White has also tried 3.Bb5+ Bd7

4.Bxd7+ Qxd7 5.c4, called the Mos-

cow Variation. But with this varia- tion, White has traded Bishops and helped Black's development.

3.. .cxd4 4.Nxd4

White's point. He has brought his Knight into the action in the center of the board where it controls many squares.

4.. .Nf6 5.Nc3 e6

Diagram 100 displays the Scheveningen Variation of the Sicilian, and it is an excellent position to spend a long time staring at. Ask yourself as many questions from the perspective of the principles as you can. It will be a very useful exercise. Diagram 100 shows that Black has taken a restrained approach to the center. He hasn't tried to occupy it, but observe how the d6- and eG-pawns control two of the sweet center squares and that the f6-Knight attacks the e4-square. This formation is the favorite of Garry Kasparov, and he used it in many games to become the World Champion! I urge any player who wants to understand the keys of the Sicilian Defense to start from this position. White has taken a number of approaches to the Scheveningen, including:

[diagram]
DIAGRAM 100.

Modern King Pawn Defenses Scheveningen Variation, Fischer Attack The Fischer Attack is a straight-forward concept that begins (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e6):

6.Bc4

White tries to clamp down on the d5-square, with an eye toward attacking the e6-pawn with f2-f4-f5. Black has a variety of defenses based upon ...Nb8-c6-a5 or ...Nb8-d7-c5 in conjunction with ...a7-a6 and ...b7-b5-b4 going for the e4-pawn. A solid choice is:

6.. .Be7 7.Bb3 O-O

8. Be3

White prepares to castle Queenside.

8.. .Na6

Black decides to bring his Knight to the c5-square to eliminate the b3- Bishop. One of the tactics that Black has to be aware of is 8...Nbd7

9.Bxe6!? fxe6 10.Nxe6 Qa5 ll.Nxf8 Bxf8, where White sacrifices two

pieces for a Rook.

9.Qe2 Nc5 1O.f3

Diagram 101 features a common position from the Fischer Attack. White will aim for g2-g4-g5 and a Kingside pawn storm. Black will play ...a7-a6 and ...b7-b5 for an attack on the Queenside. The position is dynami- cally balanced. Scheveningen Variation, Maroczy Variation In the Maroczy Variation, White takes a more restrained approach to the center. He first aims to complete his Kingside development, delaying an attack for awhile (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e6):

6.Be2 Be7 7.O-O Nc6

8.Kh1

White tucks his King away to the hl-square. He is committed to play- ing f2-f4, and wants to avoid tactics based on the gl-a7 diagonal.

8. ..O-O 9.f4 a6

Black guards the b5-square and prepares the c7-square for his Queen. 1O.Be3 Qc7 Diagram 102 shows the Maroczy. In their 1995 PCA Champion- ship Match, Viswanathan Anand and Garry Kasparov played this position a number of times. The position is dynamically balanced. Scheveningen Variation, Keres Attack By far the greatest challenge to the Scheveningen Variation is the Keres Attack, which begins (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e6):

6.g4

As shown in Diagram 103, White immediately starts his Kingside attack in motion. The threat to play g4-g5 and kick the f6-Knight into oblivion is one that theorists have long debated. Should Black allow White to carry out his threat, or play ...h7-h6, creating a weakness? This question produces two dis- tinct variations.

DIAGRAM 102.

DIAGRAM 103.

Modern King Pawn Defenses Scheveningen Variation, Keres Attack (without ...h7-h6) Black can allow White to carry out his threat, as follows (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e6

6.g4):

6...Nc6 7.g5 Nd7

8.Be3 a6 9.h4 Qc7

1O.f4 b5 White has extended his Kingside in order to launch an attack, while Black is busily preparing ...Bc8-b7 and ...Nd7-c5 with a counterattack

DIAGRAM 104.

against the e4-pawn. The position shown in Diagram 104 is uncommonly sharp, but I prefer White's position. Scheveningen Variation, Keres Attack (with ...h7-h6) Scheveningen players by and large prefer to slow down White's expansion by playing (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e6 6.g4):

6...h6 7.g5 hxg5

8.Bxg5

Diagram 105 shows the position, which is extremely difficult to evalu- ate. Black's h8-Rook has been "devel- oped" without having moved-a certain plus for Black. The trade of a Black h-pawn for a White g-pawn means that neither player is going to castle on the Kingside. Probably both Kings will move Queenside. White's menacing g5-Bishop must be

DIAGRAM 105.

carefully observed as the tactics of f2-f4 and e4-e5 will hang over Black's position. A usual continuation would be:

8...Nc6 9.f4 Be7

1O.Qd2a6 11. O-O-O Qc7

12.h4 Bd7

This leads to another one of those bottomless Sicilian positions that defy conventional understanding. Theorists have a slight preference for White in this position. Scheveningen Variation, Tai Variation Our final look at meeting the Scheveningen Variation of the Sicilian Defense (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e6) exhibits a com- pletely different plan by White. Mikhail Tai (1936-92, World Champion 1960-61), a master of the attack, introduced the scheme of a quick Queen- side castling:

6.f4

White wants to create immediate central threats with e4-e5. Black has to keep a wary eye to this possibility.

6...Nc6 7.Be3 Be7

8.Qf3

Diagram 106 shows Tai's idea. What he wants to do is quickly castle Queenside and reintroduce the threat of e4-e5 after White's Rook is sitting on the dl-square. In many lines, when the players castle on opposite wings, White's Queen is ready to support the charge of the g- pawn. The position is dynamically balanced.

DIAGRAM 106.

Modern King Pawn Defenses Dragon Variation I started my description of the Open Sicilian Defense with the Schevenin- gen Variation because that is really the classical way of handling the Sicilian. Black's e6- and d6-pawns act as a central buffer between the two armies. Of course, this central buffer is quite dynamic and Black can try a number of different cen- tral structures. A favorite of mine, if only for the name, is the Dragon Variation. 1 covered this defense in some depth in Winning Chess Brilliancies (Microsoft Press, 1995), and I urge you to probe there for a deeper understanding of this line. The Dragon Variation, shown in Diagram 107, is reached after (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3):

5...g6

Note Black's pawn structure: h7-g6-f7-e7-d6, which resembles a dragon. Black goes for a Kingside fianchetto where the g7-Bishop will have a strong influence along the long diagonal. From White's perspective, Black has failed to adequately keep the d5-square guarded, and he can use this point to his advantage. If Black tries a later ...e7-e6, the d6-pawn will be vulnerable. The Dragon can be met in an expected variety of ways that all boil down to a crucial decision: Will White castle Kingside or Queenside? Once White decides where he'd like to park his King, he can decide which formation he likes best.

DIAGRAM 107.

Dragon Variation (with Kingside Castling), Levenfish Attack One popular attacking scheme for White is the Levenfish Attack (l.e4 c5

2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6):

6.f4

White threatens e4-e5, which Black immediately prevents.

6...Nc6 7.Nf3 Bg7

8.Bd3 O-O 9.O-O

Diagram 108 shows a common posi- tion of the Levenfish Attack. White's attacking scheme is to play Qdl-el-h4 in conjunction with f4-f5 and Bcl-h6. Black has to come up with a reaction. If he plays 9...d5?

10.e5!, White will have a big advan-

tage. Thus it is difficult for Black to make a meaningful counter in the center. Black can try to distract White's pieces from the Kingside by play- ing a line like 9...b6 lO.Qel Nb4 ll.Qh4 Nxd3 12.cxd3 Ba6. Practice has shown the position to be dynamically equal.

DIAGRAM 108.

Dragon Variation (with Kingside Castling), Nottingham Variation As an alternative to the Levenfish Attack. White can take a more restrained approach (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6):

6.Be2 Bg7 7.Be3 Nc6

8.Nb3

White's last move distinguishes the Nottingham Variation. (See Dia- gram 109.) White's approach is to keep the d5-square firmly in his sights.

8.. .O-O 9.O-O

White intends to keep the center well patrolled by playing f2-f4 and Be2-f3. Black's space deficit encour-

DIAGRAM 1 09.

Modern King Pawn Defenses ages him to trade pieces and a common line is:

9.. .Be6

This is possible now that White's d4-Knight has retreated.

10.f4 Na5

Black's point is revealed; he is playing to put a piece on the c4-square:

11.f5 Bc4

This final position is known as the Byrne Variation. White has a slight advantage as he tries to stir up trouble on the Kingside. Dragon Variation (with Queenside Castling), Yugoslav Attack While castling Kingside by White can certainly bring about attacking schemes, the sharpest lines of the Dragon Variation occur when White castles Queenside (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6):

6. Be3

White quickly develops his Queenside pieces in order to make way for castling.

6.. .Bg7

A painful trap would be 6...Ng4?? 7.Bb5+! Bd7 8.Qxg4.

7.f3

White rules out a possible ...Nf6-g4, which would disrupt his develop- ment

7. . .0.0 8.Qd2 Nc6

Diagram 110 shows a critical posi- tion in the Dragon Sicilian. White has prepared to castle long but he is concerned about a possible ...d6-d5 and decides to clamp down on the d5-square.

9.Bc4 Bd7 10.O-O-O Rc8

11.Bb3

DIAGRAM 110.

The battle lines have been drawn. With Kings on opposite wings, it is a given that both armies will go after the other's monarch. White usually plays for h2-h4-h5 in conjunction with Be3-h6 to weaken Black's King. Black usually plays for ...Nc6-e5-c4 to block the b3-Bishop and force trades. Black's counterplay is centered down the c-file. This position is known as the Yugoslav Attack and has provided a bounty of beautiful attacking games. The position is dynamically balanced. Najdorf Variation Arguably the most complex Sicilian formation of all is the Najdorf Varia- tion, which begins with a move of great cunning (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3):

5...a6

Diagram 111 shows the starting position of the Najdorf Variation. As we've seen in the Scheveningen Variation and the Smith-Morra Gambit Accepted, the move ...a7-a6 is quite useful. Black controls the b5-square and makes the plan of ...b7-b5 and ...Bc8-b7 a possibility. Before going into the many approaches that White can try, the move 5...a6 deserves a reproach. The move does nothing to control the sweet center, which is a violation of our cherished princi- ples. White is given free rein over play in the center. Despite the doubts raised, White's ability to get a grip on the position is quite elu- sive. At times the central pawn buffer can radically change. Black might play ...e7-e6 or ...e7-e5, requiring White to change his plans. The following is a short list of White's approaches:

[diagram]
DIAGRAM 111. are all based upon the Modern King Pawn Defenses theme of developing White's fl-Bishop. The latter is a humorous echo of Black's "wasted" tempo on the Queenside. If Black wants to expand on the wing with ...b7-b5, White will expand on the Kingside with g2-g4 and Bfl-g2 for a position similar to a Keres Attack.

center. After 6. . .e6 7.Qf3, White plays as in the Tai Variation of the Scheveningen. All of these plans are so complex and varied that separate books have been written about them. In fact, many books have been written on varia- tions further down the chain of moves! With apologies to my readers, I'll take a look only at the greatest test facing the Najdorf:

6.Bg5

Choosing the most dynamic move, White develops a piece and begins a hand-to-hand struggle with the f6-Knight. Black's position is under imme- diate pressure.

6...e6

Black's Queen now protects the f6-Knight and prevents White from dou- bling the Kingside pawns.

7.f4

In another fine strengthening move, White introduces the threat of e4-e5 and f4-f5. This position is literally the starting position for most Najdorf players. White's threat of e4-e5 must be addressed. I'll examine each of these moves that Black has played:

[diagram]
7...Nbd7

Although it's not that popular, this move makes sense. Black covers the e5-square and reinforces the f6-Knight. The drawback to this move is that the e6-pawn can be quickly attacked:

8.Bc4 b5 9.Bxe6 fxe6

1O.Nxe6 Qa5 This piece sacrifice is shown in Diagram 112. In theory, Black is supposed to be all right, but not too many players are anxious to play Black's position. Our next line is an interesting offbeat idea (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4

4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4):

7...Qc7

Black gets out of the pin, controls the c4'Square, thereby preventing the type of sacrifice shown in Diagram 112, and invites White to double his Kingside pawns. Black's play is based on the trick:

8.Bxf6 gxf6 9.Qh5 Qc5!

Black is now able to offer an exchange of Queens. On his ninth move, White can build up pressure on the e6-square by:

9.f5 Nc6 1O.Bc4Nxd4

1 1 .Qxd4 Be7 1 2.O-O-O Bd7 Diagram 113 shows the position, in which White has an advantage.

DIAGRAM 112.

Modern King Pawn Defenses Najdorf Variation, Poisoned Pawn Variation One of Bobby Fischer's favorite defensive weapons was the Poisoned Pawn Variation of the Najdorf. It comes about after (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6

3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6

6.Bg5 e6 7.f4):

7.. .Qb6

As shown in Diagram 114, Black has no respect for the principles that we have worked so hard to learn. The rascal! The commander of the Black pieces is truly a gangster. Not only is he not worried about protecting him- self on the Kingside, he brings out his Queen in such a manner as to rob White of his b2-pawn! In principle, Black's play must be wrong. But both in theory and practice it is hard to prove it! If anyone finds a refutation to the Poisoned Pawn, please send a letter labeled "top secret" to my post office box. In the main line Poisoned Pawn, White jettisons his b2-pawn for quick development:

8.Qd2

White can also protect the b2-pawn by playing 8.Nb3, but after 8...Qe3+

9.Qe2 Qxe2+ 10.Bxe2 Nbd7, White's

advantage is slight.

8.. .Qxb2 9.Rb1 Qa3

[diagram]
The position shown in Diagram 115, on the next page, has been a source of endless theoretical debate.

DIAGRAM 114.

Najdorf Variation, Polugaevsky Variation Yet another vexing continuation of the Sicilian Najdorf is the Polugae- vsky Variation (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6

7.f4):

7...b5

Russian grandmaster Lev Polugae- vsky devised this monstrous move, shown in Diagram 116. Black is not oblivious to White's threat of e4-e5; on the contrary, he encourages it. Furthermore, Black shows his intention to start his own counterattack with ...b5-b4, pushing away the nicely placed c3-Knight. What arrogance! White accepts the challenge:

8.e5 dxe5 9.fxe5 Qc7

This is Polugaevsky's point. After 10.exf6 Qe5+ ll.Qe2 Qxg5, Black has traded pieces. 1 0.Qe2 Nfd7 1 1 .O-O-O Nc6! It would be a mistake to capture the e5-pawn. ll...Qxe5 12.Qxe5 Nxe5 13.Ndxb5 leads to threats of Nb5-c7 and Rdl-d8, with check- mate in both cases. After Black's careful eleventh move the position is dynamically balanced. Najdorf Variation, Main Line By now you should be getting an idea of just how complex the Sicil- ian Najdorf has become. But wait,

DIAGRAM 115.

DIAGRAM 116.

Modern King Pawn Defenses we haven't gotten to the main line! (I.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4)

7.. .Be7

This natural developing move is the most popular way to play the Naj- dorf. Black breaks the pin and pre- pares to castle out of the central dangers.

8.Qf3

White makes way for his own King to castle.

" DIAGRAM 117.

8.. .Qc7

Black has also played the Najdorf with 8...h6 9.Bh4, intending to provoke a sharp encounter by playing . . .g7-g5.

9.O-O-O Nbd7

The position shown in Diagram 117 is considered yet another starting point of the Najdorf Sicilian! Theorists have devoted a dozen moves and more to the best plans for White and Black. I suspect they will still be debating for centuries to come. It is impossible to say that an "equilib- rium" has been established. Both sides have their advantages and I'll just say the position provides both players with good winning prospects. Classical Variation In the Sicilian formations we've looked at so far, Black has delayed the development of his b8-Knight. When he brings out both of his Knights at the start of the opening, I consider this to be the Classical Variation. Of course, the positions are highly transpositional as we shall see. Play begins (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3):

5...Nc6

In classical style, Black develops his Knight to its most aggressive square.

Diagram 118 shows the starting position. White must now decide upon his approach. If he plays

6.Be2, Black can play 6...e6, trans-

posing to the Scheveningen, where Black has dodged the Keres Attack. Or Black could play 6...g6, where he has dodged the Yugoslav Attack in the Dragon. Or Black might change the features of the position to an all-together different variety:

6.Be2 e5

Black's sixth move, depicted in Dia- gram 119, is called the Boleslavsky Variation. Black creates a weakness on the d5-square, but he intends to play ...d6-d5 and dissolve the backward d6-pawn. Play might proceed:

7.Nb3 Be6 8.Bg5 Be7

9.O-O O-O

With a puzzling strategic battle ahead, White is considered to have an advantage. If White is dissatisfied with (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6) 6.Be2, he can play

6.Bc4, playing for the Fischer

Attack from the Scheveningen Vari- ation. Black loses some flexibility because his b8-Knight has commit- ted itself.

DIAGRAM 118.

DIAGRAM 119.

Modem King Pawn Defenses Classical Variation, Richter- Rauzer Attack Because of the highly transposi- tional nature of the Classical Varia- tion, White usually strives to play the forcing Richter-Rauzer Attack so that he can override the various transpositions (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6): 6,Bg5 The Richter-Rauzer is shown in Dia- gram 120. White sensibly develops his Bishop as in the Najdorf. For Black, the possibility of playing the Dragon is less desirable. After 6. . .g6?!

7.Bxf6 exf6, White has damaged Black's pawn structure. The common

course is:

6...e6 7,Qd2 Be7

8.O-O-O O-O

A typically sharp Sicilian game is in sight. The classical Sicilian is one of the most popular formations for Black in modern chess. The position pro- vides equal chances for both sides.

DIAGRAM 120.

Sicilian Defense, 2...e6 Variations So far our survey has focused upon (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6). Black also has a major choice on move two of playing (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3):

2...e6

This creates an entirely different complex of opening formations. Each has its own peculiarities.

3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4

Diagram 121, on the next page, shows the position, with Black having to decide between three main choices:

[diagram]
Paulsen Variation Of these three choices, the first is the one that gives this line of the Sicilian its unique flavor (l.e4 c5

2.Nf3 e6 3.d4cxd4 4.Nxd4):

4...a6

Black's fourth move introduces the Paulsen Variation. It seems to be a mocking move as Black pays no attention to the sweet center. Instead, he just covers the b5-square and sets up for possible Queenside counterplay. At first it seems that Black has created a weak d6-square, but it is quite difficult for White to land a piece there. Usually, White ignores what Black has done and instead of trying to punish him immediately for his transgressing of our beloved principles, White calmly develops. He has three choices:

[diagram]
DIAGRAM 121.

Paulsen Sicilian, Taimanov Variation A natural reaction by White is to simply develop the Knight and control the sweet center (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6):

5. Nc3 Qc7

Once more, Black seems to mock the opening principles. He brings out his Queen to control the e5-square and to see how White will commit his forces. 6, Bd3 Nc6 7.Be3 Nf6 Modern King Pawn Defenses This is Black's first benefit of his unusual move order. He has avoided Bcl-g5 and the problems that move can cause.

8.O-O Ne5

Black's position is shown in Dia- gram 122. Russian grandmaster Mark Taimanov introduced this plan for Black, and it now bears his name: the Taimanov Variation. Black is looking for an opportunity to play ...Ne5-g4, winning the advantage of two Bishops. At the same time, he has kept the f8-a3 diagonal open so that he can consider ...Bf8-c5, developing the Bishop to a more active square. Black's position in Diagram 122 is a provocative one.

9.h3

White winds up for f2-f4 and e4-e5, with a rout in the center. Once more, the complexities are quite dizzying and the Taimanov Variation remains a favorite in grandmaster play. Paulsen Sicilian, Reti Variation One of the ways that White should consider "punishing" Black's move order is by (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6): 5x4 As shown in Diagram 123, Black has not provoked Nbl-c3 by ...Ng8-f6, and thus White's c2-pawn can stake a claim to the sweet center. This

DIAGRAM 123.

move introduces the Reti Variation. White aims to keep both the breaks . . .b7-b5 and . . .d7-d5 from being played.

5...Nf6 6.Nc3 Bb4

Black exerts pressure on the e4-pawn.

7.Bd3 Nc6 8.Bc2

White has the superior position due to his central control. Paulsen Sicilian, Gipslis Variation In this final look at the Paulsen Sicilian, White is also a little crafty with his move order (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6):

5.Bd3

White supports his e4-pawn and camouflages his intentions. Will he play for f2-f4 or c2-c4?

5.. .Nf6 6.O-O

White's threat is to play e4-e5, which Black now prevents:

6.. .d6 7x4

White plays in the same manner as in the Reti Variation, but Black's f8- Bishop isn't active.

7.. .g6

Diagram 124 shows the Gipslis Vari- ation. Black activates his f8-Bishop by fianchetto, reckoning that the d6-pawn isn't weak because White will have to clear the d-file to attack the pawn. White has the advantage. Szen Variation Besides the Paulsen Sicilian, Black can opt for a different complex (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3,d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4) :

4.. .Nc6

DIAGRAM 124.

Modern King Pawn Defenses As seen in Diagram 125, Black develops a Knight and doesn't waste a tempo for ...a7-a6 yet. As always, the position can allow for a number of transpositions. If White plays

5.Nc3 d6, the game can quickly

become a Scheveningen Variation. Black's fourth move distinguishes the Szen Variation, which has its own flavor after:

5.Nb5

White makes fast tracks for the d6- square.

5.. .d6

Black quickly covers his vulnerable square.

6.c4

White once again clamps down on the d5-square.

6.. .Nf6 7.N1c3a6

8.Na3 Be7 9.Be2 O-O

10.O-O

As shown in Diagram 126, White has control over the d5-square and an advantage in space. But the a3- Knight is misplaced. Practice favors White's position. Pin Variation Our final look at the Sicilian com- plex with ...e7-e6 features a provoc- ative line of play by Black (l.e4 c5

2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4):

4.. .Nf6

DIAGRAM 125.

DIAGRAM 126.

Black immediately attacks the e4- pawn. Because 5.e5? Qa5+ loses a pawn and 5.Bd3 Nc6! 6.Nxc6 dxc6 offers White nothing, White defends the e4-pawn:

5.Nc3 Bb4

Diagram 127 features the Pin Varia- tion, which can be quite disconcert- ing to White when seen for the first time. Fortunately, with correct play, White can gain an advantage:

6.e5! Ne4

It would be a mistake by Black to try to grab material. After 6...Qa5?? 7.exf6! Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 Qxc3+ 9.Qd2! Qxal 10.c3 Qbl (Black is worried about H.Nb3 Qbl 12.Bd3 trapping his Queen) ll.Bd3 Qb6 12.fxg7 Rg8 13.Qh6, White has a winning advantage.

7.Qg4!

With this key move, White attacks both the e4-Knight and the g7-pawn.

7.. .Nxc3 8,a3 Bf8

9.bxc3Qc7 1O.Qg3

Despite his damaged pawns, White's lead in development and control of space gives him the advantage. Bourdonnais Variation Besides the Sicilian complexes with Black's pawns on either the d6- or e6- squares, one more series of complexes has Black committing his e-pawn to the e5-square. This complex is also very rich and varied (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3):

2.. .Nc6 3.d4 cxd4

4,Nxd4 e5 Diagram 128 shows the introductory moves of a whole new complex of Sicilian positions. Black's fourth move is known as the Bourdonnais Varia- tion and is quite forcing. White gains nothing from 5.Nxc6? bxc6, when

DIAGRAM 127.

Modern King Pawn Defenses Black can face the future with confi- dence. Nor does 5.Nf5? d5! promise any advantage. White's only chance for an advantage is by continuing:

5.Nb5

Black now has three variations that are all quite distinctive:

tion) In the main line of the Bourdonnais Variation (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4,Nxd4 e5 5.Nb5), Black forces White to occupy the d6-square.

5...a6 6.Nd6+ Bxd6

7.Qxd6 Qf6

Diagram 129 shows White's befuddlement. He has played natural forcing moves and finds himself without any development. After 8.Qxf6 Nxf6

9.Nc3 d5! 10.exd5 Nb4, Black will

favorably recover his pawn. White is better off not trading Queens and instead retreats:

8.Qd1 Qg6 9.Nc3 Nf6

This leads to an interesting battle with White holding the two Bishops to help him along.

DIAGRAM 128.

DIAGRAM 129.

Lasker-Pelikan Variation If Black doesn't like giving up the two Bishops as in the Bourdonnais Variation, he can claim them for himself in the Lasker-Pelikan Varia- tion (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4

4.Nxd4 e5 5.Nb5):

5...Nf6

This nuance creates a small, but unique, twist.

6.N1c3 d6

Diagram 130 shows how White's Knight has been "forced" to the b5- square. Black intends to play ...a7-a6 and send the b5-Knight into obliv- ion. White's play is, once more, quite forcing:

7.Bg5 a6 8.Bxf6 gxf6

9.Na3

This has all the makings of a horrible debacle for Black. But wait! We are about to discover a fascinating modern defense:

9...b5

This extraordinary move is called the Sveshnikov Variation. White domi- nates the d5-square and Black practically forces White's Knight to this powerful outpost. But the move has a deeper internal logic. White will have one good d5-Knight, but one bad a3-Knight. Play usually continues:

10. Nd5 f5

Black's plan is to trade off his doubled pawns and, after ...Bf8-g7, to put his two Bishops to work. Modern theory is unsure of its verdict. Practice has shown that Black has fair chances. Kalashnikov Variation If the Sveshnikov is too strategically frightening, the Kalashnikov Varia- tion is terrifying (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 e5 5.Nb5):

DIAGRAM 130.

Modern King Pawn Defenses

5.. .d6

With Black's fifth move, shown in Diagram 131, White's Knight is stopped from going to the de- square. White can try to reinforce his control over the d5-square but Black can fight: 6.Bc4 Be6 7,Bb3 a6

8.N5c3 Nd4 produces an unclear

position. Usual is:

6.c4

White brings the c-pawn into the fight for the sweet center. But now the stunning moves that follow cre- ate an entirely new struggle:

6.. .f5 7.exf5 Bxf5

8.Bd3 Be6

As you can see from this overview of modern King Pawn defenses, genera- tions of chess players have been busy blazing new and varied trails. Of them all, the Sicilian Defense complexes are the most formidable to master.

DIAGRAM 131.

WJ /AWdW AWAWdW A Modern Queen Pawn Defenses As I demonstrated in Chapter Five, today's grandmasters are will- ing to experiment with basic principles, oftentimes violating them in order to achieve some other strategic advantages. Recall from Chapter Five how Black would attack White's e4-pawn with ...d7-d5, from the side, so to speak, trying to lure the e-pawn forward. Many of the mod- ern defenses to a Queen Pawn Opening (l.d4) try the same kind of strat- egy. Other defenses try to ignore the d-pawn and play "around" the center. Polish Defense One clear example of playing around the d4-pawn is the Polish Defense (l.d4):

1...b5

Black's opening move appears at first to be absurd, but the move has its points: It controls the c4-square and prepares a fianchetto, as shown in Diagram 132. In 1990 I played a match versus former World Champion Boris Spassky, who three times employed the Polish Defense: DIAGRAM 132.

2.e4 Bb7

4.Nf3 a6

6.Re1 c5

3.Bd3 e6

5.O-O Nf6

7.c3

White has the advantage due to his classical pawn center. Dutch Defense The Dutch Defense has a goal similar to that of the Polish Defense. Play begins (l.d4): 1,..f5 Black isn't trying to meet White in the center. Instead, he's trying to stake out his own territory. It can be argued that the Dutch Defense, shown in Diagram 133, is a bit more sound than the Polish Defense because Black's opening move at least controls the sweet center. Black wants to continue with ...Ng8-f6 and completely control the e4-square. White can meet the Dutch Defense with a variety of plans. He can fian- chetto his King Bishop as in a Catalan. Or he can try any of these options:

[diagram]
Staunton Gambit If the Dutch Defense sets out to control the e4-square, the Staunton Gambit aims to stop Black's plan in its tracks (ld4 f5):

2.e4

White offers his e4-pawn as bait for quick development, as shown in Diagram 134. Black should accept the gambit. DIAGRAM 133. 2...fxe4 3.f3 Modern Queen Pawn Defenses

DIAGRAM 134. DIAGRAM 1 35.

White hopes to induce 3...exf3 4.Nxf3 Nf6 5.Bd3 with a promising attack. Black should fall back on his plan of controlling the e4-square:

3...d5 4.fxe4 dxe4

5.Nc3 Nf6 6.Bg5 Bf5

7.Nge2 e6 8.Ng3 Be7

The main line of the Staunton Gambit is shown in Diagram 135. Black con- tinues to control the e4-square and has an acceptable game. Dutch Defense (2.Bg5) The Dutch Defense is about control- ling the e4-square. White can employ another method to stop the grip (l.d4 f5):

2.Bg5

Displayed in Diagram 136, White's Bishop move is a favorite of mine. Black has a difficult moment After

DIAGRAM 136.

2...Nf6?! 3.Bxf6 exf6 4.e3, White will play c2-c4 and Nbl-c3 with a sizable

advantage. Black's best is:

2.. .h6 3.Bh4 g5

4.e3

This opens the evil threat of Qdl-h5 Checkmate!

4.. .Nf6 5.Bg3 Bg7

6.Nd2

White has the advantage. Black's Kingside is extended and the move h2- h4 is sure to undermine Black's position. Dutch Defense, Main Line If he likes, White can also play into the main line of the Dutch Defense (I.d4f5):

2.c4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e6

4,Nf3 Be7 5.e3 O-O

6.Bd3 d5

Black continues his strategy of controlling the e4-square. Black's position is about equal because in this main line, the cl-Bishop has a limited role. Most players like to fianchetto their fl-Bishop as in the Catalan. Modern Queen Pawn Defenses Of all the modern defenses, Black's most popular opening defensive move is (l.d4):

1...Nf6

As shown in Diagram 137, Black hasn't committed his central pawns and remains flexible about his intentions. He may soon play ...e7-

D I AG RAM 137.

Modern Queen Pawn Defenses e6 and ...d7-d5, transposing back into a classical defense. Black waits to see how White intends to continue:

2. c4

This is the starting point for the rest of this chapter. With his second move, White takes up the fight for the center and, given the opportunity, will play Nbl-c3 and e2-e4, occupying the whole center. How will Black stop this plan? Budapest Gambit The Budapest Gambit was an early favorite of mine (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4):

2.. .e5

Diagram 138 shows Black's surprising second move. Black attacks the d4- pawn directly. But the e5-pawn is unsupported! White can and should cap- ture the pawn.

3.dxe5 Ng4

Exhibiting a strange leap of faith, Black is forced to move his f6-Knight again, but his aim is to recapture the e5-pawn.

4. Bf4

Naturally, White is quick to protect his gains. An awful mistake would be 4.f4? Bc5, when White has weak- ened his position. White can also return the gambit pawn by 4.e4 Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 6.Be3, with a space advantage for White.

4.. .NC6 5.Nf3 Bb4+

Now we come to a parting of the ways. White must decide if he'd pre- fer to play with an extra pawn or with the two Bishops. DIAGRAM 138.

Rubinstein Variation The great Akiba Rubinstein loved the advantage of the two Bishops. He knew how to get 'em and hold 'em (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 Nc6

5.Nf3 Bb4+):

6. Nbd2

White blocks the check but allows Black to recapture the gambit pawn:

6.. .Qe7

Black's move is forced. White threatens 7.h3, with a winning game.

7.a3 Ngxe5

In a stirring moment, Black appears to have lost his senses and left his Bishop en prise. I once watched a tournament game where my friend, Leo Stefurak, cruelly punished his opponent for taking the Bishop: 8.axb4?? Nd3 Smothered Checkmate! What a jolt that was.

8. Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3

White guards against the Smothered Checkmate.

9.. .Bxd2+ 1O.Qxd2

The Rubinstein Variation is shown in Diagram 139. White has earned the two Bishops and a small advantage. Budapest Gambit, Main Line If White wants to hang on to his pawn he can play the Budapest Gambit main line (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5

3.dxe5 Ng4 4,Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+):

6,Nc3 Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 Qe7

8.Qd5

This is the difference: White can protect his e5-pawn.

8...f6

Black can't go fishing for pawns.

11.g3

Diagram 140 shows that White has earned the two Bishops and an extra pawn. This is why the Budapest Gam- bit isn't a favorite in master games, but amateurs love its tricky nature. Benko Gambit One of the most intriguing strategic DIAGRAM 140. gambits in opening chess theory is the Benko Gambit. Broadly speaking, gambits are sacrifices to gain a short-term edge in development that might be used to win back the sacri- ficed material. Black usually has a hard time making a gambit work because he is behind a tempo at the start of a game. On the other hand, gambits for White abound, because he has a head start in development. The Benko Gambit doesn't look for a quick reward; it seeks a long-term strategic advantage. The Benko Gambit begins (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4):

2...C5

Black attacks the d4-pawn from the side. White has several choices. If he plays 3.dxc5 e6, Black will quickly recapture the c5-pawn with a fine game. If White defends the d4-pawn with 3.e3 cxd4 4.exd4 d5, the game has transposed to a Caro-Kann, Botvinnik-Panov Attack. Another choice,

3.Nf3 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6 5.Nc3 d5, brings Black an easy equality. White's

best chance for an advantage is to advance the d-pawn:

3.d5

With this move White is a happy camper. His pawn occupies a fine central square and denies Black's pieces either the c6- or e6-squares.

3...b5

Diagram 141 shows the starting position of the Benko Gambit. At first the move makes a strange impression. Black is playing on the Queen's wing and not in the center. But the move has great logic. The center is closed for the moment and the c4-pawn, which supports the d5-pawn, is undermined. Whole volumes have been written about whether the Benko Gambit should be accepted or declined. I'll use a page or two to show just few of the main ideas.

DIAGRAM 141.

Benko Gambit Accepted The first officially recognized World Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, once said, "The best way to refute a gambit is to accept it." So that's where we'll start (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5):

4.cxb5 a6 5.bxa6 Bxa6

The effects of accepting the Benko Gambit can be seen in Diagram 142. Black has developed three units to White's one. Also of great impor- tance is that Black's a8-Rook is ready to pressure the a2-pawn. White's aim will be to catch up in development and defend his d5-pawn.

6.Nc3 g6

This is a crucial link in Black's plans. He wants to fianchetto his King's Bishop so that it too can

DIAGRAM 142.

Modern Queen Pawn Defenses pressure White's Queenside while offering Black's King a safe haven.

7.g3 d6 8.Bg2 Bg7

9.Nf3 O-O 10.O-O Nbd7

11.Re1

White prepares e2-e4 in an attempt to grab more of the center. Diagram 143 shows one of the main positions of the Benko Gambit Accepted. Black will play on the Queenside and White in the center. Practice has shown good results for Black and he has full compensation for the pawn. This line in no way exhausts the Benko Gambit Accepted possibilities, and I encourage further research.

DIAGRAM 143.

Benko Gambit Declined If White isn't happy about accepting the gambit (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5), he can always decline it and hope to capture the pawn under better cir- cumstances.

4. Nf3 b4

Black decides not to keep the tension. After 4...bxc4 5.Nc3 d6 6.e4 g6

7.Bxc4, White has a lead in development and a sizable advantage. Black

can also choose 4...g6 5.cxb5 a6 6.Nc3 axb5 7.e4!? b4 8.Nb5, with a dan- gerous attack for White.

5.a3 Na6 6.axb4 Nxb4

7.Nc3 d6 8.e4 g6

White has a strong center in return for allowing the b4-Knight an outpost. Theorists consider the position shown in Diagram 144, on the next page, to be better for White.

Benoni Defense One of the sharpest defenses is the Benoni Defense, it's also one of the most difficult to master. A favorite of former World Champion Mikhail Tai, its success even attracted Bobby Fischer to play it against Boris Spassky in their celebrated

1972 World Chess Championship

match. The Benoni leads to extremely lively tactical play that keeps both players on their toes. Play begins (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4):

2...c5 3.d5 e6

Black seeks to remove the cramping d5-pawn. 4,Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 Diagram 145 shows the starting position of the Benoni Defense. White has been given a central majority. In return, Black has claimed a Queen- side majority. Both players will use their majorities to control the other player's pieces. Pawn Storm Variation The most dangerous weapon in White's arsenal to try to defeat the Benoni is an immediate Pawn Storm Variation (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5

3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6) :

6.e4

White immediately expands in the center. One of Black's aims in the

DIAGRAM 144.

DIAGRAM 145.

Modern Queen Pawn Defenses Benoni, as in the Benko Gambit, is to fianchetto his f8-Bishop where it might be more active on the long diagonal. Black starts this strategy now.

6.. .g6 7.f4

White is planning to blow away the f6-Knight with e4-e5.

7.. .Bg7 8.Bb5+

This is an important intermezzo move. White would like to play 8.e5 dxe5 9.fxe5 Nfd7 10.e6 fxe6 ll.dxe6 Qh4+ 12.g3 Bxc3+ 13.bxc3 Qe4+, but these tactics don't favor him. The Pawn Storm Variation has reached a pregnant moment, shown in Diagram 146. How will Black handle the check? He has two main choices:

8...Nfd7 and 8...Nbd7.

DIAGRAM 146.

8...Nfd7

Considered the safe choice, the main line runs:

9.a4

White is worried about . . .a7-a6 and . . ,b7-b5 coming with tempo.

9.. .Qh4+ 1O.g3Qe7

11. Nf3O-O 12.O-O

This position is considered better for White. Black's best alternative is (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6 7.f4 Bg7 8.Bb5+):

8.. .Nbd7 9.e5 dxe5

10. fxe5 Nh5 11.e6Qh4+

12.g3Nxg3 13.hxg3Qxh1

The tactics of this position, shown in Diagram 147, on the next page, are still being debated, with practice favoring White. This is definitely one vari- ation where preparation is a requirement!

Nimzovitch Variation If the dangers of the Pawn Storm Variation frighten both players, and they should, White can take a more restrained approach by (l.d4 Nffi 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6):

6. Nf3

White calmly develops his Knight for now. 6,..g6 As usual, Black prepares to fianchetto. 7, Nd2 This move distinguishes the Nimzo- vitch Variation, as shown in Diagram 148. White aims to plant his Knight on the c4-square, where it will pressure the d6-pawn.

7...Nbd7

DIAGRAM 147.

Black intends to meet 8.Nc4 with 8. . .Nb6, attacking the cTKnight. Black has also essayed 7. . .Bg7 8.Nc4 O-O 9.Bf4 Ne8, which is favorable for White.

8. . .O-O 9.Bd3

This modern treatment, shown in Diagram 150, has had a chilling effect on Benoni players. If allowed, White wants to play O-O and Bcl-f4, with an active game. Black tries to counter with an enterprising gambit:

9.. .b5 1O.Bxb5Nxe4

Diagram 151 shows the latest word in the modern Benoni theory. The posi- tion is a mass of confusion, but for now White has shown a plus in practice.

DIAGRAM 149.

DIAGRAM 150. DIAGRAM 151.

Czech Benoni Defense If Black is unhappy about giving White a central majority, he can absolutely lock up the center using a Czech Benoni (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4):

2...C5 3.d5 e5

Instead of challenging White's d5- pawn, Black's e-pawn whizzes right by it. The center now becomes totally blockaded:

4.Nc3 d6 5.e4 Be7

Diagram 152 shows he starting posi- tion of the Czech Benoni Defense. White has a fine wedge in the center which cramps Black pieces, but how will he further exploit it? With the center so locked, play on the flanks becomes all important. The main line of the Czech Benoni is an intriguing line:

6.h3

Concerned that Black will be able to make trades after 6.Nf3 Bg4, White makes a precautionary move.

Modern Queen Pawn Defenses Diagram 153 shows that, at long last, Black has gotten in his King- side break. But who benefits from the open lines? Theory favors White but the practical results show that Black has chances too. Nimzo-lndian Defense While the Sicilian Defense is the granddaddy of modern King Pawn Defenses, the Nimzovitch-Indian (or Nimzo-lndian) is the granddaddy of Queen Pawn Defenses. The amount of chess literature written about this defense is astounding. While writing this book, I entered this section with trepidation. I cannot possibly cover the myriad ideas of the Nimzo-lndian in such a work. Rather, I can form an impression for you and encourage you to make further research yourself. As shown in Diagram 154, the Nimzo-lndian is reached by (l.d4 Nf6

2.c4):

2...e6

Black doesn't yet take a firm stand in the center as with the Budapest Gambit or the Benoni Defense. Rather, he simply opens up the diag- onal for the f8-Bishop. White contin- ues his standard development

3.Nc3 Bb4

This is Nimzovitch's idea. The c3- Knight is pinned, making the move e2-e4 difficult to carry out. On the other hand, Black is showing a will- DlAGRAM 154.

ingness to part with the two Bishops early in the game. Black hopes that if he is to lose his Bishop he will have the satisfaction of doubling White's pawns. White has tried a variety of moves, including:

[diagram]
Leningrad Variation If Black is going to pin White's Knight, it's only fair that White might return the favor (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3,Nc3 Bb4):

4.B g 5

White pins Black's Knight and hopes to play e2-e4 in the near future. This line is called the Leningrad Variation, and it was a great favorite of former World Champion Boris Spassky.

4...C5 5.d5 h6

6.Bh4 Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6

Now that Black has traded away his dark squared Bishop, he quickly puts his center pawns on the dark squares where they will not obstruct his c8-Bishop.

8.e3

White has to go slowly in the cen- ter. The immediate 8.e4? g5 will cost him the e4-pawn.

8...e5 9.f3

Diagram 155 shows a main position from the Leningrad Variation. Black has done a good job of clogging up

Modern Queen Pawn Defenses the center. White's Bishops aren't working at the moment. Practice has favored Black! Samisch Variation If Black is willing to part with the two Bishops, White reasons that he should force him to do so (l.d4 Nf6

4.a3

White puts the question to the Black Bishop and obliges the capture:

4.. .Bxc3+ 5.bxc3

Diagram 156 shows the starting position of the Samisch Variation. White has a nice grouping of pawns, even if they are doubled. Black's strategy is to freeze the c4-pawn so that he might capture it in the near future:

5.. .C5

White now faces a crucial decision as to how to play in the center. Should he play 6.e3 and slowly prepare the advance of his e-pawn, or should he play 6.f3 and play for e2-e4 in one go?

DIAGRAM 156.

Samisch Variation (6.e3) If White goes slowly with his e-pawn, Black has time to organize a coun- terattack against the c4-pawn (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.a3 Bxc3+

Diagram 157, on the next page, displays the fine idea of Jose Raul Capa- blanca, the third World Champion. Black prevents a possible Bcl-g5, which

puts his Knight in an unpleasant pin. Furthermore, Black gets his pieces out of the way of White's imposing pawn center. Left to his own devices, Black intends to play ...Bc8-a6, ...Nc6-a5 and possibly ...Ne8-d6, clipping the c4-pawn. Practice has favored Black once more. Samisch Variation (6.f3) The modern way to play the Samisch Variation is (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.a3 Bxc3+ 5.bxc3 c5):

6.f3

White wastes no time, but immediately goes for his e2-e4 set-up. Black feels obliged to halt White in the center.

6...d5 7.cxd5 Nxd5

White would have an advantage after 7...exd5 8.e3 O-O 9.Bd3 b6 10.Ne2 Ba6 due to his extra pawns in the center. Mikhail Botvinnik was an excel- lent champion of White's possibili- ties in this position.

8.dxc5

Owing to his two Bishops, White tries to open up the position as much as possible. As soon as he plays e2-e4, he can count on a plus.

8...f5

As shown in Diagram 158, Black tries to put a stop to e2-e4 and expects to round up the c5-pawn in the near future by playing ...Nb8- DlACRAM 158. Modern Queen Pawn Defenses a6. The position is absolutely devil- ish and requires careful study. The position is dynamically balanced. Spielmann Variation In the Nimzo-Indian, the doubled c- pawns can be downright annoying. It begins to make sense that White should avoid the doubled pawns, and what could be more natural than (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4): 4,Qb3 Diagram 159 shows the starting position of the Spielmann Variation. White not only stops his pawns from becoming doubled, he even attacks the b4-Bishop with tempo! What could be sweeter? The only problem with this move is that the Queen becomes a tactical target.

4...C5

Black protects his Bishop and attacks the d4-pawn. If White plays 5.a3? Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3 cxd4 7.Qxd4 d5 8.Nf3 Nc6, Black will have the advantage. 5,dxc5 Nc6 Black now has the annoying threat of ...Nc6-d4, which pushes White's Queen away from the protection of the c3-Knight. 6, Nf3 Ne4! 7,Bd2 Nxc5 Black can also play 7...Nxd2. In both cases Black's chances are good.

DIAGRAM 159.

Classical Variation You should now realize some of the problems that White has handling the Nimzo-Indian. A much favored continuation even to this day is the Classi- cal Variation (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4):

4.Qc2

With this quiet move, White reinforces his c3-Knight and prepares both a2-a3 and e2-e4 with fine gains. Black has three main choices: 4...c5,

4...d5 and 4... O-O.

Classical Variation (4...c5) A completely reasonable reaction for Black is to attack White's center at once (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Qc2):

4...C5

Now that the d5-square isn't supported by White's Queen, the d-pawn can't be pushed.

5.dxc5 O-O

Black can also consider the sharp line 5,..Na6 6.a3 Bxc3+ 7.Qxc3 Nxc5

8.b4 Nce4 9.Qd4 d5 10.c5 b6, which is still in great debate.

6.a3 Bxc5 7.Nf3 Nc6

8.Bg5 Nd4 9.Nxd4 Bxd4

12.Qd2

This famous ending from the Classical Nimzo is shown in Diagram 160. Practice has shown an advantage for White. Classical Variation (4...d5) One of the sharpest lines of the Classical Variation is shown after (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Qc2):

4...d5

Black takes a stand in the center.

5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3 Ne4

7.Qc2 Nc6 8.e3 e5

Diagram 161 shows the starting position of what is sometimes called the Grand Variation. Watch what happens now:

Diagram 162 shows the starting position for this Grand Variation. Modern practice favors White and it is an excellent position to play with your friends. What do you think is going on? This is one of those positions where general principles are replaced by concrete analysis. Classical Variation (4... O-O) A far more topical treatment of the Classical Defense is to allow White to win the two Bishops (l.d4 Nf6

2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Qc2):

4... O-O

As shown in Diagram 163, Black safely tucks his King away before starting aggressions in the center.

5.a3

DIAGRAM 163.

White is sorely tempted to play 5.e4, gaining ground in the center, but

5...d5 6.cxd5 exd5 7.e5 Ne4 8.Bd3 c5! gives Black excellent counter

chances. With the text White claims the two Bishops.

5...Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3 b6

Black prepares to fianchetto his c8-Bishop and control the e4-square. In this way the Nimzo-Indian gets its name. At the turn of the century the fianchetto was simply called "irregular" and later was referred to as an "Indian" development by the hypermodernists who began experiment- ing with all kinds of openings and defenses.

7.Bg5 Bb7

Many grandmaster games today begin this way. The position shown in Diagram 164 is considered dynamically equal. Rubinstein Variation Somehow White's play against the Nimzo-Indian hasn't been altogether convincing. The Samisch Variation only seems to encourage Black's inten- tions, and the Classical Variation has White spending a lot of tempi with his Queen to avoid doubled pawns. Another approach seems to be needed. Once again Akiba Rubinstein offered a solution (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6

3.Nc3 Bb4):

4.e3

Diagram 165 shows the Rubinstein Variation. As mentioned in the sec- tion on the Budapest Gambit, Akiba loved the Bishops. White plans to play Ne2 and put the question to the b4-Bishop. Black has tried 4...b6 (Bronstein Variation), 4...c5 (Hueb- ner Variation), 4...d5, and 4... O-O. Naturally, each defensive try has its own peculiarities.

DIAGRAM 164.

Modern Queen Pawn Defenses Rubinstein Variation, Bronstein Variation David Bronstein, virtual co-cham- pion of the world in 1951, is a player with enormous creative gifts. He has enriched practically every opening he ever played. This is the Bronstein Variation (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3):

4...b6

It is quite witty. Black realizes that White intends to win the two Bishops and so prepares to trade one away.

5.Nge2 Ba6 6.a3 Bxc3+

7. Nxc3 d5

Bronstein's idea can be seen in Diagram 166.

8. b3 Nc6

Black intends to play ...Nc6-a5, pressuring the c4-pawn. White has a small advantage.

DIAGRAM 165.

Rubinstein Variation, Huebner Variation In my view, the best way for Black to meet the Rubinstein Variation is with the line introduced by German grandmaster Robert Huebner (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3):

4...C5

Diagram 167, on the next page, shows Huebner's idea. He wants to start a quick attack on White's cen- ter. White has two choices: He can DIAGRAM 166.

play 5.Ne2, continuing with the idea of winning the two Bishops, or he can play for development with

5.Bd3.

Rubinstein Variation, Huebner Variation (5.Ne2) In the next two moves, White com- pletes his idea of winning the two Bishops.

DIAGRAM 167. Black makes all these trades in the center to force White to have an isolated Queen pawn.

9.Bxc4 O-O 10.O-O Nc6

11.Be3 b6

White's position in Diagram 168 is a favorite of Victor Kortchnoi. White has an advantage of the two Bishops, but after fianchettoing Black will have good chances to equalize. Rubinstein Variation, Huebner Variation (5.Bd3) If White isn't satisfied by his edge in Diagram 168, he can try a different piece arrangement (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 c5):

5.Bd3

White decides to develop his Bishop first, anticipating that he will have a better chance for e3-e4 in the future.

DIAGRAM 168. 5...NC6

Modern Queen Pawn Defenses In Diagram 169, White faces a cru- cial decision. Where should his gl- Knight go, to the e2- or f3-square? Rubinstein Variation, Huebner Variation (6.Nge2) In this variation, White plays in the classical manner preferred by Akiba Rubinstein (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 c5 5.Bd3 Nc6):

6.Nge2

Left to his own devices, White will castle and play d4-d5 with an over- whelming position. Black is quick to respond in the center.

6...cxd4 7.exd4 d5

8.a3 dxc4 9.Bxc4 Be7

Another typical isolated Queen pawn middle game has emerged in Dia- gram 170. Practice has favored White because it is easy for him to play d4- d5 with advantage due to his superior development.

DIAGRAM 169.

Rubinstein Variation, Huebner Variation (6.Nf3) In Diagram 170, the e2-Knight isn't well placed, and many grandmas- ters prefer the traditional f3-square (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 c5

5.Bd3 Nc6):

6.Nf3

White invites the same kind of iso- lated Queen pawn as in the previous line and expects his Knight to be bet- ter placed. Black changes his plan:

DIAGRAM 1 70.

6.. .Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6!

Black's shift of plan is shown in Dia- gram 171. He intends to block the center with ...e6-e5, when White's Bishops will have difficulty activat- ing themselves.

8.O-O e5 9.Nd2!

White makes a surprising, yet pow- erful, retreat. White wants to launch his f2-pawn into the central fray.

9. . .O-O

It would be a mistake for Black to capture the d4-pawn with 9...cxd4

10.cxd4 exd4 ll.exd4 Nxd4 12.Bb2 Ne6 13.Ne4, leaving White's Bishops

to radiate their power. 1O.d5 Ne7 !1.Qc2 White is prepared to play f2-f4, with good chances for the initiative. Black will try to keep the position blocked so that White's Bishops can't cooper- ate. Practice has shown the position to be balanced, although Black must play with great care. Rubinstein Variation (4...d5) So far against the Rubinstein Variation, we have looked at Bronstein's and Huebner's ideas. After White has committed himself to e2-e3, it is far more natural for Black to respond in the center in classical style (l.d4 Nf6

2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3):

4...d5

As shown in Diagram 172, Black wants to keep the e4-square as well cov- ered as possible. If he can stop White from playing e3-e4, the cl-Bishop will be deprived of a future!

5.a3 Bxc3+

DlAGRAM 171. Modern Queen Pawn Defenses Black can also retreat with 5...Be7

6.Nf3 O-O 7.b4, giving White an

edge in the center and the Queen- side, but without giving up the two Bishops.

6.bxc3 c5

This attack in the center is neces- sary. One day White will play c4xd5 and then use his newly minted c3- pawn as a central battering ram.

7.Bd3 O-O 8.Ne2 b6

Black seeks an active diagonal for his Bishop. This move is the signal for White that the time has come to trade his c4-pawn.

9.cxd5 exd5 1O.Ng3

Compare Diagram 173 with the note on the Samisch Variation. It is a direct transposition. As previously mentioned, Mikhail Botvinnik liked to play White's position as he would play f2-f3 and Ne2-g3, building up the break e3- e4. White has an advantage.

DIAGRAM 172.

Rubinstein Variation (4.O-O) The last look at the Rubinstein Vari- ation analyzes the most popular defense (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4

4.e3):

4. ..O-O

As shown in Diagram 174, on the next page, Black whips his King to safety and retains all the flexible defensive options previously men- tioned. He hasn't committed his central pawns and may play with

DIAGRAM 173.

...d7-d5 or ...d7-d6, putting his cen- tral pawns on light or dark squares. From Diagram 174, White must decide between 5.Ne2 (Reshevsky Variation) and 5.Bd3. Rubinstein Variation, Reshevsky Variation Like Akiba Rubinstein, Samuel Reshevsky loved the two Bishops. His favorite line was (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3O-O):

5. Nge2

White immediately goes for a2-a3 so that he can recapture the Bishop with his Knight. Black is now forced to respond in the center:

5...d5 6.a3 Be7

Black has been forced into this retreat. Black can also play 6...Bd6 7.c5 Be7 8.b4, allowing White to gain space on the Queenside.

7.Nf4

Reshevsky made a career out of the position shown in Diagram 175. White has the advantage. Rubinstein Variation (5.Bd3) The most analyzed continuation of the Rubinstein Variation is (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 O-O):

5.Bd3

White hasn't committed his Knight and wants to see how Black will respond in the center.

Diagram 176 represents a starting position of the Rubinstein Variation. The options are quite complex, and I encourage further study! Black's last move plans . . .Bc8-a6, trading White's best piece. Most games continue:

9.Qe2 Bb7 1O.Rd1

A fine battle lies ahead. Bogo-lndian Defense If the White player finds himself overwhelmed by the complexities of the Nimzo-Indian, he can duck the line on move three (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4):

2...e6 3,Nf3

DIAGRAM 176.

As Diagram 177 shows, White doesn't allow the Nimzo-Indian. Instead, he invites his opponent to play 3...d5, transposing back to a classical Queen Pawn Defense, or 3...c5 4.d5, transposing back to a Benoni Defense. Many grandmasters appreciate these transpositions. They feint with a Nimzo-Indian only to transpose to a Benoni. In this way certain lines, such as the Pawn Storm in the Benoni, are averted. If Black doesn't want to transpose back into these defenses, he can give the position its own flavor by playing:

3...Bb4+

This variation is attributed to Efim Bogoljubow. When faced with a last name like that, it is easy to see why

DIAGRAM 177.

players called this defense the Bogo Variation. Because Black often fian- chettos his Queen's Bishop, the defense became known as the Bogo- lndian Defense. If White doesn't want to play 4.Nc3, transposing back into the Nimzo-Indian, he should block Black's check in one of two ways: 4,Nbd2 or 4.Bd2 (the main line). Bogo-lndian Defense (4.Nbd2) My favored continuation is to block Black's check with (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6

3.NI3 Bb4+):

4, Nbd2 My reasoning is simple: I want to play a2-a3 and win the two Bishops as in a classical Nimzo-Indian without spending tempi with my Queen. If Black doesn't give up the two Bishops, my d2-Knight will support e2-e4.

4...b6

This is a key move to understanding the Bogo-lndian. Black tries to con- trol the e4-square with pieces and not by playing ...d7-d5, which requires him to commit himself in the center.

5.a3 Bxd2+

Practically speaking, this capture is forced. After 5...Be7 6.e4 Bb7 7.Bd3, White has control over the e4- square and a clear advantage. 6,Qxd2 Diagram 178 shows this paradoxi- cal capture. After 6.Nxd2 Bb7, White will have to spend time blocking the long diagonal. After

6.Bxd2 Bb7, it isn't clear what

White should do with his dark- squared Bishop. In a few moves, White's plan will be clear:

6...Bb7 7.e3 O-O

DIAGRAM 178.

Modern Queen Pawn Defenses Black could play 7...Bxf3 8.gxf3, but White will soon play Bfl-g2 and f3- f4, with a powerful middle game.

8.Be2 d6 9.O-O Nbd7

1O.b4! Diagram 179 shows how the middle game plans for both sides begin to take shape. White intends to fian- chetto his dark-squared Bishop for good central control. Black intends to occupy the e4-square with his Knight and follow up with . . .f7-f5 to play on the light squares. Practice has favored White.

DIAGRAM 179.

Bogo-lndian Defense, Main Line Black's Bishop check has provoked a response and it's certainly natural to rebuff the impudent attacker with an attack of your own (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6

3.Nf3 Bb4+):

4.Bd2

This is the main line of the Bogo- lndian, and it's a completely logical counter. If Black is forced to trade Bishops, White's development would get a boost.

4...Qe7

Not wishing to help White develop, Black defends his Bishop. Black has also tried 4...a5 and 4...c5, but the text is the most logical. Diagram 180 shows White's stra- tegic problem in a different light.

DIAGRAM 180.

What will White do with his fl-Bishop? The c4-pawn means that the fl-a6 diagonal isn't the brightest, so White decides on a fianchetto.

5.g 3

It also might seem like a reasonable plan to play for e2-e4. After trading a few pieces with 5.Nc3 Bxc3 6.Bxc3 Ne4 7.Qc2 Nxc3 8.Qxc3 d6 9.e4 Nd7, Black will play for . . .e6-e5 with rough equality.

5.. .Nc6 6.Bg2 Bxd2+

Black chooses the right moment to trade Bishops. White can't play

7.Qxd2?! Ne4 8.Qc2 Qb4+, which gives Black the initiative.

7.Nbxd2 d6

Diagram 181 is typical of the Bogo-Indian. Black has the flexibility to change plans. He now plans ...e6-e5 in order to activate his c8-Bishop.

8.O-O e5 9.d5

White gains a nice wedge in the center.

9.. .Nb8 1O.e4

Diagram 182 shows the starting position for most grandmaster games with the Bogo-Indian. White's central control gives him the advantage, but Black's position is quite solid. Black will play ...Nb8-a6, thereby control- ling the c5-square.

DIAGRAM 181. DIAGRAM 182.

Modern Queen Pawn Defenses Queen's Indian Defense By now you've observed that learning all the plans of a Nimzo-Indian is a daunting challenge to the White player. Gaining a spatial advantage against the Bogo-Indian isn't as difficult, so Black sets up a new challenge, the Queen's Indian Defense. In this defensive scheme, Black quickly fian- chettos his Queen's Bishop. The Queen's Indian Defense is initiated after the moves (l.d4 Nf6 2,c4):

2...e6 3.Nf3 b6

As shown in Diagram 183, Black prepares to fianchetto his Queen's Bishop in order to control the e4-square. This strategy is typical of mod- ern defenses. While White's pawns occupy the center, Black's pieces con- trol the central squares. From Diagram 183, White has taken a number of approaches:

1O.bxc3 Nxg3 11.hxg3 d6 Diagram 184 features the starting position of the Queen's Indian Botvin- nik Variation. Many grandmaster games have been played from this posi- tion as both sides have strengths and weaknesses. Practice has favored White but not by much. Petrosian Variation The ninth World Champion, Tigran Petrosian (1929-84, World Champion 1963-69), had an extraordinary gift for frustrating his opponents' plans. Grandmaster Robert Byrne once commented to me, "Petrosian would play a defensive combination long before his opponent realized he had a Modern Queen Pawn Defenses chance to attack!" He mastered the art of prophylaxis, anticipating the dangerous plans of his opponent before they could arise. His spe- cialty was to carefully prepare his advances, nurturing and building his position before initiating a clash. He conjured up the following varia- tion (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6): 4,a3 Diagram 185 shows the Petrosian Variation. White spends a whole tempo in the opening to prevent the pin in the Botvinnik Variation.

4...Bb7 5.Nc3 d5

At last Black has been provoked into committing himself in the center. White was threatening to play d4-d5 and e4-e5, completely shutting out the b7-Bishop.

6. cxd5 Nxd5

After 6...exd5, the position becomes that of a Queen's Gambit Declined. The text gives this variation its unique flavor.

7.Qc2

White is playing for e2-e4. Early in his career, Garry Kasparov's favorite weapon as White was this position. Practice has favored White.

DIAGRAM 185.

Queen's Indian Defense, Main Line The most popular way for White to meet the Queen's Indian is to fian- chetto his own Bishop (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6):

4.g3

White reasons that if Black just tries to play with his pieces, his position will invariably become cramped. At some point, Black will have to commit

his central pawns; in the meantime, White has a safe haven for his King on the Kingside.

4...Bb7

An entirely different idea of the Queen's Indian is for Black to change his approach and target the c4-pawn. Black reasons that if White is going to fianchetto his fl- Bishop, the c4-pawn might be vul- nerable: 4...Ba6 5.b3 c6 6.Bg2 d5 reaches a position that is also favored in grandmaster chess.

5.Bg2 Be7 6.O-O O-O

Diagram 186 shows the starting position for the main line Queen's Indian Defense. Most games continue by 7.Nc3 Ne4 8.Qc2 Nxc3 9.Qxc3 f5, both players contending for control of the e4-square. Vladimir Kramnik, currently the world's third highest-rated grandmaster, prefers 7.Rel, waiting to see how Black will react The Queen's Indian Defense is considered one of the most solid defensive systems available against the Queen Pawn Opening.

DIAGRAM 186.

Grunfeld Defense The last modern defense against the Queen Pawn Opening I consider in this survey is the Grunfeld Defense. More than any other modern defen- sive scheme, the Grunfeld typifies piece play for Black and occupation of the center by White. The opening moves are (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4):

2.. .g6

This time Black decides to fianchetto his own King's Bishop.

3.Nc3

White is ready to play e2-e4 with central domination.

3.. .d5

Modern Queen Pawn Defenses Black makes a surprising move by striking in the center. It is Black's third move that initiates the Grun- feld Defense, which is shown in Dia- gram 187. White has three main responses to the Grunfeld Defense:

DIAGRAM 187.

Exchange Variation The most logical continuation for White, and hence the one that has the largest body of theory, is the Grunfeld Exchange Variation (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5):

4.cxd5

Naturally, White is pleased at the prospect of exchanging a flank pawn, the c4-pawn, for Black's central pawn.

4...Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3

6.bxc3

Diagram 188 shows the starting posi- tion for the Grunfeld Exchange Varia- tion. Naturally, White is very pleased with himself. He has established a classical center in exactly half a dozen moves. Classical players are cheering! But Black isn't about to give up the game now. He reasons that after fianchettoing his Bishop, he

DIAGRAM 188.

will be able to put strong pressure on White's d4-pawn and the long diago- nal. Play now continues:

6...Bg7

Black plans the counter ...c7-c5 and ...Nb8-c6 to attack the d4-pawn. White must make a crucial decision as to how he should defend his cen- ter. Would he like his Knight defending his d4-pawn on the e2- or f3- square? While the f3-square is preferable, the Knight would then be vul- nerable to a pin from the c8-Bishop. Exchange Variation, Main Line For several decades the main line of the Exchange Variation was the stan- dard (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bg7):

7.Bc4

White develops a Bishop while making room for the gl-Knight to have a comfortable development.

7...C5

Once more, Black strikes into the center. The pressure of the g7-Bishop on the long diagonal is making itself felt.

8.Ne2

This was White's development scheme. On the e2-square, the Knight is not vulnerable to the c8- Bishop.

8...O-O 9.O-O Nc6

1O.Be3 Both players have followed their plans in exemplary fashion. White occupies the center and therefore should be pleased with his game. But the fight is just beginning! From Diagram 189, play proceeds:

10.. .Bg4

DIAGRAM 189.

Modern Queen Pawn Defenses This move appears to be a wasted effort because White can easily neu- tralize the pin. Black's move has a deeper point 1 1 .f3 Na5 This is Black's point: the move f2-f3 weakens White's position.

12.Bd3

Practically a whole FIDE World Championship Match between Ana- toly Karpov and Garry Kasparov was contested after 12.Bxf7+ Rxf7 13.fxg4 Rxfl+ 14.Kxfl. Today this line is con- sidered completely equal and thus preference is made for the text.

12...cxd4 13.cxd4Be6

The position shown in Diagram 190 is considered a key starting point for the Grunfeld Exchange Variation. Having provoked the move f2-f3, Black clearly wants to play ...Na5-c4, attacking the vulnerable e3-Bishop. Doz- ens of games have been played that feature the exchange sacrifice, 14.d5 Bxal 15.Qxal f6 16.Bh6 Re8, with Black usually doing well! Modern play- ers now play:

14.Rc1 Bxa2 15.Qa4 Bb3

16.Qb4 b6

White has excellent compensation for the pawn and practice has shown the position to be about equal. Exchange Variation, Modern Line Today's grandmasters have devised a new approach to the Exchange Grunfeld that involves placing the King's Knight more aggressively (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bg7):

And this is it. The b7-pawn needs protection and the c8-Bishop is to be kept at home. If Black tries to block the Rook's attack, 8...b6

9.Bb5+ disrupts Black's plans of

attacking the d4-pawn.

8. . .O-O 9.Be2 cxd4

1O.cxd4Qa5+ 11.Bd2 Once more, White offers his a2-pawn as a gambit. The ending after ll.Qd2 Qxd2+ 12.Bxd2 b6, preparing ...Bc8-b7, is considered harmless for Black.

11...Qxa2

The position shown in Diagram 192 is quite the rage in grandmaster cir- cles. Results have favored White in a series of tactical melees. Do your research and come prepared to your tournament games! Three Knights Variation If the amount of analysis of the Exchange Variation seems over- whelming, the Three Knights Varia- tion might be easier (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5):

4.Nf3

White calmly develops a Knight and chooses not to define the cen- ter just yet.

DIAGRAM 192.

Modern Queen Pawn Defenses

4.. .Bg7

Now White must reveal his plans. He can play 5.cxd5, transposing into the Exchange Grunfeld, and play the modern line. Or he can choose one of the following variations, which have their own flavor:

[diagram]
Three Knights Variation, Russian Variation The Russian school of chess has done an amazing "joint collaboration" on the following bottomless varia- tion (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4,Nf3 Bg7):

5.Qb3

As shown in Diagram 193, White develops his Queen early in order to put pressure on Black's d5-pawn. White realizes that after the passive move

5...c6 6.cxd5 cxd5, the game will

become an Exchange Slav Defense, with Black's fianchetto misplaced. The standard moves are:

5.. .dxc4 6.Qxc4 O-O

7.e4

Diagram 194 shows the current position. White has achieved a clas- sical pawn center but the premature development of his Queen means that Black can create all kinds of counter defenses. Just to list the main variations:

DIAGRAM 193.

DIAGRAM 194.

[diagram]
All of these variations have their unique qualities and books have been written about their strengths and weaknesses. While I believe that the Smyslov Variation makes the most sense, others may properly disagree. Let me just say that all of these lines are fascinating and the ideas challenging. Three Knights Variation, Seirawan Variation With so many complex lines to choose from, I decided to create a simple "anti-Grunfeld" weapon that I've used with great success. I even defeated Garry Kasparov in the Chess Olympics with the following (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Nf3 Bg7):

5.Bg5

From the position shown in Diagram 195, White plans to eliminate the f6- Knight and grab the d5-pawn.

5...Ne4

This is the best move. After

5...dxc4? 6.e4!, White will favorably

recover the c4-pawn. Another alter- native, 5...c6 6.cxd5 cxd5 7.e3, once again is an Exchange Slav Defense where the g7-Bishop bites on gran- ite, and with the d4-pawn, White has the advantage.

6.cxd5 Nxg5!

Black properly snares the two Bish- DlAGRAM 195. ops. After 6...Nxc3 7.bxc3 Qxd5 Modern Queen Pawn Defenses

8.e3, White has more influence in

the center, and once more the g7- Bishop has a limited future.

7.Nxg5 e6 8.Nf3

This latter move was really my con- cept. Previously White players had tried 8.Qd2 exd5 9.Qe3+ Kf8

10.Qf4 Bf6!, but hadn't received an

advantage.

8.. .exd5 9.b4

Diagram 196 shows the Seirawan Variation. The game is similar to a Queen's Gambit Declined, where White has played Bcl-g5xf6, giving up the two Bishops for a Queenside minority attack.

9. . .O-O 1O.e3

Black's g7-Bishop is on a closed diagonal. Practice favors White. Grunfeld Defense (4.Bf4) This last look at the Grunfeld fea- tures another logical move that ignores the action in the center (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5):

4.B14

White develops his Bishop and tar- gets the c7-pawn.

4...Bg7 5.e3

This is crucial to White's opening strategy. The Bishop is developed outside of the pawn chain and rein- forces the d4-pawn. Diagram 197 shows the position, with Black hav- DlAGRAM 197.

ing to choose between 5. . .c6, 5. . .c5, and 5. . . O-O .

5.. .c6

This passive move doesn't suit the nature of the Grunfeld Defense. White can trade by 6.cxd5 cxd5, with a favorable Exchange Slav, or he can con- tinue:

6.Nf3 O-O 7.Bd3

White has the advantage. Far more common is (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Bf4 Bg7 5.e3):

5.. .C5

Black tries to blast open the long diagonal for the g7-Bishop.

6.dxc5 Qa5

Black prepares a possible ...Nf6-e4 to attack the c3-Knight.

7.Rc1 dxc4 8.Bxc4 O-O

9.Nf3 Qxc5

White has a lead in development that gives him a slight advantage. Grunfeld Gambit An intriguing gambit appears after (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Bf4 Bg7

5.e3):

5. ..O-O

White can now play 6.Rcl, with a likely transposition to the line given above. The text move has indepen- dence if White decides to gobble a pawn:

6.cxd5 Nxd5 7.Nxd5 Qxd5

8.Bxc7

White has won the c7-pawn, as shown in Diagram 198. Black's compensation after 8...Na6 9.Bg3 Bf5 is quite visible. A difficult end- DlACRAM 198. Modern Queen Pawn Defenses ing, however, arises in Diagram 198 after 8...Na6 9.Bxa6 Qxg2 10.Qf3 Qxf3 ll.Nxf3 bxa6, which favors White. This completes our survey of the major modern defenses to the Queen Pawn Opening. I hope I've provided you with food for thought and that you now have a better understanding of the reasons behind most chess openings.

CHAPTER SEVEN

WNmwwvwvmmmM An Opening Solution Utnderstanding the information presented in the previous chapters ook me several years. Learning all the classical openings and defenses and their names was a real bear. It did, however, help me to appreciate that I'd never return to my Cannon or Queen Raid Open- ings! My favorite opening move became l.e4, and it would have stayed that way forever except for one small problem: I lost. In fact, I lost quite often and the opening was the real culprit. It seemed to me that it was nec- essary to become a specialist in every opening and defense! As soon as I'd find a line to deal with the Dragon, I lost because I wasn't aware of the lat- est wrinkle in the Scheveningen Keres Attack. Things didn't get better with the Petroff Defense. Not knowing the nuances of so many openings meant that I couldn't get an edge, no matter which line I chose. My com- plaints only got affirmative nods, "Yep, you're right Yaz. Let me know when you find something good." In a strange way that I couldn't articulate, it seemed to me that after a few years of playing chess, I was playing less "original" chess in my games. I'd play the first dozen or so opening moves as prescribed by the great chess teachers and end up with either a completely won position or a bad one that I couldn't hold. Much like the fellow who checkmated me in four moves and exclaimed that I had been his fourth victim, my oppo- nents at this time would tell me that I had fallen into the same trap as their previous opponent. It didn't make me feel any better! I realized that I wanted to play a game of chess that had less of a "the- oretical" understanding. My friends called this approach "getting out of book"-the book being the rather large body of opening theory. But how on earth could I escape? The whole purpose of opening theory was to pre-

CHAPTER SEVEN

scribe the best set of opening moves and counters so that a player would have a decent middle game position. Didn't getting out of book mean being at a disadvantage? After all, I'd no longer be following the recom- mended moves of top grandmasters. The answer is a succinct no. There is no single best opening or best defense. As this book has already shown, there are hundreds to choose from. What is important is finding an open- ing and defense that is comfortable for you-one where you can under- stand the formation and the plans that will give you the type of position that you want. Building a House What I discovered for myself is that, despite my choice of opening or defense, I often left my own King vulnerable. I was so locked in on target- ing my opponent's King that I constantly left my own inadequately pro- tected. In attacking the Dragon Sicilian, I noted that the g7-Bishop- besides putting pressure on the long diagonal-is a great defender. The concept of building a house took root, and that's exactly what I did. Building a house is making a fianchetto and sliding your King under- neath the Bishop. Once my King was nicely protected, only then did I start to worry about the center. Experienced players who are reading this book have probably noticed that the previous chapters on classical open- ings missed the Barcza Opening and the English Opening, and the chap- ters on modern defenses overlooked the King's Indian Defense and the Pirc Defense. These omissions were deliberate, because these openings are the ones I recommend. When I decided to avoid opening theory, it took me a long time to give up l.e4 because this move seemed like a trusted old friend. Instead my new move order would be:

1.Nf3

An Opening Solution Instead of trying to occupy the center with either l.e4 or l.d4, my new opening move was the start of my house building. The move controls the d4 and e5-squares and leaves it up to Black to choose his defense.

2.g3

This was the second step in building my house. The Bishop is to be fian- chettoed on the long diagonal. 2".g6 Black does the same thing.

3.Bg2 Bg7 4.O-O O-O

In Diagram 199, we see that both sides have built homes for their Kings. Both have a solid pawn shield and are covered by a Knight, a Bishop, and a Rook. It was from this formation that I realized it was possible to simply play chess without any disadvantages from not knowing the opening. The center is still left to be defined, but my King was nice and safe and I could face the future with confidence. Barcza Opening Gedeon Barcza (1911-86) was a Hungarian grandmaster who enjoyed play- ing the "quiet" opening moves shown in Diagram 199. Against nearly every Black defense, White's first four moves were always the same. Only after the King was tucked away did White turn his attention to the center. My joy for chess was rekindled after I started to play the Barcza Opening. No longer did I have to know the latest wrinkle of an Open Ruy Lopez. I could now try to outplay my opponent with both of us playing our own moves. DIAGRAM 1 99.

CHAPTER SEVEN

Just about every World Champion at one time in their careers has played the Barcza Opening. Garry Kasparov used it against Deep Blue in their celebrated 1997 match. The world's third highest-rated grandmaster, Vladimir Kramnik, has used it throughout his entire career. Although the opening often transposes into other openings and defenses, this choice is entirely White's. White's four opening moves, l.Nf3, 2.g3, 3.Bg2, and 4.O-O, create the Barcza Opening. After these initial moves, if White follows up with c2-c4, the opening often transposes into an English Opening. If he plays d2-d4, a likely transposition into a Catalan will occur. And if White plays for d2-d3 and e2-e4, the opening becomes a King's Indian Attack (KIA). The KIA became my favorite because the ideas are quite easy to grasp. Now that we know what we are going to do as White, we need a few strategies to play against Black's reactions. Black often stakes out the cen- ter, and these are the variations for which we need ideas to combat:

[diagram]
2.. .Nf6, 3...Bf5 or 3...Bg4.

[diagram]
Defense: l...d5, 2...c5, 3...Nc6, 4...e5.

[diagram]
3.. .Nc6, 4...e6, which White should take into a Closed French

Defense. E Black can copy White's opening (see Diagram 199), and then I recommend a King's Indian Attack.

[diagram]
Indian Defense. This is called the Hedgehog Defense. Once more, the King's Indian Attack is the winning formula. London Defense (...Bc8-f5) As its name suggests, the London Defense is a venerable one noted for its solidity. Black opens with his Queen Pawn and develops in classical An Opening Solution fashion while White plays the Barcza setup:

1.Nf3d5 2.g3 Nf6

As so often happens in openings, Black's first two moves are often interchanged.

3.Bg2 Bf5 4.O-O

These moves lead to the position shown in Diagram 200. White has built his house and now needs to find a plan. Black has developed three of his units, which all control the sweet center. In fact, all three of Black's pieces control the e4-square. Good for him! So what should White's plan be? The King's Indian Attack is based upon White try- ing to push his e2-pawn up the board. White aims to do this by playing d2- d3 and Nbl-d2, preparing the charge of his e-pawn.

4.. .e6

Black fortifies the d5-pawn and makes room for the f8-Bishop. Note that Black has developed the f5-Bishop outside of his pawn chain.

5.d3

This is the signal move for the KIA. White could have played 5.c4, 5.d4, or

5.b3, each of which would channel the game in a different direction. The

text move retains White's flexibility to choose another plan, but it does show that White is preparing e2-e4.

5.. .h6

This move has become the standard for Black. It is interesting to note that despite the lead that Black held in controlling the e4-square. White will be able to push his e-pawn forward. That being the case, Black prepares the h7-square as a retreat square.

6. Nbd2

DIAGRAM 200.

CHAPTER SEVEN

This is not the ideal square for the Knight because it blocks the cl-Bishop. But White is counting upon the move e2-e4 to provide him with breathing room in the future. The development of the cl-Bishop is delayed. If White wants he can also fianchetto his Queen's Bishop.

6.. .Be7

Black is happy to develop and to prepare to castle.

7.b3

Once more White prepares another fianchetto.

7.. .O-O 8.Bb2 Nbd7

9.Re1

The position is shown in Diagram 201. White is now prepared to push his e-pawn up the board with tempo. He can then play for a Kingside attack by playing e4-e5 to push away the f6-Knight, or by playing in the center. White's good Bishops and flexible position gives him the advantage in a position where neither player needs to worry about the latest theoretical wrinkle. London Defense (...Bc8-g4) In this line of the London Defense, Black plays an important nuance by developing his Bishop to the g4- square. Often this results in a trade for the f3-Knight. In such cases, its important that Black keep the long diagonal blocked; otherwise the g2- Bishop becomes extremely power- ful.

1.Nf3Nf6 2.g3d5

3.Bg2 Bg4

One of the goals behind Black's strategy is to capture White's f3- Knight and follow up with . . .e7-e5 in

DIAGRAM 201.

An Opening Solution an attempt to establish a classical pawn center.

4.O-O Bxf3

Black immediately captures the Knight.

5.exf3

I prefer this recapture, as shown in Diagram 202. After 5.Bxf3 e5, Black gets to implement his plan. With

5.exf3, Black's center quickly col-

lapses after 5...e5? 6.Rel Nc6 7.d4! Black isn't able to play ...e7-e5 and must content himself with simple developing moves:

5.. .e6 6.f4

With this excellent move, White opens the long diagonal and tightens down on the e5-square, which will become a natural outpost.

6.. .Be7 7.d3 O-O

8. Nd2 c5

Black takes a risk that he might not be able to keep the long diagonal closed. While 8...c6 is more solid, it is passive.

9. Nf3 Nc6 1O.Re1

White will soon post a Knight on the e5-square and have a small advantage. King's Indian Reversed Defense (...d5xe4) If the Barcza Opening has a drawback, it is that Black is given the oppor- tunity to occupy the center at once. A classical player quickly picks up on this opportunity. White will be placed in the position of a counterattacker, which he will have to play forcefully: 1 .Nf3 d5 2.g3 c5

3.Bg2 Nc6 4.O-O e5

DIAGRAM 202.

CHAPTER SEVEN

Black now occupies the entire cen- ter, as shown in Diagram 203. Once again, White will play to get in e2-e4 and his own play in the center.

5.d3

White protects himself against any plans of ...e5-e4 and prepares his counter.

5...Nf6 6.e4

With this key move, White attacks the d5-pawn and forces Black to make a decision. Does he capture the e4-pawn by 6...dxe4? Push his pawn with 6...d4? Or continue his development by 6...Be7? The choice isn't an easy one.

6...dxe4

At first glance, this move appears to win a pawn, but appearances are deceiving. White's e4-pawn is inviolate:

7.dxe4 Qxd1 8.Rxd1 Bg4

Black correctly refrains from "winning" the e4-pawn with 8...Nxe4?

9.Nxe5 Nxe5 10.Bxe4. White has won back his pawn and has the much

superior position as he has a lead in development. He will try to bring his Knight to the d5-square and play Bcl-f4, developing with tempo.

9.c3

An excellent move as White prevents any play based upon ...Nc6-d4, try- ing to take advantage of the pin created by Black's last move. This posi- tion is considered quite favorable to White due to the pawn structure. I describe the concept of pawn structure extensively in Play Winning Chess (Microsoft Press, 1995) and Winning Chess Strategies (Microsoft Press, 1994). Black's d5-square is vulnerable to invasion, while White's d4- square is not.

DIAGRAM 203.

An Opening Solution The position, shown in Diagram 204, should be studied closely because this formation is quite com- mon in a King's Indian Reversed. My suggestion is to play the posi- tion out against friends as well as against a computer. Once again the e4-pawn can't be captured:

9.. .Nxe4? 1O.Re1

Now Black is in trouble. The Knight retreating by 10...Nf6 ll.Nxe5 is excellent for White. If Black plays

10...Bxf3 ll.Bxf3 Nf6 12.Bxc6+,

White again reclaims his pawn with advantage.

10.. .f5 11.Nh4

This fine stroke decides the position in White's favor. He is threatening f2- f3, where he wins a piece, as well as Nh4xf5-with or without h2-h3- when White will reclaim his pawn with advantage. King's Indian Reversed Defense (...d5-d4) As you've just witnessed, capturing the e-pawn works badly for Black. He therefore decides to close the center (l.Nf3 d5 2.g3 c5 3.Bg2 Nc6

4.O-O e5 5.d3 Nf6 6.e4):

6.. .d4

Diagram 205 shows the position. With the center pawns locked, play on the flanks becomes the leading factor. White will play for the breaks f2-f4 and c2-c3 to 1pressure the

DIAGRAM 205.

CHAPTER SEVEN

center. One of the benefits to White after Black's last move is that he now has control over the c4-square, which provides him with an ideal outpost for the bl-Knight.

7.a4

This appears to be a strange move until you understand the idea behind the move. White is anticipat- ing playing Nbl-a3-c4. Once he has spent so much time traveling there, he doesn't want his arrival to be greeted by ...b7-b5 giving the Knight the boot. White thus secures the c4-outpost for his Knight.

7.. .Be7 8.Na3 O-O

9.Nc4

The game has evolved to the position shown in Diagram 206.

9.. .Nd7 1O.Ne1

White is ready to play f2-f4 and a possible Kingside pawn storm. Once again. White is considered to possess a positional advantage.

DIAGRAM 206.

King's Indian Reversed Defense (...Bf8-e7) Clearly, Black isn't entirely satisfied with the above two lines. On move six he tries a different plan (l.Nf3 d5 2.g3 c5 3.Bg2 Nc6 4.O-O e5 5.d3 Nf6

6.e4):

6..,Be7

Instead of capturing the e4-pawn or bypassing with the d-pawn, Black just develops. Now White takes a different approach from the position shown in Diagram 207.

7.exd5

White opens the long diagonal for his g2-Bishop and exposes the e5-pawn to a frontal attack. An Opening Solution

7.. .Nxd5

In such positions, recapturing with the Queen is extremely dangerous due to the potential of a discovered attack by the g2-Bishop.

8.Re1

White immediately puts pressure on the e-pawn.

8.. .f6

Black does not make this move hap- pily, but 8. . .Bf6 9.Nxe5 Nxe5 10.f4 is good for White, while 8...Qd6 invites 9,Nbd2, with the threat of Nd2-c4 winning a pawn.

9.c3

White is preparing to open the position to his advantage with d3-d4.

[diagram]
This position, shown in Diagram 208, will soon clarify into White's favor due to his good g2-Bishop and the weaknesses caused by the move ...f7-f6. Closed French Defense If Black tries to occupy the center, but doesn't want to weaken his d5- square, he can try a different for- mation (l.Nf3 d5 2.g3 c5 3,Bg2 Nc6

4.O-O):

4.. .e6

DIAGRAM 207.

DIAGRAM 208.

CHAPTER SEVEN

Black is happy with his central gains and plays to strengthen his center. The position is shown in Diagram 209. By now White's play should be quite familiar. He will again use his e-pawn as a battering ram. 5,d3 Nf6 6,Nbd2 Be7

7.e4 O-O

As White, this was one of Bobby Fischer's favorite positions, which he used to score a number of fine wins. While the center is not locked, it soon will be. The players pursue different plans: White will go Kingside, Black Queenside. 8,Rel b5 Black gains space on the Queenside while planning to launch a pawn storm. 9,e5 Nd7 1O.h4 This is a key move in White's plan of attacking Black's King. The g5- square is to be used as a likely stepping stone and the h2-square is cleared for reasons that will soon become apparent: 1O...b4 11,Nf1a5

12.N1h2a4 13,Bf4

Practice has shown that White has the better chances. Hedgehog Defense Black's final defensive reaction that I'll examine is the Hedgehog Defense. Black meets White's Kingside fianchetto with a Kingside fianchetto in order to neutralize the g2-Bishop:

1.Nf3c5 2.g3b6

This move initiates the Hedgehog. An Opening Solution

3.Bg2

This is a position where White should carefully consider his move order. He could play 3.e4 Bb7 4.d3, setting up a King's Indian Attack at once and thereby limiting Black's choices.

3...Bb7 4.O-O g6

In Diagram 210 we can see Black's strategy. He plans to fianchetto both his Bishops and leave it up to White to define the center.

5.d3 Bg7 6.e4 d6

Black plays cautiously, obviously having been previously victimized by a King's Indian Attack!

7.Nbd2 Nd7 8.Re1 Ngf6

9.c3 O-O

The game has evolved to Diagram 211. White can play for d3-d4 and push in the center. The Hedgehog is one of the best ways for Black to meet the Barcza Opening. Certainly, by adopting the Barcza Opening as White, you will cut out a number of losses that you would experience by playing com- plicated classical openings. Your need to know the theoretical lines is reduced and you can be quite confi- dent in the safety of your King.

DIAGRAM 210.

DIAGRAM 211.

CHAPTER EIGHT

A Solution to the Queen Pawn Opening Iswas so attracted to the Barcza Opening as White that I tried out the ame formation as Black against White's Queen Pawn Opening. Known as the King's Indian Defense (KID), this is the favorite defense of both Garry Kasparov and Bobby Fischer. It comes highly recom- mended! Let's see it in action: 1,d4Nf6 2x4 g6 3,Nc3 Bg7 4x4 d6 Of course, White is under no obligation to occupy the center. He can play much more quietly with his first four moves, but it is these opening moves that put the most pressure upon Black's formation. Diagram 212 serves as the starting position. White has a large number of choices. White's main tries are:

[diagram]
Four Pawns Attack One of Black's greatest fears in play- ing the King's Indian Defense is the DIAGRAM 212.

CHAPTER EIGHT

Four Pawns Attack (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6):

5.f4

As shown in Diagram 213, White's pawn center is quite imposing! What's worse from Black's perspec- tive, the routine of ...d7-d6 and ...e7-e5 has been severely dis- rupted, and it is now impossible for Black to count on this maneuver. A change of plans is needed -and fast. However, don't despair! Although White has occupied the center, his pawns can easily become overextended.

5.. .C5

Black immediately attacks White's center and forces him to make a deci- sion.

6.d5

White bypasses the c5-pawn. After 6.dxc5 Qa5!, Black threatens ...Nf6xe4, with a winning attack. White has to protect the e4-pawn: 7.Bd3 Qxc5 produces a crucial recapture. White is prevented from playing e4-e5 in the future, and play continues: 8.Nf3 O-O 9.Qe2 Bg4 10.Be3 Qa5 11.O-O Nc6. Practice has shown the position to be dynamically equal.

[diagram]
White must be careful not to overextend his center. A mistake would be

7.e5? Ne8 8.Nf3 Bg4, when White's center collapses under Black's pressure.

[diagram]
Black makes a necessary pawn sacrifice that is similar to the Benko Gam- bit. Diagram 214 shows the position. Black desperately, and correctly, tries to break up White's center. White must accept the sacrifice because . . .b5-b4 threatens to win the e4-pawn.

8.cxb5

DIAGRAM 213.

A Solution to the Queen Pawn Opening After 8.e5 dxe5 9.fxe5 Ng4! 10.Bf4 b4 ll.Ne4 Nd7, Black is well placed to meet White in the center.

8.. .a6 9.a4

White decides to cling to his extra pawn.

9.. .Nbd7 1O.Be2axb5

11.Bxb5 Ba6

Practice has shown that Black has compensation for his pawn. He will try to utilize the half-open b-file to create counterplay. Samisch Variation Another aggressive system against the KID is the Samisch Variation (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6):

5.f3

In this variation, White's intentions are cleverly disguised. At the posi- tion shown in Diagram 215, White wants to play Bcl-e3, Qdl-d2, and castle long. He will attack on the Kingside in a style similar to the Yugoslav Attack of the Sicilian Dragon. Because I like to play the Samisch Variation as White, I know that Black has to play carefully to gain a safe position. However, the Samisch Variation has an important drawback. In the words of

DIAGRAM 214.

DIAGRAM 215.

CHAPTER EIGHT

grandmaster Eduard Gufeld, "Please, ask the gl-Knight how he likes the move f2-f3. He has been robbed of his best square!"

5.. .e5

This is probably the only time that Black should make this move before castling-an important nuance. Black is not worried about the ending

6.dxe5 dxe5 7.Qxd8+ Kxd8 8.Bg5 c6 9.O-O-O+ Kc7, correctly believing

that this middle game is not worse for him.

6.d5

This is considered White's best chance of gaining an advantage. Recall from considering the Barcza Opening that a line like 6.Nge2 exd4 7.Nxd4 O-O 8.Be2 c6 has Black preparing the break . . .d6-d5, with a fine game.

6.. .Na6

Once again, Black plays for the positional plan of controlling the c5- square. When the colors were reversed, White prefaced this move with a2-a4.

7. Be3

White sets up the attacking line previously outlined.

7.. .Nh5

This move has a dual purpose: It clears the way for Black to play ...f7-f5 and possibly ...Qd8-h4+ in order to disrupt White's plan.

8.Qd2

Diagram 216 shows one of the most interesting variations of the KID. Black can now play 8...f5, a key source of counterplay in the KID that gives him a fair game. Or he can try the Bronstein Variation:

8...Qh4+ 9.Bf2 Qf4

Black invites White to trade Queens if he'd like. DlACRAM 216. 1O.Be3 Qh4+ A Solution to the Queen Pawn Opening This invites a repetition, which is declined as follows:

11.g3 Nxg3 12.Qf2

Certainly White must avoid 12.Bf2? Nxfl, which would result in the loss of a pawn for White. Now, however, Black is forced to sacrifice his Queen:

12...Nxf1 13.Qxh4Nxe3

Black has the threats of ...Ne3-g2+ and ...Ne3-c2+, so White now moves his King:

14.Ke2 Nxc4

As shown in Diagram 217, Black has a material deficit of two Bishops and two pawns for his Queen. Speaking bluntly, the position is absolutely gross and defies analysis. I've played Black's position against Kasparov and made an easy draw. Players who don't like to sacrifice their Queen should play

8. . ,f5 instead. But please, do yourself the favor of playing out this position

against a friend. It will be very rewarding. Play often continues:

15.b3 Nb6 16.Rd Bd7

17.NH3O-O 18.Nf2f6

19.a4 Rae8

A fascinating game lies ahead. Clearly, the Samisch Variation is quite a challenging one for Black and he must be on his toes.

DIAGRAM 217.

Averbach Variation The purpose of f2-f3 in the Samisch Variation is to set up with Bcl-e3 and prevent ...Nf6-g4, which would harass White's Bishop. Isn't there another way White can do this without playing f2-f3? With this move, White covers the g4-square and initiates the Averbach Variation (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6):

CHAPTER EIGHT

5.Be2

The move is highly transpositional and we haven't reached the Aver- bach Variation quite yet.

5. ..O-O 6.Bg5

This is the move that signals the Averbach Variation, as shown in Diagram 218. White's sixth move is far more annoying than 6.Be3, because on the g5-square, the Bishop is far more active. When Black plays his DIAGRAM 218. frreei.ng move ...e7-e5, he will place himself in a nasty pin.

6.. .C6

Black prepares to counter in the center. The immediate 6...e5? 7.dxe5 dxe5 8.Qxd8 Rxd8 9.Nd5 would be a failure as Black loses material.

7.Qd2 e5

Now this break works because the d5-square is covered.

8.d5 cxd5 9.cxd5

While it might be tempting to capture on d5 with the Knight, it is wrong; after playing 9.Nxd5 Nc6 10.O-O-O Be6, Black's Knight goes to the d4- square and Black earns a good game.

9.. .Nbd7 1 O.f3

In view of Black's impending pressure on the e4-pawn with ...Nd7-c5, White strengthens his center.

[diagram]
As before. Black secures the c5-square. 1l.Nh3Nc5 12.Nf2a4

13.O-O Bd7

A Solution to the Queen Pawn Opening Theorists consider the position shown in Diagram 219 to be dynamically balanced. King's Indian Defense, Main Line By far, White's most popular way of meeting the KID is the main line, where White just develops his King- side, happy with his central gains (l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4,e4 d6):

5.Nf3 O-O 6.Be2

White's last two moves are inter- changeable and some grandmasters enjoy the time their opponents spend reflecting about how they intend to meet the Averbach Variation!

6.. .e5 7.O-O

Diagram 220 features the starting position of the main line King's Indian Defense. My colleague, grandmaster John Nunn, has written two 300- page books called The Main Line King's Indian (Henry Holt and Com- pany, 1996) and The New Classical King's Indian (International Chess Enterprises, 1997), in which he goes into great detail about the strategic considerations facing both players. Needless to say, it is an impossible act to follow! My recommendation for Black is to play as follows:

7.. .exd4 8.Nxd4 Re8

9.f3 c6

DIAGRAM 219.

DIAGRAM 220.

CHAPTER EIGHT

Black is ready to break out with ...d6-d5 or, at certain times, ...Qd8- b6, which can be an annoying move. 1O.Kh1 This is the key move in this varia- tion, as shown in Diagram 221. White has tried other lines, including 10.Be3 and 10.Nc2, and is unable to gain any superiority. (One nice trick for Black is 10.Be3 d5 ll.cxd5 Nxd5! 12.Nxd5 cxd5, leav- ing Black with no problems.) Instead, White gets off the a7-gl diagonal where his King might be vulnerable.

10.. .Nbd7

This is considered the most solid continuation. Black would dearly love to play the immediate ...d6-d5, but it fails: 10. ..d5 ll.cxdS cxd5 12.Bg5 dxe4

13.Ndb5! White's lead in development gives him the advantage. With the

text, Black is prepared to put his Knight on either the e5- or c5-square and, in the cases of ...d6-d5, the Knight can play to the b6-square. White now has a large choice of moves, including ll.Nb3, ll.Nc2, ll.Rbl, and ll.Bf4. Theory considers this to be White's best move:

11.Bg5

The f6-Knight is pinned and Black's ability to play . ..d6-d5 is slowed. Black also has his choices, and ll...Qb6 and ll...Qa5 have been popular alternatives. I prefer the text for reasons that shall soon be clear:

12.Bh4Ne5 13.Qc2

One trick that White must avoid is 13.Qd2? Nxe4! because the h4-Bishop is unprotected.

13.. .g5 14.Bf2 c5

15.Nb3 Be6

DIAGRAM 221.

A Solution to the Queen Pawn Opening These moves lead to the position shown in Diagram 222. Theory con- siders White's position to be slightly better, but I'm suspicious of this evaluation. Benoni players will be happy to have a powerful e5-Knight, and the b3-Knight is definitely out of play for some time. Black is cer- tainly capable of raising a heck of a fuss. Take a close look at this posi- tion and see how much fun playing the KID can be!

DIAGRAM 222.

CHAPTER NINE

A Solution to the King Pawn Opening After discovering the solidity of building a house in chess, I became attracted to the very same formations against White's King Pawn Opening. This time, however, the ideas were far more tricky for me than in a Barcza Opening and a King's Indian Defense (KID). In time, I learned to play the Pirc Defense, which became a career defense that I still use to this day. The opening move order is quite important for Black as a single mistake can give him a bad game. The opening moves are: 1 ,e4 d6 Black is heading for the Barcza formation. The alternative l...Nf6 is the Alekhine Defense, which would provoke e4-e5-a threat Black will try to avoid. 2,d4 White establishes a classical pawn center. White could certainly entertain other, quieter formations, but this is considered White's best. 2,..Nf6 Black develops while attacking the e4-pawn.

3.Nc3

White could also play 3.f3 g6 4.c4 Bg7 5.Nc3, transposing directly back to the Samisch Variation of the KID. In fact, this was the move order that Kasparov used against me in one of our tournament games. 3,..g6 Black initiates the Pirc Defense. Left to his own devices, Black will com- plete his house and then counter in the center. From the position shown

CHAPTER NINE

in Diagram 223, White has a wide range of possibilities:

and Bg5-h6 to trade dark-squared Bishops, this line is called the Modern System.

[diagram]
Variation in the KID. White plays for h2-h4-h5, trying to blow down Black's house.

[diagram]
White's desire to complete his Kingside development and hold a plus in the center. In comparing Diagram 223 with Diagram 212, the difference is the placement of White's c-pawn. It can be argued that the pawn on the c4- square is far more active and controls the sweet center. On the c2-square, White's Queenside isn't as weakened, so that if White decides to castle there, his King's protection will be significantly improved. The difference comes down to a question of style. One thing is certain: With the pawn on c2, White can use the extra tempo to considerably sharpen the game.

DIAGRAM 223.

A Solution to the King Pawn Opening Austrian Attack The Austrian Attack causes Black to be on guard early. Play begins (l.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6):

4.f4

Diagram 224 shows the initial posi- tion of the Austrian Attack, and it's easy to see why it's also called the Three Pawns Attack. White's play is straightforward as can be; he is winding up for e4-e5 and crashing through in the center.

4...Bg7 5.Nf3 O-O

These moves lead to the most provocative lines of the Austrian. White is being encouraged to push in the center, where Black hopes that White will become overextended. White now has three main lines:

[diagram]
Austrian Attack (6.e5) The central push seems logical, but Black should be happy because he can chip away at White's center (l.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.f4 Bg7 5.Nf3

O-O):

6.e5 NeB

Black is forced to retreat, but in so doing opens the way for his g7-Bishop. Black's central focus will be the e5-pawn, and he'll use ...c7-c5 to under- mine White's central support.

7.Be3

White develops and tries to restrain the ...c7-c5 break. White has tried

7.Bc4, 7.Bd3, and 7.h4, but in each case 7. . .c5 gives Black good counterplay.

DIAGRAM 224.

CHAPTER NINE

7.. .c5 8.dxc5

White accepts Black's pawn sacri- fice. Otherwise ...c5xd4 causes White's center to collapse.

8.. .NC6 9.Be2 Bg4

This is Black's key resource. He is trying to unlock the potential of his g7-Bishop. 1 0.cxd6 exd6 1 1 .exd6 Nxd6 The center has been blown up and White has won a pawn. The position shown in Diagram 225 offers Black DIAGRAM 225. excellent compensation.

12.Bc5 Bxc3+ 13.bxc3 Ne4

14.Bxf8Qb6

After Black's fourteenth move, he has gained a dangerous attack. A likely continuation is 15.Rfl Nxc3 16.Qd2 Nxe2 17.Qxe2 Rxf8, when Black has sacrificed an exchange for good play against White's King. Austrian Attack (6.Bd3) This line and the next one are White's preferred choices in the Austrian Attack, as White plays for development (l.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6

3.Nc3 g6 4.f4 Bg7 5.Nf3 O-O):

6.Bd3 Na6

A surprising move away from the center leads us to Diagram 226. Black supports his freeing break ...c7-c5, and once again invites e4- e5 by White.

7.O-O

DIAGRAM 226.

A Solution to the King Pawn Opening White brings his King into safety before pressing in the center. White has tried playing for central control with 7.e5 Ne8 8.Be3. Black should perse- vere and prepare his central break ...c7-c5 by 8...b6. Black is not playing to fianchetto his Bishop; rather, he intends to smash White's center with ...c7-c5. Although White has a position that would make a classical player happy, Black's central counter will give him good play.

7.. .C5

Black goes for his standard break in the Austrian Attack. Grandmaster practice has shown that White's best chance for the advantage is to push his d-pawn.

8.d5 Rb8

The position is now similar to a Benoni, with Black playing for the . . .b7-b5 push.

9.Kh1

This move is considered best as White sidesteps a number of tricks based upon ...b7-b5 and ...c5-c4. The immediate attacking plan, 9.Qel Nb4, gives Black the chance to win the two Bishops.

9.. .Nc7 1O.a4a6

11.a5b5 12.axb6Rxb6

As shown in Diagram 227, White has an advantage in the center, while Black's pressure is on the Queen- side. He will play for ...Nc7-b5 and, in most cases, ...e7-e6, continuing to chip away at the center. The position is a highly charged one, typical of Benoni and Pirc Defenses. The chances are about even.

DIAGRAM 227.

CHAPTER NINE

Austrian Attack (6.Be3) As in the previous lines of the Austrian Attack, White develops while retain- ing his central options (l.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.f4 Bg7 5.Nf3 O-O):

6.Be3

The advantage of this move is that it makes it much more difficult for Black to make his freeing . . .c7-c5 break.

6.. .b6

Black spends an extra tempo preparing his . . .c7-c5 break.

7.e5 Ng4

Usually the Knight parks itself on the e8-square. Black decides on the text to pick up a tempo.

8. Bg1 c5 9,h3

Black suffers the consequences of venturing forward. The Knight is forced into a retreat, but White spends a lot of time trying to corral the Knight.

9.. .Nh6 1O.d5

It would be a mistake to play 10.dxc5? bxc5 ll.Qd5? (trying to spear the Rook) because ll...Qb6! is excellent for Black. White tries to keep his center intact.

10.. .Nd7

Provocative as ever, Black tries to lure White's center forward to its death.

11.Qe2

White protects the e5-pawn. After ll.e6? fxe6 12.dxe6 Nf6 13.Bc4 Nh5, Black wins the f4-pawn. Diagram 228 shows the current position.

[diagram]
DIAGRAM 228.

A Solution to the King Pawn Opening In a beautifully timed break, Black attempts to kick away the only defender of the d-pawn.

12.O-O-O

The game is about to become violent as both Kings now face fierce attacks. 12.Nxb5 (12.Qxb5? Rb8 advantageously regains the b-pawn) 12,..Qa5+ 13.Qd2 (13.c3 Ba6 and 13.Nc3 Rb8 both offer Black good com- pensation for the sacrificed pawn) 13...Qxd2+ 14.Kxd2 dxe5 results in approximate equality.

12. ..b4 13.Ne4 Nb6

14.g4 Bb7

The position shown in Diagram 229 is a barn burner, with both players having their trumps. Pirc Defense (4.f3 or 4.Be3) Building a house is a well-respected defensive strategy in grandmaster cir- cles. For this reason, many players immediately try to storm the founda- tions by trading off the fianchettoed Bishop. After (l.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6), Black has committed himself to the fianchetto. The favored move for White to trade the f8-Bishop is:

4.Be3

White wants to play Qdl-d2, Be3-h6, and probably h2-h4-h5, with a King- side initiative. In the past, theorists suggested that White should pref- ace the move with 4.f3, thereby pre- venting a timely ...Nf6-g4. Indeed, f2-f3 forms an important nucleus of White's plans, but this move should be delayed. White's point is that

4...Ng4 5.Bg5 h6 6.Bh4 g5 7.Bg3

sends Black on a wild goose chase.

DIAGRAM 229.

CHAPTER NINE

He has weakened his Kingside without trading Knight for Bishop. The rule of thumb is that this kind of chase should be encouraged only if Black is able to nab the Bishop. Diagram 230 shows the current position, in which Black must become a little crafty himself.

4...C6

Black makes an exception to the traditional "automatic" play to com- plete his house, 4...Bg7. The rea- son for the text is that Black anticipates that White will castle Queenside. He wants to save the tempo ...Bf8-g7 and accelerate a Queenside pawn storm.

5. Qd2 b5

Black reveals his point. He now threatens ...b5-b4, thereby chasing away the c3-Knight, the only defender of the e4-pawn.

6. f3

White reinforces his center. Although the moves 4.Be3 and 4.f3 are inter- changeable, both players should be precise with their move order. Under the present order of moves, Black has forced White to include the tempo f2-f3. Without this order of moves, White might have foregone f2-f3 alto- gether. One of the benefits of f2-f3 is that White can now plan g2-g4-g5, removing an important defender with tempo. Again, Black should resist the temptation to automatically fianchetto his Bishop.

6.. .Nbd7 7.O-O-O

White has also tried to delay this committed move by 7.Nh3, 7.h4, 7.Bh6, and 7.g4, amongst others. 7.g4 aims for g4-g5; after 7...Nb6, Black has made room on the d7-square for his f6-Knight to retreat. That's why Black's opening move order deserves careful scrutiny.

7.. .Nb6

DIAGRAM 230.

A Solution to the King Pawn Opening Diagram 231 shows the position. Both players will zealously attempt to maul one another's King. A sample line might run:

8.g4 b4 9.Nb1 a5

1O.h4h5 11.g5 Nh7

12.Bd3 Bg7

This leaves a wild game in view, fea- turing a typical Pirc middle game. Modern System The lines described in the previous section gave a number of grandmas- ters some clever ideas, including (l.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6):

4. Bg5

White reasons that he wants to play as before, using Qdl-d2 and Be3-h6 with a nice twist. He can also play for the Austrian Attack with the Bishop on a much more aggressive square.

4...h6

Black puts the question to the Bishop immediately. White would have an advantage after 4...Bg7

5.f4!, when the move e4-e5 will come

with added punch because the g5- Bishop does so much more than in the previous Austrian Attack varia- tions.

5. Be3

The position shown in Diagram 232 is nearly the same as the one shown in Diagram 230, with an important

DIAGRAM 231.

DIAGRAM 232.

CHAPTER NINE

nuance: White has induced the move ...h7-h6. The great debate is, which side benefits? It is clear that after the battery Qdl-d2, the h6-pawn is a tar- get and Black's King is stuck in the center. Furthermore, White will be able to play g2-g4, h2-h4 and with g4-g5 insure himself of prying open the Kingside. On the other hand, White has robbed himself of the Be3-h6 trading Bishops option.

5...C6 6.f3 b5

7.Qd2 Nbd7

After these moves, the game is similar to the previous variation with the h6-pawn sticking out. Black's King shouldn't be too uncomfortable in the center because White isn't threatening to crash through any time soon. Pirc Defense (4.Be2) A rather cunning line is (l.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6):

4.Be2

White has not revealed his point. He might easily transpose into the main line, which I describe later in this chapter.

4...Bg7 5.h4

Diagram 233 shows White's belliger- ent move. It's appalling that White decides to storm the house before the Black King even makes it to the Kingside. White's intentions are as clear as they are aggressive. He will push his h-pawn and rip open the Kingside. It would now be a grievous error for Black to play 5... O-O, for as they say in chess parlance, "Black would castle into it." And by it, they mean a bone-crunching attack. After

DIAGRAM 233.

A Solution to the King Pawn Opening White's fifth move, Black should definitely be put off from castling Kingside for awhile.

5.. .c5

Once more Black strikes in the center with this familiar counter. This brings me to the last wise opening principle of this book: An attack on the wing is best met by a counter in the center. This dictum was laid down centuries ago and it's as valid as ever. Time and time again in master games you will see this type of principled response. Look for it in your games too. Black forces a central response.

6.dxc5

White could try 6.d5 a6 7.h5 (7.a4 e6 leaves White wondering where he will castle) 7...b5, which produces the better position for Black.

6.. .Qa5

Black utilizes a standard Pirc Defense resource, and threatens ...Nf6xe4 with advantage.

7.Qd3

White defends the e4-pawn and sets a cunning trap: 7...Nxe4?? 8.Qb5+ wins a piece.

7.. .Qxc5 8.Be3 Qa5

9,h5 White pursues his Kingside play.

9.. .NC6 1O.h6

White achieves nothing from

Black has a fine position.

10.. .Bf8 11.O-O-O Bd7

As shown in Diagram 234, the posi- tion has become an unusual Sicilian where Black has an excellent game.

DIAGRAM 234.

CHAPTER NINE

Geller Quiet System (Pirc Defense Main Line) Russian Grandmaster Efim Geller is a first-class attacker of the highest order. He is one of the few players in the world to have a better score against Bobby Fischer. When such a bold player devises a "quiet" line against the Pirc Defense, you just know that things are boiling below the surface. Play begins with a fundamentally principled move in which White develops his Knight to its best square (l.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6):

4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Be2 O-O

6.O-O

Diagram 235 shows the starting position of Geller's system. White has a classical pawn center and is happy with his gain. It is up to Black to find an effective counter.

6...c6

With this multipurpose move, Black feints a possible ...b7-b5, but mainly intends to cover the d5-square. In some lines, Black can also play ...d6-d5 intending to leap into the e4-square. White has tried three plans:

and prepares e4-e5 Geller Quiet System (7.a4) While this move reasonably fur- thers White's intention of prevent- ing a Queenside expansion, it hardly pressures Black's position (l.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Be2 O-O 6.O-O c6):

I prefer Black's position. Geller Quiet System (7.h3) This is a far more useful move. White makes luft and prevents annoyances from happening on the g4-square, by (l.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7

5.Be2 O-O 6.O-O c6):

White also is set to play 8.e5 dxe5 9.dxe5, forcing the f6-Knight to retreat.

Black concedes that ...b7-b5 is not yet a threat. Black stands badly after:

Otherwise Black will play ...e7-e5. Kasparov as Black has faced 8.Bf4 Qa5

The position is considered equal as White has problems creating active play in the center. Geller Quiet System (7.Re1) This is the most dangerous line for Black. White supports his e-pawn so that it will act as a bowling ball as it moves up the board, knocking pieces out of the way (l.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Be2 O-O 6.O-O c6):

A Solution to the King Pawn Opening ings, and that it has given you some insight into classical and modern openings and defenses. I hope that my recommended formations of the Barcza Opening, the King's Indian Defense, and the Pirc Defense will bring you a career of success as they have brought me. Happy hunting. Glossary Active: An aggressive move or position. Advantage: A net superiority of position, usually based on force, time, space, or pawn structure. Algebraic Notation: The international standard for writing chess moves. Each square on the chessboard is given a letter and a number, as shown in Diagram 239. When a piece travels from one square to another, algebraic notation enables you to identify the piece and the square to which it is moving. For example, if the Rook moves from square al to square a8, you write Ra8. For pawn moves, you write only the square to which the pawn moves; for example, e4. Castling Kingside is written O-O, and castling Queenside is written O-O-O. Analysis: The calculation of a series of moves based on a particular posi- tion. In tournament play, you are not allowed to move the pieces during analysis but must make all calcula- tions in your head. When the game is over, opponents commonly ana- lyze the game they have just played, moving the pieces about in an effort to discover what the best moves would have been. a8 b8 c8 d8 e8 f8 g8 h8 a7 b7 c7 d7 e7 f7 g7 h7 a6 b6 c6 d6 e6 f6 g6 h6 a5 b5 c5 d5 e5 f5 g5 h5 a4 b4 c4 d4 e4 f4 g4 h4 a3 b3 c3 d3 e3 f3 g3 h3 a2 b2 c2 d2 e2 f2 g2 h2 a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 f1 g1 hi

WINNING CHESS OPENINGS

Attack: To start an aggressive action in a particular area of the board, or to threaten to capture a piece or pawn. Bind: When one player has a grip on the position because of a large advantage in space and his opponent is unable to find useful moves. Bishop Pair: Two Bishops versus a Bishop and a Knight or two Knights. Two Bishops work well together because they can control diagonals of both colors. See also Opposite-Colored Bishops. Blockade: To stop an enemy pawn by placing a piece (ideally a Knight) directly in front of it. Popularized by Aaron Nimzovitch. Blunder: A terrible move that loses material or involves decisive posi- tional or tactical concessions. Book: Opening analysis found in chess books and magazines. A book player relies heavily on memorization of published material rather than on his own creative spark. Break: The offer of an exchange of pawns in order to gain space or mobil- ity. Also called a pawn break. Castle: A player castles by moving his King and Rook simultaneously. Castling is the only move in which a player can deploy two pieces in one move. Castling allows a player to move his King out of the center (the main theater of action in the opening) to the flank, where the King can be protected by pawns. Additionally, castling develops a Rook. When White castles Kingside, he moves his King from el to gl and his hl-Rook to fl. When Black castles Kingside, he moves his King from e8 to g8 and his h8-Rook to f8. When White castles Queenside, he moves his King from el to cl and his al-Rook to dl. And when Black castles Queenside, he moves his King from e8 to c8 and his a8-Rook to d8. Glossary Center: The center is the area of the board encompassed by the rectangle c3-c6-f6-f3. Squares e4, d4, e5, and d5 are the most important part of the center. The e- and d-files are the center files. Centralize: To place pieces or pawns in the center, or as close to the center as possible. From there, they can control a good chunk of enemy territory. Checkmate: An attack against the enemy King from which the King cannot escape. When a player checkmates his opponent's King, he wins the game. Classical: A style of play that focuses on the creation of a full pawn center. Classical principles tend to be rather dogmatic and inflexible. The philoso- phy of the classical players was eventually challenged by the so-called "hypermoderns." See also Hypermodern. Closed Game: A position that is obstructed by blocking chains of pawns. Such a position tends to favor Knights over Bishops, because the pawns block the diagonals. Combination: A sacrifice combined with a forced series of moves, which exploits specific peculiarities of the positions in the hope of attaining a cer- tain goal. Compensation: An advantage in one area that balances the opponent's advantage in another area. Material versus development is one example; three pawns versus a Bishop is another. Control: To completely dominate an area of the board. Dominating a file or a square, or simply having the initiative, can constitute control. Counterplay: When the player who has been on the defensive starts his own aggressive action. Cramp: The lack of mobility that is usually the result of a disadvantage in space.

WINNING CHESS OPENINGS

Critical Position: An important point in the game, where victory or defeat hangs in the balance. Defense: A move or series of moves designed to thwart an enemy attack. Also used in the names of many openings initiated by Black. Examples are the French Defense and the Caro-Kann Defense. Development: The process of moving pieces from their starting positions to new posts, from which they control a greater number of squares and have greater mobility. Discovered Attack: A discovered attack is an ambush. A Queen, Rook, or Bishop lies in wait so that it can attack when another piece or pawn moves out of its way. Discovered Check: The most effective type of discovered attack, which involves checking the enemy King. Double Attack: An attack against two pieces or pawns at the same time. Double Check: The most powerful type of discovered attack, which checks the King with two pieces. The King is forced to move, and the enemy army is thus frozen for at least one move. Doubled Pawns: Two pawns of the same color lined up on a file. This dou- bling can only come about as the result of a capture. Draw: A tied game. A draw can result from a stalemate, from a three-time repetition of position, or by agreement between the players. Dynamic: Implies action and movement. A dynamic factor concerns itself with actual moves and threats and involves combinations of attack and defense maneuvers. The two main aspects of a dynamic factor are time and force. Glossary Endgame: The third and final phase of a chess game. An endgame arises when few pieces remain on the board. The clearest signal that the ending is about to begin is when Queens are exchanged. En Prise: A French term that means in take. It describes a piece or pawn that is vulnerable to capture. Equality: A situation in which neither side has an advantage or the play- ers' advantages balance out. Exchange: The trading of pieces, usually pieces of equal value. Exchange, The: Winning the Exchange means winning a Rook for a Bishop or a Knight. Fianchetto: An Italian term that means on the flank and applies only to Bishops. A fianchetto (pronounced fyan-KET-td) involves placing a White Bishop on g2 or b2 or a Black Bishop on g7 or b7. FIDE: The acronym for Federation Internationale des Echecs, the interna- tional chess federation. File: A vertical column of eight squares. Designated in algebraic notation as the a-file, b-file, and so on. See also Half-Open File; Open File. Flank: The a-, b-, and c-files on the Queenside, and the f-, g-, and h-files on the Kingside. Force: An advantage in force arises when one player has more material than his opponent or when he outmans his opponent in a certain area of the board. Forced: A move or series of moves that must be played if disaster is to be avoided.

WINNING CHESS OPENINGS

Fork: A tactical maneuver in which a piece or pawn attacks two enemy pieces or pawns at the same time. Gambit: The voluntary sacrifice of at least a pawn in the opening, with the idea of gaining a compensating advantage (usually time, which per- mits development) . Grandmaster: A title awarded by FIDE to players who meet an estab- lished set of performance standards, including a high rating. It is the highest title (other than World Champion) attainable in chess. Lesser titles include International Master and FIDE Master, which is the lowest title awarded for international play. Once earned, a Grandmaster title can- not be taken away. See also Master. Half-Open File: A file that contains none of one player's pawns but one or more of his opponent's. Hanging Pawns: A pawn island consisting of two pawns side by side on the 4th rank on half-open files. Sometimes, hanging pawns are the source of dynamic energy for an attack; at other times, they become a target, sub- ject to frontal attack by the enemy. See also Pawn Island. Hypermodern: A school of thought that arose in reaction to the classical theories of chess. The hypermoderns insisted that putting a pawn in the center in the opening made it a target. The heroes of this movement were Richard Reti and Aaron Nimzovich, both of whom expounded the idea of controlling the center from the flanks. Like the ideas of the classicists, those of the hypermoderns can be carried to extremes. Nowadays, both views are seen as correct A distillation of the two philosophies is needed to cope successfully with any particular situation. See also Classical. Initiative: When you are able to make threats to which your opponent must react, you are said to possess the initiative. Glossary Isolated Pawn: A pawn with no like-colored pawns on either adjacent file. The drawbacks of an isolated pawn are that it is not guarded by a friendly pawn and that the square directly in front of it can make a nice home for an enemy piece, because no pawns can chase that piece away. On the other hand, an isolated pawn has plenty of space and controls squares on the open (or half-open) files on either side of it, with the result that minor pieces and Rooks of the same color usually become active. An isolated pawn is, however, considered a weakness. Ringside: The half of the board made up of the e, f, g, and h files. Kingside pieces are the King, the Bishop next to it, the Knight next to the Bishop, and the Rook next to the Knight. See also Queenside. Luft: A German term that means air. In chess, it means to give the King breathing room. It describes a pawn move made in front of the King of the same color to avoid back rank mate possibilities. Major Pieces: Queens and Rooks. Also called heavy pieces. Master: In the US, a player with a rating of 2200 or more. If a player's rat- ing drops below 2200, the title is rescinded. See also Grandmaster. Mate: Short for checkmate. Material: All the pieces and pawns. A material advantage is when a player has more pieces on the board than his opponent or has pieces of greater value. Mating Attack: An attack on the enemy King, with checkmate as the ulti- mate goal. Middle Game: The phase between the opening and the endgame. Minor Pieces: The Bishops and Knights. Mobility: Freedom of movement for the pieces.

Occupation: A Rook or Queen that controls a file or rank is said to occupy that file or rank. A piece is said to occupy the square it is sitting on. Open File: A vertical column of eight squares that is free of pawns. Rooks reach their maximum potential when placed on open files or open ranks. Open Game: A position characterized by many open ranks, files, or diag- onals and few center pawns. A lead in development becomes very impor- tant in positions of this type. Opening: The start of a game, incorporating the first dozen or so moves. The basic goals of an opening are to:

[diagram]
bringing the Rooks toward the center and placing them on poten- tially open files Openings: Established sequences of moves that lead to the goals outlined under Opening. These sequences of moves are often named after the player who invented them or after the place where they were first played. Some openings, such as the King's Gambit and the English, have been ana- lyzed to great lengths in chess literature. Opposite-Colored Bishops: Also Bishops of opposite color. When players have one Bishop each and the Bishops are on different-colored squares. Opposite-colored Bishops can never come into direct contact. Overextension: When space is gained too fast. By rushing his pawns for- ward and trying to control a lot of territory, a player can leave weaknesses in his camp, or can weaken the advanced pawns themselves. He is then said to have overextended his position. Glossary Passive: In relation to a move, denotes a move that does nothing to fight for the initiative. In relation to a position, denotes a position that is devoid of counterplay or active possibilities. Pawn Center: Pawns that are inside the rectangle bounded by squares c3, f3, f6, and c6. Pawn Chain: A diagonal line of same-colored pawns. Pawn Island: Two pawns are members of different islands if neither can protect the other. Pawn islands are separated by open files. Pawns that are both doubled and isolated constitute two pawn islands. Having fewer pawn islands than the opponent is advantageous. See also Hanging Pawns. Pawn Structure: Also referred to as the pawn skeleton. All aspects of the pawn setup. Perpetual Check: When one player places his opponent in check, forcing a reply, followed by another check and another forced reply, followed by another check that repeats the first position. Because such a game could be played forever, after the position repeats itself, the game is declared a draw. Pin: When one player attacks a piece that his opponent cannot move with- out losing a different piece of greater value. When the piece of greater value is the King, this tactic is called an absolute pin; when it is not the King, the tactic is called a relative pin. Plan: A short- or long-range goal on which a player bases his moves. Poisoned Pawn: A pawn whose capture is a precursor to a strong attack. Positional: A move or style of play that is based on long-range consider- ations. The slow buildup of small advantages is said to be positional. Premature: Taking action without sufficient preparation.

WINNING CHESS OPENINGS

Prepared Variation: In professional chess, it is common practice to ana- lyze book openings in the hope of finding a new move or plan. When a player makes such a discovery, he will often save this prepared variation for use against a special opponent. Queenside: The half of the board that includes the d-, c-, b-, and a-files. The Queenside pieces are the Queen, the Bishop next to it, the Knight next to the Bishop, and the Rook next to the Knight. See also Kingside. Quiet Move: An unassuming move that is not a capture, a check, or a direct threat. A quiet move often occurs at the end of a maneuver or com- bination that drives the point home. Rank: A horizontal row of eight squares. Designated in algebraic notation as the 1 (1st) rank, the 2 (2nd) rank, and so on. Rating: A number that measures a player's relative strength. The higher the number, the stronger the player. Resign: When a player realizes that he is going to lose and graciously gives up the game without waiting for a checkmate. When resigning, a player can simply say, "I resign," or he can tip over his King in a gesture of helplessness. When you first start playing chess, I recommend that you never resign. Always play until the end. Sacrifice: The voluntary offer of material for compensation in space, time, pawn structure, or even force. (A sacrifice can lead to a force advantage in a particular part of the board.) Unlike a combination, a sacrifice is not always a calculable commodity and often entails an element of uncertainty. Sharp: An aggressive move or position. In relation to a player, denotes someone who enjoys dynamic, attacking chess. Skewer: A threat against a valuable piece that forces that piece to move, allowing the capture of a less valuable piece behind it. Glossary Smothered Checkmate: When a King is completely surrounded by its own pieces (or is at the edge of the board) and it receives an unanswer- able check from the enemy. Space: The territory controlled by each player. Speculative: Made without calculating the consequences to the extent normally required. Sometimes full calculation is not possible, so a player must rely on intuition, from which a speculative plan might arise. Strategy: The reasoning behind a move, plan, or idea. Tactics: Maneuvers that take advantage of short-term opportunities. A position with many traps and combinations is considered to be tactical in nature. Tempo: One move, as a unit of time; the plural is tempi. If a piece can reach a useful square in one move but takes two moves to get there, it has lost a tempo. For example, after l.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.Qxd4 Nc6, Black gains a tempo and White loses one because the White Queen is attacked and White must move his Queen a second time to get it to safety. Theory: Well-known opening, middle game, and endgame positions that are documented in books. Transposition: Reaching an identical opening position by a different order of moves. For example, the French Defense is usually reached by l.e4 e6

2.d4 d5, but l.d4 e6 2.e4 d5 transposes into the same position.

Trap: A way of surreptitiously luring the opponent into making a mistake. Two Bishops: See Bishop Pair. Unclear: An assessment of a position. Some positions are good for White, others are good for Black, and still others are equal. Unclear means that the analyst is unable or unwilling to state which applies.

Variation: One line of analysis in any phase of the game. It could be a line of play other than the ones used in the game. The term variation is fre- quently applied to one line of an opening; for example, the Wilkes-Barre Variation (named after the city in Pennsylvania) of the Two Knights' Defense. Variations can become as well-analyzed as their parent openings. Entire books have been written on some well-known variations. Weakness: Any pawn or square that is readily attackable and therefore hard to defend. Index

1. Bishops like open diagonals and should

usually be developed accordingly. You may also use your bishop to pin an enemy piece, or to unpin your own. Exchanging your bishop for a knight is reasonable, but do so only to gain some advantage (or if forced to), otherwise you will be surrendering the advantage of the bishop-pair for no return. Although there are many exceptions to this in various openings, try not to let your bishops become trapped behind their own pawns with out good reason. Having said that, limiting a bishop's activity may be necessary to ensure that your knights, rooks and remaining bishop secure good positions.

2. Knights also need as much freedom of

movement as possible, but only to the extent that they don't unduly interfere with the ac tivity of other pieces. For that reason, you may see knights developed on the second rank or on the side of the board with their first move, in stead of to one of the 'ideal' squares f3, c3, f6 or c6. Knights are particularly fond of outposts, which arise in many openings. An outpost is a place in the opponent's pawn-structure where your piece cannot be attacked by a pawn. To have significance, an outpost should be on at least your 4th rank, and preferably on the 5th or 6th rank. From an outpost on a central file, a knight can exert considerable influence on sev eral squares in the enemy position while main taining defensive coverage. Here's an example of an outpost that's occupied by a knight (see upper diagram on following page): The defining feature of the outpost is that the knight can't be captured by a pawn. Its influ ence would be further strengthened by a rook or queen on the d-file, or by another knight on c3 or e3.

THE NATURE OF CHESS OPENINGS: FUNDAMENTALS 21

In the lower diagram Black's knight is on an outpost that is unsupported by his own pawns yet not subject to attack by the opponent's pawns. Notice that Black could also occupy this outpost with a dark-squared bishop, rook, or queen. Support for the eS-knight could come from rooks on the open file, another knight, a bishop on f6 or d6, and various placements of Black's queen. This is a real-world example: Black has an outpost on d5. Some students will say that White's knight has an outpost on e5, but notice that if Black's knight moves from f6, he could then attack the knight with a pawn by .. .f6. In stead, the e5-square is sometimes called a 'support-point' because it is supported by his d4-pawn and unlikely to be driven away by a pawn in the near future. Knights are sometimes just as happy to reside on a support-point as they are to occupy an outpost. The outpost and support-point are examples of structural configurations, a subject that we expand upon in Chapter 2 and still more Chap ter 3.

3. Rooks like to have open files, preferably

ones that extend vertically as far as possible into the enemy camp. Early pawn exchanges will sometimes let rooks breathe and have im mediate effect upon the game. In the opening, assuming that you castle in one direction or an other, your rooks may well end up on half-open files (ones blocked by your own pawns). If they can be centralized so as either to defend your e or d-pawns or to assist in their advance, that's also not a bad role. Doubling rooks (placing one behind the other on an open file) used to be uncommon in the opening stage, but since openings extend further and further into what was previously called the middle game, you'll definitely run across that situation. Likewise with the placement a rook on the seventh rank, which isn't generally possible until after the opening, but does occur, usually to assist in an attack. Rook-lifts to the third rank, on the other hand, happen relatively frequently; often they will move horizontally to help with an attack on the opponent's king. Another common rook-lift in the opening is to the second rank, because a rook which moves horizontally along the second rank can defend extremely sensitive squares such as the ones immediately in front of the king. This 'second-rank defence' is essential against some attacks, and such rooks may also be able to swing to the e- and d-files to support the centre.

4. Apart from wide-open games in which

the centre pawns are blown off the board early on, the queen tends to stay at home or

22 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

to lurk behind her pawns and pieces in the early stages of the opening. Increasingly, advanced players are bringing the queen out early but in a judicious manner to control more of the board - a practice that you'll see in this book. There's nothing wrong with exchanging queens in the opening, but there's also no reason to go out of your way to do so, as so many young players do. Activity and Initiative I shall refer time and again to a player's active pieces and to activity in general. This is a con cept that may encompass a coordination of forces, but to a first approximation simply ex presses the mobility and reach of one's pieces. Active pieces control more squares. Such pieces aren't necessarily involved in a direct attack but can serve to harass opposing forces, support a pawn advance, and generally accrue more terri tory. You will see that in opening play the active player tends to get the better game, in part because active pieces tend to force slower ones onto the defensive, resulting in the creation of weaknesses in the enemy camp. The balance that generally exists between attack and de fence in chess will break down if one player is working with direct threats and gaining more control of the board. Gathering momentum like this is called 'having the initiative'. As long as the aggressor is able to force his opponent to keep reacting to threats, he will maintain his initiative. Sometimes the initiative peters out, especially if handled poorly; it can even change hands. In this book, you will run across an as sessment of mine that reads simply 'Black has the initiative'. While it is ambiguous how much advantage that confers on Black, the initiative constitutes an advantage in and of itself. This chapter has covered terminology and general ideas that I hope will serve you well. Re member that most of what is discussed in these first three chapters will be applied and rein forced in the investigation of specific openings that occupies the larger portion of this book.

lt:lf3 lllc6 3 .i.c4 .i.c5 4 b4 .i.xb4 5 c3 .i.a5 6 O-O the likes of 6 ... 'i!Vf6!? were largely replaced by safer defences such as Lasker' s 6 ...d6 7 d4 .i.b6. In addition, provocative openings such as the Philidor Countergambit ( 1 e4 e5 2 lllf3 d6 3 d4 f5), and the Schliemann Defence to the Ruy Lopez (1 e4 e5 2 lt:lf3 lllc6 3 .i.b5 f5) were held to be dubious or were at any rate supplanted by more careful strategies. Lastly, responses to 1 e4 which favoured confrontation over equality also failed to gain a foothold until their playa bility was established. Most masters didn't take seriously such moves as 1...lt:lf6, l ...d6 and 1 .. .g6, nor was 1.. .d5 approved of by the lead ing masters. In fact, the latter has only been convincingly revived in the last ten years. As an alternative to l ...e5, the solid Caro Kann ( l...c6) gained popularity after 1 900, pri marily as an equalizing weapon. In the same 'equality-first' vein, French Defence players employed the unambitious move ... dxe4 (e.g., 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lllc3 dxe4), and the French De fence generally lacked the dynamic character that it later acquired. (To this day, in fact, ... dxe4 systems are chosen by leading grandmasters, often as a way to simplify the play and equal ize). When players did essay upon 1 d4 instead of 1 e4, l ...d5 was the overwhelming response by Black, with the various 'Indian' defences (beginning with I...lt:lf6) held in low esteem. Looking back, we can see that the legitimate desire to establish a pawn presence in the centre greatly influenced the choice of and attitudes towards opening play. The Sicilian Defence ( 1 e4 c5) neglects to move a centre pawn (see the next paragraph), whereas defences to 1 e4 such as 1...lllf6, l ...d6 and 1...g6 all concede the ideal or at least favourable centre to White. So do several of today's dynamic and/or unbalanc ing replies to 1 d4. For instance, the King's In dian Defence allows White to occupy the centre directly in the main lines after 1 d4 lt:lf6 2 c4 g6 3 lllc3 .i.g7 4 e4 d6 (D). Compare the related discussion at the begin ning of Chapter 3. The Sicilian Defence ( 1 e4 c5), which ac counts for nearly 20% ( !) of all top-level grand master games played today, was at first a more ambiguous case, with a curious evolution. Al though one sees only a handful of modern-style treatments in top-level games throughout the latter half of the 1 9th century and into the 20th, the Sicilian Defence grew to be played in a re spectable 5% of such encounters. At first it was White who failed to play aggressively in the centre, typically choosing the Closed Sicilian (2 lllc3) or 2 f4. As players then turned to the Open Sicilian with 2 lllf3 and 3 d4, Black tended to play active, developing moves, until the Scheveningen V aria ti on with its backward central structure ( ... e6 and ... d6) was brought to general attention in the 1920s by prominent players such as Euwe. Soon, various new inter pretations of the Open Sicilian became estab lished as main lines. But the extent to which Black could disrespect the basics of develop ment and space in favour of other factors be came apparent only much later. During the 1 940s and 1 950s new interpretations of the Si cilian Defence ushered in a modern age of dy namism; players and theoreticians developed the fundamental structures and piece-play that are used today by nearly every major player. Dynamic variations of traditional openings also gained popularity; e.g., the Winawer Variation in the French Defence and the Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez. The Alekhine Defence and Pirc Defence had accumulated masses of the ory and stalwart grandmaster adherents by the time Fischer used both openings in his 1 972 World Championship match versus Spassky; today these openings are played less than oth ers in high-level chess but certainly retain their legitimacy. After that lengthy digression, no one will be surprised to find that either of Black's ap proaches to the opening is valid, that is, he can play for equality or aspire to achieve a dynamic

OPENING IDEAS AND POSITIONAL FEATURES 25

imbalance. Some players just starting out, how ever, may not have heard about the latter op tion. White's Goals in the Opening White has choices similar to Black's, assuming that he has the same opportunities. White can work patiently to hold on to his inherent ad vantage, usually by suppressing his opponent's counterplay and 'accumulating small advan tages'. Or White can seek dynamic situations in which he tries to take the initiative and keep Black on his heels. Finally, White can plunge into two-sided slugfests and hope to express his theoretical advantage or superior skills in that environment. Once again all of these methods are admissible. But for White there is a differ ent twist. Curiously, it is sometimes easier for Black to launch an effective attack and to define the quality of early play than it is for White to do the same. Black has the advantage of know ing his opponent's moves ahead of time. If he chooses to play a solid game it may be impossi ble for White to attack aggressively. Of course the reverse is also true: White can play 1 d4, 2 'Llf3 and 3 .i.f4 against most openings, or, for example, 1 'Llf3, 2 g3, 3 .i.g2, 4 d3 and 5 O-O against practically anything. But most players aren't interested in giving away the advantage of the first move with such conservative moves and so will choose to play more ambitiously. Paradoxically, this can let Black set the pace in certain openings. Central Types Several very important central formations will be explored in detail in the next chapter. Among them will be centres characterized by: a) isolated pawns; b) majorities and minorities; c) restrained central pawns; and d) pawn-chains. Most other types of centre that have practical significance will be represented somewhere in the main body of the book. It's useful to look at some of those central formations to get a feel for how they can be analysed and assessed. Be aware that the material in this chapter will be gin at an elementary level but quickly move into complex areas that are not essential for the inexperienced player to master.

This is a well-known version of the Exchange Variation of the King's Indian Defence where a series of early exchanges has decimated the centre. According to theory, Black stands slightly better. White has weaknesses on d3 and d4 that can be occupied by Black's minor pieces, whereas White can't find good squares other than f6 to exploit in Black's position. If White waits around, Black will occupy the d4- square by ... lbc6-d4, so White should move quickly and play 1 1 j,_g5 j,_xb2 12 j,_xd8! j,_xal 13 j,_xc7 lbc6 14 O-O j,_g7, when Black has only a small positional advantage.

The centre pawns have been swept away but static factors are still controlling the play. Black has the weaker pawn-structure but he also has the bishop-pair. White has a mobile majority on the kingside, which can theoreti cally be used to create a passed pawn. But that's far down the road and in the middlegame, espe cially with the vanished centre, one would ex pect that Black's two bishops would be more effective than the bishop and knight. The prob lem is that White controls more space and Black has no centre pawn with which to drive White's pieces away. The position is about equal. The vanished centre shows up in old gambit lines which were popular 1 00 or more years ago. Some of these lines have never been per manently stowed away. A case in point:

The centre has been cleared out and there's no way to make a simple assessment. Only a lot of brainpower, computer analysis and corre spondence chess can solve this sort of thing; in fact, only those things got chess researchers this far! Which brings me to another point: my aim in this book is to have you understand strat egy, including typical methods for both sides to handle attacking positions. It's often possible to indicate recurrent themes and some connec tions among them. However, I shall rarely ana lyse chaotic positions like this one featuring moment-to-moment variations in tactical events. The correct moves are so unpredictable that they really can't be 'explained' except on a case-by-case basis. You may be able to find out

OPENING IDEAS AND POSITIONAL FEATURES 2 7

more about them in books that make specific detailed investigations; better yet, you can try to work them out for yourself ! 2 . We have already seen and discussed cases of the 'ideal centre' (also known as the 'classi cal centre'), in which one side has pawns on e4 and d4 (or e5 and d5). Normally the ideal centre constitutes an advantage, but that's only true if it has some positive effect on the position; for example, tying down the opponent's pieces, ad vancing with tempo, creating a passed pawn, and/or serving as the pivot point from which pieces can launch an attack. Otherwise the op ponent might be able to attack the centre pawns from afar with little risk. In a typical situation Black restrains White's ideal centre but can't break it down. This imbalance arises in certain variations of the Queen's Gambit Accepted, Slav, Grlinfeld, and this main line of the Semi Tarrasch:

[diagram]

3. The formation arising from what is called

the 'surrender of the centre' appears in many different openings. It involves a single white central pawn on e4 or d4 facing a lone black pawn on d6 or e6, respectively. Generally, White has somewhat the better game by virtue of his greater control of space, but Black has a compact structure and an open file aiming at White's 4th-rank pawn, so the advantage can range from tiny to moderately significant. Here's an illustration taken from the 'classi cal' Philidor's Defence:

White has a pleasant advantage because he controls more space and has freer development. A surrender of the centre occurs in the old main line of the Caro-Kann Defence:

the d4-based centre with the move ... c5. White has the easier game, but against accurate play he will retain little if any advantage. This type of 'restraint centre' will be discussed at some length in Chapter 3. Flank versus Centre It's always hard to assess whether a flank pawn advance in the opening is strong or weak. It's often said that a centre has to be safe in order to justify a pawn advance. That is true in many sit uations; e.g.:

1 e4 cS 2 ll'Bf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ll'Bxd4 ll'Bf6 S

Black will have serious weaknesses after 14 ... O-O 15 dxe6 fxe6 16 .i.d3. In these examples, the flank de fends the centre. As long as you're aware that each situation has to be assessed on its own merits, you should always consider responding to a flank attack with a central counterattack, and vice-versa. But neither response should be made into a rule. Weaknesses The word 'weakness' refers to problems with pawns and pawn-structures. Some terms relat ing to pawns still need to be defined, which we'll do presently. First, however, I want to make a broader comment. Pawn weaknesses are to be avoided at any stage of the game if you get nothing in return for them, and understand ing pawn-structures (a subject much wider than

OPENING IDEAS AND POSITIONAL FEATURES 29

pawn weaknesses) is more important than any other factor in understanding chess. But that in sight should not be confused with a general phobia towards weaknesses. Generally they are not as important in the opening as they are later in the game. Tarrasch' s dictum 'Before the endgame the gods have placed the middlegame' is part of the explanation, yet it is not the whole story here. As the middlegame progresses and considerable simplification has occurred (or is imminent), a player must be particularly con cerned with current weaknesses, and eventu ally with what an endgame might bring if that pawn-structure persists. Sometimes this calls for radical action. But in the opening stage (partic ularly within the first 10 moves or so) structural weaknesses are generally more of an immedi ate defensive problem than one which must be attended to for the sake of the ending. They can be incorporated into an overall approach to a position that works extremely well; e.g., a terri bly weak pawn may temporarily provide pro tection from the opponent's play and allow you to gain the advantage. That holds true because of the ever-changing nature of most openings and middlegames. Especially players who are beginning to gain experience with chess should not overestimate the drawbacks of weaknesses such as doubled, isolated or backward pawns and thus ignore good opportunities for attack or other positive activity. I find that students gen erally err on the side of caution in this respect, when they could aggressively pursue the initia tive. So yes, try to avoid unnecessary weak nesses and take advantage of those in your opponent' s position, but don't make decisions that are too focused on just this one aspect of the game. Y our pawn-structure may be telling you other important things about how to handle the position as a whole. There follow some definitions and short ex planations of pawn types and properties. In Chapter 3 we investigate and evaluate these in much greater detail.

1. An isolated pawn is one that has no

pawns of its own colour (i.e. friendly pawns) on any adjacent file. In practice, we are especially concerned with such a pawn when it's on an open file. In Chapter 3 you will find a lengthy discussion and many examples of isolated pawns. In some very typical situations, their advantages are famously in balance with their disadvantages, which is why so many players rush to take them on and others to play against them. White has three isolated pawns, on a4, c3 and e3. Black has one isolated pawn on b7. The pawns on a4, c3 and b7 are on open files and thus relatively more exposed than the pawn on e3, which is masked by an opposing pawn on the same file.

2. A backward pawn is one that has at least

one pawn of its own colour on an adjacent file, but that neighbouring pawn is situated one rank or further ahead of its compatriot. In this well-known position from the Sicilian Defence, Black's d6-pawn is a backward pawn. Often the square in front of the backward pawn serves as an outpost for the opponent, as it does

30 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

here (see Chapter 1 for a description of the out post). We care most about backward pawns on open file, as is Black's on d6. Backward pawns are usually weak, but not always so.

3. A doubled pawn is one that resides on

the same file as another of your pawns. As usual, doubled pawns on an open file are weaker than those that are masked by enemy pawns. Doubled pawns can be weak or strong, but most of the time isolated doubled pawns on an open file are a serious disadvantage, both because they are hard to defend and be cause there is a wonderful outpost in front of the pawns, just asking for an opposing piece to occupy it. Here is a well-known situation in which a knight is stationed in front of doubled f-pawns.

4. Pawns that block the path of pieces are

always a problem, and the most famous of such problems involve 'good' and 'bad' bishops. I'll be using those terms throughout the analysis section, so I should attempt a definition. A 'bad' bishop is one whose central pawns are on the same-coloured squares as the bishop; con versely a 'good' bishop lives on the squares that are of the colour opposite to its central pawns. Notice the emphasis on central pawns. By far the most important pawns in determining the 'goodness' or 'badness' of a bishop are the d and e- pawns. Adjacent c- and f-pawns can be factored in if they seem relevant to the bishop's overall mobility, but these pawns must be given considerably less weight. Let's look at this situ ation in the abstract: Assessing Black's bishops is the easiest task. Black's pawns on e6 and d5 are on light squares, so his bishop on d7 is 'bad' and the one on e7 is 'good'. It happens that all of Black's other pawns are on light squares as well, but except for the c- and f-pawns, which are of limited im portance, they aren't factors in the way we as sess whether a bishop is good or bad. White's light-squared bishop may look use less because it is blocked by pawns on f3, h3 and g3, while even those pawns on c2, c3 and a4 might provide obstacles. But it is a 'good' bishop because White's centre pawns are on dark squares. By contrast, the a5-bishop has two nice open diagonals and can even reach the wonderful outpost on e5. Nevertheless, it is a 'bad' bishop because it is on the same colour as the central pawns. The point is that a 'good' bishop can be a poor or even dysfunctional piece whereas a 'bad' bishop may be the best piece on the board. However, those situations are exceptional. In a considerable majority of cases a 'good' bishop really is the one that serves you the best (and that you don't want to exchange!), while a 'bad' bishop tends to be ob structed and passive. This generalization goes back to the extraordinary importance of the centre. Bad bishops can serve as decent defenders but they can be particularly unhelpful when op posed by a good knight (see following dia gram):

a sequence such as 11 tbd3 f5 12 tbxc5 tbxc5, White shouldn't play 13 exf5? !. He might do this for the sake of avoiding Black's dangerous attack that follows from 13 f3 f4. But 13 exf5? ! i..xf5 14 'iVdl runs up against 14 ...e4!, when the g7-bishop has gone from a passive onlooker to a major force. In this and similar positions, the dark-squared bishop serves as a prophylac tic measure versus White's exf5, which might otherwise hamper Black's plans. I should add that in some cases where Black replies to exf5 with ... gxf5, that will also allow him to play a favourable ...e4 and free his bad bishop. What's the lesson? That a bad bishop can discourage moves that would otherwise hurt his cause. It doesn't take a fianchettoed bishop to fill that role, of course. In the Closed Ruy Lopez when White constructs a pawn-structure with e4 and d5 and places his bishop on c2, one might say that White's bad bishop on c2 has a natural prophylactic effect against the move .. .f5, because then exf5 brings the bishop into a kingside attack. If Black has a pawn on c7 (with the same piece placement), then the move ... c6 can be answered by dxc6 and i.. b3, taking over the open a2-g8 diagonal. For these ideas see, for example, the Breyer Defence or Zaitsev Variation in the Ruy Lopez (Chapter 8). Colour Complexes In a great number of openings, one player or both will concentrate his forces either largely or exclusively on squares of one colour or the other. This is particularly logical in Black's case because he doesn't have time to keep up with White on both colour squares. One case in point is the Nimzo-Indian Defence, in which the first three moves all control light squares (1 d4 tbf6 2 c4 e6 3 tbc3 i..b4), and several main lines continue with ... b6, ... i..b7 and ... tbe4 (strictly speaking this last move aims at dark squares, although it 'plays on' light squares and prepares another light-square move, ...f5). In doubled-pawn variations such as 4 a3 i..xc3+ 5 bxc3, we might see Black play ... b6, ... i..a6, ... tbc6-a5 and ... d5, which is truly playing on a colour complex. The following game combines complementary themes of backward pawns, outposts, and playing on a colour complex. Taimanov - Karpov Moscow teams 1973

would put a very bad bishop on c3 whose po tential to be freed by the move d5 is almost non-existent, especially after Black places a knight on the truly powerful outpost on d5. The c3-pawn can be either weak or strong, the latter depending upon two possibilities: a) the c3-pawn does such a good job of sup porting d4 that it allows White the time to orga nize a kingside or central attack; b) the pawn can advance to c4. Taimanov wants to pursue the latter idea, counting upon the superiority of his bishop over Black's d7-knight (which incidentally doesn't have many prospects right now be cause it is restricted by White's d4-pawn). A favourable change of structure might come about, for instance, if White can play c4 fol lowed by .llb4. The problem is that Black strikes first.

Light-square domination! This is a particu larly good illustration of favourable play on a colour complex. The opening stage is over and Karpov has more than enough positional compensation for a pawn. The rest of the game is very accurately played until the last moves before the time control and demonstrates the strength of the blockade and associated outpost:

'iif4+ 41 @h l exd5 42 'ii e3 'iif5. This game is typical in that the structure re sulting from the opening is indicative of whether players will be concentrating upon a certain colour throughout the game. There are quite a few other openings with a lasting orientation towards playing on one col our. Consider the main lines of the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian: Black's central pawns are situated to control dark squares, and his most active pieces control dark squares: the all important g7-bishop, the c6-knight, his queen on a5 or c7 (more often than not), and even the c8-rook has its greedy eye on c3. Black's f6- knight has a tendency to go to d7 and augment control of the dark squares e5 and c5. Only the queen's bishop doesn't participate, but it has in herent difficulties in that respect. White nor mally castles queenside, when Black's most devastating attacks seem to land on the squares c3 and b2. Nevertheless, when I speak of a position in which 'Black dominates the dark squares', there's usually a persistence of structural weak ness that I'm referring to. For instance: Domination of a colour complex doesn't nec essarily mean a winning position but it probably constitutes a serious advantage, often compen sation or more for the exchange, which was sac rificed in this example by capturing a knight on f3. White still has his dark-squared bishop, but he has lost the dark squares anyway. Internal Weaknesses An important situation arises when one or both sides have 'internal weaknesses'. This means that they have unoccupied squares on their third or fourth ranks that cannot be de fended by other pawns. Often these weak nesses are somewhat masked by a pawn-front, but they can also be exposed when a pawn front disappears or breaks down. Generally, I'll refer to internal weaknesses in the centre of the board, i.e. White's squares e4, d4, e3 and d3, or Black's on e5, d5, e6 and d6. Weak nesses on the flank squares are normally of less note, but those created by a pawn advance in front of one's king are a huge exception; for instance, an attack by f4-f5, g4-g5 and h4 can create critical weaknesses on f4, g4, h4, f3, g3 and h3. Players tend to be very careful about exposing their kings in such a fashion. In my experience, less advanced players fail to rec ognize this type of weakness, especially if the squares in question are not immediately at tacked or occupied.

OPENING IDEAS AND POSITIONAL FEATURES 35

A typical example of a complex of internal weaknesses arises with an advanced centre. In the last chapter we saw a King's Indian Four Pawns Attack in which the front of the centre collapsed and the internal weaknesses were ex posed. It's worth taking the time to look back at that example, especially the final diagram. The weaknesses remain regardless of whether the pawns that mask them disappear.

Of course these are just a few examples, and many other main-line pawn-structures support fast piece development. In these variations the pieces and pawns seem to be in mutual support and one might easily conclude that this is the ideal situation. But the distinction between a philosophy of 'pawns-before-pieces' and one assigning equal priority to both has become increasingly more subtle and context-dependent as time has gone by. I already mentioned in Chapter 2 that when the Open variations of the Sicilian were estab lishing themselves in the first part of the 20th century, there was a tendency on Black's part to get his pieces out reasonably quickly. For in stance, you would see 1 e4 c5 2 lLif3 lLic6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lLixd4 lLif6 5 l2Jc3 e6 and ... .i.b4 and/or the freeing move ... d5 with rapid development.

In that case four of Black's pieces are devel oped within the first eight moves. We then often see Black make several more piece moves before touching another pawn (e.g., ... l2Jxd4, ... .\le6, .. .l:Ic8); this policy is clearly indicated by the ini tial pawn-structure. In contemporary play, how ever, we regularly see variations of the Sicilian Defence in which the establishment of pawn structure swamps rapid development, not least of which is the most popular Sicilian system of them all, the Najdorf Variation: 1 e4 c5 2 lLif3 d6

available for action. Nevertheless, the majority of attacks will be informed by describable cate gories of positions. Thus the precedence of pawn-structure, and the motivation for this chapter. It is generally agreed now that pattern recognition and the ability to process patterns in context is the foremost determinant in chess strength (put ting aside competitive factors). The number of patterns one can recognize and associate with other structures correlates to how well one un derstands and plays the game. Grandmasters store and process many more pawn-structures with accompanying piece placements than the average player does, if only because of their repeated exposure to them in preparation and over the board. With study alone it's possible for one to master a great number of standard opening positions in the same way, and to un derstand their interaction with the subsequent play. Appreciation of why a strategy works in one position but not in a similar position is an indispensable part of chess mastery. Further more, if you recognize ideas and manoeuvres from other openings that apply to the one that you are playing, it will help you to focus on the issues and inspire you to make better deci sions. How might we improve our knowledge of pawn-structures? Obviously it's not possible to list them all and memorize their unique fea tures. But there are formations and related is sues that repeat themselves from opening to opening, very often constituting the basis for the fundamental strategy of each. In this chap ter I'll examine some pawn-structures and the issues associated with them, choosing selected areas most likely to impact one's understand ing of the game, or at least to grasp the com mon elements of the opening. These are not strange or irregular formations; one idea is to show how one might use the same approach to study other, more complex, structures. Hope fully their usefulness will extend to players of a wide range of skills. This is not a middle game book, however, and my main goal has been to make the discussion in the forthcom ing openings section more readily comprehen sible. When presenting individual variations and games, I'll often assume your familiarity with this chapter. Isolated Pawns We saw some broad characterizations of posi tional features in the last chapter. Now I want to look at the structural elements across the board that bear upon the opening stage. We'll begin with the fairly straightforward case of the iso lated pawn, also called the 'isolani', which we defined in the Chapter 2. Textbooks almost al ways concentrate upon the isolated d-pawn, also called the 'isolated queen's pawn' (abbre viated as 'IQP'). Most authors do so to the ex clusion of isolated pawns anywhere else on the board, writing chapters and even whole books on this specific case. Granted, it's very impor tant to give the IQP its due because it can arise from so many openings, and so early in the game. Why is that? To generate an IQP in the opening, it's generally necessary to have the moves d4 and ... d5 appear early on, and it's ex tremely likely that one or both of the moves c4 or ... c5 were also played in the first stage of the opening. To show this, let's take a list of several openings that lead to the same, well-known type of isolated queen's pawn position, and sometimes to the very same position: Queen's Gambit Accepted: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 CLJf3 CLJf6 4 e3 e6 5 .llxc4 c5 6 O-O cxd4 7 exd4 .ll e7 8 CLJc3 O-O 9 .l:!.el .

This is the basic picture (see diagram over leaf): The most significant difference among these openings is the position of White's light-squared bishop (it's on c4 or d3). Sometimes the queen is already placed upon c2 or e2, and the king's

40 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

rook is usually but not always moved to e l . The basic position and its variants have been played thousands of times and investigated in depth. In fact, more words have been written about the IQP than about any other specific positional feature in chess. Neither side can be said to stand inherently better, which is why both sides are willing to enter into these positions. With out going into detail, here are the basic struc tural properties and strategies that should be stressed. For ease of discussion, let's assume that White is the possessor of the IQP before we attend to specific examples. Disadvantages of the isolated d-pawn:

1. The IQP is a relatively easier target than

most pawns because it can only be protected by pieces, several of which may be required for the task (as opposed to needing only a sin gle pawn). Also, the d-pawn is almost always on an open file potentially facing Black's rooks and/or queen.

2. Defence of the isolated d-pawn can tie

down White's pieces which might be used more effectively elsewhere.

3. Black gains an influential outpost in front

of the isolani, which means that it is very diffi cult to drive his pieces off that spot.

4. The IQP tends to be a more serious weak

ness in simplified positions, the more so in an endgame. Notice that the mutual possession of the open c-file increases the chances of simpli fication. Nevertheless, Black must be skilful to make the right kind of simplification that doesn't come with other disadvantages. Often a new equilibrium will result from exchanges. Advantages of the isolated d-pawn:

1. White will be able to develop more easily

and aggressively, having more space and open lines for his bishops.

2. The IQP creates a support-point for a

knight (or other piece) on e5.

3. The threat of the d-pawn's advance ties

Black's pieces to the defence of d5.

4. Black, with less space, will have difficulty

developing actively without making some con cession such as creating a weakness or ceding the bishop-pair.

5. White has good kingside attacking chances

based upon the support-point on e5, the e-file, and his bishops aimed in that direction. In terms of strategy, White will have several ways of proceeding. He will usually complete his development by putting his queen on e2 or d3 (less frequently c2 or b3) and queen's rook on d l . Then one of the first goals is to provoke a weakness on the kingside. To do this, he can play lbe5 and swing a rook to the kingside via e3. Or he can line up his bishop and queen to create a threat on h7. Black will generally de fend by keeping a knight on f6 and playing ...g6 if necessary. With that set-up White can attack the dark squares by i..h6, work to soften up the kingside by h4-h5 and/or play for d5, often by bringing his bishop back to the a2-g8 diagonal. The safe advance of the d-pawn to d5 beto kens success in most cases because it opens lines or broadens potential uses for almost all of his pieces (notably, the rooks on d l and e l , bishop on a2 and knight on c3) and breaks down the defender at e6; it also liquidates the isolani itself. After d5 White usually has the far superior pieces, and he often has tactical re sources that win material. The d5 break is prob ably the most frequently successful plan. There are also set-ups with the moves l:.el -e3-g3; or, more commonly, lbe5, ..llc4 and J:.el , intending tactics such as lbxf7, particularly if Black's rook is on e8. These ideas and others only work because White's superiority in space permits him to transfer his pieces rapidly, make threats, and take Black out of his game plan. The more pieces with which to attack, the better. Black's strategy is not excessively compli cated, although implementing it may be. His

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRUCTURE 41

first goal is to maintain the blockade on d5, usu ally with a knight. Simply leaving a knight there is often not enough, however, because White may be able to capture the piece at a point where ... exd5 is forced, eliminating the threat to d4 and sometimes transforming the pawn structure in White' s favour. Thus, whether oc cupied or not, d5 itself needs to be reinforced. Often Black's knights will go to f6 and d5 (via ... tt::l b4-d5) or to d5 and e7. His c8-bishop will be developed to b7, either by ... b6 or by ... a6 and ... b5. A rook on d8 can also act to support a piece on d5 or restrain White' s pawn advance to d5. One of Black's goals is simplification: the more pieces that are exchanged the less likely it is that White can break through. More over, the closer that Black can get to an endgame the better his prospects usually are. Exchanging White's minor pieces is a high priority, because they can have considerable range from squares around the isolated pawn. Knights in particu lar are dangerous when posted on e4, e5 and c5; and even seemingly 'defensive' knights on c3 and f3 can quickly come into action. Ex changing White' s light-squared bishop is a real coup for Black; whether on c4, d3, a2 or c2, it is the piece most likely to be involved in a direct attack. By contrast, a rook on d l defending the isolani is much less likely to do any damage. For all that, simplification can be double edged because sometimes it clarifies White's attacking themes, especially if he has support points along open files in conjunction with pawn advances. A wonderful illustration of this is seen in Chapter 5 on the Giuoco Piano (in the main line with 1 0. .. tt::l ce7). All that is rather abstract, so here are some examples of strategy by both sides. There are literally thousands of isolated-pawn positions in games between masters, many of which can be found in books on the opening or middle game. As indicated, these positions will be taken from openings in which an IQP situation is nor mally created (for instance, in the same open ings listed above). What you will eventually find is that isolated pawns are formed in a wide range of positions, many of them appearing af ter the opening stage because of an exchange on d4 or d5. Here is a brief lesson about the main danger posed by the d-pawn: its advance. Spassky - Avtonomov Leningrad 1949

reverse approach, exchanging rooks (if any thing has to be exchanged) and keeping minor pieces on the board. That's getting into the realm of middlegame theory, however. At any rate, activity is at a premium: rooks on open files, bishops attacking weak points, etc. And of course if you can safely get ...d4 in, your odds of a happy conclusion increase. Isolated e-Pawns The IQP isn't the only isolated pawn of interest in chess openings. First, we might ask why we don't see more isolated e-pawns in the opening. That's fairly easy: at some point an f-pawn would have to advance and that's not part of most openings, especially since there would have to be another central capture at some point. However, in the Sicilian Defence we do see a situation that is rare in other openings, i.e. the pawn-structure often leads to isolated e- and d pawns on adjacent files. There are a great num ber of lines like 1 e4 c5 2 tllf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ctJxd4 ctJf6 5 tllc3 a6 6 i.e2 e5 7 ctJb3 i.e7 8 O-O O-O 9 @h1 ctJbd7 1 0 i.e3 "V/i/c7 1 1 f4 exf4 1 2 i.xf4 (D) involving the routine moves . . .e5, f4 and ...exf4.

Sometimes Black has his pawn on e6 and the advance f4-f5 can lead to the same struc ture, that is, if White responds to . . .exf5 by capturing with a piece (usually a knight, i.e. tllxf5), or Black does the same after White's fxe6 (for instance, by ... i.xe6). The character istics of those positions are fairly consistent and will be discussed in Chapter 1 I on the Si cilian Defence. Isolated c-Pawns Isolated c-pawns are very common and we shall see them frequently throughout this book. They may arise a little later in the game than in the standard isolated d-pawn openings, partly because they can easily stem from them. The Sicilian Defence offers some examples: Sicilian Defence, Alapin Variation: I e4 c5 2 c3 ctJf6 3 e5 ctJd5 4 d4 cxd4 5 cxd4 d6 6 ctJf3 tll c6 7 i.c4 ctJb6 8 i.b5 dxe5 9 tllxe5 i.d7 1 0 i.xc6 i.xc6 1 I tllxc6 bxc6 (D).

another pawn-chain, i.e. interlocking. The text book example is the French Defence Advance Variation, 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 c5 4 ctJf3 tllc6 5 c3. The line of pawns from b2 to e5 is called a 'chain' , and the directly interlocking pawns are on e6 and d5, but of course Black' s pawn on f7 holds up the ones on e6 and d5. Most books on strategy discuss this French Advance Variation when they want an example of pawn-chains, and also the main lines of the King' s Indian De fence. Those are excellent starting-points. We don't always think in terms of pawn-chains even if they share classical properties, for in stance, in the Slav with 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 ctJf3 ctJf6 4 e3 a6 5 c5, in which White' s pawn-chain is lengthy indeed. But in fact ...e5 is the natural way to attack that chain, and of late we've even seen the arduous b4, a4 and b5 by White to at tack the base of Black's pawn-chain at c6 (this has occurred a bit more often in the line that goes 4 tllc3 a6 5 c5 followed by i.f4, but that' s another matter). Furthermore, much of what relates to those pawn-chains is relevant to a great number of other 'pawn strings' that aren't fully or di rectly opposed by other pawns. In accordance with some other sources, I'll call these pawn chains as well. For example, if you look at the Modem Benoni ( 1 d4 ctJf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 tllc3 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 e4, especially with 6 . . .g6 7 f3) you see short 'pawn duos' pointing in opposite directions. In several openings only partially overlapping chains emerge but have chain-like properties; for example, things like c3/d4/e5 versus f7 /e6 and e4/d5 versus c7/d6, and so forth. We see a truncated chain in some Ruy Lopez variations, when White plays d5, thus forming an opposition of e4/d5 ver sus c7 /d6/e5). Furthermore, pawn-chains with doubled pawns at their base will emerge from exchanges. Almost all of these can be looked at in the same terms as the traditional French and King's Indian chains; for example, in methods of attacking and defending them. Study of their common and contrasting ele ments will help you to master this part of the game. Let's start with the traditional examples and see what we can discover. We'll start out with the French Defence, probably the only opening in which the majority of its main variations have pawn-chains.

The logic behind this move for White is that it claims space on the kingside and cramps the de velopment of Black's pieces. After 3 e5, Black's king's knight cannot go to its 'best' square on f6, and Black's queen's bishop, which was al ready blocked by its pawn on e6, is further in carcerated by the inability of the e6-pawn to advance. As mentioned, a variation well-suited for a discussion of chains continues: 3 ...c5 4 c3 tllc6 5 tll f3 (D) The last two moves are natural in that 4 ... tll c6 develops and exerts influence upon d4 and e5, whereas 5 tllf3 defends those points. Note first that if White had played 5 dxc5 he would have broken the chain, which would have weakened the front of the pawn-structure at e5. That pawn would then be subject to a greater threat of capture, like an isolated pawn which can't be defended with other pawns. It also could be exchanged more easily due to insufficient re sources for maintaining it. A direct attack could come by the moves ... 'filc7 and ... tll ge7-g6. Or the offer to exchange could be pursued via the pawn move ...f6. This leads to the idea that if Black can break down the d4 point, sometimes called the 'base' of the pawn-chain, he can cripple or destroy the pawn-structure itself. To what end? By getting rid of the pawn on d4 and then winning or ex changing the one on e5, a natural place would appear on f6 for the knight currently doing nothing on g8, and the move ...e5 would be more feasible. With a little luck that advance

of attacking the base, Black will end up by at tacking the protected front of the chain. For ex ample, after White successfully protects his base by 8 b3 lllf5 9 i.b2, Black's next step is to attack the front of the pawn-chain by .. .f6. For instance, one line goes 9 ... i.b4+ 1 0 @fl i.e7 1 1 tllc3 O-O 12 g3 f6 ( D) and White will soon surrender the leading pawn by exf6. Or, in the same Advance Variation, the phe nomenon is illustrated in the variation 3 e5 c5 4 c3 tllc6 5 tllf3 i.d7 6 i.e2 tllge7 7 O-O tllg6 with the intention of .. .f6 next or soon thereaf ter; for example, 8 tlla3 i.e7 9 lll c2 (White is still concerned with protecting the base at d4) 9 ... O-O 1 0 .l:.el cxd4 1 1 cxd4 f6 (D). Now the front of the pawn-chain disappears because of the three-way attack: 1 1 exf6 i.xf6. This time Black ignored the base and came out fine. Other French pawn-chain variations are clearer in that respect; e.g.:

[diagram]
c5 6 c3 tllc6 7 tlle2 cxd4 8 cxd4 f6 The e5-pawn is attacked three times. 9 exf6 tllxf6 10 ctJf3 i.d6 1 1 O-O ( D) In this instance Black made only a half hearted attempt to attack the base of the pawn chain and then successfully attacked the front of it. So perhaps the procedure should be to attack the base and then the front? But then there's the following unadulterated example of attacking only the front of the chain:

f6 5 e5 llld7 6 i.d3 f6 (D) I should note that according to theory Black stands perfectly well in this position. Other openings attack chains in this manner; for ex ample, English Opening variations in which Black plays ...e4 and White eliminates the front pawn by f3. There are also Ruy Lopez varia tions in which d5 is met by ...c6 (e.g., the

This example illustrates how important it is, in a game with pawn-chains, to have at least one file open for a rook to work with in a direct way next to the pawn-chain. Other pieces alone usu ally can't completely break down the oppo nent's position. Since White's pawn-chain is so impervious to assault in the foregoing variation, Black can think about challenging the front of the pawn chain, even when it's protected to the hilt. As seen in the French Defence examples, there are benefits to that approach. 9 ... a5 (D) First Black defends against b4, in tum pre venting the key move c5.

14 cxd5 14 exd5 gives Black a type of kingside ma jority that we shall see more of as we proceed. ... f5 will follow shortly. Suffice it to say that in general that situation is favourable to Black. •• Jks 15 .Bb2 axb4 16 axb4 The pawn-chain has been neutralized, prov ing that Black needn't only play on the side of the board where he has the undermining moves. The same applies to White. Chess is not so one-dimensional that you aren't permitted to think about more than one theme, at least not in the opening where we have so many pieces on the board. What's the upshot of all this? Is the practical player left without any guidance whatsoever? Not at all, because the more positions you see and play, the more tools that you acquire. As in any other situation in chess, you have to make an assessment of which positions call for which treatment. For instance, notice that Black ad dressed the front pawn on the queenside and never attended to the e4 base. How realistic is that in general? Let's imagine a similar position of a type that does arise in the French Defence:

[diagram]
6 c3 tt:Jc6 7 lLldf3 .Be7 8 g3 'iVa5 9 Rf2 (D)

Here White has safeguarded his king (it can even go to g2 if necessary) and his pieces are about to spring out to aggressive positions; e.g., ..ild3, lLle2, with perhaps g4 and f5. How likely is that plan to succeed? The structure is analogous (d4/e5/f4 to c4/d5/e4), so Black's procedure would have to do with ...f6, perhaps preceded by ... h5, connected with ...g5. But the crucial difference is that this is the side of the board where Black' s king resides, so such a plan is unrealistic. A simple analysis (with a little bit of calculation) also tells you an attack on d4 won't get very far: not enough pieces and plenty of defenders. But if you're thinking in terms of pawn-chain experience, you'll see that Black should play to undermine White' s pawn-structure b y 9 •••b5! followed b y ...b4 and moves such as ... .l:Ib8, ...bxc3, ... .Ba6 and ... lLlb6-a4 in some intelligent order. This can be an effective idea as long as Black is alert to the defence of his king. With those ideas in mind, let's look at exam ples from the Caro-Kann Advance Variation.

Black would like to play for .. .f5 or ...b5, White for f4 or b4. In practice, White's breaks are more likely to succeed because of Black's lack of space or good squares for his pieces; e.g., he lacks c5 for his knights, or anywhere ac tive for his king's bishop (which is sometimes reduced to the exotic idea ...h6 and ... i.e7-g5). In particular Black has trouble enforcing .. .f5 if White sets up a structure involving ..ild3, ltJf3 and h3. Notice that the same pawn-structure in the King's Indian Main Line is more bearable for Black because with his bishop better-placed, he can get counterplay with .. .f5 before White squelches it.

lowed by Black's recapture of the pawn over the next moves, White is very seldom able to en force an attack at the effective base of Black's pawn-chain at d6, and can only dream of achieving a successful b4 (it does happen, but only rarely). Black on the other hand has al ready eliminated the base of White's pawn chain on c4, and the move ...e6, cracking up the front pawn at d5, characterizes most Benko Gambit variations at one point or another.

Doubled Pawns and Related Pawn Captures Understanding of doubled pawns is essential to playing openings and eventually mastering them. As above, I'll approach this subject with some standard examples and then try to intro duce some more complicated ideas for you to chew over. Other structures will be discussed in conjunction with individual openings. Doubled pawns are a recurring motif in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. After 1 d4 CL:lf6 2 c4 e6

3 CL:lc3 ..llb4, capturing the c3-knight produces

doubled pawns, whose structure is such that the forward c-pawn is particularly vulnerable. Without getting into the jargon, you can see that a structure with pawns on c4, c3 and d3 is more secure than one with pawns on c4, c3 and d4. In the former case each pawn can be protected by another, whereas in the latter the c4-pawn is un supported. Here's a game with several thematic ideas in a typical Nimzo-Indian: Geller - Smyslov USSR Ch (Moscow) 1949

[diagram]
bxc3 White now has doubled pawns on c3 and c4. The forward pawn is the target; note that if White's d-pawn were on d3, his doubled pawns would be protected. 5 ••. CL:lc6 6 f3 Having secured the advantage of the two bishops in compensation for his doubled pawns at c3 and c4, White wants to build a large centre and use his extra space to help in a kingside at tack. The kingside is a particularly good target because Black's dark-squared bishop has been exchanged and can't guard vulnerable squares around the king. 6 .•. b6 7 e4 ..lla6 Black is taking aim at White's weak c4- pawn.

Capturing the c4-pawn di rectly is one theme; what happens in the game is related. 12 ..td3 O-O 13 e5 .l:Ie8 14 O-O tt:Jf8!? 15 tt:Jf4!? White should always maximize his kingside play in such positions and not worry much about a pawn or two on the queenside. Thus 1 5 f4 ! d5 16 f5 was called for, attacking the pawn chain. Notice that White's attack benefits greatly from the lack of Black's dark-squared bishop, which was exchanged off on the fourth move. 15 •.• d5!

variation is generally another good illustration of how Black can play on the queenside in King's Indian Defence. 13 ..ll e3 \\!Vc7!? 14 ..llxc5!? The exchange on c5 to get doubled pawns can occur in many, many distinct positions of the King's Indian. White has to decide whether to give up his best bishop in order to cripple Black's pawn-structure. He usually declines the bargain. Here, however, he's a little ahead in time and goes for it. .•.dxcS 15 dxc6 bxc6 ( D) The first point is that 1 5. .. \\!Vxc6 would give White a huge and favourable outpost on d5, one that might be reinforced by CLJd2-fl-e3. What are the main characteristics of the po sition? Black's doubled pawns are isolated, and what's more he has an isolated pawn on a5. We've already mentioned, however, that iso lated a-pawns are usually not serious weak nesses until the endgame. What is typical about the doubled c-pawns is that they control very important central squares, both the black out post on d4 and most importantly White's d5, which is protected from intrusions. On the other hand, Black' s dark-squared bishop has very lit tle scope, so the advantage of two bishops is not yet a factor, and he has no pawn-breaks other than ...f5, which White can keep under control.

16 CL:la4

The forward doubled pawn is usually the more vulnerable one. Here White has no pros pects of attacking it along an open file because of his own c4-pawn, but he can focus pieces on it in order to tie Black's pieces to its defence. When a player's doubled pawn can be pro tected by adjacent pawns then his pieces need not be diverted to defend it. That's why iso lated doubled pawns are so much worse than connected ones, assuming that other factors aren't at work. 16 .•. ..trs 17 \\!Vb3 CL:lhs 18 \\!Ve3 \\!Va7 Black's pieces are passive and now White could try to transfer his f3-knight to b3, but if necessary Black can bring his knight to e6 or d7.

Specifically, doubled c-pawns arise more often than any other type and they deter mine the nature of the play in many of those games. For the sake of clarity I'll concentrate on them, with a brief look first at a particular central situation. Doubled Centre Pawns Doubled centre pawns arise much less often in the opening than doubled c-pawns. They are generally produced by exchanges of minor pieces on the third or fourth rank, and usually don't allow of the choice of recaptures that we saw above. Their effects on the position tend to be ambiguous. This is a position from Chapter 6 on the Two Knights Defence; similar situations can arise from a number of 1 e4 e5 openings. White plays ..ll e3 to challenge the enemy bishop on c5 (like wise with colours reversed, of course). Cap turing that bishop on e3 will help White to gain central control (in particular of d4, which was a potential support-point for Black's knight), and he will have the open f-file to work with. But the resulting centre e3/e4/d3 is generally not

60 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

mobile. What does that mean? After the ex change on e3, White' s pawns are initially well protected; it's usually difficult to get at the single weakness at e3. However, if White plays d4 thereafter, the forward e-pawn will be unpro tected by another pawn and therefore vulnera ble, just as the c4-pawn was in the Nimzo-Indian example above. And if the d-pawn advances fur ther to d5, the e-pawn may not be able to move for the rest of the game. Both sides have to weigh whether one advantage or the other is more important. If Black isn't going to exchange on e3, one of his options is to leave the bishop where it is on c5. Normally the doubled pawns that Black would get if White played ..ll xc5 wouldn't be harmful (see the discussion of c pawns below); but that's not always true.

Again the choice arises of whether White should: a) exchange bishops on d6, allowing ... cxd6 if Black wants to; b) leave his bishop on f4, inviting ...i.xf4; or c) retreat to g3. In master play all three solutions are played. This position is simplified but shows the basic situation that arises in many variations. Isolated doubled e- and d-pawns are rare when the queens are off the board; neverthe less, an opening line such as 1 e4 d6 2 d4 CLJf6

[diagram]
..lle6 ! ? 7 ..llxe6 fxe6 shows that it' s possible to adopt such pawns in that situation. The result ing position is one that current theory indi cates is equal. See Chapter 7 on the Philidor Defence, in particular the discussion of early move-orders. It bears repeating that the exchange of queens by no means betokens entrance into an end game, because there can be many active pieces remaining on the board producing astonish ingly complex positions. The phrase 'queenless middlegame' doesn't appear often enough in chess discussion, written or otherwise. It de scribes an extremely large set of situations, often lasting for the bulk of the game. The conditions for a decisive result are still there, as shown by literally thousands of games. But for our pur poses it's important to note that a lot of queen exchanges such as the one above result in queenless openings! Although the boundaries of the queenless opening, middlegame and end ing are to some extent a matter of judgement, variations in which the queens have been ex changed within the first 10 moves are routinely analysed by players and theoreticians for an other 10 moves, and clearly belong to the terri tory of the opening proper. Finally, we run across 5th-rank doubled pawns in just a few openings; for example, 1 c4 c5 2 CLJc3 CLJc6 3 g3 g6 4 ..llg2 i.g7 5 d3 CLJf6 6 e4 O-O 7 CL:lge2 d6 8 O-O CLJd4 9 CLJxd4 cxd4 10 CLJe2 (D).

Keene referred to the doubled pawn on d4 as a 'dead point' , so called because it has little or no dynamic potential. It makes Black's central

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRUCTURE 61

play difficult because White will be ready to re spond to ... e6 and ... d5 by cxd5 and e5 ( espe cially if the move f4 has been played), whereas Black' s move ...e5 would restrict his own bishop and isn't very helpful with respect to mobility. The opponent (in this case White) can play 'around' the pawn by f4, intending f5 and g4, and/or by b4. This is a theme worth remember ing as it arises fairly frequently in openings such as the Closed Sicilian, King's Indian and English Opening. It tends to occur in the move sequence above, with a knight on d4 (from White' s point of view) being captured by a knight on e2 or f3. In many cases there would be a bishop on e3 in the above case, say, by 8 ... llld7 9 .Be3 lll d4 (D). In this instance White's knight can't capture on d4 because of the fork, and most players will avoid giving away their good bishop by .Bxd4, dead spot or not. So you will commonly see players wait until a bishop comes to e3 before occupying the outpost with their knight. It also frequently happens that when a bishop arrives at e3, White is just ready to play d4, so Black's knight jump has a double purpose. Obviously all of this is true with colours reversed as well. Naturally there are no absolutes and the dead-point structure isn't always bad, but one should be careful that there are compensating factors before adopting it. Doubled c-Pawns Now let's move on to doubled c-pawns, which are far more common than central ones. The most frequent exchange in the opening that leads to doubled pawns is when a knight on c3 or c6 is captured by a knight or bishop. Then a basic decision often presents itself: whether one wants to recapture with a b-pawn ( 'strength ening' the centre) or with the ct-pawn, opening lines for development. There are plenty of situ ations in which there is no choice; for instance,

[diagram]
bxc3 or 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lll c3 .Bb4 4 e5 c5 5 a3 .Bxc3+ 6 bxc3, both cases where the prece dence of structure is conspicuous. In neither case does either player have many pieces de veloped, but by their pawn moves both sides have established a structure that will serve and determine their development. In both of these cases the players were forced to capture 'towards the centre', the advice given to students everywhere. But it's more re vealing to look first at recaptures requiring a decision.

In making a decision how to recapture in the Rossolimo Variation, a major consideration is whether Black can achieve ...e5 after taking with the d-pawn. If so, White has no particular way to gain space, because now c3 followed by d4 merely opens the centre for Black's bishops. But if Black captures with the b-pawn he has to watch out that an early d4 doesn't leave him too far behind in development (he has no open d-file to challenge a white piece on d4). In particular, the variations in which Black fianchettoes his bishop can put his development behind sched ule. Petroff Defence

Recapturing with the ct-pawn is the very point of 5 lll c3, to get White's pieces out quickly with additional pressure down the open d-file if O-O-O follows. Having pawns on c2 and c3 is easy for White to handle, just as ... dxc6 was in the Ruy Lopez. The difference is that in this Petroff line both sides have two bishops, so it' s unlikely that White has anything special in the way of a permanent advantage. Nevertheless, taking with the ct-pawn is more promising than 6 bxc3, which would leave White with a restricted cen tre in which one of his bishops wouldn't be able to assume an active role. Scotch Game In the Scotch Game with 1 e4 e5 2 lll f3 lll c6 3 d4 exd4 4 lll xd4 lllf6 5 lllxc6, 5 ...bxc6 is the almost automatic recapture. This is still an un resolved line, but Black's queenside structure doesn't hurt him in most lines. Two examples with this type of structure: Rublevsky - Bologan Dortmund 2004

By themselves the bishops usually aren't sufficient to offset the pawns, but the capture has also seriously weakened squares on the opponent's kingside.

The best example of this situation occurs af ter 1 e4 c5 2 lllf3 lbc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lll xd4 g6 5 lbc3 .Bg7 6 lll b3 .Bxc3+ 7 bxc3, a line which usually continues 7 ... lll f6 8 .Bd3, and now Black has the interesting choice between 8 . .. d6, in tending to blockade the c-pawns, and 8 ...d5 9 exd5 'i¥xd5, when Black develops so quickly that White's pieces tend to be tied down. The usual considerations with respect to Black's dark squares on the kingside apply in principle, but there is little chance that they will become a real factor. If you want to continue investigating the is sue of captures away from and towards the centre, there will probably be instances of both in the openings that you play. The more that you study these and get to experience them, the better a player you'll be in the widest sense. Hanging Pawns The term 'hanging pawns' is habitually used to refer to black pawns on c5 and d5 separated from Black's other pawns by at least a file on both sides. The hanging pawns are usually pit ted against a white pawn on e3 and open d- and c-files. Of course the same applies with colours reversed. This structure generally arises from two pawn exchanges on c5 and d5, but it can also come about when an isolated pawn is transformed by a piece exchange on c6. Like 'isolated pawns' , the term 'hanging pawns' is defined more broadly, but it doesn't seem to extend beyond this single case when actually being discussed. That is understand able, because so few analogous structures reg ularly arise, at least in the opening. You could call pawns on e4 and d4 'hanging' under cer tain circumstances, but that's not convention ally done. Returning to the basic position, Black's hanging pawns have advantages and disadvan tages. Much as is the case with an isolated d pawn, Black has the persistent possibility of breaking the position up by ... d4, thus extend ing the range of his pieces, initiating favour able tactics, and/or creating a powerful passed pawn. The hanging pawns also cover key cen tral squares and give Black's pieces somewhat more manoeuvring room than White's. Finally, the e- and b-files can be used to create dynamic chances. From White's point of view there are many promising ways to attack this structure. Most of them begin by restricting the advance of the d pawn. White has a pawn, a knight (sometimes two), and a rook or two on an open file to achieve this, with a bishop on b2 for good ef fect. Once the pawn is 'fixed', White can do one of several things: a) Attack it with his pieces; e.g., a bishop on g2, knight on c3 and/or f4, and rook(s) on an open file. The queen and rooks are particularly effective attackers of hanging pawns. b) Advance a pawn to b4 or e4 to force a desirable change in pawn-structure. If White's advancing pawn either captures Black's or vice versa, an isolated pawn remains in Black's camp. Or, if one of Black's pawns advances, it creates a juicy outpost for White to the side of it. For example: if White attacks with e4 and Black responds with . . .d4, then the c4-square is available for a piece. c) Exchange pieces and simplify the posi tion; as is the case with an isolated queen's pawn, this reduces the pawns' dynamic possi bilities and makes them easier to put under pressure.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRUCTURE 71

there is a single centre pawn on the board and it is connected with other pawns on the flank, I may group them together, an important case being the 4:3 kingside set-up that we shall run into in the course of discussing openings with that pawn distribution. One way of thinking about the Griinfeld De fence main line above is that White's centre is under pressure by direct threats and other in conveniences from an enemy who has no tar gets of attack in his own position. What's more, there aren't even prospective targets of attack in the near future! This sounds one-sided until you take into account that White is protecting a central majority, possibly the most valuable as set in chess in the realm of pawns and struc tures. How is that? First, two central pawns control more central points than one, in itself an advantage. Then, after a protracted struggle to survive the constant threats to their lives and/or their integrity, a central pawn-majority can sweep across the board and scatter the op ponent's pieces, sometimes exacting material tribute along the way. Even more frequently a central majority can be transformed into a passed pawn that is difficult or impossible to stop. That is precisely what happens when things go wrong for Black in many variations of the Griinfeld Defence. Barring such a trium phant journey, a central majority has other ad vantages. It can advance far enough to grant abundant room for friendly pieces to roam, but can also provide the maximum security to the pieces behind it. There are even advantages to having a central pawn-majority that resides on the third rank. The most important situation in which that occurs is in the Open Sicilian, in which Black always has a central majority to begin with, because White has played 3 d4 cxd4 4 lll xd4, as in this example (see following diagram): The pawns on d6 and e6 protect against threatening incursions by putting all of White's important 5th-rank squares under pawn super vision. They combine that with a threat to ad vance, when they would give Black's pieces freer play and begin to restrict White's. Such a majority can compensate for a space disadvan tage elsewhere, because the main value of a space advantage is the ability to shift forces about more easily, and that can be limited by the necessity of keeping White's pieces fairly rigidly poised to prevent Black' s central expan sion. Even though White' s centre pawn in this example is more advanced than Black' s are, it can still cover only one central square, namely, d5. To illustrate this, we might ask why ...b5 is so effective in the Sicilian Defence (when Black has pawns on e6 and d6). A large part of the rea son is a well-timed ... b4, of course, to drive away the c3-knight (e.g., to e2) and then either put pressure on White's e-pawn or successfully achieve a pawn-break in the centre. But White often plays g4-g5 himself and drives away the f6-knight (e.g., to d7). Often that has less effect as regards positional con siderations in the centre. What's the differ ence? The central majority. Let's pretend that Black had only a pawn on d6 and White has his usual central pawn on e4. Then driving away White's c3-knight might be of about the same importance as White's driving away the

71 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

f6-knight. Furthermore, the lack of an e-pawn for Black would mean seriously weakened de fence against White' s pieces occupying cen trally-oriented squares, specifically d5 and f5. For example, if Black' s e-pawn were missing, then d5 would be an attractive outpost that would be further weakened if White could force Black' s knight off f6 by g4-g5 . In that kind of a position a knight on f5 is also notori ous for tearing Black's position to shreds. As it is, since Black's pawn is on e6, White's lim ited central pawn presence in the Open Sicil ian also allows Black to use influential squares for his purposes, such as c5 and e5 for his knights. Then the knights will have fewer ob stacles to reaching c4 or attacking e4. Of course, in 'extra-positional' terms, White has the opportunity for violent attacks based upon the pawn advances e5 and f5, and/or sac rifices on f5, e6, d5 and b5. With a single inac curacy by Black (or merely choosing the wrong variation), these attacks can be so powerful as to decimate the defence. Otherwise no one would play White's side of an Open Sicilian. I simply want to demonstrate Black's underlying reason for accepting a cramped position. See Chapter 1 1 on the Sicilian for other illustrations of how his central majority functions in diverse situa tions, such as the Paulsen and Dragon Varia tions. The next diagram shows another type of cen tral majority in the Open Sicilian arising from 1 e4 c5 2 lZ'Bf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lLixd4 lZ'Bf6 5 lLic3 lZ'Bc6 6 j_e2 e5 7 lZ'Bb3 j_e6 (D). Although by comparison with the previous example, Black has a more vulnerable structure of pawns (on d6 and e5), White's knights are denied e4 and d4, so that defending d5 is really Black' s only practical concern, just as White himself must watch out for ... d5. Again, see Chapter 1 1 on the Sicilian for various exam ples. What are some other common central pawn majorities? White finds himself with this ma jority in several variations of the Griinfeld De fence such as the one mentioned above and in the important variation 1 d4 lZ'Bf6 2 c4 g6 3 lZ'Bc3 d5 4 lZ'Bf3 j_g7 5 l'lb3 dxc4 6 l'lxc4. In the Queen's Gambit Exchange Variation White as sumes a 2: 1 majority on move four ( 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lLic3 lZ'Bf6 4 cxd5 exd5), and in the Queen's Gambit Accepted he gets it on move two ( 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4). White also ends up with an extra centre pawn in many variations of the English Opening in which Black plays ... d5 (an example would be 1 c4 c5 2 lZ'Bc3 lZ'Bf6 3 lZ'Bf3 d5 4 cxd5 lZ'Bxd5). Finally, every Modem Benoni variation has Black accepting a 2: 1 deficit from the start ( 1 d4 lZ'Bf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 lZ'Bc3 exd5 5 cxd5). There aren't a great many 2:0 central majori ties in standard openings, although examples do exist. Take the Nimzo-Indian variation with

[diagram]
l'Bxd5 6 lZ'Bf3 l'Bf5 7 l'Bxf5 exf5 (D ). Ironically, this position seems to be perfectly playable for Black. White's difficulty is that when he finally organizes f3 and e4, Black can capture on e4 and will have an f-pawn in re serve to restrain or even attack the centre. There are a growing number of openings in which this structure arises.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRUCTURE 73

In conclusion, whether central majorities are inherent to a specific opening or not, they are extremely important and tend to assert them selves in the long run. Defenders must be sure to have a clear plan for neutralizing them, some times by transforming the structure itself before the pawn-majority can do any damage. The corresponding issue has to do with queenside majorities and minorities, since cen tral majorities for one side almost always leave the other side with a queenside majority. Since most majorities can in principle be transformed into a passed pawn, it has been said that a queenside majority is advantageous because the resulting passed pawn will usually be an outside passed pawn and thus of special value. That is, in a king and pawn ending, one king will have to go chasing after the queenside passed pawn in order to stop it from promoting, while the other king mops up on the enemy pawns on the kingside. Unfortunately, several considerations interfere with this optimistic scenario. First, if both kings are centralized (as hap pens in many endings) neither majority neces sarily results in a passed pawn further 'outside' than the other. Secondly, the hypothetical ad vantage of the queen side majority is reversed if the parties castle queenside. But since kingside castling is the rule, a more compelling issue arises that especially impacts the opening (our area of concern, after all): the relation of ma jorities to king safety. Since there are more pieces on the board in the opening, the ad vance of kingside pawns to create a passed pawn carries with it the risk of exposing one's own king; obviously, doing the same with a queenside majority is safer. On the other hand, the results of a kingside advance may be to put the opposing king in danger, whereas defence against a queenside majority doesn't require any compromise of the king's position! These many considerations suggest a sort of theoretical balance between the types of major ities, depending upon concrete features of the position. As a practical matter in the opening stage of the game, one shouldn't pay much at tention to the matter of majorities and minori ties, apart from their value in beginning to pursue a specific plan. The odds are that the pawn-structure will be transformed prior to the onset of the endgame. This brings us to the minority attack, which involves two pawns attacking three. It is fa mously effective in the Sicilian Defence, in volving ... b5 and ... b4, sometimes supported by ... a5, driving away White's knight from c3 and/or gaining open files. The exposure of White's queenside renders his majority irrele vant in most cases, at least in so far as creating passed pawns is concerned. The most famous minority-attack structure is 2:3, 2: 1 and 3:3, sometimes called the Carls bad pawn-structure. Numerous books discuss the minority at tack by b4-b5 in great detail because its appli cation is widespread, although not necessarily in the pure form shown. The most important examples that directly conform to the model in the diagram are in the Queen's Gambit Ex change Variation and a few other variations of the Queen's Gambit Declined. The Carlsbad pawn-structure also emerges in the Nimzo Indian Defence following 1 d4 llJf6 2 c4 e6 3 lZ:Jc3 .tb4 4 Wic2 d5 5 cxd5 exd5 6 .tg5 h6 7 .txf6 Wixf6 8 a3 .txc3+ 9 Wixc3. Then Black often feels compelled to play ... c6 in the face of c-file pressure, making White's minority attack by b4-b5 all the more effective. Interestingly, the Caro-Kann has the same pawn distribution with colours reversed after 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 .td3 lZ:Jc6 5 c3 llJf6; in fact, you will find an example of a pure minority attack by Black in Chapter 12.

Generally, White's first goal is expansion in the centre, in the one case by c4 and d5, in the other by e4 and d5. These are difficult to achieve given Black's pawn-structure, which is specifi cally designed to prevent d5, and Black is ready to play ... e5 or ...c5 at the first opportunity. But White also has other resources, including using the support-point at e5 (and sometimes at c5) to make threats and favourably transform the cen tral situation. Or he can expand on the wings. In some of these variations, Black's light squared bishop comes out in front of its pawns. Then Black already has some freedom for his pieces and can take more time to play for a transformation of the pawn-structure. When the bishop is stuck behind its pawns, as in the Queen's Gambit or the Caro-Kann with 4 ... ltJd7, Black needs to get ...e5 or ... c5 in as a freeing move, preferably sooner rather than later, if he is to equalize. The ... c5 move not only loosens White's grip on the centre but if followed up by ... cxd4 it claims the c5-square for Black's pieces, often a knight. In that case we have something similar to various French Defence lines with 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lLic3 (or 3 ltJd2 dxe4) 3 ... dxe4 (or 3 ... lLif6 4 ..Bg5 dxe4) 4 lLixe4 lLid7 5 lLif3 ltJgf6 6 lLixf6+ lLixf6, where Black will generally play for . . .c5. If Black can play ...e5, he attacks the centre but also frees his light-squared bishop. It's better to show a few examples than to speak in generalities. Gulko - Lakdawala USA Ch (San Diego) 2004

But having seen this d4 ver sus c6 structure before (hopefully many times) he assesses this as a favourable isolated queen's pawn position. Black is well-developed, and if he gets ...c5 in it will open up the b7-bishop and activate his game. The issue then is whether White can make use of any particular advan tages that he has in advance of that freeing move. The dark squares and aggressively-placed pieces look good, so the first question is: where is Black weak? The squares c5, e5 and d6 may be vulnerable, and if you've foreseen the move 15 .tg5 before playing 1 3 c4, that should be enough to convince you to go ahead. 13• •. bxc4 14 lZ'Bxc4 'Yi'c7 15 .tgS!

Rather than trying to fight directly against the ...c6/ ...e6 complex, it's sometimes better to give up on d5 and transform the structure.

White has the advantage. He can exploit the weakness on e6, or play for a well-timed 0,c5. Spassky went on to win the game. Space and Structure The relationship of space to structure is poten tially an immense subject, but I just want to make a few comments about it. We know that White is the one who will generally grab more space in the opening (particularly in the major openings discussed in this book). Several situ ations can arise for Black. In the Closed Sys tem of the Ruy Lopez and several other double e-pawn openings, Black's strongpoint on e5 (based upon the pawn-chain c7-d6-e5) and his b5-pawn establish a sufficient command of ter ritory that he doesn't usually feel the need to acquire more. The Chigorin set-up with ... 0,a5 and ...c5 is an exception, in that it is clearly aimed at extending Black's territorial reach; but that this policy is not necessary is shown by the popular Breyer, Zaitsev, M0ller and Smyslov Variations (see Chapter 8 on the Ruy Lopez for examples). To some extent this is also true with the double d-pawn openings such as the Queen's Gambit Declined and Slav. Nevertheless, in the traditional Queen's Gambit variations Black tends to play for ...e5 at some point, arguably exchanging one type of territorial control (the d5-pawn) for another that also activates his pieces. In the Dutch Variation of the Slav ( 1 d4

82 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

d5 2 c4 c6 3 lllf3 lllf6 4 lll c3 dxc4 5 a4 iLf5 6 e3), Black is generally in no hurry to play ... e5 or even ... c5, which also true of several of the other ...e6/ ... c6 restraint openings that we saw above, especially since his queen's bishop is outside his pawn-chain. By contrast, look at many of the other major d-pawn openings. In the King's Indian Defence main lines (e.g., 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 g6 3 lllc3 ii.g7 4 e4 d6 followed by ...O-O and ...e5), once White takes space in the centre, Black will seldom be satisfied that the single central pawn on e5 fully represents his interests in that sector. Without further pawn moves he will slowly be strangled by White's central and queenside pawn ad vances. Therefore you will almost always see a rapid .. .f5, or in some cases an attempt to take over territory on the queenside by ... c6 or ...c5. Likewise in the Modern Benoni (1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 lll c3 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 followed by ...g6, ...ii.g7, ...O-O, etc.), Black can almost never be satisfied with the central control of fered by his c5-pawn. In most variations he is almost compelled to win more space by ... b5 or .. .f5 or get strangled by White's pieces and on rushing pawns. In the Semi-Slav, a combina tion of ... dxc4 and ... b5, or ... dxc4, ... ii.d6 and ... e5 is customary before White extends his con trol over the central squares (note that Black's light-squared bishop is trapped behind his pawns). What about the Sicilian Defence? In general, if he has the ...e6/ ... d6 centre, Black is in a re markable lack of hurry to take on more space. At most he will play ...b5, and if White stops that by playing a4 it is hardly a matter of great concern. But look at White's various strategies against the Sicilian. It seems practically man datory to expand his reach over the board. Re cently there are players who set up with f3, g4, g5 and h4 (and even h5 and g6) against the ma jority of Sicilian variations. Traditionally, f4 has been a standard way of proceeding, with f5 to follow or perhaps e5 (although the latter is sometimes more of a tactical device, because the pawn will seldom stay on e5 long enough to be a true claimant of territory). These days there are also more combinations of f4 and g4. Barring those kingside moves, White will at least play a4 to stake out some space on the queenside. In the Maroczy Bind and Hedgehog Variations, in which White already has control of space with pawns on c4 and e4, Black finds it a little more urgent to achieve ...b5 or ... d5, or at least threaten to do so. Almost every opening can be looked at_ in this way, that is, how vital is it for the side with less space (usually Black) to win space, and how quickly? What about the need for White to take on more space quickly, or can he be pa tient? If you understand the urgency (or lack of it) in achieving these goals, you will have a much better feel for the logic and timing behind the opening moves. Cross-Pol I ination Sometimes manoeuvres and positional ideas will arise across openings that are not specifi cally related, a phenomenon that I call 'cross pollination' . We have seen repeated examples of structures that show up in various openings, and in a way everything that we've seen about structures to this point has involved cross pollination, that is, every structure has been re lated to other structures. Here I'll briefly discuss the process that may lead you to recognize such similarities and therefore play an unfamiliar or only partly familiar variation with increased confidence. Grandmasters are very good at see ing this type of relationship in subtle ways. You'll gain a lot from the very process of using your study and experience from one position and then applying it to another. All the more reason to keep your opening knowledge broad and not overspecialized. As an example, you've probably wondered whether to play with an isolated queen's pawn in a given position. This requires judgements based upon experience. We already know that the isolated pawn offers similar lessons across a wide range of openings. We even see standard IQP positions that are essentially the same in the Nimzo-Indian, Caro-Kann, Sicilian and Queen's Gambit. But you'll consistently be given the option of deciding whether a new IQP position in a foreign position has more good features than defects, and experience with other open ings will do more than an author's generalities can. A more interesting illustration of cross pollination relates to decisions about when to

bring your queen out, and whether you can do so productively at an early stage. If, as Black, you've captured some 'poisoned' pawns on b2 or gambited them as White, you'll certainly get a better feel for when to take the risk in either way. Here are a few examples that you might run into:

The broader your exposure to typical structures, the better you'll be able to handle unfamiliar situations. See Chapter 14 on the Pirc Defence for more details about this varia tion; the next thing that happens is that it turns into an Open Variation of the Ruy Lopez! Along the same lines (bringing queens to d4 or d5), a tricky anti-Sicilian variation goes 1 e4 c5 2 lllf3 d6 3 c3 lllf6 4 ii.d3 ! ? lllc6, when some players may not want to face ... ii.g4, so they play 5 h3. But with that pawn on c3, 5 ... d5 should be considered, with the idea 6 e5 llld7, and nowWhite can play 7 ii.b5 Vi'b6 (a French Defence pattern), or he might enter into the se quence 7 e6! ? fxe6 8 lllg5, a tactical ploy that arises in a good half-dozen other opening varia tions. With experience in any of those, you may be helped by recognition of associated patterns such as 8 ... lll f6 9 lll xh7 (9 ii.xh7 lllxh7 10 Vi'h5+ 'it>d7 1 1 lllxh7 'it>c7, etc.) 9 ... l!Vd6 (or maybe 9 ... lllxh7 10 Vi'h5+ 'it>d7 1 1 il.xh7 b6, even if you haven't seen that one before). The fact that you've seen and/or played other posi tions with the e6 move helps you to make more accurate calculations and gives you confidence that the resulting positions should be fine for Black. There are plenty of other cases of an early 'it'xd4 (or ... l!Vxd5) in which the c3-square (or c6-square for Black) isn't occupied. The sim plest of these is the Scandinavian Defence (Centre Counter) 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 l!Vxd5, when 3 lll c3 forces the loss of a tempo with the queen, still out early and subject to further attack. I think that it's fair to say that the reason that Black can get away with this is that the knight isn't all that well placed on c3, such that Black can play moves like ... ii.f5, ... e6 and ... c6 at some point, when White would prefer to have his c-pawn free to advance and increase his central control. Or the queen, when attacked, may use the tempo 'lost' to make a second pro ductive move. A good example comes up in the line 1 c4 e5 2 g3 lllf6 3 lt:Jf3 e4 4 lt:Jd4 lllc6 5 lllc2 d5 6 cxd5 Vi'xd5 7 lllc3 Vi'h5 ! intending ... ii.h3, when Black has an excellent game. That leads to many other examples, such as those in which a knight on c3 (or ... c6) is pinned, so that a queen can come to d4 (or d5). A well known case is the Nimzo-Indian line with 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 e6 3 lllc3 ii.b4 4 l!Vc2 d5 5 cxd5 Vi'xd5; and a related one is the Chigorin De fence with 1 d4 d5 2 c4 lllc6 3 cxd5 l!Vxd5 4 e3 e5 5 lllc3 ii.b4. From the white side, we have a Sicilian Defence with 1 e4 c5 2 lllf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Vi'xd4 lllc6 5 il.b5, which we might compare with a Philidor Defence 1 e4 e5 2 lt:Jf3 d6 3 d4 exd4 4 l!Vxd4 lllc6 5 ii.b5. In both cases the queen is allowed to stand her ground, but often at the cost of the bishop-pair. Do you spot the main difference? In the Sicilian line, Black keeps his central majority intact; in the Philidor Black surrenders the centre. After a while it be comes second nature to look for these situa tions, and advanced players do so. Cross-pollination between 1 d4 and 1 e4 is more common than you'd think. The chess player with some experience may have noticed that the Benoni pawn-chain ...c5/. ..d6 versus White's e4/d5 will often arise in the King's In dian Defence, after, for instance, 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 g6 3 lll c3 ii.g7 4 e4 d6 5 ii.e2 O-O 6 ii.g5 c5 7 d5 h6 8 ii.e3 e6 9 lllf3 exd5 10 cxd5 and in several other major lines. But if you're playing the black side of a Ruy Lopez, you might consider heading for this same structure by way of vari ous Closed lines. For example, in the Keres Variation you may arrive at this main position:

1 e4 e5 2 lllf3 lllc6 3 ii.b5 a6 4 ii.a4 lllf6 5 O-O

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRUCTURE 85

White will prevent it. All Black needs to do next is 'fianchetto' his bishop by ... J.f6 and he will obtain an excellent game. White doesn't want to allow this and plays 15 lllxe5, but as it turns out that frees Black's game or at least gives his pieces places to go. Cross-pollination will appear in contexts that are not strictly structural, but relate to the scope of plausible structures. I think that a lot of this shows up in the opening preparation of players and their borrowing of ideas from each other. Grandmaster X will see a new move that Grand master Y has played on the 1 8th move of a cer tain variation of the Sicilian. Then he may apply that move to his 14th move in a closely-related variation. That is an interesting exchange of ideas, of course, but it's more exciting to see players latch on to the same moves or general ideas across the range of openings. The number of older, well-known, positions in which White has recently found and played the move g4 can not be coincidental. Whole articles have been written about this move appearing in so many new and interesting contexts. The list of open ings thus affected includes several variations of the English Opening, the Semi-Slav, the Two Knights Defence, the Bogo-Indian Defence, the Dutch Defence, the Caro-Kann Defence, and just about every variation of the Sicilian De fence! And I could make a similar although shorter list of openings in which Black has be gun to use the move ... g5. Obviously, once the idea struck players' imaginations they began to look for it in every position. Something that has struck me about chess from the last several decades, actually stretch ing back more than a century but only recently flowering, is the phenomenon of semi-waiting moves in the opening. That is, moves that serve a definite purpose but only just so, and which seem to need the opponent' s cooperation to take on meaning. It is fascinating to see, how ever, that these moves are a little more effective than my description would imply, i.e. the oppo nent hasn't really the luxury of doing nothing in return without giving ground. A lot of these ideas are unassuming; for example, develop ment of pieces to the second rank that appear to have five good answers and yet are hard to meet. Or a sequence of moves that seems to lose a tempo but puts the opponent' s pieces somewhere they' d rather not be; for instance, in d-pawn and c-pawn openings with an early ...e6 we see many new cases of ... i.b4+ followed by ... J.e7, and ... J.a6 followed by ... J.b7. In the Sicilian Defence and English Opening, Black always seems to be playing ... J.c5 or ... i.b4 followed by ... i.e7. I find the little rook's pawn moves to be par ticularly thought-provoking, and I suspect that grandmasters are finding inspiration from such moves' success in some openings to experiment with them in others. These are not necessarily new moves but often obscure older ones which later received general acceptance. For instance, Kasparov's strengthening of Petrosian's little move 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 e6 3 lllf3 b6 4 a3 ! ? led to an explosion of games and investigations, and 4 a3 has been going strong in the Queen's Indian Defence for many years now. Variations such as

1 c4 c5 2 lll

[diagram]

86 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

and so forth. These all seem fully playable, in part because ...c5 can follow and 'threaten' to go into a favourable Sicilian Defence, an ex ample of cross-pollination. Recently players started looking at long-established openings and found a new idea or rediscovered it in older literature; for instance, 1 e4 e5 2 lbf3 lbc6 3 lllc3 lllf6 4 a3 ! ?. This is another waiting move that doesn't do much but achieves a little some thing; for example, 4 ... ii.c5 5 lll xe5 ! , when the resource ... ii.b4 isn't available after 5 ... lllxe5 6 d4. Or in the Pirc Defence, the remarkable 1 e4 d6 2 d4 lllf6 3 lllc3 g6 4 f4 ii.g7 5 a3 !?, prevent ing the usual 5 ...c5 in view of 6 dxc5 l!Va5 7 b4, and otherwise waiting for Black to make a com mittal move, of which it turns out that many have disadvantages. In the Sicilian Defence, 1 e4 c5 2 lll f3 lllc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lll xd4 lllf6 5 lllc3 e6 became a popular way to avoid major Sicil ian theory; after a century of experience with that line players noticed the possibility of 6 a3, preventing 6 ... ii.b4 and again waiting to see what Black is going to do. There's a current in terest in 1 e4 c5 2 a3 (not to mention 2 llla3 ! ?), and even a monograph devoted to it. Similar things have been going on with Black. In the French Defence with 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lllc3 (and 3 llld2), grandmasters have been using 3 ...h6 (the other rook' s pawn!), asking White to commit while preventing il.g5 and finding the move ...g5 useful in a remarkable number of positions. Likewise, Anand and many others have played 1 c4 e5 2 g3 lllf6 3 ii.g2 h6. It seems obvious that these sorts of ideas feed off each other, with each new explorer inspired by the most recent discoveries. But if you look at the details of the newly discovered theory and practice of such lines, you will see that standard structures from other chess openings appear everywhere throughout them. In other words, experiments like these are successful only be cause of the vast knowledge of traditional open ings that lets players find old patterns in new contexts. The moral of the story is not to play the move a3 in every position (or any position!), but to realize that mastery of openings comes from a broader set of structures and techniques that ap pear across the board. While you study the tra ditional openings, be sure to look at ideas from every other source to reinforce what you're learning. Furthermore, you can look at structural themes in the same way, comparing them from opening to opening. The more that you examine and compare outposts and support-points, for example, the more you will find yourself able to work with them. Ask simple questions when you play over games by grandmasters: when are outposts on squares like e5, d5, e4 and d4 similar, and how do they differ? Does the out post piece radiate influence and make counter play fruitless? Can the outpost be maintained? Can a piece on the outpost be exchanged off fa vourably in order to change the pawn-structure? Is there a situation in which the outpost can be 'played around' , leaving an impressive-looking but uninvolved piece occupying it? Similarly, is a piece on an outpost in front of doubled or backward pawns so powerful that it's worth a rook, or will it just sit there and block one's own play? Either result is possible. Cross-pollination turns out to be an unlimited subject and contributes to the fact that we take so strong an interest in chess. There are examples throughout this book and in most sources of chess information. Keep an eye out for them, es pecially as you study and play openings. You'll find it a fun exercise, and helpful for your chess.

4 Introduction to 1 e4 and the Open

Games Want to play a game of chess? I'll move first:

1 e4 (D)

Advancing the e-pawn two squares is the old est and still the most popular way to begin the game. Beginners who know little more than the rules proudly play 1 e4 before they start losing their pieces. Chess in the movies is dominated by e-pawn play. The majority of the world's top ten players use 1 e4 more often than not. What's so great about this move? On the most basic level, 1 e4 fights for control of the key central square d5, and it frees the fl-bishop to join the fray. Indeed, in the 1 e4 e5 openings that dominated chess practice for so many years, we find the bishop being developed at an early stage. Surprisingly, however, that doesn't hold true for most of Black's other defences to 1 e4. What other advantages stand forth? Well, mov ing the e-pawn also opens up the d l -h5 diago nal for White's queen to come out on, although she doesn't use that privilege much in the early stages, so as not to become an object of attack. White's queen does prevent or discourage cer tain uncommon deployments of Black's pieces and pawns, such as rash advances involving .. .f6 or .. .f5. These are not exactly compelling reasons for

1 e4 to have ascended to the throne of the open

ings realm. Maybe we should think on an even more fundamental level. What's the first goal of opening play? To control the centre. And what's the best way to do that? To set up an ideal cen tre. There are only two moves involved in that project: e4 and d4. To some extent, playing the one creates the threat to play the other. Thus, playing one of these two moves right away nar rows Black's set of logical responses and in some sense establishes a degree of control. At that point there are various advantages to either move, and indeed 1 d4 is White's second most popular opening move by a landslide. The over all preference for 1 e4 then comes down to more subtle factors, and I may as well cite the obvious fact that in the great majority of open ings, 1 e4 prepares the way for kingside cas tling more quickly than does 1 d4. Now things get a little more complicated. Notice that the e4-pawn is undefended. Not surprisingly, Black will often attack it and try to compel White to spend a move protecting his pawn. This immediate vulnerability is not shared by other popular first moves by White such as 1 d4, 1 c4, or 1 lllf3. Hence Breyer's proclamation that 'After 1 e4, White's game is in its last throes' ! That is melodramatic, of course, but it does reflect the direction in which Black's defences will tend to go. He will gener ally create threats to White's e-pawn, usually by the move ... lllf6 or by ... d5. We find such an attack on White's e4-pawn in most of the major defences to 1 e4, usually within the first two or three moves of the game. For example: a) The Caro-Kann: 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5; b) The Alekhine: 1 e4 lll f6; c) The Petroff: 1 e4 e5 2 fllf3 lll f6; d) The French: 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 (and 3 lll c3 lll f6 or 3 llld2 lll j6, among other examples);

88 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

e) The Scandinavian: 1 e4 d5; f) The Pirc: 1 e4 d6 2 d4 t:fJ/6. After 1 e4 e5 much the same holds; for ex ample, 2 f4 exf4 3 t:fJf3 d5 (or 3 ... t:fJ/6). Or, after

[diagram]
t:fJ/6 and many other Ruy Lopez positions with ... t:fJf6 at a very early stage. An exception to all this is the Sicilian De fence: after 1 e4 c5, Black's move ... d5 is nor mally inferior and in the main lines he doesn't usually get to play ... t:fJf6 until the 4th or 5th move (e.g., 2 t:fJf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 t:fJxd4 t:fJf6), or perhaps later (after 2 t:fJf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 t:fJxd4 t:fJc6 5 t:fJc3 a6 6 ii.e2 'W/c7 7 O-O t:fJf6, for exam ple). Nevertheless, attack on White's e4-pawn is a consistent theme of Black's strategy in these Sicilian variations; he very often follows ... t:fJf6 with moves such as ... ii.b7, ... t:fJbd7-c5 and the like. Finally, one of White's principal alternatives to 1 e4 c5 2 t:fJf3 is 1 e4 c5 2 c3, to which Black normally replies 2 ... d5 or 2 ... t:fJf6, both attacking e4. This observation may seem trivial, but in how many queen's pawn openings (i.e., those stemming from 1 d4) does Black attack the d4- pawn at all? Certainly not early on in openings like the following: a) The Queen's Gambit Declined: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 and, for example, 3 t:fJc3 t:fJf6 4 il.g5 ii.e7

5 e3 O-O, etc.;

b) The Nimzo-Indian: 1 d4 t:fJf6 2 c4 e6 3 t:fJc3 ii.b4; c) The major Indian defences that begin with I ...t:fJf6 and 2 ... e6 or 2 ...g6, with the exception of the Benoni ( 1 d4 t:fJf6 2 c4 c5). This is not universally the case, but for the most part it holds true. After 1 t:fJf3, of course, White's knight is ex empt from direct attack by Black; in practical terms, so is White's pawn after 1 c4. We there fore have a fundamental difference between 1 e4 and other first moves. The Open Games It is interesting that 1 e4 is commonly thought to be an 'attacking' move. To some extent that derives from the very exposure of the e4-pawn to attack, which can lead to early confrontation and the kind of dynamism often associated with king's pawn openings. But the characterization of 1 e4 as an 'attacking' opening, and of 1 d4 as a 'positional' opening doesn't really follow. The openings arising from 1 e4 e5 are called the 'Open Games' because pieces tend to come out rapidly and at least part of the pawn-centre tends to evaporate. In particular, the association of 1 e4 with aggressive play stems in large part from the tradition of tactically-based annihila tions that spring from 1 e4 e5. Openings deriv ing from 1 e4 e5 (D) are also combative from at least one perspective, namely that even within the first few moves the players so often make threats to pawns, pieces, or even the king. We can see this reputation illustrated by nu merous standard variations. The move 2 t:fJf3 immediately threatens the e-pawn, and after 2 ... t:fJc6 3 ii.c4 t:fJf6, 4 t:fJg5 already attacks the king! Such things don't happen after 1 d4 d5. It might be useful to look at some of the more traditional openings after 1 e4 e5. We have 2 f4 (the King's Gambit, an opening ubiquitous in master chess of the 1 9th century). After 2 ...exf4 White tries to attack the king down the f-file in conjunction with ii.c4, t:fJf3 and O-O. 2 d4 is an other way to attack the pawn, and after 2 ...exd4 3 c3, White is already trying to blast open the centre with tempo (after 3 ...dxc3, 4 ii.c4!? cxb2 5 il.xb2 is the Danish Gambit, and 4 t:fJxc3 is the Goring Gambit). The Vienna Game with 2 t:fJc3 t:fJf6 3 ii.c4 t:fJxe4 4 l!Vh5 has all the ele ments of attacking chess. Even the generally calm Giuoco Piano main line, 2 t:fJf3 t:fJc6 3 i.c4 ii.c5 4 c3 (don't forget 4 b4, the Evans Gambit) 4 ... t:fJf6 5 d4 exd4 6 cxd4 ii.b4+, can result in violent play after 7 t:fJc3 !? t:fJxe4 8 O-O ii.xc3 9 d5 and similar variations. There are

INTRODUCTION TO I e4 AND THE OPEN GAMES 89

So which is objectively better, 1 e4 or 1 d4? The short answer is that it depends upon the prefer ences of the individual player. To go any fur ther, we should address the state of theory. Many of us will remember that for some time 1 d4 was Garry Kasparov's main opening move, played in order to generate attacks. Indeed, a significant portion of his most brilliant and ag gressive games begin with 1 d4. Attackers like Shirov also used d-pawn openings, as did a younger and more aggressive Kramnik. Korch noi rarely deviates from his adherence to 1 d4/1 c4 openings and of course many other top-level grandmasters use 1 d4 almost exclusively. Nev ertheless, at this moment we see a distinct pref erence for 1 e4 among most of the world's strongest grandmasters. Is that because 1 d4 isn't an exciting move? Would you say that the Exchange Variation of the Griinfeld, the Bot vinnik Variation of the Semi-Slav, the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined, the Taimanov Variation of the Benoni, and any number of King's Indian lines, are not aggres sive attacking systems? In reality, what happens is that in different eras, individual defences prove to be temporary barriers to the general use of 1 e4 or 1 d4 at the very highest levels. At this moment in time I would say that the Nimzo-Indian ( 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 e6 3 lll c3 i.b4) is such a defence, with Black complementing its use with the Queen's Indian Defence or Queen's Gambit Declined when confronted by 3 lllf3. Recently, however, White has done reasonably well against the Queen's Indian and it has tradi tionally been possible to create chances against the Queen's Gambit. Furthermore, White's score against the Nimzo-Indian is somewhat better than his score against other openings,

90 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

including those beginning with 1 e4. In the Ruy Lopez, on the other hand, we currently see White avoiding the Marshall Attack with, for example, an early h3 followed by moves such as d3, a3, lll c3 and ii.a2 (see Chapter 8). Given the unambitious appearance of this method of play (although it's faring tolerably well so far), one wonders if the pendulum might swing back to 1 d4. Or perhaps players will amend their tastes some years hence, for unrelated reasons. That is part of the fun of following opening the ory. At any rate, the average player (and even 'ordinary' master) need not worry about such matters; either first move will produce games with plenty of opportunities for victory. Don't worry if the recital of names in the last few paragraphs befuddles you. My point is to present 1 e4 from a broad perspective. It can be as much an option for positional players as for attacking players. There are ways to fight for very small and lasting advantages against nearly every defence to 1 e4, and there are ways to try to decimate the opponent with slash-and-bum tactics. Most of the latter methods come up short of their goal against proper defence, or in the face of counterattack by Black. Still, once the smoke has cleared, a bold attack may be just as effective as any other approach at producing a small but durable advantage. Rather than measuring degrees of aggres sion, a dispassionate investigation of e-pawn openings turns up a more interesting distinction between 1 e4 and 1 d4. This has to do with the acquisition of space by the pawn advance e5, which is prominent in the Semi-Open Garnes (defences other than 1 .. .e5), but can also occur in double e-pawn openings. Consider that White can play e5 on the third move of both the Caro Kann Defence ( 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 e5) and French Defence ( l e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5), and on the sec ond move of the Alekhine Defence ( 1 e4 lllf6 2 e5). Against the Pirc Defence, e5 is a common move in the variation 1 e4 d6 2 d4 lllf6 3 lll c3 g6 4 f4, and played in several lines with 4 lll f3 and 4 ii.c4. Just a bit further on in French De fence games, we have 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lllc3 ii.b4 4 e5, 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lll c3 lt:Jf6 4 ii.g5 ii.e7 5 e5, and so forth. After 1 e4 e5, there are moves such as 2 lllf3 lllc6 3 ii.c4 lllf6 4 d4 exd4 5 e5, or the more complex 2 lllf3 lllc6 3 d4 exd4 4 lll xd4 lZ:lf6 5 lllxc6 bxc6 6 e5, the latter revived and brought into prominence by World Champion Kasparov. Where do you find similar advances in the practice of 1 d4 d5, or in any line beginning with 1 d4? In a d-pawn opening, White seldom plays d5 with a threat within the first six moves. In fact, only in a few openings (such as 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5) does the d-pawn even reach the fifth rank, whether there is a threat or not. It's true that d5 will fairly often occur in the King's Indian Defence (e.g., 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 g6 3 lllc3 ii.g7 4 e4 d6 5 lllf3 O-O 6 ii.el e5 and now

7 d5 or 7 O-O lllc6 8 d5); and similarly in a few

lines of the Griinfeld. However, such d5 ad vances don't occur often after 1 d4 d5 and will usually happen well past the first several moves of the opening. In e-pawn openings, an analo gous situation would be the advance d5 in the Ruy Lopez, normally played after the 10th move. What does that mean? That by using 1 e4, at least in some openings, White has the option of staking out a significant space advantage early on. This is indeed an aggressive stance, but not one that involves open centres and multiple ex changes - quite the contrary. And keep in mind that when pawns are advanced they can become vulnerable; again we hark back to Breyer's 'last throes' . If you are an e-pawn player, you have to take that possibility into account when you advance your pawns. Failure to tie your oppo nent down or make other difficulties for him can sometimes leave you on the defensive. On the other hand, an aggressive pawn presence in the enemy camp can reward you with a winning advantage. You will see examples of both of these results throughout the book.

5 G iuoco Piano

1 e4 e5 2 tbf3 tbc6 3 J.c4 (D)

The move 3 J.c4 has been used consistently since the early days of chess in its modem form. Although far behind the Ruy Lopez (3 J.b5) in popularity, 3 J.c4 is White's second favourite continuation. Placing the bishop on c4 agrees with the principles of development and central ization, and prepares to castle quickly. It is also the move that most directly attacks Black's po sition, in particular the sensitive f7-square. In addition, White wants to control the central d5-square and thus prevent Black's freeing move . . .d5. In this respect 3 .ltc4 fulfils a positive po sitional role that, for instance, 3 J.e2 doesn't. As always, there are drawbacks, not obvious at first. Because the bishop on c4 makes no threat, Black himself is able to develop freely. That would also seem to be true of 3 .ltb5, which also has no direct threat; but the latter move discourages a number of black set-ups that .ltc4 doesn't, by virtue of the potential threat of .ltxc6 and tbxe5. In the Giuoco Piano, moreover, we shall see that if Black does achieve the move ... d5, White may lose a tempo or suffer some positional disadvantage. These considerations are rather abstract, and can only be shown by example. I should mention that the Bishop's Open ing, l e4 e5 2 J.c4, is a respectable choice that will sometimes transpose to 3 J.c4, for in stance after 2 ... J.c5 3 tbf3 tbc6. The inde pendent line 2 J.c4 tbf6 3 d3 c6 4 tbf3 d5 5 J.b3 J.d6 can lead to complex play, and of course Black can play ... tbc6 on one of the first few moves. One of the problems with 2 J.c4 is that Black has various ways to control the direction of play. That interferes with some players' desire to be in command as White, particularly when facing a symmetri cal variation such as l ...e5. 3 ... J.c5 (D) This development of Black's bishop is the oldest well-analysed response to 3 .ltc4. I'll use the generally accepted name 'Giuoco Piano' for 3 ... J.c5; it is also called 'the Italian Game' in recognition of the Italian players who published analysis of the move in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. With 3 ... J.c5, Black attends to White's move d4, the idea of which is to form an ideal centre. Moreover, the move tbg5 is lurking in the back ground; since that would attack the f7-square twice, Black wants to be ready to defend against the threat by castling. The straightforward posi tion after 3 ... J.c5 contains a majority of the ba sic classical ideas about development, centre and attack. That should motivate us to examine it in some depth.

92 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

4 c3 I shall concentrate upon this continuation as representing the purest intent of the opening: to establish an ideal centre and drive Black's pieces away with tempo. 4 c3 leads to play that resembles other openings and is therefore of general value. For organizational reasons, the line 4 d3 tllf6 is discussed in Chapter 6 about the Two Knights Defence. It will arise via the move-order 1 e4 eS 2 tllf3 tllc6 3 .ltc4 tllf6 4 d3 .lies.

iVb6! Euwe's continuation is probably the most logical response. Simplification should help the defender and Black avoids weaknesses as well. The irritating effect of the pawn-push a5 shows up in the beautiful game Rossolimo-Reissman, Puerto Rico 1 967: 1 3. .. b6 14 ctJe5 .ltb7 15 a5 ! l::t c8?!

Now Black's king is under serious attack before he has the chance to play ...c5 and free his a8-bishop. The game continued 20 ... ctJe6? (a poor move, but 20 ...c5 2 1 g3 ctJg6 22 lLixg6 hxg6 23 iVh4 is also good for White, with ideas including 24 ctJg5 ctJf6 25 l::t ae3 !) 2 1 .ltxd5 cxd5 22 ctJf6+ @h8 23 iVg6 ! !

Naturally the brilliance of this move strikes one first (reminiscent of the famous Levitsky Marshall ... iVg3 ! ! game) but an eye for detail will also pick up Black's bishop stuck behind the d5-pawn. That was of course the blockading square which was the pride and joy of Black's position. The game continued 23 ... iVc2 (mate on h7 is threatened, but accepting the queen sacrifice loses instantly: 23 .. .fxg6 24 lLixg6+ hxg6 25 l::t h3#; 23 ... hxg6 24 l::t h3#; or 23 ...gxf6 24 iVxf6+ lLig7 25 l::t g3 l::t g8 26 ctJxf7+) 24 l::t h3 ! 1-0.

This is the kind of slow move that White typ ically makes in order to play it safe and engage Black in a battle of positional skills. His ideas by setting up this structure are: a) to protect his e4-pawn; b) to cover the d4-square against intrusions by Black's pieces (in particular ... tt:ld4); and c) to hold off on the move d4 until his pieces are more developed, thereby avoiding the forc ing variation that we saw in the main variation after 5 d4 exd4 6 cxd4 .ltb4+, which was soon followed by the centre-clearing move ...d5. On the other hand, Black now has much more freedom to develop his pieces. Without

Advancing the a-pawn so modestly has two ideas: to put the bishop on the safe square a7 and to be able to play ... tba5 and capture the c4-bishop. That exchange would gain Black the advantage of the bishop-pair with no conces sion on his part. Note that 7 ... tba5 right away would have allowed 8 .ltb5 ! a6 9 i.a4 b5 10 .ltc2, which saves White's bishop from ex change and threatens b4. So we can see another advantage of White's move c3. After the text move, the positional threat of 8 ... tba5 is real, so play can continue as follows: 8 .ltb3 .lta7 9 h3!? (D) Karpov's move. It prevents ... .ltg4 in some situations, but mainly it prepares l:.el without having to worry about ... tbg4. White is now ready to reorganize by moving his knight to c4 and e3, or to play l:.el followed by tbfl , in tum followed by tbg3 or tbe3. Perhaps you're fa miliar with this sequence of moves, but if not, it must look rather odd. In fact, the knight ma noeuvre tbbd2-fl -g3/e3 is standard practice. I won't go into detail at this point, but the princi ple here is that if the centre is stable, players may be able to embark upon long trips with their pieces without being punished. From g3, White's knight lusts after the wonderful square f5 and protects e4; and after tbe3, the knight sets its eyes upon both d5 and f5 (at the cost of blocking off his queen's bishop). We shall see a lot of this manoeuvre tbbd2-fl-g3/e3 in the Ruy Lopez chapter, and it's good to be intro duced to it now. 9 .•. .lte6 9 ...h6 is a good option. You will see a lot of these 'little moves' in variations with d3 and ...d6. The idea is to prevent .ltg5 after White's knight moves. After 10 l:.el , there can follow 10 ... tbh5 !.

(D) This isn't the only move by any means, but it follows a 'mini-rule' that can apply to any opening in which there are pawns on e4 and e5: if White plays h3, the move ... tt:lh5 should be strongly considered. The reasoning is that after ... tt:lf4, the knight can't be kicked out by g3 since ... tt:lxh3 will follow. But if White's bishop captures that knight (i.xf4), he will have ceded the bishop-pair; that is hardly disastrous but usually not a good thing for White (remember how important it is to possess the two bishops). Notice that in the note above about 9 ... h6, the d-file was closed. This time we're about to get an exchange of queens. Of course this sort of technical guidance only fits in certain situations, but it can also ap ply to the Ruy Lopez and Philidor Defences, and the same idea quite frequently occurs in the King's Indian Defence, a very different open ing indeed! 13 tll fl \\Wxdl 14 !Ixdl l:tad8 15 i.e3 f6 16 .ltxa7 tt:lxa7 17 tlle3 tllf4 18 h4 .ltf7 19 tllel At this point Polugaevsky suggests 19 ... tt:le6 20 .ltb3 tt:lc5, which looks equal.

This move quietly protects the e-pawn with a minimum of risk. It is not dangerous for either side but White's modest pawn-push brings up some important positional points. Instead of doing a systematic analysis I want to emphasize a few characteris tic types of positions that one should know to understand this variation. Before I even get to that, very inexperienced players might want take a look at 4 ... i.e7 (a slow move, but not a bad one) 5 'Dg5?! O-O 6 'Dxf7? .l:.xf7 7 i.xf7+ Rxf7. Few players who have built up playing experience with 1 e4 e5 would even consider such a trade for White, but those just starting out are often attracted to this CDg5/CDxf7 idea (which appears in many 1 e4 e5 openings, such as the Giuoco Piano, Goring Gambit and Ruy Lopez). It's important to know that in most chess openings, two pieces are better than rook and pawn, and usually the equal or better of a rook and two pawns, until there arises an ending or a considerably simpli fied position. Of course, that claim contradicts simple point-count chess (White has 6 or 7 points versus Black's 6). The explanation is that the minor pieces enter the action earlier and co ordinate better in attack and defence, especially on a crowded board. Keep in mind that rooks tend to get developed later and, more impor tantly, to get blocked off if there are too many pawns and pieces around. There are few excep tions to this. Thus 5 'Dg5 and 6 'Dxf7 are mis takes. However, you should know that in an end game with a rook and pawns versus bishop and knight, the latter will often have trouble defend ing each other at the same time as they attempt to hold off the pawns. The bishop and knight may do reasonably well if pawns are on the same side of the board, but if the rook is escort ing a pawn or two far from the opponent's king, the minor pieces will normally have a very hard time of it.

Without the opponent castling, this sacrifi cial idea doesn't work, so you can see why both sides tend to play h3 and ... h6 before castling! The old saw about not moving pawns in front of your king has many exceptions. In almost any opening, with 1 e4 or 1 d4, there are plenty of cases where either h3 or g3 will frustrate your opponent's attack. The same applies to ... h6 or ... g6, of course. White targets f7: 4 llJg5 4 tl:Bg5 (D) With this sortie White immediately breaks the rules about moving a piece twice in the opening before the other pieces are developed (and in this case most of White's pieces aren't). For that reason, 4 tl:Bg5 has been called a begin ner's move. Nevertheless, there have been thousands of master games with 4 tl:Bg5 for over a century, and several whole books have been devoted to precisely this position (not to men tion lengthy parts of other books and countless articles). The main point is that, principles not withstanding, Black has a difficult time defend ing f7 without making some kind of concession. White's philosophy is simple: if it works, play it! 4 ... d5 Black cuts off White's bishop with tempo while dramatically helping his central situation and freeing his c8-bishop for action. There are a number of alternatives over the next few moves that I won't be considering. One is the chaotic

4...

i.c5! ?, which has the idea 5 tl:Bxf7 i.xf2+ !? . This has been analysed in excruciating detail, often past 20 moves, by players and theoreti cians. Several experts seem to feel that playing 5 i.xf7+ instead of 5 tl:Bxf7 grants some advan tage. We'll leave the whole mess to them. In spite of the fascinating play that stems from this and other highly tactical sidelines, I shall mainly devote my attention to the main lines and in general the more strategic (and popular) continuations. Naturally the course of events after, say, 4 tl:Bg5 i.c5 or the wilder 4 d4 lines are instructive in the broader sense, conspicu ously so in the realm of attack. They are, how ever, singular in their nature, and the purpose of this book is not to pursue particularities of forc ing play but rather to broaden understanding of openings and tie them together wherever possi ble. 5 exd5 tl:Ba5! (D) Black continues to gain time for development by attacking the c4-bishop. He is willing to sac rifice a pawn to that end. The disorderly 5 ...b5 and 5 ... tl:Bd4 (sometimes transposing) fall into the same category as 4 ... i.c5. A more familiar line to inexperienced players is 5 ... tl:Bxd5, when 6 tl:Bxf7!? 'lt>xf7 7 'irVf3+ 'lt>e6 is known as the 'Fried Liver Attack'. According to theory this line, if properly played, can be defended by Black. White's other try, 6 d4!, has the similar idea 6 ... exd4 7 O-O i.e7 8 tl:Bxf7!, this time lead ing to an extremely strong attack, at least accord ing to the older theory. That's because White

TwO KNIGHTS DEFENCE 105

has more open lines. A lot of study will be re quired of anyone interested in these variations. But we're going to look at 5 ... ll'la5 because most good players choose that move, and be cause the resulting variations are marked by nu merous defined strategic and tactical themes that can teach us about the Open Games. 6 .i.bS+ This is White's point: he will stay a pawn ahead, having no pawn weaknesses himself. His knight may look a little funny out there on g5, but so does Black's on a5. Black has two moves here: 6 ... c6 and 6 ... .i.d7. Be forewarned that what follows is not a complete overview of the latest theory, but examples that will hope fully illuminate the issues involved. Interposition with the Pawn 6 •••c6!? Black sacrifices a pawn, but he gains another tempo by attacking White's bishop and thereby takes the initiative. 7 dxc6 bxc6 8 .i.e2 h6 9 ll'lf3 e4 10 lt'ieS .i.d6 (D) Of course there are legitimate alternatives for both sides along the way. For instance, White could have played Steinitz's 9 ll'lh3 or, instead of 10 ... .i.d6, both 10 ... 'iVd4 and 10 ... .i.c5 have fairly good reputations. But the position after 10 ... .i.d6 arises more frequently than any other. Black wants to use his space advantage and develop quickly by at tacking the e5-knight. Whatever happens, he's a pawn down and has to keep making active and/or forcing moves before White gets his pieces out. Black's first goal is to attack the king, with the hope that the cramping role of his e4-pawn will render White's defence difficult. If that pawn is exchanged, he will develop pressure down the d- and e-files. His only real problem is the wayward knight on a5, which he hopes to reposition by ... lt'Bb7 followed by ... lt'Bc5 or ... lt'Bd6. For his part, White wants to eliminate the e4- pawn. If he can't do that he can bypass the pawn and put his pieces on more active posts, for in stance by playing d4, .i.e3, lt'Bc3 (or lt'Bd2), and perhaps 'iVd2. In a real game all of these plans conflict. You can only get a feel for the ideas by looking at examples. Because of Black's open lines and pressure down the d-file, White will probably have to keep his pieces on passive squares while he unwinds. 11 f4!? Estrin - Levenfish Leningrad 1949 This pawn advance has a poor reputation be cause it weakens White's kingside, but the re sulting play is fairly balanced. One advantage is that White keeps his d-pawn; compare 11 d4 in the games that follow this one. ••. exf3 It's not strictly necessary to make this cap ture, but Black craves space and open lines in return for his pawn. 12 ll'lxf3 O-O 13 O-O 'iVc7 14 d4 c5!

This frees White's pieces to roam the board, in particular towards the kingside. ..i.e3!? (D) White modestly protects his centre before advancing pawns and exposing his own posi tion, but it may be too slow. White also has the aforementioned f3-f4-f5, although with Black's bishop on c5 that may not be easy to implement. For example, White can trade off kingside expansion for reduced central control by 10 f3 tbg5 11 ..i.e3, when

11...'iVe7 12 f4 tbe4 13 tbd2 or 11...O-O 12 tbc3

What is going on in this position? As usual, Black is counting upon his two bishops and ac tivity to compensate for his positional problems. Two KNIGHTS DEFENCE 113 He would like to move his bishop to b6 and then successfully achieve the advance ...c5. Given time, White would take advantage of the pawn structure by a combination of moves such as (in some order) f3, 'it'd2, lbc3-a4 and/or lbb3, dominating the board from c5 and rendering the bishops passive. That takes a few moves! 10• •• 'ii' e7! The side with the bishops often depends upon tactical niceties to avoid disadvantages. Now

7 Phil idor Defence

1 e4 e5 2 tl:Bf3 d6 (D)

The Philidor Defence has one virtue that few e4 e5 openings have: Black decides what opening is played! The underlying ideas of sur render of the centre in the Philidor were men tioned in Chapter 2; we'll explore them more thoroughly and even look at a wild counterat tacking scheme. Then we'll tum to a version of the Philidor that uses a strongpoint approach in one of its purest forms. The characteristic ideas behind this not-so-old-fashioned opening are extremely instructive and applicable to many other openings. The Philidor is not a frequent visitor to master chess but has a remarkable fol lowing of contemporary players who have used the defence extensively through the years. These include quite a few grandmasters, and even Ad ams and Azmaiparashvili have dabbled in the Philidor. Reaching back a few generations, Tigran Petrosian was probably the last World Champion who tried it out. It should be said, however, that most grand masters who want to play the 'strongpoint' ver sion of the Philidor Defence now use the order

3 i.c4 is often overlooked with respect to move-order issues. Then 3 ... tt:'Bf6!? 4 tt:'Bg5 d5 5 exd5 seems bothersome, although a serious ex amination reveals that Black has equality or stands only marginally worse after 5 ...h6 6 tt:'Bf3 e4!; for example, 7 tt:'Be5 (7 'it'e2 can be met by 7 ... i.e7 8 tt:'Be5 O-O {e.g., 9 O-O?! i.c5! } or 7 ... i.b4 !? 8 a3 !?

Nevertheless, Black normally plays 3 ... i.e7 4 d4 exd4 (4 ... tt:'Bd7? fails to 5 dxe5 lt:Jxe5 {5 ... dxe5 6 'V//i d5! } 6 tt:'Bxe5 dxe5 7 'ii' h5 g6 8 'V//i xe5) 5 tt:'Bxd4 tt:'Bf6 6 tt:'Bc3 O-O. However, this transposes into a 3 d4 exd4 line, which means that White has successfully pre-empted Black's strong point approach, that is, one in which Black plays ... tt:'ibd7 without ... exd4 (see the 'Strong point' section below). Thus Black may want to look into 3 ... tt:'Bf6. Otherwise, 3 i.c4 makes an other argument for the move-order 1 e4 d6 2 d4 tt:'Bf6 3 tt:'Bc3 e5. The first and obvious point is that Black has allowed White the greater share of the centre and blocked his own f8-bishop behind the d6- pawn, an unfortunate by-product of ...d6 but no terrible thing in itself. There are now two basic strategies that Black can pursue: surrender of the centre or making e5 a strongpoint. Surrender of the Centre

3. ..exd4 4 tt:'Bxd4

White has a reasonable alternative in 4 'V//i xd4, although this hasn't scored as well as it did in the 19th century after 4 ... tt:'Bf6 (4 ... a6 intending to gain time by ... tt:'Bc6 without being pinned by i.b5 has a respectable record; 4 ...tt:'Bc6?! 5 i.b5 is the original continuation that made 4 'V//i xd4 popular in the first place - after 5 ... i.d7 6 i.xc6 i.xc6 7 i.g5 with O-O-O soon to follow, White achieves considerable pressure) 5 tt:'Bc3 i.e7 6 i.g5 O-O 7 i.c4 tt:'Bc6 with equality. 4 •••tt:'Bf6 5 tt:'Bc3 ( D) 5 ... i.e7 (D) The alternate strategy of activity and poten tial attack begins with 5 ... g6, when White's most aggressive set-up is 6 f3 i.g7 7 i.e3 O-O 8 'V//i d2, as in a Sicilian Dragon. There usually fol lows 8 ... tt:'Bc6 9 g4 i.e6 10 O-O-O tt:'Bxd4 11 i.xd4. This is a position from which White has won many games (and thus discouraged 5 ... g6). Black could certainly use an open c-file, as in the Dragon. He does succeed in throwing his queenside pawns forward after l l ...c5 12 i..e3 'V/lia5 13 i.h6 i..xh6 14 'V//i xh6 b5! 15 i..xb5 .l:.ab8 16 a4 a6, yet 17 .l:.xd6! axb5 18 e5 gives a ferocious attack that has won several games for White. All this is difficult to improve upon. There have been scads of other attempts by Black but he still seems to be in search of a sat isfactory solution. At any rate I shall concen trate upon lines with ... i.e7. With 5 ... i.. e7, Black introduces a strategy that was explicated by Nimzowitsch: ...

O-O,

... .l:.e8, ... i..f8 and ... tt:'ibd7, both restraining and putting pressure on White's e-pawn. White has more space and can thwart a direct attack but still has to find a way to break down Black's defences without allowing his pieces to spring to life. This situation might remind you of similar positions in the King's Indian Defence, such as

I d4 tll f6 2 c4 g6 3 tll c3 .i.g7 4 e4 d6 5 tllf3 O-O 6 i..e2 e5 7 O-O exd4 8 tll xd4. In the case of the Philidor, White's c-pawn is on c2 (rather than c4, as in the King's Indian) and Black's bishop is on f8 (rather than g7). You could argue that in the King's Indian, White is more exposed in the centre (d4 is unsupported by pawns); but in the Philidor, Black's counterattacking chances are limited by his passively placed bishop on e 7. Check out what happens in the second game below! 6 .i.e2 White decides to go for a safe space advan tage.

It takes a born defender (with an opportunistic streak) to embrace this kind of position for Black, yet it is relatively solid. 6 ... O-O 7 O-O l:.e8 8 f4 (D)

With this move White commits to a pawn structure in which he restricts Black's pieces and increases his space advantage, but fails to support the e-pawn (as f3 does).

Black has insufficient forces to attack and has to play with the back ward d-pawn that we also see in the King's In dian Defence. But d6 is well-protected, which gives Black the leeway to turn his attention to the queenside; his main positive idea consists of attack on that wing based upon ...b5, with the idea that White's forces are tied to protecting against the freeing move . .. d5. For his part, White will develop, double on the d-file, and slowly increase the pressure.

This move stops ...b5, which would win much-needed space with tempo. The only good way to do without it is to play d5, intending to meet ... b5 with ... dxc6, a theme described be low. But in this position Black could merely work around the pawn by ... a5 and ... lt:Jc5, since dxc6 is comfortably answered by ... bxc6, con- trolling d5. What are Black's goals now? He will gener ally follow up with ... 'V/lic7 and/or ... .l:.e8, to bolster e5 while keeping a careful eye on the d6-pawn. Then we come to the point at which he needs to develop his queen's bishop. This may be prefaced by the safe moves ... h6, ... l:Ie8 and ... i.f8 (or even ... ctJf8), or Black may com mence immediately. If he is allowed to com plete the following plan he will usually have solved his problems: Black places his pawns on b6 and a6, his bishop on b7, and then advances with ...b5. With completed development and queenside play, he should stand well, especially since his ideas of ... b4 and central attack are by no means trivial to defend against. Then what is White to do? There are a num ber of answers depending upon one's style of play and the specifics of the position. He has the challenge of breaking down Black's defences, and this time there is no open file or backward pawn to focus upon. However, at the point that Black plays ... b6 (and before ... i.b7) he is vul nerable to the move d5, since capturing will leave White in possession of the key outpost on d5. If Black already has ... .i.b7 in before White

plays d5, then Black has better chances of mak ing a favourable mass-exchange upon that square. The game will hang upon whether ex changes and simplification leave White any thing at all, or whether he can stifle Black's counterplay by other means. There are three standard alternatives to d5: a) b3 and ..i.b2 or ..i.a3; b) a5, to hamper Black's queenside plans; and c) tl:Bh4-f5. Incidentally, this kind of analysis suggests that Black's plan would be even more effective were White's bishop on e2 or fl, where it is of ten placed.

8 Ruy Lopez

1 e4 e5 2 lll

f3 lll c6 3 ..llb5 ( D) These moves constitute the Ruy Lopez, aptly called the 'King of Openings'. It has domi nated 1 e4 e5 chess for more than 100 years and is considered the best chance for White to gain the advantage in the play that follows 2 ... lllc6. Thereupon hangs the popularity of 1 e4 itself, no small burden for a single move to bear. What's the point of 3 ..llb5? One's first in stinct is that it threatens 4 ..llxc6 followed by 5 lllxe5, but Black's most popular answer 3 ... a6 shows that not to be the case, at least not imme diately. Then of course White wants to castle quickly. But then why do most players use 3 ..llb5 instead of the more aggressive-looking 3 ..llc4, which hits Black's weak f7-pawn? The answer is that 3 ..llb5 is a prophylactic move that works to squelch the opponent's opportuni ties. If you look at the main lines after 3 ..llc4, for instance, it turns out that Black's key defen sive/counterattacking move in a majority of cases is ... d5 (as in most variations after 1 e4 e5), attacking the bishop and establishing him self in the centre. But putting a bishop on b5 ei ther prevents or discourages that move. Let's see how this works in a few simple cases. Obvi ously, the immediate 3 ... d5? is bad due to 4 exd5 'i1Vxd5 5 lllc3 with a terrible loss of time for Black. But what if Black imitates his re sponse to 3 ..llc4 by playing as follows? 3 ... a6 4 ..lla4 b5 5 ..llb3 ( D) After all, White is on the same diagonal as after 3 ..llc4 and Black has a couple of extra moves in ... a6 and ... b5 that may help his posi tion or at least not hurt it. The answer is that the move ...d5 can no lon ger be played with tempo, which negatively im pacts both of Black's normal defences after 3 ..llc4. That consideration overrides all others, as we can see from the following discussion (see Chapters 5 and 6 on 3 ..llc4 if you need to). First, compare the old line 3 ..llc4 lllf6 4 d4 (notice that after 4 lllc3, Black has the excellent response 4 ... lll xe4! 5 lll xe4 d5, whereas this would be a blunder with White's bishop on b3) 4... exd4 5 e5, when 5 ... d5 ! gains a critical tempo. Not so with a bishop on b3 instead of c4. Then, look at other main-line defence to 3 ..llc4, i.e. 3 ... ..llc5 4 c3 lllf6 5 d4 exd4 6 cxd4 (6 e5 d5 !) 6 ... ..llb4+ 7 ..lld2 ..llxd2+ 8 lll bxd2 d5 ! 9 exd5 lllxd5 with equality; the Ruy Lopez prevents such solutions, as I'll show below for clarity's sake.

5. .. ..llc5

The equivalent of the Two Knights Defence would go 5 ... lllf6 6 d4! (D) (6 lllg5 is probably no improvement upon the main 3 ..llc4 lllf6 lines, but this is strong):

RUY LOPEZ 123

6 ... exd4 (after 6 ... lllxe4 7 dxe5 White threat ens 'i1Vd5 and ..llxf7+, so Black needs to play 7 ... lllc5, when 8 ..\ld5 retains the bishop and es tablishes the superior position - the e5-pawn cramps Black's game) 7 e5 lllg4 (there's no ...d5 response!) 8 O-O and White threatens h3 and .l:!.el. A sample line might be 8 ... ..llb4 (pre venting .l:!.el ; 8 ... lllgxe5?? loses to 9 lllxe5 lllxe5 10 .l:!.el d6 11 f4) 9 c3 (or 9 ..lld5 threatening h3) 9 ... dxc3 10 bxc3 ..llc5 11 'i1Vd5!

f6 7 d4 exd4 8 e5! Were White's bishop on c4, Black would have the resource ... d5! at this point. Instead the knight has to move and lose time. For instance:

8.••llle4

8 ... lllg4 9 cxd4 ..llb4+ 10 lllc3 and White chases the knights with h3 followed in some cases by d5. 9 ..lld5! (D) White's move serves not j ust to attack the al most-trapped e4-knight, but also to stop ... d5. That's the consistent theme involved in an early ..llb3. 9 ...f5 Black can try the somewhat cheap win of three pawns for a piece by 9 ... lllxf2?! 10 'it>xf2 dxc3+, but after 11 'it>g3! White connects rooks and threatens 12 ..llxf7+ 'it>xf7 13 'i1Vd5+. Thus Black is stuck with 1 l...cxb2 12 ..llxb2 O-O 13 lllc3! (or 13 h4) 13 ... ..llb7 14 llle4 ..lle7 15 'i1Vd2 and White dominates the board. His king is un touchable, and in general three pawns aren't worth a minor piece this early in the game (un less two or three of them are passed and moder ately advanced). When you factor in White's activity and far superior development, the as sessment is clear. 10 cxd4 ..llb4+ ll lllbd2 Black can't even castle, but White will play O-O and gain a very large advantage. For the record, Black can try to j ustify 1 e4 e5 2 lllf3 lllc6 3 ..llb5 a6 4 ..lla4 b5 5 ..llb3 with the odd move 5 .. . llla5!? (the 'Norwegian Varia tion'), based upon 6 lllxe5 lllxb3 7 axb3 'i1Vg5, etc. But simply 6 O-O d6 7 d4 is thought to give White the advantage. Returning to 3 ..llb5, we have seen one local ized reason for preferring 3 ..llb5 over 3 ..llc4. But what characterizes the Ruy Lopez itself? Since each opening variation that begins on move 3 is so different in attributes, we cannot speak of the 'nature' of the Ruy Lopez without referring to specific systems. The most interest ing way to approach the subject is to take a somewhat impressionistic historical look. In the early days of the Ruy Lopez we saw some understandable experimentation with moves such as 3 ... llld4 and 3 ... f5, both still playable today but on the very margins of legitimacy. As positional concepts solidified, the great masters of the late 19th and early 20th centuries drifted towards 1 e4 e5 2 lll f3 lllc6 3 ..llb5 d6, which is featured in the games of Steinitz, Lasker, Capa blanca and many others. Without taking the time to examine that variation (an exercise that is well worth it), I can't demonstrate its draw backs; but the crucial thing to remember is that Black will immediately or eventually be forced to surrender the centre by means of ... exd4 in

play defensively until he can't protect against every breakthrough on both wings. This game program is what's glibly referred to as the 'Spanish Torture'. We shall see how White's plans evolve when we inspect the individual Closed variations below. In its general con tours, by the way, the above description also applies to the Open Ruy Lopez: White tries to keep Black's dynamism under control and then switches to a gradual augmentation of his posi tional advantages. Let's look at the moves that introduce the Closed Ruy Lopez:

1 e4 e5 2 lll

f3 lllc6 3 i.b5 a6 4 i.a4 We'll see the Exchange Variation with 4 i.xc6 dxc6 later on. Note that after 5 lllxe5 'i1Vd4 Black recovers his pawn. Thus if White's e-pawn becomes protected, the capture on e5 may become a threat. 4• .•lll f6 ( D) We saw the move 4 ... b5 above. With this flexible continuation, Black threat ens White's important e-pawn before deciding upon the development of his other pieces.

5 O-O

For example, the passive 5 d3 allows Black to become more aggressive without much risk:

5... b5 (notice that since e4 is covered, i.xc6 and

lllxe5 has become a threat; however, 5 ... i.c5 is another legitimate move-order, since 6 i.xc6 dxc6 7 lllxe5? loses to 7 ... 'i1Vd4 - both f2 and the e5-knight hang) 6 i.b3 i.c5 7 O-O (7 lllxe5 lllxe5 8 d4 i.xd4 { 8 ... lllxe4!? 9 dxc5 i.b7 10 O-O 'i1Vf6 is also possible} 9 'i1Vxd4 d6 leaves Black a full tempo up on the Meller Variation; we devote a section to that variation below) 7 ... d6. Black has his bishop outside his pawn chain and stands solidly. Of course, there's much more that can be said about 5 d3, but in general White would rather wait a move or two until he sees what his opponent is up to. 5 •.• i.e7 The first major decision about how Black will set his position up. After 5. .. b5 6 i.b3, 6 ... i.c5 is the Meller Variation, examined in depth later; and 6 ... i.b7 is called the Arkhangelsk, a varia tion which I won't be investigating. The main alternative is 5. .. lllxe4, the important Open Vari ation, which reaches its standard position after

with ... c5, and then adopted a strongpoint policy by defending e5. He feels that an immediate ex change on d4 would amount to a surrender of the centre and puts that idea on hold with l 1 ...'i1Vc7. However, White must constantly watch over po tential central exchanges, a situation that Black hopes will limit his opponent's free develop ment. After l 1...'i1Vc7, Black will generally try to bring his pieces out slowly before taking any drastic action in the centre. There are some drawbacks to this strategy. The first has to do with finding a useful, posi tive plan. Exerting pressure down the c-file is natural but generally White can defend the crit ical squares. Often Black will have to bring enough pieces to bear that a capture or two on d4 will make White's centre vulnerable. At that point White can implement his own ideas. He can exchange pawns on c5 and try to exploit the d5-square, or he can play d5 and then attack on the wings, sometimes by means of a4 and some times by piece-play on the kingside. In general White has the choice of developing his pieces or closing the centre. Black's biggest problem tends to be his knight on a5. He can return it to c6, of course, but that consumes time and can provoke a timely d5. Furthermore, White's d5 advance in and of itself can keep the a5-knight out of play. At that point ... lllc4-b6 isn't bad, but it shows up an underlying problem with ... c5 combined with ... e5: a pawn on d5 can't be undermined by ... c6. We shall come back to the idea of omitting ...'i1Vc7. For the moment, here are two sample games which illustrate the classic Chigorin po sition:

lvanchuk - Graf Merida 2004 12 lllbd2 (D)

:ds This is a flexible move. It discourages White from playing dxe5 and leaves the bishop on the c8-h3 diagonal for now in anticipation of d5. We shall see 1 2 ... cxd4 in the next game, with a note on 1 2. .. lll c6. 13 b3! Also flexible: White keeps Black's knight out of c4 and would like to make simple moves such as i.b2 and :c 1. Although it seems ob scure at this point, b3 can also work with the moves a4 and i.d3, which are designed to tar get b5 - watch for this theme in other games with the Closed Ruy Lopez.

13. .. i.d7

Black sometimes plays ... i.b7 instead of ... i.d7, but in the former case he should ex change in the centre first, because of 1 3 ... i.b7 1 4 d5! (D). This gives White almost everything that he could want from advancing his pawn, a com mittal decision that sometimes releases the pressure on Black's game. Let's consider this position. Black's bishop is badly placed on b7 because its scope is limited by White's pawn chain and unfortunately the move .. .f5 is no where in sight. Thus Black will play ... i.c8 and probably ... i.d7 with loss of time. What about that knight on a5? Right now it has no moves whatsoever because of White's pawns on b3 and d5; as a rule if Black permits White to play d5 it's a good idea to have the move ... lllc4 in

128 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

hand. Then even if the knight is driven away, b6 is a good place from which to keep an eye on White's a4 break, and Black reserves pros pects of ... lllbd7. However, in the diagram (af ter 13 ... ..llb7 14 d5), Black will have to move his bishop in order to reroute the knight to the uninspiring b7. From that square, alas, it is blocked from moving by the pawns on d6 and c5. Notice that if Black plays ...c4 and White plays b4, the situation is even worse. All right, it's a closed position and perhaps the knight can make just one more move from b7 to become useful, i.e . ... lll d8. But again, it is completely restricted, this time by White's d5-pawn! Even in a closed position, all this reorganization to little effect gives White plenty of time to pre pare and launch an attack. The moral of the story is that with a bishop on b7, Black should almost always play ... cxd4 and perhaps even ...exd4 once the restrictive move b3 is in. Apart from that, both sides need to develop a feeling about whether to play/allow d5 if c4 is still available to the knight and/or Black's bishop is placed on d7 in support of the queenside. These decisions are terribly difficult and greatly as sisted by playing experience with the opening. 14 lll fl lllc6?! Black gets into trouble after this. 14 ... cxd4 1 5 cxd4 :ac8 looks better.

Polgar - Acs Hoogeveen 2002 12 lllbd2 cxd4 Black opens up the position to get some breathing room. 1 2 ... lllc6 is really asking for White to play dxc5, a Fischer favourite which intends lllfl e3-d5. If practice i s any guide, this general plan causes little trouble for Black. Even in this fa vourable form for White (because the c6-knight is exposed to a recapture on d5), Black can ap parently hold the balance: 1 3 dxc5 dxc5 14 lllfl i.e6 (not a move that Black would like t o make but he has to rush to cover d5) 15 llle3 :ad8 1 6 'i1Ve2 c4 1 7 lllf5 ( 1 7 lllg5 looks attractive but 1 7 ... h6 ! 18 lllxe6 fxe6 gives equality - another case of the doubled e-pawns!) 17 ... .l:!.fe8 ! 1 8 i.g5 lll d7 1 9 i.xe7 lllxe7 20 lllg5 h6!?

In the game Black should now have played

lllc5 ! 23 lllg4 lllc6 with at least equality. 13 cxd4 i.d7 14 lll fl (D) This is the standard Ruy Lopez manoeuvre that has been popular ever since Steinitz started playing it in variations with d3 instead of d4. White's knight will either go to e3, eyeing d5 and f5 (while protecting c2), or to g3 where it covers f5 and protects the e-pawn (this discour ages ... exd4), while leaving the c l-bishop a good view of the kingside. Such meanderings are ordinarily only possible in a closed position or in one with a stable centre. ••• .l:!.ac8 15 llle3 lllc6 16 ..llb3!?

Black of course hopes that the new weakness of c4 may provide him compensation. Whether or not 1 6 d5 i s good, White opts here for activating the light-squared bishop and keeping lines open.

13 tt:Jn Ponomariov - Gyimesi Moscow 2005 At this juncture White has played some fun damentally different ideas such as 1 3 b4, 1 3 b3 and 13 a4. In the last case, for example, 13 ... i.f8 can be answered by 14 i.d3 aiming at the queenside. In fact, White's main advantage in these lines is that if he can prevent any radical central action by Black, he can exert pressure on both wings. Generally White gains a limited edge if that happens, but nothing that allows him to exceed a normal percentage score; e.g.,

14. .. c6 15 b3 g6 1 6 l1Vc2 (often you'll see Black

Notice how the modern Breyer seems to do best when Black can successfully implement the 'blow it all to bits' strategy as opposed to the 'cleverly shift around' method of defence. That said, the latter can also be sat isfactory with very accurate play.

We've switched back to Keres-style play! 17 ...c6 is the positional option which has in mind an eventual ... d5, and may be preferable.

Of course Black can deviate at that point and play another defence to the Lopez, such as 1 2. ..h6 intending to enter a very similar but less immediately ag gressive system by 1 3. .. l:!.e8 and 1 4. .. i.f8. That sequence is sometimes named after Smyslov. As for White, he can play 1 1 CDg5 l::t f8 1 2 f4, which originally was thought to deter Black from Zaitsev's move-order, but this is now con sidered fine for Black after 1 2. ..exf4, and enter prising players will most likely prefer l 2 ...exd4 1 3 cxd4 d5 14 e5 'be4!, in view of 1 5 'bxe4?! dxe4 1 6 l:!.xe4 'ba5, when Black will follow up by ...

It's now customary for Black to bring a knight to d3 and White to swing his rook to g3 in this line; what counts are the specific tactics and one's skill in carrying them out. Contrary to the impression given by this game, there's a fair amount of room for original play in even these critical Zaitsev lines, and the odds of the aver age player or even a master reaching something this theoretical are extremely low. Which is to say that the Zaitsev is still a fun system, both in the tactical variations and in the positional con tinuations given above. 18 exf5 A more famous and exciting contest from the same match went 1 8 l::t ae3 'bf6 1 9 ctJh2 ! ?

This changes the entire character of the game. Notice how, as in the Breyer Defence, Black retains the option of playing ...c6 to break up White's centre.

The problem is that he must devote all his resources to this effort and allow other equalizing methods. Here are a couple of ways in which this dilemma plays out:

RUY LOPEZ 141

if Black manages to create a successful strong point defence by ...d6 with his bishop outside the pawn-chain, then he has the best of both worlds. The M0ller has enjoyed a great revival among the world' s best players over the past ten years or so. You can imagine how liberating it feels to live for once without that passive bishop on e7 ! But along with his advantages, Black is presented with a few challenges. Con cretely, White has the fork trick 7 ctJxe5 CLixe5 8 d4. Then, on a positional level, White's i.g5 can pin the f6-knight and it can't be unpinned by ... i.e7. It also turns out that Black' s queen side is difficult to protect, much as in the Closed variations but more awkwardly because the bishop gets in the way. Perhaps most impor tantly, Black has to be careful that, if his attack ing ambitions are frustrated, he isn't left with a forlorn bishop cut off from the action on b6. 7 a4! White can also play the critical variation 7 CLixe5 CLixe5 8 d4, forcing Black into 8 ... i.xd4 9 iVxd4 d6 (D). For years everyone assumed that this was a grave drawback to 6 ... i.c5. It gives White the two bishops and the greater share of the centre. It turns out, however, that Black's remaining pieces have great scope and are very well-placed to attack the key e4 point. First, ... c5-c4 is threatened, winning the bishop, and that threat gives Black time to develop his pieces aggres sively. Here are just a couple of lines: a) 10 c3 c5 (or 10 ... i.b7) 1 1 iVe3 O-O 12 ctJd2 l::t e8 1 3 f3 i.b7, as in Kholmov-Lomineishvili, Moscow 1 997, illustrates how Black can use his active pieces to take the initiative.

Now we're leaving the realm of Black's 1 st-3rd rank manoeuvring in favour of staking a full claim to the centre. Perhaps be cause of this assertive posture, the Open Ruy has been the playground for some of the sharp est tacticians in history. As always, you'll have to be careful about the move-orders, which we'll cover in the next few notes. For instance, the inverted moves 5 ...b5 6 .Jlb3 lt:Jxe4?! can run into 7 a4! (D). Instead, 7 d4 d5 transposes to the main line, and 7 l:.el d5 8 lt:Jc3 lt:Jxc3 9 dxc3 .Jle6 1 0 a4 b4 1 1 a5 ! ? is a recurring tactical idea: White threatens .Jla4 and then lt:Jxe5. This is some what unclear but difficult for Black. We've seen the power of a4 throughout the Ruy Lopez, and it especially applies to the Open Variation. After 7 a4, the play might go: a) 7 ... b4 8 .l:Iel d5 9 d3 lt:Jf6 10 a5 ! . b ) 7 .. . .Jlb7 8 .l:Iel lt:Ja5 9 .Jla2 and White has ideas of d3 or d4 and lt:Jg5. c) 7 ... l:.b8 8 axb5 axb5 9 .l:Iel d5 10 lt:Jc3 !, and now, for example, 10. .. lt:Jxc3 1 1 dxc3 .Jle6 1 2 .l:Ia6 �d7 1 3 .l:Ixc6! �xc6 1 4 lt:Jxe5 �c5 ( 1 4. .. �d6 1 5 .Jlf4) 1 5 lt:Jxf7 !

Black announces that he is playing dynamically and will steer clear of those protracted positional struggles that we have seen above (often with no exchanges in the first 20 moves). Neverthe less, the Open Ruy has a great number of con sistent positional features, more so than the average attacking system. Already the funda mental question arises: tactics apart, what is each side playing for? In the positional phase,

We now return to 4 ... dxc6 (D):

5 O-O

The first basic idea of the Exchange Variation is that White has the superior pawn-structure, and that he will sooner or later exchange his d pawn for Black's e-pawn, establishing a 4:3 pawn-majority on the kingside. He hopes to win a simplified position by using that majority to create a passed pawn, whereas Black's 4:3 majority is 'crippled' and incapable of doing the same thing. Consequently, White will tend to win the vast majority of pure king-and-pawn endings. However, there's a lot more going on here. First of all, Black possesses the bishop-pair, which can be in and of itself compensation for a weakness. Then I think there's a rule of thumb in his favour: usually the earlier in the game that one side establishes an 'advantage in the long run' such as doubled, backward, or iso lated pawns, the less likely it is to last into the endgame, or cause harm if it does persist that far. In large part this is due to the fact that the opponent has more time to adjust to the prob lem and solve it directly or find counterplay. With that in mind, one can imagine that having more pieces on the board favours the side with the weaknesses. And that's where a hypotheti cal problem arises: it may not seem vital at first, but White has a lead in development. This means that he can sometimes control the dis position of forces and arrive at the kind of po sition in which Black will be compelled to exchange pieces. If the pawn-structure isn't changed thereby, White comes closer to the sort of endgame that he would prefer. In my ob servation, however, the 4:3 endgame advantage very seldom arises in games between strong players. In reality it is just as likely that Black's bishops and active play will effect some struc tural change along the way. However, barring favourable exchanges (and it takes a lot of them before a true endgame will come into view), White may still be able to use his lead in devel opment and in some cases his greater control of territory to build up his forces and break through in the centre before Black is ready for it. That seems to be the more common way in which White makes progress. Conversely, the varia tions in which Black successfully restrains White's central pawns or the ones in which he develops rapidly have proven the most effective in equalizing. This brings us to the difference between White's more modem move 5 O-O and the tradi tional 5 d4. The latter move has a certain logic, because White needs to disturb his opponent's game before Black can secure his position and find roles for his bishops. But after 5 d4 exd4 6 'i*'xd4 (6 lbxd4 c5 is easy for Black, because af ter the exchange of queens, the two bishops can

Given that cir cumstance, we're down to the effectiveness of the two bishops versus the potential advantages of White's pawn-structure. Let's see: 7 ... i.d7! (the idea is to get castled quickly, bringing the rook to the open d-file, and perhaps play ...c5 and ... i.c6; 7 ... c5 is a good alternative; on the other hand 7 ... i.d6!? commits Black to a par- ticular development; then 8 ctJc3 ctJe7 9 O-O O-O 1 0 f4 Ile8 1 1 lbb3 f6 1 2 f5 ! ? b6 1 3 i.f4 is the famous game Lasker-Capablanca, St Petersburg 1 9 14, in which Black was probably not worse but he had to defend accurately and lost) 8 i.e3 O-O-O 9 lbd2 (9 lbc3 i.b4) 9 ... lbe7 (9 ...c5 1 0 lbe2 b 6 sets up a structure that Black normally likes, because it is sound and makes room on c6 for a bishop or knight; for instance, 1 1 O-O-O lbe7 1 2 ctJc4 lbc6 with equality) 10 O-O-O lbg6 ( 1 0 .. .f6 1 1 f3 ctJg6 1 2 h4 h5 1 3 ctJc4 c5 1 4 ctJf5 i.e6 is solid and equal, if uninspiring, Miles Karpov, Biel 1 992) 1 1 h3 Ile8 1 2 .l:thel i.d6 1 3 lbe2 f5 !? 14 exf5 ctJh4 1 5 ctJc4?

You can see how easy Black's play is after 5 d4 and why 5 O-O (D), to which we now return, is generally preferred. After 5 O-O Black can choose among a wide array of defences, but most of them offer White good prospects for advantage. We'll focus on three that hold their own, and follow a few games (with a number of imbedded excerpts) in order to get a close feel for the ideas. 5••• i.d6 Milu - Vajda Bucharest 1995 This modest and logical development bol sters e5 and retains options for the knight and c8-bishop. It keeps the game interesting but is also non-forcing; thus it offers White more op portunities to create trouble for his opponent than the other two moves under consideration.

White should develop as rapidly as possible. as explained above, and he also wants Black to play ...exd4 to establish his 4:3 kingside major ity. Black's bishops would find the time to de velop smoothly after 6 d3 ctJe7; for example. 7 i.e3 O-O 8 lbbd2 (8 c3 ! ?) 8 ...f6 9 a3 (probably White would be better off with 9 c3 or 9 l0c4. although in the latter case Black might cause the same kind of problems by 9 ... i.g4) 9 ... c5 l 0 lbc4 i.g4 l l b4? cxb4 1 2 lbxd6 cxd6 1 3 h3 ( 13 axb4 f5 ! and the f3-knight is in trouble) 1 3. .. i.xf3 14 'iVxf3 bxa3 1 5 .l:tfbl b5, Ungu reanu-Flear, Lenk 1 992.

'iVh4!?) 8 i.e3 O-O intends ...f5, a double-edged move that is good in a position like this because it opens lines; e.g., 9 lbc3 f5 1 0 exf5 lbxf5 1 1 lbxf5 i.xf5 with free and easy development. You can see that White's kingside majority is no longer a relevant factor.

7 ... f6 (D) An unfortunate necessity versus e5 which puts White even further ahead in development. However, if Black gets just a few moves to con solidate by ... ti'Je7-g6 and ... i..e6, he'll control e5 and stand well positionally. We looked briefly at this position in Chap ter 2 when discussing the vanished centre. As explained there, static factors are temporarily more important than dynamic ones, although that might change at any moment. White would like to make inroads before Black can stabilize the position. Given time, the bishop-pair might begin to assert itself. White's other option is to eliminate one of the bishops, probably the one on d6; he can hardly stand worse in that case but the time it takes to achieve this will usually let Black equalize or come very close to doing so. 8 i.. e3 A flexible move that develops without com mitting the bl -knight. Alternatively: a) 8 e5 fxe5 9 ti'Jxe5 lets Black catch up in development again: 9 ... ti'Jf6 (or 9 ...

Black's pawn-struc ture is the equal of White's. The moral for Black is to get on with his development and force the pace. b) The most common move by quite a mar gin is 8 ti'Jbd2.

However, I think that this is the exception and not the rule, and that the most important lesson of these examples as a whole is that Black usually has the where withal either to change the pawn-structure or otherwise to create counterplay in return for his doubled c-pawns. As indicated above, the way that White usu ally gets the edge in practice is by exploiting his development and space to create some other type of advantage, even if it means straighten ing out Black's pawns. White can often succeed in doing this and give himself real chances; whether he can achieve enough to win the game is another matter. Also, some of Black's early options deserve attention. 5 ... i.g4 (D) This is the most radical move and the one that was originally thought to be the most seri ous problem with 5 O-O. Now 6 d4 loses a pawn, and slow moves allow, for example, ... 'iVf6 and ...O-O-O and/or ... i.c5. Thus White prefers to attack the black bishop right away.

For all that, White shouldn't feel overconfident: years ago, Blatny tried 1 1 ...tt:.lb6 followed by ... c5 and ... .Bd6; this deserves some attention. Of course, Black needn't gambit; he usually plays 8 ... .Bb7 9 d3 (D). After this modest protection of the e-pawn, White has several methods of arranging his pieces. For example, he can divorce himself

160 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

entirely from the Closed Ruy lines by lbc3, per haps to be followed by lbd5. He can play c3, in more or less traditional fashion (ctJd2-fl might follow). Or he has .Be3 followed by ctJd2, con templating d4. What has become the main line goes 9 ...d6 (even the active 9 ... .Bc5 has been played here, reacting to White' s slow develop ment, but Black's main alternative is 9 ...Ile8; e.g., 1 0 lbc3 .Bb4!? 1 1 ctJg5 .l:tf8 1 2 a3 .Bxc3 1 3 bxc3 lba5 1 4 .Ba2 c5 1 5 f4 exf4 1 6 e5 ctJd5 1 7 .Bxd5 'iVxg5 1 8 .Bxb7 1/z-1/z Kramnik-Leko, Brissago Wch (2) 2004) IO a3 (D).

The minute that Black defends his e-pawn, he is free to play ... lba5 and rid himself of White's active bishop. With 1 0 a3, White gives the bishop a square to drop back to. This con trasts with the customary set-up with c3 and .Bc2. Now Black has been playing 1 O ... lba5 (although world-class players are playing this way, I really wonder about the wisdom of set ting up a Chigorin structure with ...c5 and ced ing the d5-square; the logical 10. ..

(Black plays the familiar rerouting move with his bishop even though there's no pawn on d5 - his idea is to play the also-familiar ... .Be6 and challenge White to exchange; early success often leads to repetition and I suspect that other moves will become more popular here) 1 4 c3 ( 1 4 ctJe3 .Be6 15 .Bd5 !, as in Sutovsky-Beliav sky, Gothenburg Echt 2005, is interesting and perhaps even favourable for White; for the mo ment these h3/d3 set-ups are still producing some original positions) 1 4. .. .Be6 1 5 .Bxe6 fxe6

It's amusing that in a very similar position from this h3/d3 variation, the move ... .Be6 is al most never answered by .Bxe6, whereas here the world's best players have done so repeat edly. As explained in the introductory chapters, there is no rule about when to double Black's pawns. Sometimes the lack of central mobility after ... fxe6 is debilitating; and other times the extra squares that are covered by the e6-pawn make it worth it for Black.

The starting position for the main lines of the Marshall Attack. Essentially, the idea for Black is to move pieces to the kingside and check mate, whereas White wants to prevent that and remain a pawn ahead! It's not quite that simple, of course. For example, Black will usually gain some advantage in the centre as well, so that even if White beats back the attack and remains a pawn ahead, the game will often be drawn. Black's initial attack is based upon exploiting the light-square weaknesses that White will have to create in order to fend off mate. And White's defence will often consist of counterat tacks that involve the sacrifice of material. At the very least he will try to open queenside lines with a4 and axb5, hoping for Ila6 or Ila7. Still, the action is mainly on the kingside. When I opened a book on the Marshall At tack and looked at the first paragraph of the first chapter, I learned that for the 'old main line' (which is still extremely popular), "the real

9 Ki ng's Gambit

I e4 e5 2 f4 (D) With the move 2 f4 we come to the King's Gambit, opening of the great romantics of the 1 9th century. It is associated with wild attacks and sacrifices of pieces, with each side focused firmly upon their opponent's king. In modem times, however, it has become commonplace to describe the King's Gambit as an opening that has taken on a simplifying character and leans towards the endgame. Neither of these descrip tions is very relevant to today's play, because most if not all of the great attacking lines have been neutralized and the early transition into endgames is a relatively unusual occurrence, given publicity by just a few older games involv ing well-known players. Although the King's Gambit has no fixed disposition, modem play ers interpret it primarily in a positional manner, with sudden outbreaks of irrationality. Why would White play 2 f4? For a few fun damental reasons: a) It tries to exchange a flank pawn for a central pawn, thereby giving White a central majority. This is no small achievement, as we see in numerous openings ranging from the Queen's Gambit to the Sicilian Defence. b) After either one of the moves ...exf4 or fxe5, White gains the open f-file. This dovetails nicely with quick development by means of the moves tbf3, .tc4 and O-O. In the best of worlds, White might even get d4 and .txf4 in, estab lishing the elementary picture of ideal piece placement. c) The traditionally weak f7-square (which is guarded only by the king) is a target both from a bishop on c4 and the rook on the newly opened f-file. Of course, Black has something to say about these grandiose plans. In the King's Gambit Declined with 2 ... .tc5 we see that the a7-gl di agonal has been ceded, making castling diffi cult. We shall look at that in detail, because it expresses some common ideas and illustrates the dynamic imbalance that the King's Gambit can still give rise to. Varied problems occur after the most fre quently played move 2 ...exf4, called the King's Gambit Accepted. It's interesting that when he accepts the pawn, Black's defences all seem to involve one or both of two moves: a) The advance ... g5. This protects the f4- pawn and claims a material advantage, with the additional benefit of blocking off the aforemen tioned f-file. The g-pawn can also advance fur ther to g4 (or be forced to advance), when it may win time by attacking a knight on f3 and has other possibilities including the common idea of ... f3, disturbing White's pawn-structure and introducing some tactical ideas if White opens lines by gxf3 and exposes his king. b) As might be expected, ...d5 is an ideal freeing move (as in almost all double e-pawn openings). In particular, after White plays exd5, this allows Black to place his knight on f6 with out being harassed by e5. It also frees the c8- bishop, gives the queen room, opens the often useful e-file, and gives Black a comfortable square for his king's bishop on d6, protecting the gambit pawn. That's quite a bit for one move, but naturally things don't go as smoothly as Black would have it either.

KING 'S GAMBIT 167

Now we'll look at two illustrative variations out of the many that have been thought up by both sides over the years. One is the main line of the King's Gambit Declined, the other the 'Modem Defence' to the King's Gambit Ac cepted. King's Gambit Declined

1 e4 e5 2 f4 i.cS (D)

If one wants to decline the King's Gambit, 2 ... i.c5 has to be the most logical way, taking over the critical g 1 -a7 diagonal and preventing White from castling. It certainly leads to com plicated and challenging play. A couple of other ways to forego acceptance are 2 ... tbc6 3 tbf3 f5 !? and 2 ... Wkh4+ 3 g3 Wke7, both plausible and requiring some preparation. Note that 2 ...tbf6?! 3 fxe5 tbxe4 4 tbf3 leaves Black's knight stranded in the middle of the board, as well as securing a central majority. In one game Black made the best of a bad situation by 4 ... tbg5 ! 5 d4 (5 c3 tbxf3+ 6 Wkxf3; 5 i.c4 ?? tbxf3+ 6 Wkxf3 Wkh4+ and ... Wkxc4) 5 ... tbxf3+ 6 Wkxf3 Wkh4+ 7 Wkf2 (to protect d4) 7 ... Wkxf2+ 8 @xf2 d6, when 9 exd6 ! i.xd6 1 0 tbc3 c6 (ver sus tZ'Bb5) 1 1 tbe4 i.c7 1 2 .td3 would have se cured White a small but persistent edge. 3 tZ'Bf3 Almost always played. For one thing, Black was threatening 3 ... .txgl 4 l:txgl Wkh4+ 5 g3 Wkxh2, and 3 fxe5?? Wkh4+ is a blunder of major proportions. 3 ... d6 This time White was threatening tbxe5, but 3 ... tbc6? doesn't protect the pawn due to 4 fxe5 tbxe5?? 5 tbxe5 WVh4+ 6 g3 Wkxe4+ 7 Wke2 Wkxhl 8 tbg6+ tbe7 9 tbxh8 and White will win. After 3 ...d6, White has two basic options, 4 tbc3 and 4 c3: Piece-Play 4 tbc3 tbf6 4 ... tbc6?! is an inaccurate move-order as it allows 5 i.b5 ! , when Black's centre is under pressure. 5 i.c4 White doesn't get mated after 5 fxe5 dxe5 6 tbxe5?! Wkd4! 7 tbd3 i.b6, but Black has a bind and very quick development for the pawn; e.g.,

White still can't castle! But Black has to watch out too. For instance, an unfavourable pawn-structure follows 6 ... O-O? 7 f5 ! with the idea .tg5 or in some cases g4-g5. However, after the main continuation 6 ... .tg4, 7 f5?! is a mistake because 7 ... tbh5 ! threatens ... tbd4, and there is hardly a good way to re spond. White has at least two other candidates. I'll try to present the main ideas without even dreaming of covering the complicated theory associated with this position. 7 h3 Chigorin - Pillsbury Hastings I 895 A note on 7 tba4 follows the game.

1 70 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

At this point we have an important alterna tive, as well as our usual move-order discus sion. It begins with the move 2 ...d5 ! (or ' ? ' if, as Black, you would like to get to the Kieseritzky Gambit below) 3 exd5, and now 3 ... e4 (D) is the Falkbeer Counter-Gambit. Black's idea in the Falkbeer is to cramp White's development. White's extra pawn on d5 is not impressively-placed anyway. The prob lem is that the powerful pawn on e4 has trouble staying there after 4 d3 li:Jf6 5 dxe4 lt:Jxe4 6 li:Jf3, the old main line going 6 ... i.c5 7 Wke2 i.f5 8 li:Jc3 Wke7 9 i.e3 ! , when Black has never found a route to complete equality. The main idea is 9 ... i.xe3 10 Wkxe3 lt:Jxc3 1 1 Wkxe7+ <:J;;xe7 1 2 bxc3 i.xc2 1 3 <:J;;d2. This position has been ana lysed for some years and seems to favour White. But after 3 exd5, Black can also play 3 ... exf4! 4 li:Jf3 li:Jf6, when we have transposed into the Modem Line that Black may be hoping for (it is the variation analysed in this section). So 2 ...d5 might be reasonable after all. Notice that this order avoids 1 e4 e5 2 f4 exf4 3 i.c4 in the next note. 3 li:Jf3 There must be at least a thousand master games with 3 i.c4 (D), the Bishop's Gambit. It has been subject to lengthy analyses for well over a century. The old main line was 3 ...Wkh4+ 4 <:J;;fl, which offers White intriguing attacking chances beginning with 5 li:Jf3, and Black also enjoyed some brilliant attacks on White's vulnerable king. But 3 ... lt:Jf6 is a big problem for White: a) 4 e5 d5 ! is our familiar device in e-pawn openings. Then 5 i.b5+ i.d7 ! 6 exf6 i.xb5 7 lt:Jc3 i.a6 keeps White from castling and em ploys the two bishops effectively; for example,

8 d3 Wkxf6 9 li:Jxd5 Wke6+ 1 0 Wke2 <:J;;d7 ! and ev

erything is covered: l l li:Jxf4 Wkxe2+ 1 2 lt:Jgxe2 lt:Jc6. Black has some advantage because for one thing he can reorganize by ...b6 and ...i.b7 with powerful bishops. b) 4 lt:Jc3 c6!. In this position White has tried nearly every move, but after ...d5, he loses a key tempo. Later, when White plays d4 and captures with a piece on f4, he is left with a seri ous internal weakness on e3. You can check the theory (critically, please! ), but I don't believe that White ever gets full equality.

3. ..d5

The 'modem' way of treating the King's Gambit. But in fact, most contemporary players use 3 ...g5 (D), the venerable Kieseritzky De fence, to try to refute the King's Gambit. Everything gets very tactical and we'll pri marily concern ourselves with 3 ... d5, but I'll mention two noteworthy continuations after

The 'Modem Defence' to the King's Gambit looks appealing for Black. Of course, there's al ways more to the story. It would be nice if White could figure out a way to bypass such technicalities and return to gambit play in the romantic spirit. 1 0 I ntroduction to the Semi-Open Games The Semi-Open Games are a disparate group of openings with few characteristics in common except that they immediately unbalance the play. Another unifying factor is that they all prepare to counter in some manner White's plan to cre ate a classic pawn-centre with 2 d4. It has been said that each of the openings under the 'Semi Open Games' rubric has to 'give something up' in order to fulfil its mission. The French De fence ( 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5), for example, blocks in the c8-bishop. The Caro-Kann Defence ( 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5) takes c6 away from Black's knight. The Alekhine Defence ( 1 e4 tt::l f6) loses a tempo to 2 e5 and fails to contest the centre. The Pirc Defence ( 1 e4 d6 2 d4 tt::l f6) gives White an ideal centre, and the Sicilian Defence (1 e4 c5) doesn't open lines along which Black's pieces can develop. None of this applies to l ... e5, so one could ar gue that in some sense that is the 'best' defence to 1 e4. But l ...e5 makes its own concession in that Black's e-pawn becomes an unprotected target of attack. Furthermore, if we look at the other Semi-Open Games listed above, all of them except one attack White's centre pawn at e4, as can be seen from 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5, 1 e4 c6

2 d4 d5, 1 e4 tt::l

f6, 1 e4 d5 and 1 e4 d6 2 d4 tt::l f6. In the case of the Alekhine ( l e4 tt::l f6) and the Scandinavian ( 1 e4 d5), the fact that White will effectively gain a tempo by 2 e5 and 2 exd5, re spectively, gives the counterattack an ambigu ous character, but Black nevertheless creates an imbalance that he fails to bring about by play ing 1 .. .e5. The Sicilian Defence goes its own way, as usual, neither developing nor attacking. What an irony that it's the favourite move of the best players in the world! Since the chapter introductions cover the ba sics strategies (and the games much more so), I won't repeat what's said there. Still, it might be interesting to make a few general comparisons between apparently similar openings before turning to the practical material. First, it should be clear that the Caro-Kann would be a better defence than the French if the disadvantages mentioned above were their only problem. Af ter all, bringing a bishop out freely as Black does in the Caro-Kann contrasts dramatically with Black' s imprisoned bishop on c8 in the French. It overshadows any other developmen tal problem. In the Caro-Kann, limiting the op tions of the b8-knight (i.e., preventing it from occupying c6) doesn't seem that severe a pen alty. In the abstract, a hypothetical knight might be best off on c6; but in this particular opening that piece will generally be happy on d7, con trolling e5 and defending f6 in key situations. And in the main line with ... i.f5 the knight doesn't even temporarily block Black's light squared bishop from developing. Of course, the availability of c6 for a knight in the French De fence shouldn' t be underestimated, not only be cause a knight there attacks d4 and e5, but because d7 is left free for a bishop or for a knight retreating to d7 after White plays e5 (a major sequence in the French). So the trade-offs between the two openings aren't completely one-sided, but if forced to compare, you feel that Black gets the better bargain by playing the Caro-Kann. However, what evens the scales is the respective central situations of the two open ings. Regardless of whether you play ...dxe4 (as in the main lines of the Caro-Kann) or maintain your pawn on d5 (as is the case in most varia tions of the French), it' s unlikely that you'll be able to attack White' s d4-pawn by means of ...e5 ; White can put a knight on f3, a bishop on f4, a queen or rook on the e-file, etc. So the re maining way to attack the centre and free one's pieces is ... c5. Black plays that move in most variations of the French Defence, truly threat ening to liquidate White' s centre. But in the

1 74 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Caro-Kann Defence, playing ...c5 would cost Black a full tempo (i.e. ...c6-c5). For that rea son, the Caro-Kann defender will generally delay or forego ...c5 and count upon the re straining influence of his pawn on c6. That is the right decision ( ...c5 on an early move is usu ally impractical anyway); nevertheless, it' s al most always better to break up the opponent' s centre than to surrender the centre yourself. In the Caro-Kann, Black does gain counterplay against White' s centre along the open d-file, but that is relatively easy to fend off. So both open ings have their appealing and unappealing sides. The Alekhine Defence makes a funny con trast with the Pirc Defence. In the Pirc, Black plays ... d6 first, to restrain White's centre, and then ... tt::l f6 to attack it. In the Alekhine, Black reverses this order, playing ... tt::l f6 first, losing a tempo, and then within a few moves after e5 he plays ... d6. It's as though Black had allowed White to play e5 successfully against the Pirc, an advance that is Black's top priority to prevent! Thus one's first instinct is that the Pirc is a supe rior opening. It may or may not be, but the flaw in this argument can be stated more or less as follows: in the Pirc, White often shouldn 't play e5 because Black will either capture once and then retreat the knight, or retreat without cap ture, in both cases undermining the centre by ...c5 or if appropriate ...f6. In the case of the Alekhine, Black has got White to commit his pawn to e5 from where he is already in a position to undermine it. So in a way, he has achieved the Pirc player's dream! Well, of course it's not at all clear whether Black can undermine White' s e-pawn Pirc-style. But the point is that h e has an extended centre to attack whereas in the Pirc Black is waiting for that opportunity. Again, there are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. Most strong players would probably worry more about their space disadvantage were they to play one of these openings. Black's side of the Scandinavian variation 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 °iVxd5 with 3 tt::l c3 °iVa5 might be compared with the Centre Game for White af ter 1 e4 e5 2 d4 exd4 3 °iVxd4 tt::l c6 4 'iYa4. White has the extra move e4 in, but as with most reversed openings you have to decide whether that move is good or bad. The e4- pawn can be a target down an open file, fol lowing, for instance, . . . tt::l f6, ... i.c5 (or ...g6 and ... i.g7), ... O-O and ... .l:te8. On the other hand, the e4-pawn does guard d5 in classical fashion. Perhaps this one's a toss-up as well. One can make this kind of comparison be tween any number of positions in opening the ory, and it's a useful exercise to do so. The reader might want to think about other funda mental properties of Semi-Open Games and how they offer advantages or disadvantages. You will find that every defence has a balance between negatives and positives whose sum can't be too different from that of other open ings. Otherwise, some defences wouldn't be played at all, and others would find no willing opponents ! 1 1 Sici lian Defence l e4 c5 (D) The Sicilian Defence has been the most popular opening in top-level chess for the past several decades and continues to be so today, accounting for about 1 7% of all contests be tween grandmasters, and an astonishing 25% of the games in a database of Informators. Since young players and aspiring masters show such enthusiasm for the Sicilian, it's hard to see those figures diminishing much. What's so special about this opening? First of all, 1 .. .c5 effectively prevents 2 d4, the pri mary goal of a defence to 1 e4. To be more spe cific, 2 d4 cxd4 3 'iVxd4 loses a tempo and already risks disadvantage after 3 . . . tt::l c6. If, in stead, White plays 3 c3 and sacrifices a pawn (the Morra Gambit), we have many years of experience and analysis to show that Black at the very least should have no problems equal izing and almost certainly should gain an ad vantage with accurate play. Of course other openings also discourage d4 or prepare to meet it effectively, so we have to look for more rea sons to choose specifically the Sicilian De fence. Since the vast majority of games are contested in the Open Sicilian, i.e. 2 tt::l f3 and 3 d4, let's see what we can learn from the result ing positions. We need a concrete example to think about, so let's start with the most popular Sicilian Defence played by masters, the Naj dorf Variation: 2 tt::l f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l xd4 tt::l f6 5 tt::l c3 a6

(D)

What's going on? Can Black really get away with this 4th pawn move, when it's not even a centre pawn? Let's make some more sample moves: 6 i.gS e6 7 f4 i.e7 8 °iVf3 'iYc7 9 O-O-O tt::l bd7 10 i.d3 bS 11 l':thel (

White has all seven pieces developed, Black just four, having made six pawn moves thus far. Furthermore, Black has only one piece beyond the second rank; White has five. And of course

1 76 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

White commands more space. Before comment ing upon all this, let's compare it with the Sozin Variation ofthe Najdorf. After 1 e4 c5 2 tt::l f3 d6

3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l

xd4 tt::l f6 5 tt::l c3 a6, White contin ues 6 i.c4 e6 7 i.b3 i.e7 8 O-O b5 9 i.e3. In that case, White has five pieces out to Black' s two. A traditional Scheveningen/Najdorf line goes 6 i.e3 e6 7 i.e2 i.e7 8 O-O (D). In this case, White has five pieces out to Black's two, and out of seven moves Black has played five with pawns. Just to drive the point home, Black some times plays an even more extreme version of these ideas, namely, 1 e4 c5 2 tt::l f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l xd4 a6 5 tt::l c3 d6 6 i.e3 b5, which adds up to six straight pawn moves and not even a piece out! You should notice another negative aspect of every one of these lines, as if they need it: Black's centre pawns on e6 and d6 are in passive positions blocking his own pieces, as third-rank pawns are known to do. Thus his pieces have few prospects of being as active as White's. As we shall see, the same thing is true of most other Sicilian systems. Back to our question: why then would any one, much less the world's elite, play the Sicil ian Defence? Well, Black has an open c-file. But wait! White has an open d-file attacking a weak pawn on d6. That should be even more effective. How about Black's minority attack with the pawn advance ...b5? OK, at least that's a real plus (unfortunately at the cost of more time taken away from development); but if he wants to, White has the time to stop that move by playing a4. In many cases this reduces Black to developing by ...b6 and ... i.b7, thereby put ting another pawn on the third rank. Any experienced player knows that Black stands reasonably well in these positions. Again, can we say why? The real key to the Open Sicil ian is that Black has a central majority. A cen tral majority is a basic positional advantage that should never be underestimated and can com pensate for other problems in the position. If we consider the centre with ... d6 and ...e6, Black's d- and e-pawns protect against incursions by white pieces, thus giving Black time to catch up in development. Next, every central majority threatens to advance and this one is no differ ent: once Black's pieces begin to get developed, the move ... d5 will expand the scope of some of them (for example, a bishop on e7, queen on c7 and a rook on d8 or e8), and create good posts for others (e.g., a knight on e4 or d5). Because White has to be constantly on the lookout for this move (as well as ...e5 followed by ...d5 on the next move) he has to devote forces to its pre vention. That brings us to another important ad vantage for Black in almost all Open Sicilians: White's e-pawn is a target. It can be attacked by a knight on f6, a bishop on b7, and perhaps an other knight on c5. White can defend his e-pawn with his light-squared bishop, but where should he put it? If the bishop goes to d3, it is blocked by its own pawn, and if it goes to g2 or f3, then the bishop will also be passively defending. In fact, in both of these positions Black may at some point be able to play ...e5 and fix the e pawn, preventing that bishop from getting out. What does this all translate to? White's light squared bishop is by definition a bad bishop, be cause his centre pawn is on a light square. I once heard the great Larsen say that after 3 d4 cxd4 White was positionally lost! Tongue-in-cheek or not, he was undoubtedly referring to Black's central majority, and the diversion of White's re sources to the defence of his e-pawn. What can White do in the face of these problems? He generally doesn't want to wait around for an ending without changing the pawn-structure, lest Black's central majority and queenside minority attack become too in fluential in that stage of play. In order to make progress, White has to exploit his space advan tage (he almost always controls four ranks to Black's three, with the other disputed). Hence

SICILIAN DEFENCE 1 77

you will see that many encounters feature White' s advance e5, activating his bishop and other pieces to gain serious and sometimes un stoppable attacking chances. A potential prob lem in that case is that the e5-pawn will become weak, so this decision has to be undertaken cau tiously. He can also turn to the advance f4-f5, hoping to force ...e5; sometimes, however, that cedes the e5-square to Black' s pieces - as al ways, proper timing is the key. Another attack ing option at White's disposal is g4-g5, perhaps in conjunction with h4, risking kingside expo sure in order to drive back Black's pieces. That has been an increasingly popular and successful strategy over the last decade. Finally, in addition to all those ideas, White can try to take direct ad vantage of Black's slow development and re fined pawn-play to sacrifice material and blow open the enemy position. His knights on c3 and d4 may be restricted by Black's pawns, but those same knights are habitually sacrificed on the squares d5, f5, b5 and e6. A completely different structure arises when Black has a pawn on d6 and one on e5. That would seem worse than the ...d6/ ...e6 systems, because he gives up the d5-square to White's pieces (and the f5-square can be handy for a knight). Let's see the best-known early version of this structure: 1 e4 c5 2 tt::l f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l xd4 tt::l f6 5 tt::l c3 a6 6 i.e2 (6 i.e3 can also be answered by 6 ...e5, but that's another story) 6 ... e5 7 tt::l b3 i.e7 8 O-O O-O 9 i.e3. Both sides have played natural-looking moves and now Black illustrates a basic idea: 9 . . . i.e6 (D). This standard move contains the notion of playing ...d5 soon, totally freeing Black's game. White has plenty of options, but one is to oc cupy that square immediately. Then after 10 tt::l d5 i.xd5 ! ? (10. .. tt::l xe4? 1 1 i.b6 and 12 lbc7) 1 1 exd5, White has two bishops but has lost his outpost. More importantly, Black now has a mobile central pawn-mass. One encounter pro ceeded 1 1 ...tt::l bd7 12 c4 a5 1 3 tt::l d2 tt::l e8 14 f3 i.g5 15 i.f2 f5 and Black's 4:3 kingside major ity (a variant of the one we see in so many open ings) establishes itself. Black appears to have achieved a game with equal chances. Note that White' s bishop on e2 is still bad. Obviously one of the most complicated openings in chess can't be boiled down to a couple of generalities, but such themes will appear along with a multi tude of others that directly or indirectly stem from the basic properties of the opening. Before moving on to concrete variations, let me refer again to the very abbreviated descrip tion that I gave in the introductory chapters re garding the evolution of the Sicilian Defence. I'll expand upon it in certain particulars, but the point is the same. In the second half of the 19th century, players met the Sicilian with 2 tt::l c3 more than any individual variation (2 f4 was also a big favourite). When White played a line of the Open Sicilian (i.e., 2 tt::l f3 and 3 d4), Black responded primarily with the Pin Varia tion (2 tt::l f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l xd4 tt::l f6 5 tt::l c3 i.b4) or the similar Four Knights Variation (2 tt::l f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l xd4 tt::l f6 5 tt::l c3 tt::l c6), as suming that White let him get that far. Notice that both of those variations have the primary goal of rapid development, and bear little resem blance to the modem set-ups ...d6/ .. .e6/ ...a6 or ...d6/ ...e5, with pieces generally constrained to the second and third ranks. A few players ex perimented with such systems, such as Louis Paulsen. Among top players, he had to be the most devoted Sicilian player of his time and his games included everything from the Schev eningen to ... the Paulsen! The latter variation is truly hypermodem: 1 e4 c5 2 tt::l f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l xd4 a6. In the first part of the 20th century, leading players began to investigate more Sicilian De fences with limited success, and in particular we see more Open Sicilians, including the Dragon Variation and to a limited extent the Schev eningen Variation. But the Sicilian only began to be truly accepted as a leading defence in the

A thought-provoking situation has arisen, pit ting White' s knights, space, and superior devel opment against Black' s bishop-pair and central majority. The general rule with knights is that their owner needs to hurry to achieve an attack or gain outposts before his opponent consoli dates. Otherwise there will come a counterat tack on the queenside (in this situation by ...b5) and/or in the centre (by ...d5 or ...e5). Theory isn't particularly extensive on these lines and they afford a lot of scope for creativity.

the most frequently played system, the Yugo slav Attack, the players castle on opposite sides of the board and it's interesting to see the prior ity that White's pawns take in the attack (g4, h4-h5, f4-f5, etc.). This can be compared to Black' s queenside pawns, which often stay at home until his attack is complete. Finally, before leaving the subject of pawn-structure, there' s the simplest factor o f all: the g6-pawn offers a target for attack, in particular by h4-h5. In other Sicilian Defence variations, White may achieve an attacking advance such as g4-g5 (or a posi tional one like a4-a5) but there' s no specific pawn target. As usual, these various structural issues tend to balance out; if they didn't, no one would play the Dragon! I won't indulge in any more generalities, considering that the Dragon quickly breaks up into numerous variations that superficially have little in common with each other. It' s better to glean the ideas from the play itself. Classical Dragon

This is the Soltis Variation, the most fre quently played line of the Yugoslav Attack. Black simply stops White's pawn advance and dares him to break down Black's own defences before getting overrun on the queenside. The typical Dragon themes that we showed in the first game still apply, so we'll discuss a few ad ditional ideas as we go along.

Yugoslav Attack. I should note that, along with the idea of being able to sidestep .Bxc4 after ... l2Jc4, there is a similar idea connected with the move ... l2Jg4. As a response to f4 (or even as the second move of the sacrificial device ... .Bxg4), ... l2Jg4 will not gain a crucial tempo on the dark-squared bishop because it has gone to g5.

White has several options and there are count less games from this position connected with intricate analysis by many strong masters.

a6 (DJ Whereas the Dragon Variation may have the most appeal to the average player, the Naj dorf Sicilian has been the favourite opening of

SICILIAN DEFENCE 1 95

top-level players for many years now. Part of this was certainly the influence of World Cham pions Fischer and Kasparov, consistent devotees of the variation. There is also the inherent com plexity and diversity of the Najdorf concepts and themes, to some extent in contrast to the relatively straightforward ideas of the Sicilian Dragon. White has a large variety of absolutely independent systems available for choosing, and Black can respond with varying basic structures. The Najdorf has an especially fluid character: again in contrast to the Dragon, we see more central breaks to go along with flank attacks, and in most variations the centre ulti mately plays as large a role as the attacking for mations on either side of the board. What is that magical little move 5 ...a6 all about? First of all, flexibility, which is perhaps the most valuable asset in modem openings. As the move 4 ... a6 does in the Paulsen Sicilian ( 1 e4 c 5 2 lL'Bf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lL'Bxd4 a6), so Black's 5 ...a6 in the Najdorf makes an implicit challenge to his opponent. White has played five unexceptionable moves (e4, lL'Bf3, d4, lL'Bxd4 and lL'Bc3), which essentially tell Black nothing about what he is up to. But now it is time for White to commit one of his bishops, which by defining the play will allow Black to respond accordingly. The development of White's light squared bishop is particularly meaningful in that regard. If it goes to e2, then Black might play ... e5, which would not be highly recom mended in the Dragon or Taimanov Sicilians, for instance. If White's bishop ends up on c4, Black can block the bishop by ...e6, and so forth. Similarly, a dark-squared bishop on e3 or g5 will require different strategies from Black. For all that, 5 ...a6 is fundamentally slow and simply invites White to go on an offensive. Thus the Najdorf is a risky system in which the slightest inaccuracy can spell disaster. But as Kasparov says, 'High risks mean high rewards', adding that with the Najdorf, Black will usually get a chance to seize the initiative at some point. But he cautions that any generalizations about strategy need to be supported by thor ough homework. We shall investigate 6 .Bg5, 6 .Bc4, 6 .Be2 and 6 .Be3. The continuation 6 f4 is rare these days. One idea that demonstrates a basic Sicilian theme is 6 ...e5 7 lL'Bf3 lL'ibd7 8 a4 (versus ...b5) 8 ... .Be7 9 .Bd3 O-O 1 0 O-O (D). Now with 10 ... exf4!? Black strives to control the e5-square in return for d5. This is the quint essential Sicilian strategy, since it provides an outpost on e5 at the same time that it opens up the e-file and the h8-al diagonal i.n support of that square. But White gets something from the deal too: he gains the key d4-square (usually for a knight), gets an open f-file, and may be able to put pressure on d6 more effectively because of a bishop that occupies f4. These trade-offs have to be constantly evaluated when Black considers whether to play - and White considers whether to allow - the capture ...exf4. Of course Black has other moves which we won't elaborate upon here, notably 10 ... 'i:Vc7 and 1 0. .. lbc5. Af ter 1 0. .. exf4, White plays 1 1 @hl !

.Bxe6 or ... .Bxe3 occurs, or even l2Jg5 and lLixe6. Black' s pawns protect the key central squares d5 and d4, as well as f5 and f4. In such positions the key questions are whether the pawns can be attacked (they are unsupported by other pawns) and who has the better pieces. Mainly because of the relative strengths of the bishops, I prefer Black. Of course this is just one example, not a verdict! The i.g5 Attack 6 .Bg5 White's predominant choice for years was this direct attacking line, and it is still the choice of many experts. White wants to play f4 fol lowed by pawn-breaks like e5 or f5 if allowed. Since Black usually prevents those, White's main set-up begins with 'i:Vf3 and O-O-O. We shall see the associated themes as we go along. In the meantime Black plays ...e6 followed by what are the most typical Najdorf moves ... l2Jbd7, ... 'i:Vc7, ...b5 and ....Bb7, usually but not always with an early ... .Be7. Again, the standard set-ups will ap pear with examples. 6 ... e6 7 f4 (D) This is the most direct attacking scheme that you will see in the Najdorf and has led to crazy sacrificial brilliancies for both sides for years. Three games will follow, and since the variations are so tactical and diverse, I shall lean towards recent examples and stay at least within shooting distance of current theory. Again, only specific study of concrete varia tions will let you truly master 6 .Bg5, whether White or Black. It should be said, however, that if you can pick up some of the ideas that repeat themselves you will have a good head- start. There are of course many ways in which the play can develop. Most of them have White ei ther attacking on the kingside or in the centre. In both cases he will resort to piece sacrifices whenever they are useful or necessary, because the pawns alone won't generally be enough to break down Black's position. Black has some interesting counterattacking ideas on the king side, but will usually proceed with a basic plan of development followed by central and queenside attacks. Or he can leap into action by playing the so-called Poisoned Pawn Variation and grabbing material. I'll outline these possi bilities in a few games.

Najdorf Sozin Attack

[diagram]
a6 6 ..ltc4 (D) The name 'Sozin' is connected with ..ltc4 in both the Najdorf and the Classical lines, so I'll designate 6 ..ltc4 as the Najdorf Sozin. Although this direct bishop development has never been as popular as 6 ..ltg5, and in these days not as popular as 6 ..lte3, it is still used successfully by loyal adherents. The play after 6 ..ltc4 divides into a set of positional and primarily tactical lines, so I'll treat it that way. It's probably fair to say that the slower lines tend to end up in equal ity or even in Black's favour because of his long-term advantages, but the more numerous dynamic lines are much harder to assess, with beautiful tactics seemingly the rule rather than the exception. Black almost always plays ...e6 (usually 6 ... e6) in order to restrict the scope of the c4- bishop. After that White has to be careful about the move ...d5 or ... lbxe4 followed by a ... d5 fork, so he will retreat his bishop to b3. That's the basic position from which strategies are formed, as we shall see. 6 •.•e6 / 6 ... lbxe4? walks into 7 'fih5 ! wiili multiple threats, when the best that Black can do is 7 ...d5 ! 8 ..ltxd5 lLid6. Then, however, White plays 9 O-O and Black has trouble getting his pieces out, since ...e6 is met by a capture on that square and ...g6 by 'fie5. Players often wonder why Black doesn't simply attack the bishop right away with the useful move 6 ...b5. One problem is that the b pawn advance is committal; since ...e6 will doubtless be played anyway, Black may not want White to know on what basis he will set up his attack. Velimirovic-Mrdja, Yugoslavia 1 984 went 7 ..ltb3 (7 ..itd5 ! ? is also very interesting

White's 10th move introduces a type of e-pawn sacrifice that has dozens of variants and forms. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.

If White plays f4-f5 and Black responds with ...e5, the argument revolves around occupation of the d5-square. Should White succeed in exploiting it as a pure outpost, he will probably stand better. When Black can prevent a piece from establishing itself there or gain compensating advantages, his natural Sicilian attack on the queenside will usually come into play. The variations that top players such as Fischer en tered into (he played both sides of 6 ..ltc4) were primarily positional and revolved around these factors. As in many Najdorf variations, if White plays f4 and e5 (instead of f5) the game will often tum very tactical, and White may have to shift his strategy to piece sacrifices before his ad vanced central pawn falls. Those lines are very position-specific and exciting. Alternatively, White sometimes foregoes f4 altogether and simply brings his pieces out. This has become a very popular strategy, although it contradicts what for years was the conventional wisdom, i.e. that the b3-bishop ran into a brick wall at e6 and that it took pawn advances to remedy that. We'll follow various games from this posi tion. I'll show a lot of tactical ideas which are fairly universal in their character and apply elsewhere, but there will also be some purely unique and creative combining for your enjoy ment. Dynamic attacking play is what has al ways drawn the average player to the Najdorf Sozin.

Reutsky - Shtyrenkov Noiabrsk 2003 7 ... lbbd7 This development has been popular for some years, especially after Kasparov used it versus Short in their world championship match. The knight temporarily prevents e5, but generally it goes to c5 next, from which post it can protect e6 against f4-f5 and eliminate the b3-bishop when Black chooses to do so. White is chal lenged to find a way to attack Black's solid structure.

This was probably due to Fischer's example; he consistently employed the idea of f4-f5 to break down Black's e6/f7 structure. The logic was that the e6-pawn ren dered White's b3-bishop ineffectual, so it had to be eliminated. However, that strategy simply didn't succeed versus accurate play, so White finally turned to a different concept. Pieces can precede pawns in an attack as long as the two ul timately cooperate. The great Tai always seemed to bring his pieces out to active squares before organizing pawn-breaks, if indeed his opponent survived up to that point.

c3 a6 6 ..lte2 (D) As various systems have come in and out of fashion, this solid and unpretentious develop ment has always been there as a sensible alterna tive to the heavily theoretical attacking sys tems. The last world-class player to play it consistently with great success was Karpov, yet practically every major player has been on one or both sides of it. Kasparov played it at least four times versus major players with an idea that will be seen below. White's concept is sim ple, at least at first sight. He wants to develop and get castled without exposing his pieces to the tempo-gaining attacks that 6 ..ltg5, 6 ..ltc4 and 6 ..lte3 are often hit with. 6 ..lte2 also covers the g4-square against an invading knight and thus prepares to put a bishop on e3. While 6 ..lte2 is almost always associated with f4, the advance g4 has increasingly been used in con junction with it in order to drive away the f6- knight and prevent ... d5 before undertaking more aggressive action. The negative side of ..lte2 is fairly obvious: it is passive and creates no threats. Nor does the bishop protect the critical e-pawn, which indi cates that it will most likely end up on f3 or d3 at some point. Consequently, White's bishop will often take two moves to get to a relatively passive square. 6 ...e5 (D) Although Black can play 6 ...e6 and trans pose into another variation, this is the original 'point' of 5 ... a6. On the move before, 5 ... e5 would have been met by 6 ..ltb5+, creating some awkwardness on the light squares; for example, 6 ... ..ltd7 7 ..ltxd7+ li'xd7 8 ll'lf5, after which the knight will head for e3 in many situations, al ready with a complete grip on d5. None of this can occur once ...a6 is in. The move 6 ... e5 sets up one of the archetypal Sicilian structures. Black's idea will be to threaten ... d5 as soon as possible and force White to react in a way that is otherwise unfavourable. The analogous idea

Here we look at Najdorf variations, primarily those that use ...e6 and skip ... lbc6 in favour of moves like ...b5, ... ii.b7, ... ii.e7 and ... 'ii c7. This is a hot line in contemporary chess and full of analysis going 20 moves or more, so my coverage will be lim ited. Nevertheless, the English Attack lines are full of interesting and original positional ideas that express a new way of playing the Sicilian Defence for both sides. These positional con siderations make it a good topic of study. The move-order 6 f3 with 7 ii.e3 is a way of transposing to the main English Attack without allowing ... lbg4. However, Black does have the move 6 ... 1Wh6! ? preventing 7 ii.e3 due to 7 ... 1Wxb2. This has the same idea as ... 1Wh6 in the Classical Sicilian, namely, to force the knight back to b3 even at the cost of a tempo ( ... 1Wh6-c7). Then if the knight returns to its 'best' square d4, it's Black who has gained the tempo. But with the knight remaining on b3 it's not so easy for Black; e.g., 7 lbb3 e6 8 g4! ? (8 1We2 intending ii.e3 is also played; perhaps 8 a4 is also good, since a5 can't be prevented) 8 ... lbc6 (Judit Polgar has played both 8 . . . 1Wc7 9 ii.e3 b5 and 8 ...tt:Jfd7; these both look like better ways to go) 9 'ii e2 1Wc7 I O ii.e3 b5 l l O-O-O with advantage. In view of White's many options against 6 ... 1Wb6, it looks as though 6 f3 is safe enough and avoids the ... lbg4 lines men tioned in the next note. 6 •••e6 Or: a) 6 ... tt:Jg4 7 ilg5 h6 8 ii.h4 g5 9 ilg3 ilg7 (D) has been the subject of many grandmaster games, notably Kasparov's. The idea is to take White's dark-squared bishop away from its most effective diagonal and use the e5-square productively. Still, Black has weakened his kingside and the variation seems to have fallen out of favour, so we won't be looking into it here. b) 6 ...e5 is the typical Najdorf solution that we saw under 6 ii.e2 e5. A unique idea is 7 lbf3 ! ? ii.e7 8 ii.c4, which resembles 6 ii.e2 e5 except for three things: 1 ) White generally would like to play ilg5 in lines with lbf3, so as to weaken Black's con trol of d5.

lbf3 e6 (D) This advance of the e-pawn caught the atten tion of many early practitioners of the Sicilian Defence. Black threatens to challenge, if not take over, the centre by playing ...d5 next or within a few moves. The game as a whole takes on a different character with 2 ...e6 as opposed to 2 ...d6 or 2 ... lbc6. Naturally, it can transpose to the same lines and structures if an early ...d6 follows; but if not, Black has new options with respect to his development and overall strategy. One noteworthy difference with 2 ...e6 is that White has no ii.b5 option, as he does after 2 ... lbc6 and 2 ... d6. A few years back that might not have meant much, but ilb5 systems are in creasingly popular, and 2 tt:Jf3 lbc6 3 ii.b5 has even driven top-level grandmasters to change their preferred variations or at least their move orders. Another benefit has to do with the f8- bishop, which after 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt:Jxd4 is now free to go to various positions such as c5 and M; both carry the prospect of more confronta tional chess than, say, 2 ...d6 offers. We also see a lot of early queen moves; for example, to c7 and b6 without first playing ...d6. Needless to say, 2 ...e6 comes with some negatives. On a smaller scale, Black has less flexibility in meeting the moves 3 c3 and 3 d3. It should be added that these moves pose no serious threat; however, Black may not get to choose the variation with which he is most comfortable (see below). And ... e6 does weaken the d6-square, which is a drawback in a num ber of lines, especially those in which Black delays ...d6. Moves such as lbb5 and ii.f4 can be problems, and in general White's move e5 can have more force in many positions since it can't be captured by a pawn. Oddly enough, the fact that 2 ...e6 cuts off the path of the c8-bishop isn't of great consequence. Normally that bishop will attempt to go to b7 or if necessary take its place on d7, and these are the usual squares in other Sicilian variations as well. Taken as a whole, 2 ...e6 is neither better nor worse than the alternatives, as can be seen from its percentage scores in various lines. 3 d4 The alternatives are not threatening but both sides might want to look into 3 c3 and 3 d3. These moves are good study material in any case because the positions are of a standard nature:

SICILIAN DEFENCE 21 7

a) After 3 c3, Black has to decide which anti-c3 method to choose. It's important to know something about the move-orders, especially when compared to 1 e4 c5 2 c3, which is cov ered in the Alapin section of this chapter. A big difference is that after 2 c3, Black can play 2 ... d5 3 exd5 °Yi'xd5 4 d4 tt'Bf6 5 tt'Bf3 ilg4, a move that is no longer available when he plays 2 tt'Bf3 e6 3 c3 d5 4 exd5 °Yi'xd5 5 d4.

Here we have a standard position from sev eral openings, with the backward c-pawn ver sus the isolated queen's pawn. Even if White were better developed than he is here, Black would have enough play by combining pressure down the b- and ct-files. In this position he can also liquidate the weaknesses and gain activity; for example, 1 1 O-O ii.e7 1 2 tt'Bc3 O-O 1 3 ii.c2 ii.a6 14 �el c5 1 5 dxc5 °Yi'xd l 1 6 �xdl ii.xc5, Blatny-Shaked, Kona 1 998. a2) The other obvious response to 3 c3 is 3 ... d5, when 4 exd5 can lead to two unrelated set-ups: a2 1 ) Upon 4 ... °Yi'xd5, we might get 5 d4 tt'Bf6 6 ii.d3 (6 ii.e2 tt'Bc6 7 ii.e3 cxd4 8 cxd4 ii.e7 9 tt'Bc3 °Yi'd6 transposes to one of the lines stem ming from 2 c3; it is considered harmless) 6 ... tt'Bc6 7 ii.e3 cxd4 8 cxd4 ii.e7 9 tt'Bc3 °Yi'd6 with analogous ideas to lines versus 2 c3; again, refer to the Alapin section. Of course there are options on every move. a22) Black can also play 4 ... exd5 5 d4 tt'Bc6, when an isolated queen's pawn position can easily follow: a22 l ) 6 ilb5 ii.d6 7 dxc5 ii.xc5 8 O-O tt'ige7 9 tt'ibd2 O-O 10 tt'Bb3 ii.d6 (D). We've transposed to the French Defence variation 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 tt'Bd2 c5 4 exd5 exd5 5 ilb5+ tt'Bc6 6 tt'igf3 ii.d6 7 dxc5 ii.xc5 8 tt'Bb3 ii.d6 9 O-O tt'Be7, except that White might not want to play 1 0 c3 in that case; that is, in the Si cilian 2 ...e6 3 c3 version he has committed to making that move before he might want to. This is a rather sophisticated thing to worry about for all but very experienced players; neverthe less, it makes the position easier for Black to play than it usually would be, and might give less-advanced players a feel for the consider ations that go into top-level opening play. At any rate, all the themes of isolated queen's pawns apply to the diagrammed position; for

lbc6 (D) The Four Knights is a perfect example of a Sicilian line that emphasizes development over structure. That is true of only a couple of Sicilian variations, mostly old-fashioned and out of fa vour, so it is instructive to see how the players' considerations differ from those in the conven tional lines. The Four Knights itself is still play able but I should warn you that it probably falls short of equality after 6 lbxc6 bxc6 7 eS lbd5 8 lbe4, a highly tactical line that has been thor oughly tested in recent years. It makes sense that a variation that targets the weak d6-square would be a good weapon against this opening. However, we'll follow another variation that produces games with fundamental conflicts be tween positional and tactical ideas. Buchenthal - Rosen German Cht 197819 6 lbdb5 ii.b4 (D) At this point 6 ...d6 7 ii.f4 eS 8 ii.gs trans poses into the Sveshnikov Variation, which is more commonly arrived at via 1 e4 cS 2 lbf3 lbc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt:Jxd4 lbf6 S lbc3 eS 6 ltJdbS d6 7 ii.gs. With the first move-order, both sides have made an extra move due to . . . e6-eS and ilf4-gS. The Sveshnikov contains all kinds of positional and tactical themes, but I felt it less instructive over a broad range of strengths than other variations of the Sicilian, so have not dis cussed it in depth in this book. 7 tt:Jd6+ 7 ilf4 leads to crazy tactics and lengthy the ory after 7 ...lbxe4 8 'Yi'f3 ! d5 9 lbc7+ 'lt>f8 1 0 O-O-O ii.xc3 1 1 bxc3 gS, which ultimately yields equal play according to the books and comput ers.

By deploying the knight to c6, Black breaks with the noncommittal Paulsen approach. He decides early upon the position of the queen's knight rather than keeping open the option of ... lDd7. He also allows White to play lDb5. In return, he has developed a piece, and his c6- knight limits White's options (for instance, the anti-Paulsen move 5 .Bd3 simply loses a piece here).

This advance is somewhat rare but leads to material that is potentially useful. White tries to set up a sort of Maroczy Bind.

It's important to see that Black is not committed to setting up a prepared forma tion with, say, ... 'iVc7 and ... a6. The Taimanov move ... lbc6 goes well with quick development. For instance, White can't simply make Maroczy Bind moves such as 7 f3?! O-O 8 .Be3, because 8 ...d5 !

You don't see this kind of freeing move very often in the Sicilian because, behind the scenes, White makes his moves so that there is a spe cific drawback to ... d5, such as a multiple cap ture or e5. He is normally successful in doing this, and that' s why you seldom see an effective early ...d5 in any well-played Sicilian, including the Najdorf, Rauzer, Scheveningen, Dragon or for that matter Taimanov. This is obvious to a player accustomed to the Sicilian, but perhaps not to a newcomer who sees many games with ...d6 and ...e6 and assumes that Black just pre fers to play with less active pieces. In the dia grammed position White can't even maintain equality, as a short analysis will show you. Returning to 7 lbxc6 (D), Black has two re captures. 7 ..• bxc6 Muzychuk - Gershon Dresden 2003

How about White? Taking the ... .itd8-c7, ... l:tg8, ...g5 idea first, White will first play 'lt>hl and .ltgl to guard h2, and then .itfl for potential second-rank defence by the queen. With that formation you can see that in our main game those first moves of the plan, ... .itd8-c7, can be difficult to implement. Furthermore, White's knight on a3 may not be badly placed to meet Black's strategy. With the queen on b8, for in stance, the moves l:tbl and b4 will discourage ... d5, when Black has to watch out for the move c5, followed in some cases by lllc4. Alterna tively, White can run his queenside pawns at Black by 'llc2 and b4, a4 and a5. Right in the middle of that process Black has to be able to strike in the centre based upon the looseness of White's queenside; whether he is able to do so resolves the question of who stands better. 16 .itfl (D) As explained, this clears the second rank, and the bishop might have been a target along the e-file anyway.

236 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

h3, he has weakened his kingside and failed to contest the f4-square. But upon g3, Black's ad vance ...h5-h4 can be extremely annoying. Fur thermore, the bishop can switch to the g l -a7 diagonal when called upon to do so. If White plays f4, a bishop on c5 may be very strong. b) Black's bishop controls important dark squares from d6; in some lines it goes to e5 in advance of moving the d-pawn, or it may go to f4 and trade bishops. The ending in that case is easier for Black than it looks provided he keeps his king in the centre. c) Black may also be able to delay f4, which is key to White's strategy. One theme in this re gard is ... ltJe5-g6, perhaps in conjunction with ...f6. Along those lines, it's worth noting that if White had avoided the exchange of knights on d4, then the same idea could be expressed by ... ltJge7-g6. By the time f4 is played (probably supported by the preparatory move g3), then Black will normally have ...b5 and ... .ltb7 in, so that White has some weakness on the long di agonal which will discourage him from playing e5. All this is rather exotic and clearly won't be achieved in one game, but it demonstrates the same sort of flexibility that we saw in the Paul sen Variation.

This can include a variety of lines but the most important ones are the Richter-Rauzer Attack (6 .ltg5), and the Sozin Attack (6 .ltc4), which is the subject of this section. These moves both strongly discourage Black from playing ...e5.

d4-knight. White can respond in a number of ways, but by far the most common one is 7 ctJb3, in order to protect the b-pawn and play .lte3; for example, 7 ...e6 8 O-O .lte7 9 .lte3 "fic7. As I describe elsewhere, this creates a sit uation in which Black seems to have wasted an important tempo by ... "iib6-c7, but White may make up for that by playing ctJb3-d4. Lines with ...

Here both 4 ... ltJc6 5 ltJc3 d6 and the Najdorf move-order 2 ...d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ctJxd4 ctJf6 5 ltJc3 a6 circumvent the Keres Attack described in the next note, but of course they have their own peculiarities. 5 ltJc3 d6 (D) 6 .lte3

6 g4 is the Keres Attack, which has a high

reputation among players, and accounts for the fact that the Scheveningen with . . .e6, . . .d6 and ... ctJf6 (before other moves) is not played as much these days - Scheveningen lines more of ten arise by transposition from the lines men tioned in the previous note. However, I am using this sequence of moves in order to lay out some move-order issues and transpositions. Instead of 6 .lte3, for instance, 6 .ltc4 a6 transposes to the 6 .ltc4 Najdorf. The traditional 6 .lte2 can also transpose into other variations such as the Najdorf with . . . ltJbd7; but if . . . ltJc6 is played soon the varia tions take on their own character.

ltJc6 7 .ltc4 (D) We have arrived at the Sozin Attack. It is sim ilar to the Najdorf 6 .ltc4 variation but Black's knight is on c6. That implies the possibility of earlier simplification by ... ctJxd4, which ren ders White's idea f4-f5 less effective. Black is also unlikely to have to worry about the sacri fice .ltxe6 that was a hallmark of the Najdorf line. And even the possibility of f4 followed by e5 can lose force because Black has a natural retreating and counterattacking square for his attacked knight on d7 . White has ample resources, the nature of which are completely dependent upon his choice of piece deployments, especially that of the queen. If she goes to f3, for example, Black will struggle to achieve ...b5 unless he exchanges on d4. But . . . ctJxd4 brings another piece to the cen tre, normally White's bishop, which then aims

SICILIAN DEFENCE 139

at Black' s king. In the absence of that exchange, the move f5 can still be effective. If White cas tles kingside he will almost certainly play f4 and aim for e5. But the most compelling varia tions arise when White castles queenside and plays his remaining attacking weapon, namely g4-g5. It is no coincidence that the g-pawn ad vance established itself in this variation some years back and presaged the flood of g4 attacks in the Sicilian and other openings. Somehow modem theory keeps settling upon that move as the most effective one in long-disputed attack ing variations. 7 ... i.e7 Here we'll show three games illustrating the ...e6/ ...t?Jc6 positions: one in which White cas tles king side, another in which his king stays in the middle of the board, and a modem one in which he plays O-O-O.

Here we have a quintessential old-style Si cilian scenario: White's forces aim at the king side, including his knight, queen, both of his bishops, and his rook on the open file. He would like to play 'ifg4 and tiJf6 (even as a sac rifice), and l:tad l , whereas the sacrifice llxf7 might easily enter into the picture. For his part, Black will be sure to target White's unsupported weakness on e5. Black's kingside is generally solid and his e6-pawn ne gates the pressure from White's b3-bishop.

ctJf3 ctJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ctJxd4 g6 (D) This system is similar to the Dragon (into which it often transposes), so my treatment will mainly concern White's most important chal lenge to Black's move-order, one that is not available in the Dragon: 5 c4 This variation is known as the 'Maroczy Bind', and indeed the same name is often ap plied to White's pawn-structure when it arises in other openings. Before moving on to it, let me point out a few unique features in the Accelerated Fianchetto after the normal-looking 5 lbc3 .Bg7, which is loaded with tricks and positional traps: a) After 6 ctJb3, 6 ... ctJf6 7 .Be2 O-O 8 O-O d6 leads us back to a Classical Dragon.

the Accelerated Fianchetto move-order gives Black another option in 6 ... .Bxc3+! ? 7 bxc3 ctJf6, trying to exploit White's doubled c-pawns at the cost of losing the important dark-squared bishop; see the section of Chapter 3 devoted to doubled c-pawns for a short discussion of pre cisely this position. b) 6 .Be3 ctJf6 ( D) and then: bl) 7 f3? ! O-O 8 1ii d2, in order to get into a Yugoslav Dragon, allows Black to free his game immediately in the classic fashion: 8 ...d5 ! and White should probably simplify by 9 exd5 ctJxd5 10 lbxc6 bxc6 1 1 ctJxd5, with rough equality, before he stands worse due to the weaknesses that f3 has created; see how Black has saved a tempo by playing ...d5 rather than ... d6 and ... d5. b2) Likewise, the Classical moves 7 .Be2 O-O 8 O-O can be answered by 8 ...d5 !. b3) Therefore White might want to play in the style of the Reversed Dragon by 7 ctJb3 O-O 8 .Be2, if slower play is his inclination. b4) 7 .Bc4 (D) and then: b4 1 ) At this point the move 7 ... ,.a5 has some other tricks associated with it.

This gives Black one extra opportunity to steer clear of the main lines: 10 ... lbxd4 ! ? 1 1 .i.xd4 b5 with a complicated game that seems to favour White slightly. On the flip side, many players and theoreticians feel that 10 ... l::t c8 1 1 h4! saves a critical tempo over 1 1 O-O-O and leads to an advantage for White. This is all in the boo ks (or at least most of it is), and will certainly repay study. We now return to 5 c4 ( D ): After 5 c4, White has a large space advan tage that will usually dominate the centre for as long as White maintains the c4/e4 structure. On the negative side, he has a weakness on d4 (much as in a queen's pawn opening where White plays d4, c4 and e4). White's plan is to use his superiority in space to expand and throt tle Black's position. All three areas of the board are available, but he will normally use the centre and queenside. Many endgames favour White.

246 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

and in particular Black has to be sure that with his queen on a5 and White's on d2, the move tZ'Bd5 won't be effective. Black would like to achieve the break ...b5 in order to chip away at White's centre; obviously this usually involves ...a6. Sometimes he can play .. .f5 for the same purpose, but that is un common until later in the game. Finally, he would like to work on the dark squares, espe cially in view of the unprotected state of d4. Some specifics follow: 5 .•. i..g7 Bareev - Pavlovic Plovdiv Echt 2003 This is the traditional main line of the Mar oczy Bind. 5 ... tZ'Bf6 6 tbc3 d6 (6 ... tZ'Bxd4 7 °Yi'xd4 d6 is another well-known idea, when White has vari ous ways to proceed, including 8 i..g5 i..g7 9 °Yi'd2) 7 i..e2 tbxd4 8 °Yi'xd4 i..g7 9 i..e3 O-O 1 0 °Yi'd2 i..e6 1 1 O-O °Yi'a5 12 .l:.ac l ( 12 .l:.fc 1 puts both rooks on the queenside, which seems a good idea; White would like to play f3 and in some cases .l:.abl and/or tZ'Bd5; for instance, 12 ... .l:.fc8 1 3 f3 ! with the idea 1 3. .. i..xc4? 1 4 tZ'Bd5) 1 2. .

some respects by limiting White's options: spe cifically, White has to commit his bishop to c4 and has lost the opportunity to play the popular antidote to the Dragon involving 9 O-O-O. But Black needs to be clear that he can only avoid the 9 .Bc4 version of the Yugoslav Attack by playing sidelines such as 8 ... a5, which are un likely to equalize fully. None of this should discourage a player who is below master level, of course. There will al ways be plenty of winning chances against av erage competition, even with the Maroczy Bind. I do think, however, that you probably won't want to play this system for life. Alapin Variation l e4 c5 2 c3 (D) Known as the 'Alapin Variation' , 2 c3 partic ularly appeals to those turned off by the mas sive theory associated with the Open Sicilian. On the positive side, White tries to build up a centre with minimal risk. Generally, however, 2 c3 lacks punch and might not appeal to the at tacking player. My stated philosophy in this book is to exam ine the most 'important' openings, especially older and established ones that have played a leading role for many years. For the purposes of presenting a Sicilian variation that isn't in that mould, I've chosen the Alapin Variation instead of, for instance, the Closed Sicilian, because it has some universal ideas that are applicable to other lines in this book and opening study in general. The main responses are 2 ... d5 and 2 ... tZ'Bf6. We' ll have only a partial look at those but with relevant details. Other fairly respectable con tinuations include 2 ... b6, 2 ...d6 (and perhaps even 2 ... 1ii a5 ! ?), but I'll skip those and talk briefly about some alternatives that are better known: a) 2 ...e6 is discussed under the order 2 tZ'Bf3 e6 3 c3 in the 'Introduction to 2 ...e6' , except for the line 3 d4 d5 4 exd5 ( 4 e5 is the Advance French, an important transposition to bear in mind) 4 ... exd5 (4 ... 1ii xd5 will usually trans- pose) 5 .Be3 when 5 ... cxd4 6 .Bxd4 tZ'Bc6 7 .Bb5 a6 is considered equal. The plan discussed via the 2 tZ'Bf3 move-order of 5 ... c4 still has the ef fect of making .Be3 look like an unnecessarily passive move and with care to bring his pieces out quickly Black should stand satisfactorily. b) 2 ...g6 3 d4 cxd4 4 cxd4 d5 will often transpose to the variation 1 e4 c5 2 tZ'Bf3 g6 3 c3 .Bg7 4 d4 cxd4 5 cxd4 d5. The main lines are 5 exd5 (5 e5 .Bg7 is similar to the transposition mentioned; then 6 tZ'Bf3 .Bg4 7 .Bb5+ tZ'Bd7 has been played, among others) 5 ... tZ'Bf6 6 tbc3 (6 tbf3 tZ'Bxd5 7 tZ'Bc3 .Bg7 comes directly from that line) 6 ... .Bg7 7 .Bc4, when Black chooses his method of regaining the pawn: ...a6, or ... tZ'ibd7 and ...tZ'Bb6. According to current knowledge, he is able to get a quite playable game and come close to achieving full equality. Counterattack with . . . dS 2• • •d5 3 exd5 1ii xd5 4 d4 tZ'Bf6 4 ...tZ'Bc6 5 tZ'Bf3 .Bg4 is also played, when one ambitious line for White is 6 .Be2 cxd4 7 cxd4 e6 8 tZ'Bc3 'iiV a5 9 h3 .Bh5 1 0 d5 !? but 1 0. .. exd5 1 1 tZ'Bd4 tZ'Bxd4 ( l 1 ....Bxe2) 1 2 .Bxh5 tZ'Bc6 was easy enough (and equal) for Black in Nayer Lautier, Khanty-Mansiisk FIDE WCup 2005. 5 tZ'Bf3 (D) 5 • • •.tg4 5 ... tbc6 is an important alternative for those who are unhappy with some aspect of 5 ....Bg4, perhaps 6 dxc5 in the next note. Play usually continues 6 .Be2 cxd4 (or 6 ...e6 7 O-O cxd4) 7 cxd4 e6 8 tZ'Bc3 1ii d6 9 O-O .Be7. Black wants to play ...O-O, ...b6 and ... .Bb7, with ... .l:.fd8 in some cases. White can build up by .Be3, 1ii d2 and .l:.fd 1, but his position would contain little dynamic potential. Therefore White sometimes

SICILIAN DEFENCE 249

tries to force the pace: 10 ctJb5 'iiV d8 (10. .. 1ii b8 !? 1 1 g3 ctJd5 1 2 .Bc4 a6 1 3 .Bxd5 axb5 14 .Be4 favours White's active pieces) 1 1 ctJe5 ! ? ( 1 1 .Bf4 ctJd5 1 2 .Bg3 O-O { or 12 ...a6} 1 3 .Bc4 a6 14 .Bxd5 exd5 1 5 ctJc7 .l:.b8 with equality) 1 1 ...O-O ( l l ....Bd7 1 2 ctJxd7 'iiV xd7 1 3 .Be3 O-O is also fine: d5 is permanently blockaded) 12 lbxc6 bxc6 13 ctJc3 .l:.b8 (D ). We see this kind of position in several open ings. As long as Black can develop quickly and use the b-file, his isolated c-pawn is not a prob lem. White's d-pawn is just as exposed and is obviously not going anywhere if Black doesn't exchange it. Neither side can claim much, if any, advantage, but either side can play for a win. 6 .Be2 6 dxc5 was brought to the forefront about a decade ago and has enjoyed a steady popular ity. That may say less about the move's merits than it does about White's difficulties in getting an advantage with 2 c3. In any case, the main line goes 6 ... 1ii xc5 ( 6 ... 'iiV xd 1 + 7 @xd 1 e5 8 b4 e4 9 h3 has been tested and argued about for some years now; most players seem to shun it as Black) 7 ctJa3 (7 .Be3 1ii c7 8 h3 .Bh5 9 ctJbd2 ctJbd7) 7 ... ctJbd7 8 h3 .Bh5 9 .Be3 1ii c8! and Black should have a satisfactory position. That assessment is not shared by everyone, however. 6 ...e6 7 .Be3

But by delaying he has committed White's bishop to the rather passive post on e3. 8 cxd4 ctJc6 9 ctJc3 1ii d6 (D) This retreat is better than another (for exam ple, 9 ... 1ii d8) for two reasons: it stops the active move .Bf4 and allows Black to increase the pressure on White's d-pawn after ... .l:.d8 at some point. The dark-squared bishop belongs on e7 anyway.

10 O-O .Be7

We've reached a standard isolated pawn posi tion in which White will pit his activity against Black's more static advantages, primarily pres sure on the isolated queen's pawn and well placed pieces. White may nudge Black's bishop to h5 by h3 and reserve the move g4 for later. He sometimes builds up by means of 'iiV b3 fol lowed by bringing a rook to d l . We saw many examples of this type of position in the intro ductory chapters. This particular one appears unpromising for White, since his pieces are less active than in those positions and d5 will be ex tremely hard to achieve.

250 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

The 2 . . . lbf6 Variation 2• •. lbf6 3 es liJdS (D) This set-up resembles an Alekhine Defence, and Black would very much like to have ...c5 in if he were playing that opening ! But it's not so simple, because White is not intending to kick the d5-knight around with pawns when he can develop his pieces instead. The Alapin with 2 ... ctJf6 can lead to rather theory-heavy play. Here's an outline of some of the wide range of continuations: 4 d4 4 ctJf3 lbc6 5 ii.c4 ctJb6 6 ii.b3 c4 7 ii.c2 g5 ! ? is another eccentric line; current theory has it as equal, whatever that means in such an unbal anced position. 4 ... cxd4 The usual starting-point. Only a 2 c3 special ist would know if White has any way to squeeze something from the position. 5 ctJf3 White can also play the direct 5 cxd4 d6 (5 ...e6 6 ctJc3 lbxc3 7 bxc3 'Ji/Bc7 8 .Bd2 b6 has been a popular system in the past) 6 ctJf3 lbc6, when a traditional line is 7 .Bc4 (or 7 ctJc3 lbxc3 8 bxc3 e6) 7 ... ctJb6 (7 ... e6) 8 .Bb5 dxe5 9 lbxe5 .id?

If Black plays 6 ...e6 7 cxd4 d6, we again have the line referred to in the note to 5 ... ctJc6. 7 .Bb3 d5 Capturing the offered pawn by 7 ...dxc3 8 lbxc3 is risky. 8 exd6 'Jilixd6 (D) Black is generally thought to have equality here, although as usual there are lengthy analy ses of variations which, fortunately, your aver age opponent will never have heard of.

Nevertheless, White may be interested in play ing such a position because it's double-edged enough to be interesting. 1 2 Caro-Ka n n Defence l e4 c6 (D) This is the official starting-point for the Caro-Kann. Now 2 d4 is played in a clear ma jority of games, though naturally White can try to react to the idea of 2 ... d5 in other ways. As always, these early deviations can be very edu cational, and one of them sets up a respectable structure that is played on a regular basis: Caro-Kann Two Knights 2 ctJf3

2 c4 is another important alternative to the

main lines: 2 ...d5 (2 ... e5 3 ctJf3 d6 4 d4 is some sort of Old Indian Defence that most Caro Kann players won't be comfortable with) 3 exd5 cxd5 usually transposes to the Panov At tack by means of 4 d4 - see later in this chapter. White can also try 4 cxd5, when 4 ... 1ii xd5 loses a tempo after 5 ctJc3. However serious that may or may not be, White will follow up with d4 and some advantage; e.g., 5 ... 1ii a5 6 d4 ctJf6 7 ctJf3

This compares well for White with a Scandi navian Defence ( 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 1ii xd5 3 ctJc3 1ii a5 4 d4 ctJf6 5 ctJf3), because Black cannot re strain White's centre by the useful ...c6. In re turn, White has no pawn on c2. But in the Scan dinavian, the c2-pawn can be a disadvantage for White for a couple of reasons. For one thing it's a target of a bishop on f5 and sometimes a knight on b4; but more significantly it's not up on c4 to make the centre more mobile, nor on c3 where it would protect White's d4-pawn. Furthermore, you should note that without a c pawn, White has the handy move 1iib 3 if Black's c8-bishop strays from the queenside. Thus, instead of 4 ...1ii xd5, Black almost al ways plays 4 ... ctJf6 5 ctJc3 (5 i.b5+ will even tually lead to White losing back his d-pawn after either 5 ... i.d7 or 5 ... ctJbd7; in the latter case, ... a6 and either . . . b5 or ... ctJb6 can fol- low) 5 ... lbxd5 6 d4 and we're back to the iso- lated queen's pawn position that characterizes the Panov Attack. The text-move (2 ctJf3) is easily White's most promising independent try and deserves a look for those who want a somewhat less-travelled path. 2 ... d5 3 ctJc3 (D) This sequence tries to use piece-play and quick development to cause Black discomfort. For instance, line 'a' in the next note is a good example of this. 3 ... i.g4 This is most players' choice. Otherwise: a) If Black plays 3 ...dxe4 4 lbxe4 i.f5?!, White shows the benefit of his quick develop ment by harassing the bishop with 5 ctJg3 i.g6

Black sets up the kind of restraint structure that is seen in the Slav, Scandinavian and other defences: pawns on light squares to comple ment the dark-squared bishop while restraining White's centre.

or gambit. Some of the resulting positions are quite similar. It has also been said that the Caro Kannresembles the Slav because l ...c6 takes away the 'best' square c6 from the knight, but keeps an open view for his light-squared bishop. Not surprisingly, however, the characters of the positions arising from 1 e4 and 1 d4 turn out to be radically different: there isn't a Slav Advance Variation, and e4 by White is a rarity in the Slav. In any event, 2 ... d5 compels a response. I'll be looking at 3 exd5 (both the Exchange Varia tion and Panov Attack) and 3 e5, the Advance Variation. I think that those variations are the most useful and consistent in terms of this book's organization. I won't be dealing with the 3 tl:Bc3 main lines, although naturally they're full of wonderful ideas. I'm also leaving out the 'Fantasy Variation' 3 f3, although it has its points of interest. A curious positional compar ison arises after 3 f3 e6! ? 4 tl:Bc3 i.b4 (these are not the only moves, of course), when 5 e5(?) c5 is actually a good version of the French De fence because White's 'extra' tempo due to ...c6-c5 has been used for the awful move f3, which not only loosens White's kingside but takes away f3 for the knight and cuts off White's queen from the kingside. Exchange Variation 3 exd5 cxd5 (D) An enormously instructive variation, the study of which will benefit all chess-players. We'll look at White's slow build-up with c3, and then tum to the more aggressive Panov At tack with c4. The c3 Systems 4 i.d3 tl:Bc6 5 c3 This more conservative development isn't supposed to promise White much, but it has some sting and the pawn-structure is particu larly thought-provoking. 5 .•• tl:Bf6 (D) Now we'll run into some familiar ideas. 6 i.f4 This is the customary approach, and most likely to achieve something tangible. However, let's say that White plays 6 tl:Bf3, Black answers with the natural 6 ... i.g4, and there follows 7 O-O e6 8 tt:'ibd2 i.d6 9 .l::t el O-O. All very logical. Then White might want to re spond to the presence of Black's bishop on g4: 10 tl:ifl °V/ii c7 1 1 i.g5 tt:'Bd7 12 tl:Bg3 (D). What do we have here?

should mention that 6 ... e6 7 lt:Jf3 i.e7 leads to one of those positions that we were talking about in which White may not want to lose a tempo after 8 i.d3 dxc4 9 i.xc4, and thus con siders moves such as 8 l:tc 1 and 8 a3. The inde pendent idea of 8 c5 is also possible. These positions will repay study, and in fact you might want to sit down and try to work out the details without recourse to books or other sources. b) 6 lL:\f3 ( D) is the main move. Then: bl) Sometimes 6 ... i.e6 is played to threaten ...dxc4 and protect the centre at the same time. Anand-Miles, Wijk aan Zee 1 989 shows one way to convert the pawn-structure (pretty much by force) and then build up a superior position:

It's difficult for Black to find anything positive to do, and Anand won rather easily. b2) The most important reply is 6 ... i.g4, because it carries with it the positional threat of 7 ... i.xf3 and gives White few serious options. The most common and well-analysed one is 7 cxd5 lt:Jxd5 8 �b3 i.xf3 9 gxf3 (D). White has implemented the mini-rule that when one side brings their queen's bishop out early, the opponent should strongly consider bringing his queen to the queenside, in this case to b3, because the bishop has abandoned de fence of that wing. Here White has carried out that idea at the cost of doubled f-pawns. Now 9 ... lt:Jxd4?? loses to 10 i.b5+, and 9 ...lt:Jxc3 1 0 bxc3 i s considered good for White because of

White's horrible doubled f-pawns are compensated for or outweighed by his open files (providing some bothersome threats against the king), his more effective bishop, and Black's own two weak pawns. Probably the result with perfect play is a draw, but Black has to play more accurately than White does, which probably explains a lot of players' inclination towards the more com mon move 5 . .. e6 (D), to which we return now. 6 lt:Jf3 Here we'll look at a few of the thousands of games that have been played from this position. Fortunately there's quite a bit of material on iso lated queen's pawns throughout this book (for a lengthy introduction to the subject, see Chapter 3), so this lesson will not stand on its own. We'll see three different 6th moves for Black. Velimirovic - Benko Vrnjacka Banja 1973 6 ••• J.e7 7 cxd5 exd5 ( D) I think it's important to understand that this recapture, while safe-looking, can give White some real prospects.

Here we see one danger in the pawn-structure after 7 cxd5 exd5, which is that the d-pawns are iso lated. Normally when such a pawn is masked by another (and thus not on an open file), it poses no problems. But the fact that 1 1 �3 targeted the d5-pawn caused Black's knight to go to a miser able position on b6, which became the reason for White's advantage. 9 lt:Je5 J.d7 10 O-O O-O 11 l:lel .l::t c8 12 J.g5 J.e6 13 J.xc6 bxc6 14 lt:Ja4 h6 15 J.xf6 J.xf6 16 lt:Jc5 (D)

1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 (D)

This extremely popular move has led to re markably exciting, creative play. There have

262 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

been more discoveries here than in any other variation of the Caro-Kann, and indeed more than most openings. 3 . . . .ltf5 Strong players over the years have tried to at tack White's pawn-chain at the base by 3 ...c5, the idea being that 4 c3 might allow Black's c8- bishop to develop outside Black's own pawns; e.g., 4 ... tt:'Bc6 5 tt:'Bf3 cxd4 6 cxd4 .ltg4 or some such. But this takes Black two moves with his c-pawn, and 4 dxc5 changes the structure dra matically. After 4 ...e6 (D), you may recognize the similarity to the French Defence Advance Variation, i.e. 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 c5 4 dxc5, but then it's Black's move! That's because of the tempo loss ...c6-c5. In the French Defence move-order. 4 dxc5 is harm less or worse because it weakens e5 and brings Black's pieces out quickly. The first question, then, is whether having lost a whole tempo, this position can still be played for Black. That is at least possible, since it is generally favourable for Black in the French. The flip side of the question is whether this basic white pawn structure, advocated by Nimzowitsch, really can be played for an advantage. According to conventional theory, White is supposed to over protect the e5-pawn against assault by .. .f6, such that any capture with .. .fxe5 will leave him with a permanent outpost on d5 from which his pieces can't be driven away. That is not so eas ily done. Alternatively, White can use his extra tempo simply to hold on to the c5-pawn and re main a pawn up! It's worth examining these two strategies, which can be introduced in a few ways: a) 5 .ltd3 tt:'Bc6 (5 ... .ltxc5? 6 'ti'g4 forces Black into an awkward defence of his g-pawn; he either has to move his king or make the very weakening move ...g6) 6 tt:'Bf3 (this is the same as 5 tt:'Bf3 .ltxc5 6 .ltd3) 6 ... .ltxc5 7 O-O tt:'ige7 !

Black appears to be doing fine in these positions. b) Also by analogy with the French De fence, the apparently untried 5- 'ti'g4! would be very interesting, tying Black's bishop to f8 and preparing tt:'Bf3, .ltd3, etc. The queen is ready to overprotect e5 from g3, as shown by 5 ... tt:'Bc6 6 tt:'Bf3 f5 (6 ...

The Short Variation 4 tt:'Bf3 (D) This move revolutionized the Advance Vari ation by showing that White could opt for slow and simple development with protection of the pawn-chain, usually by c3. This is in spite of the fact that Black has a 'good' French Defence due to the development of his bishop outside the pawn-chain. As it turns out, such an ab stract theoretical view doesn' t mean much in practice and there are cases when the bishop would be better-placed on d7. Short and others won various nice games until theory caught up and roughly evened things up. Today the same structure is widely seen, and the Short Variation itself has evolved, often involving .i.e3 instead of c3. Here's one of Short's original wins. It illustrates some of the underlying ideas and some that have more to do with pawn-chains as a whole. Short - Seirawan Manila IZ 1990 4 .•.e6 5 c3 c5 6 .i.e2 tt:'Bc6 7 O-O h6 8 .i.e3!

4 Si.e3 (D)

This modern move (a typical case of bishop before-knight development) has several points. First, it helps to stop ...c5, which after all is Black's goal once he has played ... Si.f5, and all the more so after ...e6. It also directly protects d4, the main target of Black's attack. Moreover, a piece gets out that normally has difficulty doing so in the Advance Variation. Now the queen's knight can follow by moving to d2 and not interfere with that bishop, leaving the pawn moves c3 and c4 free to be played. Here you might compare 4 tt:'Bc3 above; one of the reasons that White must strike out with the early tactical move g4 in that line is that he is no longer able to play c3 and protect d4, so his centre is faced with demolition by ...c5 and ...cxd4. After 4 Si.e3, however, the option of c3 exists, or White can defend with pieces follow ing tt:'Bd2-b3 or he can counterattack by c4. On the kingside we have a somewhat similar situa tion, in that delaying tt:'Bf3 retains the option of f4, while the g4/h4 ideas that we see after 4 tt:'Bc3 are not ruled out. Eventually White will probably play Si.e2 and O-O, but he doesn't want to waste a precious tempo on those moves until it is necessary. As in so many openings today, White's underlying philosophy is one of flexi bility. There are of course drawbacks to all this, first and foremost that White is not granted two moves for every one of Black's, and can only implement these strategies one at a time! Fur thermore, there is the concrete problem that to play it within the next few moves. Let's re call again our idea about the early development of White' s dark-squared bishop: whenever that happens, Black should always consider target ing the queenside dark squares. That normally applies to Si.f4 or Si.g5, but there's no particular reason to reject the same thought after Si.e3 (al though at least White needn't worry as much about d4). The queen sortie to b6 also assists with ... c5 . So it is probably best played right away or early on, because given a little time White can play tt:'Bb3 or c3 and b4. Black, having been informed that a bishop is on e3, can also aim to put a knight on f5 or g4 and look for a favourable way to obtain the two bishops. One might want to compare all this to the Kupreichik line in the Advance French: 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 c5 4 c3 tt:'Bc6 5 Si.e3. In that case, too, Black will often play ... tt:'ige7, aiming for . .. tt:'Bf5, or even more often ... tt:'Bh6 with the dual ideas ... tt:'Bf5 and ... tt:'Bh6. Of course there's much more in terms of strategy in this wonderfully complex line. The players' positional under standing will usually be put to the test, and therein lies the chance for a challenging and competitive game. We look at two games after 4 Si.e3: 4 . . .e6 (D) 5 tt:'Bd2 Shirov - Dreev Poikovsky 2006

1 e4 e6 the Queen's Gambit Declined ( 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6),

Strictly speaking, this move defines the French Defence. However, I shall pass over White's second-move options, and get straight to the position that most players think of as the starting-off point.

2 d4 d5 (D)

The French Defence ranks behind only the Sicilian Defence and l ...e5 as a reply to 1 e4. It is hard to characterize in general terms since it combines highly tactical and ultra-positional types of play. But the French has one quality that few other openings have, and perhaps none to this extent: a persistence of central struc ture. In the main lines (mostly characterized by White's move e5), the fundamental formation of ...e6 and ... d5 has a tendency to last for many moves into the middlegame and fairly often into an endgame. The exceptions consist of variations with ...dxe4, which are proportion ately infrequent, and lines in which Black achieves the freeing move ...e5, something that White usually denies his opponent until the middlegame. This brings us right away to the main disad vantage of the French Defence, Black's light squared bishop. Whether that piece assumes a useful role can determine the success of the opening. We run into a similar phenomenon in where in most of the traditional lines the move ...e5 is needed to bring the c8-bishop into play. A significant exception in the Queen's Gambit occurs when the bishop is freed by White' s vol untary exchange on d5. The situation with the Semi-Slav ( 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 tt:'Bf3 tt:'Bf6 4 tt:'Bc3 e6) is obviously worse still. In any event, re turning to the matter of the French Defence, we find that if White advances his pawn to e5, the freeing move ... e5 becomes unlikely in the short term, so Black may try to develop his light squared bishop via . . .b6 and ... .i.a6. More often it stays on c8 or d7 for a while, perhaps await ing the move .. .f6, after which it plays a useful defensive role guarding e6. The bishop may later transfer to the kingside (g6 or h5) via e8. It' s interesting that the Sicilian Defence varia tions which include the moves ...d6 and ...e5 are a mirror image of certain Tarrasch French main lines, right down to the role of the bad bishop as protector of a backward d-pawn (in the Sicil ian) or a backward e-pawn (in the French); see the section on 3 tt:'Bd2 tt:'Bf6 for more about that remarkable comparison. Finally, Black's light squared bishop may go in the other direction to c6, b5 or a4. Where it ends up will reflect the pawn-structure and thus indicate the nature of the play. What else is going on in the initial position? On the most basic level, Black's second move of the French Defence attacks the e-pawn! Ac cording to the Hypermodern theorists, White's e4-pawn is too much of a target for 1 e4 to be a good move, and in fact Black puts the question to White, who has to choose between exchang ing the pawn, advancing it, protecting it, and gambiting it. We discuss this in the Introduc tion to the Semi-Open Games (Chapter 1 0). Looking over White's options against the French, we find: a) There is no realistic method of gambiting White's e4-pawn that doesn't leave him strug gling for equality.

With more and more willingness to defend difficult positions in openings, players who recognized the very real advantages in Black's pawn-structure and his smooth development began to try out the line. A standard plan goes ... lbc6, ... lbf6, ... a6, ...°VJll. c7 and ... b5 with ... .i.b7, depending upon how much is permitted him. These are typical Sicilian ideas and, as in the Sicilian, players re alized that the pawn on e6 in particular makes Black's position hard to crack. White in turn uses his lead in development to restrict Black's own pieces from getting out by posting pieces on support-points like e5, still looking for and often finding attacking chances. For Black, it' s all about structure: White doesn't have a centre pawn to attack with, and his c- and f-pawns tend to take a long time to enter the fray. About 15 years ago this turned into the most popular line of the Tarrasch at the very top levels and it is still leading to great wins for both sides. We'll explore three games from this position. Lastin - Bareev Russian Cht (Sochi) 2004

lbxd4 White has recovered his pawn. In the early days of the variation, quite a few players tried 10 °VJll. xd4 (D). In spite of White's lead in development, Black has a solid position. If the game actually reached a simplified ending with no structural changes, Black's central majority would give him the advantage. In any case, Black's most popular continuation is 10 ... .i.d7 (10. .. °VJll. xd4 1 1 lbxd4 .i.c5 ! is also reasonable: 1 2 lDb3 .i.e7 1 3 .i.f4 .i.d7 14 .i.e2 {White intends to exert pres sure from f3; this is the standard plan} 14 ... ltJd.5 15 .i.g3 h5 ! 16 h3 h4 17 .i.h2 O-O-O, Akopian Shirov, Merida 2000) 1 1 .i.f4 °VJll. xd4 1 2 lDxd4 l:i.c8 (or 12. .. .i.c5) 1 3 .i.e2 lbd5 14 .i.g3 h5 !

The cur rent main line continues: 7 ... tllf6 8 tllb3 tllc6 Black has to catch up in development and anyway, the harder he can make it for White to recover his pawn on d4, the better.

Black has also played simply 14 ...O-O here, but that's risky. The text-move gets the queen off the d-file and gains a tempo by attacking White's g5-bishop. 15 h4! Or maybe he hasn't gained a tempo, since the h-pawn will be handy in an attack!

Black aims at White's kingside, but even more significantly, he stops .tf4, which effec tively exchanges Black's good bishop. This comes at the cost of committing the queen early on, which could be considered a relative loss of time. I'd guess that at least thousand pages of anal ysis (adding up all sources and annotations) have been devoted to the lines beginning with

I'm going to stick with the queen develop ment instead. But I do think that it's intriguing to compare this position with the Sicilian line 1 e4 c5 2 tt:Jf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt:Jxd4 tLlf6 5 tt:Jc3 tt:Jc6 6 .te2 e5 7 tLlb3 .te7 8 O-O O-O 9 .te3 .te6

It's a mirror image! Notice especially the roles of the bad bishops protecting backward pawns. The biggest difference in structure is Black's open f-file in the French Defence. He also has the opportunity to attack White's vul nerable d-pawn. Both of these are comparative advantages. But in the Sicilian Defence posi tion, Black has an important minority attack with ...a6 and ...b5, by which he gains space, at tacks the queenside, and helps with control of d5. In the French, Black has nothing of the sort; as such, his strategy is more piece-based, with moves like ... "file? (supporting the idea of . . .e5), ... tt:Jh5 (or ... tt:Jg4), intending to attack on the king side. And as long as we're digressing, a thought provoking comparison also arises between this sort of position and that of the Guimard De fence, 3 tLld2 tt:Jc6. It turns out that the lack of a c-pawn in our 3 tLld2 tLlf6 French Defence can be a disadvantage in comparison with the Gui mard!

Let's look at a real game: 12 i.gS Biti - Gleizerov Zadar 2005 The main line, which has the logical idea of i.h4-g3 to exchange off that good bishop of Black's. Then White can start thinking about occupying the juicy outpost on e5 by means of l:.el . If Black plays ... e5 first, he gets saddled with an isolated queen's pawn and remember that they tend to be weaker after simplification, especially the exchange of the better bishop. That's White's general strategy, but of course it takes time. As explained after 1 1 ...O-O, Black tends to rely on piece-play, so he'll start putting everything close to the king, provoke weak nesses and then strongly consider ... e5 in order to bring the last pieces into the attack. 1 2 tllc3,

Still, in some respects Black calls the shots. As long as Black doesn't commit to a radical move right away, White needs a positive plan. He can't play tll b3 due to ... c4, and dxc5 gives up the centre. That means that a slow move by Black at this point could be the most effective course, as in the following game. Zhang Pengxiang - M.

By surrendering the centre he gives his king's knight the d4-square, which ruins Black's at tacking plan, and he can blast away at the sud denly poor-looking g-pawn by f4; for example, 9 ... tll dxe5 (9 ...g4 10 tll d4 tlldxe5 1 1 il..b5 il..d7 1 2 tll 2b3 gives White the advantage, Smirin Akobian, Minneapolis 2005) 10 tllxe5 tllxe5 1 1 tll b3 il..d7 1 2 f4 !, Hracek-Stellwagen, Solin gen 2005.

f6 4 e5 lllfd7 5 f4 (D) White constructs a big centre, with the pawns forming a wedge that extends into Black's posi tion. The advantage is obvious: it's now ex tremely hard to break down the front of the pawn-chain, which is always the essence of Black's strategy in the .ltd3 lines. The moves ...f6 and .. .fxe5 can be answered by fxe5 (or in fewer cases by dxe5, which cedes the c5-square to Black's pieces). I'll concentrate on this d4/e5/f4 pawn-chain structure here and in the Classical French because it's different from most other pawn-chains in this book. The only other major opening with similar properties is the King's Indian Defence with pawns on e4, d5 and c4, and Black's treatment in that open ing is radically different from what we shall see in the French Defence. White's strategy has one major drawback: he has to make so many pawn moves, not only these first four but also c3 and usually g3 and/or h4. Even a3 and b4 are part of a typical forma tion. Because of this it turns out that Black can almost inevitably sacrifice something in the centre to open up attacking lines for his better developed pieces. The result is often a confused disarray of pieces and threats, with White try ing to defend an exposed king against Black's open lines and advanced centre. Of course, there are two possible outcomes in White' s favour . Either the sacrifice isn't possible, when White will almost always enjoy a large, cramping space advantage and potential attacks on both wings. Or Black' s sacrifice may prove insuffi cient for equality. Ensuring such a result takes a lot of accuracy on White's part, however, and many players seem to have grown tired of be ing on the receiving end of brilliancies. The normal and logical response to 5 f4 is to attack the d-pawn with 5 ...c5. As a mini-rule. we can generalize that attacking the front of a double-winged pawn-chain like this with ... f6 is best delayed until some of your other pieces are out. You might compare the King's Indian c4/d5/e4 double-wing, in which ...c6 can be very useful, but doesn't usually occur until Black has castled. Nevertheless, you will see that eventually ...f6 will be essential to open counterattacking lines. 5 ••• c5 6 c3 I should mention that 5 c3 c5 6 f4 is another move-order that reaches this position. 6 ... lllc6 7 llldf3 This is played in the great majority of games. Otherwise the knight on d2 is only getting in the way. 7 .•. 'i¥'b6 Here Black has the option of a 'closed' sys tem with 7 ...cxd4 8 cxd4 f5 (D) that is quite playable. The idea is ... .lte7, ...

All these pawn moves can be a little slow. White's got a lot of space on the kingside and might want to use a move to secure it.

296 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

It's now or never. That's about all you need to know about these lines when playing Black: if you don't sacrifice at an early stage, you'll probably never be able to sacrifice later! White will just have too many pieces covering all the key squares and then you'll die slowly, waiting around as he slowly advances on your cramped position. If you're handling the white pieces, the sac rifices are also about all that you need to know ! If you can prevent those, the rest won't be diffi cult. So try to set up your pieces for maximum post-sacrifice defence, as Anand has tried to do here by playing l:.h3 and lt'ieg l , both designed to overprotect the f3-square, which is generally the most vulnerable target. It pays off for him in this game. 16 dxeS lt'ixeS 17 lt'ixeS 'iVxeS+ (D) 18 'iVe2 i..xh4+!? Shirov pours more gasoline on the fire.

Then I'll play ... e5 (hitting h3) and ... i..f6." That' s probably a good plan: If you want to see Black's reward for sacri ficing his piece, try to defend the diagrammed position for White. It may or may not be that he can succeed in repulsing the attack, but few players could do so in practice. One line would be 19 i..g5 !

We are going to concentrate upon the main line, which is marked by the advance. 4 e5 Easily the most ambitious move, restricting Black's development and staking out territory on the side of the board that Black's dark squared bishop has just abandoned. Various other lines may be found in the books, several of them involving the sacrifice of White's e-pawn with subsequent recovery. For example: a) 4 a3 .ltxc3+ 5 bxc3 dxe4 6 'iVg4 lll f6 7 'iVxg7 l:tg8. b) 4 .ltd2 dxe4 5 'iVg4 lllf6 6 'iVxg7 l:tg8. c) 4 llle2 dxe4 5 a3 .Ile7 6 lllxe4. And so forth. There are numerous options on every move of these lines, with theory tending towards a verdict of equality with best play. As always, the reader may want to consult special ized books to learn more.

4...cS (D)

Black decides to attack the base of the pawn chain first. He will almost inevitably attack the front of it later. 5 a3 White wants to force a decision by Black's bishop; you'll have to check theoretical works and databases in order to find out about the alter natives. Of these, 5 dxc5 and 5 .ltd2 are perhaps the most interesting. If you are not inclined to play the main lines presented below, this may be a good place to investigate potential weap ons for use. The defender, of course, should be aware of and prepared for White's various 4th and 5th-move alternatives. 5 • • • .ltxc3+ Black cedes the bishop-pair to White in or der to gain a tempo and inflict doubled pawns on his opponent. 5 ... .lta5 is a respectable option played by some specialists, but isn't nearly as popular; we'll pass that by. 6 bxc3 llle7 (D) 6 ... 'iVc7 is also played, posing a different set of problems. Those who enjoy play upon col our complexes may be attracted to lines such as 7 'iVg4 f5 8 'iVg3 cxd4 9 cxd4 llle7 1 0 .ltd2 O-O 1 1 .ltd3 b6 1 2 llle2 .lta6, when White's con centration upon dark squares (h4-h5-h6, lllf4- h5 and .ltb4 are typical ideas) contrasts with Black's on the light squares (by . . . .l:.c8 and ... lll b8-c6-a5, for example). It is my belief that the most instructive and engrossing lines follow from the positions after 6 ... llle7. At this j uncture, White chooses between the Positional variations, involving the moves lll f3, a4 and/or h4 in various orders, and the 'French Poisoned Pawn Variation' 7 'iVg4. Positional Variations In this section we'll look at lines in which White bypasses tactics for a while and tries to establish a positional edge. In spite of initial ap pearances, both players will use both sides of the board to generate play. We'll look at a series of games beginning with 7 h4 and 7 lllf3.

7 h4 (D)

With this move White charges forward to as sault Black's position, not caring about piece development. He has several ideas, beginning

300 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

with h5-h6 to compromise Black' s kingside. Black' s kingside dark squares are already weak ened due to the loss of his f8-bishop, so if White can establish holes on f6 and h6 it will not only give him good squares for his pieces, but also discourage Black from attacking on the king side. White' s advantage in space is on the kingside, and h4 only enhances that advan tage. Other matters of note, many of which apply to the Winawer in general: a) White has the two bishops; b) The pawn advance h4-h5 makes kingside castling very difficult for Black, and almost compels ...O-O-O; c) The rook's pawn advance doesn't block off White's queen as lines with tll f3 do, so 'i¥'g4 is always an issue; d) White has a potentially strong resource in l:.h3-g3/f3 or l:.h4-g4/f4, the latter rook move also introducing the possibility of dxc5 and l:.hb4 for attack. Black's main advantage is less subtle: a growing lead in development. It's quite possi ble that he'll have every piece except one of his rooks in action when White still only has one piece out! White also has weak doubled pawns on his c-file, with the usual problem that if Black exchanges pawns on d4 White gets rid of his doubled pawns only to find that his remain ing backward c-pawn on an open file can be as least as much a problem as the doubled pawns. In general, Black would like to exploit White's queenside light-square weaknesses on c4 and a4. Finally, Black can usually open files on the kingside, after which his rooks directly face White's king. There are many other positional and tactical issues and I shall discuss as many as possible in context. 7 .•. tll bc6 8 hS 'iY'aS Black attacks White's c-pawn and, inciden tally, threatens ... tllxd4. 9 ild2 (D) 9 'i¥'d2? cxd4 1 0 cxd4 'i¥'xd2+ and 1 1 ... tllxd4 wins the d-pawn.

10 h6 gxh6 (D)

A funny position because Black's doubled h-pawns are so weak on an open file and White apparently controls the kingside. But Black finds

FRENCH DEFENCE 301

a remarkable idea after which both players have the opportunity to play on both sides of the board! In fact that' s often the case in the Winawer. Although White has space on the kingside, Black can counter with .. .f6 and open lines for his pieces there. And Black's attack on White's weak queenside squares can boomer ang when White uses the b-file and dynamic pawn moves on that side of the board including c4, a4-a5, and sometimes dxc5.

c3 i.b4 4 e5 lll e7 5 a3 i.xc3+ 6 bxc3 c5 7 'i¥g4 (D) The grand old flagship of the Winawer Vari ation. White wants to exploit Black's lack of the dark-squared bishop by direct means. He will try to get Black to weaken himself or castle into a potential attack. It makes sense to work on the side of the board where he has space and to wards which his bishops aim. In addition, the e5-pawn cramps Black in that part of the board. As is true in the positional lines, White would love to get rid of the g-pawn so that his unop posed dark-squared bishop can have a field day on squares like h6 and f6. For his part Black's first goal is to attack White's centre and queenside, where White al ready has serious weaknesses. Ironically, how ever, he usually ends up playing on the kingside too, whether or not he castles in that direction. The key move is .. .f6, which helps defensively but also gives him central threats and a very useful f-file. In any case, Black' s first decision is whether to gambit the pawn by 7 ... 'i¥c7, or play 7 ...O-O and hang on to his material for a while. The latter is the preferred choice these days but it' s not clear that the former won't come back into fashion. As in so many lines of the French Defence, one notices the persistence of the central pawn structure. This gives both the positional and tactical themes a certain logical consistency, al though it doesn't seem to limit their variety. The Gambit 7• • •'i¥c7 8 'iVxg7 .l:!.g8 9 'iVxh7 Now in addition to the other advantages listed above, White has a passed h-pawn. It is worth remembering, however, that the advance of a passed rook's pawn very seldom poses a threat until far into the middlegarne. Their real strength appears in simplified positions and, of course, as outside passed pawns in an ending. 9•••cxd4 10 lll e2 (D) Other moves like 10 @dl are possible, yet this is how they've played it for 50 years in the vast majority of games.

11...jg,d7 12 'iVd3 dxc3 13 'iVxc3 (D)

Simply recapturing the c3-pawn is very pop ular, since it has both a cramping effect and at tacking strengths. On the other hand, the c-file is open for Black's rooks. There are many other moves here such as 1 3 I:Ibl, 1 3 I:Igl and 1 3 lll xc3. Let's take stock. White's advantages are pretty obvious: he has cleared out the kingside, which for one thing means that the move .. .f6 (to undermine his centre) would be unsupported by a pawn. His bishop-pair can be usefully placed on d3 and e3 for both attack and de fence, although the dark-squared bishop can be a target in that case. A bishop on a3 would be wonderful but generally it's just too hard to achieve. In view of this his most potent posi tional threat is to expand on the kingside by means of g4 (preceded by either h3 or I:Ig 1 ). That would deny Black's knight the powerful f5-square. Alternatively, White can try to play g3, jg,g2 and O-O; that arrangement of pieces is another trade-off because when the bishop moves off its original diagonal White tends to be subject to central and queenside attack. Finally, we shouldn't forget that h-pawn. If White can get bishops to d3 and f6, then Black will at the very least have to devote several pieces in an attempt to stop it from marching up the board and promoting. What is Black doing in the meantime? He has sacrificed a pawn, apparently in order to get at White's queenside and gain development. That lead in development is absolutely critical because if he waits too long for White to get his position organized (and especially to get his bishops out!) he will have little to counter White's space, extra pawn, and bishop-pair. Fortunately, his knights at the moment are very well-placed and influential. It' s a kind of semi closed position in which for now the knights are superior to bishops. He also has play down the c-, g- and h-files, whereas right now White isn't using his king' s bishop or rook at all. Is that enough to make up for White's own advan tages? Probably not, except that White also has isolated c- and a-pawns, and hasn't castled. Note too that there is an important interior weaknesses on e3, a square that can be an chored by ...d4 and is particularly vulnerable to a knight on f5 and a queen on b6. Generally speaking, White' s advantages, if he can keep them, are probably the better ones in the long term, so you will usually find Black trying to upset the equilibrium in the near term. All in all one can see why players would be willing to take both sides of this position. 13 ••• tt:Jrs A multipurpose move that holds off ctJd4 and controls e3. This introduces the idea of ...

The attack can be supple mented by h4-h5 and .l:.h3, or by f4, assuming that White's knight has moved. Now 8 i.d3, bringing the bishop to d3 before deciding upon anything else, is the overwhelm ing favourite. 8 Cllf3 is the most natural move, but was put under a cloud by several games, in cluding the following: Roth - Kindermann Vienna 1996

314 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Black can go his own way with things like I d4 d6 2 c4 e5 or I d4 d6 2 'Lif3 .tg4 ! ? . A great deal of theory now exists on these and related posi tions. We've come a long way from the days of a near-compulsory I e4 e5 and I d4 d5. 3 'Lic3 White plays the most natural and important move, defending the attacked pawn. The Pirc is one of those openings in which the early op tions are instructive, so we'll look at a couple over the next few moves. Here 3 .td3 is some times played, intending to enter into a system with c3 and perhaps 'Lie2. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but apart from the normal and good 3 ...g6 it allows Black to strike out in the centre immediately by 3 ...e5. Then 4 c3 allows the cute idea 4 ... d5 ! . It's a case of "If you don't want to take the centre, I shall !'' I've discussed this position briefly in Chapter 3 (un der 'Cross-Pollination'). Let me repeat and ex pand upon that exposition. After 3 .td3 e5 4 c3 d5, we find that it's a great asset to know about a wide variety of chess positions and themes. Chemin did a fascinating analysis of 4 ...d5, which I've abbreviated and modestly revised. The play will usually continue 5 dxe5 'Lixe4

In Chapter 3, we already looked at White's option 6 .txe4 dxe4 7 'iVa4+ (7 'iVxd8+ @xd8 gives Black the two bishops and active play; e.g., 8 ..Bf4 'Lid7 9 'Lid2 'Lic5) 7 ... .td7 8 'iVxe4 .tc6. The position is similar to pawn sacrifices made in various openings. Here 9 'iVg4 is forced, when 9 ... 'iVd7 ! is very strong: 1 0 'iVg3 ( I O 'iVxd7+ 'Lixd7 1 1 'Lif3 .txf3 1 2 gxf3 'Lixe5 1 3 Qe2

In fact, the only difference between the two lines is Black's insertion of ...a6 and ... b5 in the Ruy Lopez version. Without entering into yet

another digression, I'll just say that this has both positive and negative features. 3• . •g6 Here there's an important transposition 3 . .. e5 4 ll'Bf3 lt'ibd7, when we're in a Philidor De fence! What's more, this is arguably the only safe way to get to this version of the Philidor because 1 e4 e5 2 lt'Bf3 d6 3 d4 ll'Bf6 allows 4 dxe5 ll'Bxe4 5 °iYd5, which is not to everyone's taste. Details about this and associated move order issues can be found in Chapter 7. We shall now move on to a discussion of the main lines of the Pirc. Austrian Attack

4 f4 (D)

As I've pointed out with many examples at the very beginning of Chapter 3 on pawn-struc tures, the first reaction to 'unusual' defences that cede the centre is generally to throw as many pawns forward as possible and push the opponent off the board. The Pirc was infre quently played and generally held in low regard until the mid- l 960s, and indeed this response dominated early theory.

4. ..

.tg7 Before moving on to the main line 5 lt'Bf3, played in thousands of games, let's see if we can understand what the relation between this structure and pawn advances might be. Austrian Attack with 5 e5

5 e5 (D)

What about advancing right away? You won't find much in the books about this, and it's easy to say that 5 e5 is too ambitious, especially since it resembles other openings in which rash pawn attacks are insufficiently supported and expose the centre. But it's another thing to show that. Let's do our own analysis and per haps pick something up about how to study an opening while we're at it. As we know, varia tions that are not highly respected are often the most instructive. Let's look at two answers to 5 e5 as representative of typical ideas in the Aus trian Attack:

[diagram]
ll'ifd7

dxe5

A)

5 • . • lt'ifd7 This is a dynamic move in the spirit of the Pirc, avoiding simplification and accepting the challenge. The positions that result are little explored and instructive to investigate. 6 ll'Bf3 c5! The recommended continuation for Black. It's consistent to destroy White's centre before he consolidates; of course, that depends upon the outcome! This line transposes into 5 ll'Bf3 c5 6 e5 lt'ifd7. By the 5 e5 move-order, White has avoided a few of Black's options along the way. 7 lt'Bg5!? This odd sortie may well be the best move, although 7 .tc4 could use more investigation. Positions with a knight on d7 and the possibil ity of the move e6 are notoriously tactical, so the move 7 lt'Bg5 is likely to occur to you if you've run across such positions before.

316 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Black's hope was to see something along the Jines of 7 exd6 O-O 8 dxc5 (8 dxe7 'iVxe7+ 9 'iVe2 'iVxe2+ 1 0 ll'Bxe2 l:te8 1 1 @f2 ll'Bc6 1 2 c3 ll'Bf6 with an initiative for the pawn) 8 ...'iVa5 ! 9 ..Be2 ..Bxc3+ ! 1 0 bxc3 'iVxc3+ 1 1 ..Bd2 'iVxc5 1 2 dxe7 l:te8 ! 1 3 l:tbl lt'Bc6 (D). This is the game B.Ivanovic-M.Gurevich, Lucerne Wcht 1 989. White can't easily reorga nize, and look at those exposed internal weak nesses on e3 and e4! This way of destroying White's centre is relatively common, especially the device of allowing White's capture dxe7 and responding with ... l:te8. 7 ••• cxd4 Worse is 7 ...h6?! 8 ll'Bxf7 ! @xf7 9 e6+ @g8 10 exd7 lt'Bxd7 1 1 ..Be3. 8 e6!

Black still has difficulty freeing his king, and he isn't out of the woods after 17. .. 'iVf5 1 8 l:tel ll'Bc6 1 9 'iVd5 either. 18 l:tel ll'idf8 19 g4! Here White still has threats. Naturally both sides have a lot of other options along the way, and it's unlikely that White can actually force an advantage in this line. But the characteristics of the position are what count here, and they can only be indicated by analysis (which in this case is a lot of fun). Mainly, I wanted to show that it's easy to dismiss 'premature' attacks on principle without testing whether the principle in question applies to a specific position (or even whether it is valid at all). 8) 5 .•.dxe5 6 fxe5!? lt'Bd5 7 ll'Bf3 (D) White retains his centre. Then we have Black's bishop looking rather restricted on g7. An apparently logical move is: 7 •.•f6? However, this tends to be dubious before Black has castled and developed, and is ex tremely poor in this exact position. We shall look at a better option after the end of this line.

8 exf6 White makes his usual response to .. .f6. The recapture 8 ... ..Bxf6 would leave Black with a weak isolated e-pawn on an open file; then 9 ctJe4, 9 ..Bc4 and 9 ..Bh6 are all good moves. Therefore Black in principle would prefer: 8 ••• exf6?! (D) Recapturing with the pawn might be OK in some positions but here it is much too early be cause Black's king is stuck in the centre and he also suffers from a weakness on e6 and a bishop on g7 that is blocked off. 9 ..Bc4 W/Je7+ Against 9 ... ..Be6, IO Wife2 simply wins.

At the end White is enjoying more space, while Black's bishop is still hemmed in on g7.

After all that, I should add that after 5 ... dxe5, 6 dxe5 (D) is less instructive but may be even a better move (or at least an easier one to handle in practice). Theory gives White a slight advantage after 6 ...

In general, 5 ... dxe5 may leave something to be desired; it illustrates the dangers of early simplification when the opponent commands more space. What have we learned by this exercise? For one thing, White seems to have more positive chances after 5 e5 than indicated by what little existing theory is devoted to it. More signifi cantly, we see how one might go about investi gating a position on one's own, and how helpful it is to have general knowledge about structures and their characteristic properties. The Austrian Attack Main Line: 5 ll'Bf3 5 lt'Bf3 (D) With this natural move we return to normal theory. Now in the face of 6 e5 (or 6 .ltd3 and 7 e5), Black has two logical reactions, the natural de veloping move 5 ...O-O and the central counter attack 5 ...c5. We'll try to understand each.

The move's main drawback, obviously, is that the knight is far from the centre and cannot be fully effective in that area of the board. As an instructive les son in positional themes you couldn't do better than to study this variation.

[diagram]
Since 8 ...cxd4 was a positional threat, and since 8 dxc5 lll xc5 brings the knight into the centre with an easy game, White tries to take the c5-square away from the knight and cramp Black's position at the same time. If he gets the chance he will simply forge ahead with his cen tral pawns by e5 and drive Black back, or he might play for f5 in conjunction with moves like Wke 1 -h4. This is all quite dangerous. For the moment, however, it is premature for White to play 8 e5? lllg4! 9 h3 cxd4 10 lll e2 llle3 ! . See how the centre keeps collapsing in these extended-centre lines? White should also avoid 8 .Bxa6? ! cxd4! 9 lll xd4 bxa6 (D). We talk about doubled a-pawns at several points in this book. Generally speaking, the sur render of one's light-squared bishop and ceding of the b-file is a poor deal. Here White's sound position should balance out those advantages; e.g., 1 0 Wkd3 with the idea of Whl and .Be3, or perhaps .Bd2. But L.Barczay-Sandor, Hungary 1 968 showed how easily the active black pieces can create threats: 10 lll b3? a5 ! 1 1 Wkf3 .Bb7 12 a4? (but 12 .Be3 a4 1 3 llld2 a3!) 12 ...

White has one very dangerous alternative: a) 7 .i.e3 lllg4 8 .i.gl e5 9 fxe5 dxe5 10 d5 lll d4 is not clear, but probably Black stands sat isfactorily. b) 7 d5 lllb4 8 .i.'c4 (8 .i.e2 c5 ! ?) 8 ...c6 ! changes the central equation and should be OK after 9 a3 cxd5 10 exd5 llla6 or 10 ... °iVa5 !?. These ideas also show up in the main line with 4 lllf3. c) 7 e5 is not so easy to equalize against, since Black has neither ...c5 nor ...e5 at his dis posal; for example, 7 ... dxe5 8 fxe5 llld7 ! ?

This is still the critical line. Black has held his own for years after 6 dxc5 'iVa5 7 .i.d3 'iVxc5, but this is the variation that most resem bles other openings in its positional themes, and deserves a look. We'll follow Kindermann M.Gurevich, Haifa Echt 1989: 8 'iVe2 O-O (if Black wants to be sure of getting ... .i.g4 in, he can play it now) 9 .i.e3 'iVa5 J O O-O (D). 1 0. .. lll c6 (JO. .. lllbd7 ! ? is a Sicilianesque move that has been tried out, but most players don't want to be so cramped) 1 1 a3 .i.g4 (the move-order has been a bit strange; normally

White's e-pawn is weak. Most of the lines in this whole variation (excluding 6 dxc5) have a positional basis but are also forcing. They should probably be learned by heart. The .tc4 Variation

Black has the bishop-pair and a central majority with a nice f-file. On the other hand, White has a space advantage and Black's squares down the e-file are vulnerable, while at the same time White's knights are nicely cen tralized. Probably it's one of those many chess positions in which, if the owner of the two bish ops (Black) can stabilize the position and avoid serious weaknesses, Illscentre and bishop-pair will assert themselves in the long run. But White looks ready to use his knights and major pieces along the open e-file to prevent that. 6 °iVe2 c6 Black can't stop e5, but this stabilizes the centre.

The exam ples seem to indicate that he can. 10 l:i.adl! Donaldson - Felecan Kona 1998 It's odd, but this position seems the least promising that we have seen thus far for White. He has made no progress on the queenside, Black still has his bishops, and with the knight on e7, the idea of ... f5 has gained force. How ever, White has achieved something that he hasn't been able to do in any other line. So far Black has always successfully traded White's d-pawn after ... c6, allowing him to take over good posts rapidly before White could reorga nize. With threats and piece activity, White's bishops didn't have time to find good positions. But here Black doesn't get ...c6 in because the d-pawn will fall. And .. .f5 is still to be dis cussed, but has its problems. This means that White has time to put his pieces on the appro priate squares and make a pawn-break, either with f4 or c5. 10 .•• .i.d7! Instead of waiting around, Black embarks upon a new idea: queenside expansion. A game of Spassky's is a model of how White should handle the exchange on f3: 1 0. .. .i.xf3 1 1 .i.xf3 ti:Jd7 12 g 3 ! ?

As in Volume 1 , which examines 1 e4, I work from the ground up, starting with the very first moves of each opening to explain its elementary properties. Someone with only a modicum of playing experience should be able to master these fundamentals and use them as a basis for under standing the more sophisticated material that follows. For a primer on the rudimentary principles that apply to all opening play, please refer to Chapter 1 of Volume 1 . The next two chapters of that volume may also be useful, since they identify the ideas and themes most often referred to in the book as a whole. My philosophy is the same in both volumes, but a few points bear repeating. These books are not meant to cover all openings, much less all of their variations; such an undertaking would require scores of volumes. Instead, I have selected systems that I consider the most useful for the sake of explanation and instruction. In the main, these are the most 'important' openings, in that they have had a large following through the years and have a well-developed theoretical underpinning. Within these major openings I have picked a number of variations to study in some detail, based upon the belief that in-depth familiarity with several variations is better than superficial under standing of all. In order to place this selection in context, I leave signposts to indicate the direction in which alternatives may lead. While some of the games and analysis are recent, many classic examples are used to illustrate general points. This is not primarily a theoretical tome: some of the opinions that I venture about the value of hotly-contested individual lines will undoubtedly prove wrong or irrelevant. Instead, my goal is to provide a solid basis for the reader to play openings successfully, emphasizing positional features and techniques that extend to variations beyond those at hand. Notice that this differs from a full ex planation of an opening using concepts specific to that opening. We shall see that individual moves themselves express ideas, whether or not they fit into a general scheme that has previously been set forth. Accordingly, a certain level of detail is absolutely necessary to understand both the consis tent strategies and the anomalies that can render such strategies irrelevant. On a practical level, I have subjected readers to recitations about the niceties of move-orders; the associated issues can be confusing but bear a direct relation to real-world results. Assessments of variations can evolve very rapidly, but how one best arrives at the desired starting points tends not to change much. In the next chapter I examine the fundamental characteristics of 1 d4 and how it differs from 1 e4. You will find further comparisons between these moves in both volumes. The study of 1 d4 by itself will suffice to improve your chess understanding by leaps and bounds, but if you truly aspire to master the game you will want to know as much as possible about the e-pawn openings as well. I sincerely hope that these volumes will help you in both respects.

1 Introduction to 1 d4 and the

Closed Games At the most basic level, 1 d4 might seem to resemble 1 e4. It brings a pawn to the fourth rank to occupy the centre and frees a bishop for action. Very much as the main 'goal' of 1 e4 is to enforce a successful d4, it may be said that after 1 d4 White's goal is to achieve e4. Never theless, even from this most primitive stand point, we can see that 1 e4 only controls one central square (d5) and 1 d4 controls two (d4 and e5). This latter quality accounts for some immediate differences between opening with the queen's pawn and the king's pawn. For ex ample, when we look at the defences to 1 e4, some of them attack e4 directly: the Alekhine Defence (1 e4 tZ'Bf6) and the Scandinavian De fence ( 1 e4 d5). Others allow 2 d4 and then at tack e4 on Black's 2nd move: the Caro-Kann Defence ( 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5), the French Defence (1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5) and the Pirc Defence ( 1 e4 d6

2 d4 tZ'Bf6). But versus 1 d4, none of Black's

major defences attack the d4-pawn, and none even allow 2 e4, i.e., these defences all start with either l .. .d5 or l ...tZ'Bf6, fighting for con trol of e4. It doesn't take much thought to see how that difference arises: after 1 e4 White's e-pawn is unprotected, meaning that attacking it with tempo can bring significant rewards, or at least a temporary initiative. Since White' s d-pawn is already protected by his queen after 1 d4, the chances for Black to gain the initiative by tar geting it are correspondingly low. On the other hand, when he plays 1 d4, White has done nothing to contribute towards castling kingside. In fact, he often follows up with the moves 2 c4, 3 tbc3 and in some cases moves such as 4 .i.f4, 4 .i.g5 or 4 'ifc2, none of which clear the way for kingside castling. One might argue that in such situations White's prospects of queenside castling are enhanced, since early moves by the knight, bishop, and queen clear the road for castling queenside. However, apart from a few attacking lines such as the Exchange Queen's Gambit and the Samisch Variation of the King's Indian, White seldom avails himself of the opportunity to cas tle queenside. As is the case in most chess openings, queenside castling carries with it too many risks in terms of exposing White's king to quick attacks. Then the question becomes whether Black can gain anything from White's delayed king side castling. Can he put pressure on White that requires a degree of compromise in White's strategic plans? Before turning to 1 d4 d5, let's consider the Indian Defences that begin with 1 d4 tDf6. The answer to our question changes with each opening and in each variation. In the main line of the King's Indian Defence, for ex ample, Black puts very little pressure on White while he's getting castled, since his first five moves don't threaten anything or even directly challenge the centre. For example, the main line goes 1 d4 tDf6 2 c4 g6 3 tbc3 .i.g7 4 e4 d6 5 tbf3 O-O 6 .i.e2 with 7 O-O next. As in all major openings, Black's counterplay is based upon a central advance, normally the move ...e5. In that case White has great strategic leeway and

Although no longer holding such an exalted status, 2 ...e6 has remained the most important defence to the Queen's Gambit throughout the years and into the present. In some ways this is strange, because Black imprisons his bishop on c8 behind its own pawns. This is no trivial mat ter, since the bishop won't be able to participate in the struggle to control the centre nor in any active role. As usual, pieces condemned to stay ing on the first rank cause other problems, such as interfering with the connection of the rooks. The struggle to free the light-squared bishop and find a good spot for it is arguably Black's main problem in the Queen's Gambit De clined (a.k.a. 'QGD'). As Kasparov indicates, the theme of finding a role for this bishop per meates the theory of the opening, and even complex ideas can often be reduced to it. The obvious question, then, is why Black would subject himself to a potentially arduous task. What happens if Black doesn't block off his bishop? A superficial explanation concerns the two conventional alternatives. First, accepting the pawn by 2 ... dxc4 immediately cedes the centre to White. And in both Queen's Gambit Ac cepted theory and practice, it turns out that ...e6 is usually played within a few moves, before Black's c8-bishop is developed anyway ! For example, the traditional main line of the Queen's Gambit Accepted is 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 tl:lf3 tl:lf6 4 e3 e6 5 ..txc4 c5, when that bishop is left sitting on its original square behind the e6- pawn. By contrast, the Slav Defence with 2 ...c6 keeps the c8-bishop open for development, but it takes away the best square for Black's queen's knight. The move 2 ...c6 also foregoes ...c5, which is one of Black' s most effective ways to attack White's centre. Furthermore, Black's two main lines in the Slav Defence are hardly per fect solutions to the light-squared bishop prob lem. After 2 ...c6 3 tl:lf3, he can choose the extremely popular Semi-Slav by 3 ... tl:lf6 (or 3 ...e6) 4 tl:lc3 e6, in which case the bishop on c8 is still hemmed in, even more so than after 2 ...e6. The most favourable variation in this re spect is the old main line 3 ... tl:lf6 4 tl:lc3 dxc4 5 a4 ..tf5. While this develops the bishop quite actively, it comes at the cost of giving White a central majority. These variations and associ ated issues will be discussed in detail in the next chapter. Declining the Gambit: Other 2nd Moves After 1 d4 d5 2 c4, the argument for playing 2 ...e6 gains force when one investigates less played responses to 2 c4 which don't imprison Black's bishop on c8. This book is not encyclo paedic and I certainly won't analyse many side-variations in detail. But in this case it's ex tremely valuable to examine the ideas associ ated with those deviations from both 2 ... e6 and 2 ...c6, including their good points and the prob lems that accompany them. In each case, Black wants to keep the c8-bishop's path open and leave the c6-square free for his knight on b8. These lines are terribly instructive and hope fully useful. Marshall Defence

What could be simpler? Black develops a piece, defends the pawn on d5, and leaves the c8-bishop with a clear path to the outside world. It's interesting that if you show this posi tion to even fairly experienced players and ask how they would proceed, many will react by suggesting 3 cxd5 tl:lxd5 4 e4, which certainly is natural: White thereby forms the ideal centre with the gain of a tempo. Then if Black plays 4 ...tl:lf6, the obvious response is 5 tl:lc3 (5 e5 tl:ld5 leaves Black comfortably placed on the

...c6) idea comes up in the Torre Attack (with j_g5), London System (with j_f4), the Veresov Attack ( 1 d4 d5 2 tl:lc3 tl:lf6 3 j_g5), several variations of the King's Indian Defence, and a host of other openings. The fact that 4 tl:lf3 was clearly superior to 4 e4 in this simple example illustrates that White needs to refrain from occupying the centre with his pawns until he is sure that those pawns can not be attacked to good effect. For instance, Black may be able to compel White's centre pawns to advance, or get the opportunity to ex change one or both of them. The problem is ob vious enough, but often White's decision is not an easy one to make. This basic situation will arise throughout the openings that we are study ing. Baltic Defence

This is another counterattacking defence that refuses to acknowledge the need to defend against cxd5. It is a more serious challenge to the Queen's Gambit than the second moves of the preceding two variations. Black sacrifices a pawn following 3 dxe5 d4! and hopes that the cramping effect of his advanced pawn will limit White's pieces while giving him freer de velopment. There normally follows 4 tZ'lf3 tZ'lc6

Unlike the 2nd-move variations seen above, White has neither an ideal centre nor tactical threats. But he does have an extra pawn and good development. White has a choice between

5 g3 and 5 tZ'lbd2 (moves like 5 a3 are also

played but held in lesser regard). This is not a

Then he attacks the pawn on b7 and threat ens .i.xf6 to win the pawn on d5. So it seems as though the best move to get to the Exchange Variation is to play 3 lll c3. But about playing 3 lllf3 ( D )? Players frequently get to this and related po sitions via other move-orders. For example, the opening might go 1 d4 'll f6 2 c4 e6, and White may not want to play 3 lll c3 because he'll have to go up against 3 ... .i.b4, the Nimzo-Indian De fence. This is the feeling of many strong mas ters, whose solution is to play 3 'll f3. Then Black in tum may want to play 3 ... d5, transpos ing to a form of the Queen's Gambit below. No tice that if you're playing Black and you like the Nimzo-Indian Defence, this can be an effective move-order, because it gets White to commit his knight to f3, a move which is generally less feared if Black now plays 3 ... d5. But is there any drawback to that strategy? Let's see. After

1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 ll:lf3, Black will play 3 ...

lllf6 ( D) here most of the time. In the Move-Orders section at the end of this chapter, I've gone into a lot of detail about the differences between having played lllc3 or 'll f3. The most important thing to understand is that if you get to the Exchange Variation, it would probably be in the following way: 4 lllc3 .i.e7 5 cxd5 exd5 6 .i.g5 O-O 7 e3 c6 (D). White's knight is committed to f3. I'll refer to this as the 'Carlsbad Variation' (the corre sponding pawn-structure is called the 'Carls bad pawn-structure' or 'Carlsbad formation'). There's nothing wrong with this position, as we'll see, but having the knight on f3 has limited White's freedom of choice. We'll look at this po sition at great length in the Exchange Variation section later on. Many players as White prefer to develop their king's knight from g l to e2, and now they've lost that option. There's more to think about when White plays the order 3 lllf3 'll f6 4 lllc3; Black can even avoid the Exchange Variation altogether, without having to concede much. I've said a lit tle about that below. 3 .•• lll f6 (D) This is the move that we shall look at first. It has easily been the most common choice for Black over the years. 19th-century practice of 1 d4 d5 by the world's best players usually led to this position, and in fact to the positions stem ming from both sides' next few moves. The only other move that was employed fairly con sistently was 3 ... c5 (the Tarrasch Variation), al though it was put under a bit of a cloud for some time by 4 cxd5 exd5 5 lll f3 lllc6 and now Rubinstein's move 6 g3. That's still the line that most dissuades Black from the Tarrasch. Only

much later, particularly since the 1960s, was 3 ... lll f6 challenged in terms of effectiveness by 3 ... i.e7, an important variation called the 'Ala- tortsev' which is examined in its own section. 4 i.g5 White heads for the traditional main line, which goes 4 i.g5 i.e7 5 e3 O-O 6 'll f3. Instead 4 cxd5 exd5 5 i.g5 is finally the 'real' Ex change Variation, which we'll be looking at carefully later. As I described above, 4 lll f3 ( D) is an impor tant move-order for a couple of reasons. First, it arises via 3 lllf3 lllf6 4 lllc3 as well. Again I'll refer you to the Move-Orders sec tion at the end of this chapter for a lengthier dis cussion. But there are a couple of points that you might find useful: a) After 4 lll f3, Black can choose to play 4 ... dxc4. This introduces the Vienna Variation, which is a very complex opening. You may want to consider playing that as Black. As White, you can't avoid the V ienna V ariation if you play ll:lf3 and lllc3 on the 3rd and 4th moves. That probably means you'll want to put a little study time into it, as explained at the end of the chapter. b) I should also point out that Black can still prevent White from getting into any kind of true Exchange Variation by fiddling with move orders. For example, after 4 lllf3, Black can play 4 ... i.e7, and if 5 cxd5 exd5 6 i.g5, then Black plays 6 .. . c6 with the idea 7 e3 i.f5. That is probably easier for Black to play than the true Exchange Variation. On the other hand, by using that order (1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 'llc3 ll:lf6 4 lllf3 i.e7), Black does allow 5 i.f4, an important variation that I won't be covering in detail but will touch upon at the end of the chapter. So much for early move-orders. We can't avoid the transpositions from one line to an other, but at least you've got the basics. Now let's continue stepping through our main line -we return to 4 i.g5 (D):

4 ... i.e7 Black unpins the knight. We'll look quickly at some weaker moves: a) 4 ... h6? 5 i.xf6 creates serious problems for Black, who must either accede to the iso lated doubled pawns resulting from 5 .. . gxf6 6 cxd5 exd5, or lose a pawn by 5 ... 'iYxf6 6 cxd5 exd5 (6... c6 7 dxc6 lllxc6 8 ll:lf3) 7 'llxd5 'iYd6 8 e4, etc. b) Also favouring White is 4 ... c5?! 5 cxd5 cxd4 (5 ... exd5 6 i.xf6! gxf6 7 'llf3 and Black's pawn-structure is shattered while he's behind in development) 6 'iYxd4 i.e7 (6 ... 'll c6 7 i.xf6!

A funny position. This strongly resembles the Tartakower Variation that I shall discuss later, but with options for White that don' t exist in that sequence, because he hasn't committed his knight to f3. 1 1. .. .ltb7

exchanging pieces. Normally you'd think that the resulting position would be much more cramped than the original - certainly Black hasn't done anything to solve his problem with the bishop on c8, while the bishop on e7 was a pretty good piece. But it turns out that the combination of a queen on e7 and knight on d7 can enforce the freeing advance ... e5, which will finally give that light-squared bishop some breathing room. The drawback to all this is that it takes time, and there's no reason why White can't mount an attack when there have been only two sets of minor pieces exchanged. 8 iLxe7 'flixe7 9 .:!.cl White develops his rook so as not to lose time with 9 .ltd3 lbxc3 1 0 bxc3 dxc4 11 iLxc4. This is only one of several moves. a) For some time it was thought that White could gain some advantage after 9 cxd5 lbxc3 1 0 bxc3 exd5 1 1 'flib3, but his lead in develop ment has vanished and his extra centre pawn is easily restrained. The main line goes 1 l .. . .l:i.d8 1 2 c4 (1 2 .lte2 has several answers, including 1 2 ... lbc6, eyeing the light squares via . .. lba5, as in the game) 1 2. .. dxc4 1 3 .ltxc4 (D).

An instructive position, because White has two central pawns to Black's none, and even potential pressure down the c-file. But he hasn't castled yet, often an issue in openings stemming from 1 d4. Here Black will develop quickly to harass White's pieces before he can get orga nized: 1 3 ... lbc6! (this threatens ... lba5; time is more important than structure) 1 4 'flic3 (the old move, to cover a5 and keep the bishop on c4; not much better is 1 4 ile2!? b6! 1 5 O-O .ltb7, or here 1 5. .. ile6 1 6 'flic3 .ltd5 also has its points; after that move Black can even think about challenging White's kingside by ... .l:.d6-g6) 1 4. .. .ltg4 (rapid development!) 1 5 O-O (1 5 .lte2 .ltxf3 forces 16 gxf3 anyway in view of 1 6 iLxf3? lbxd4) 1 5. .. ilxf3 1 6 gxf3 'flif6 17 .lte2 .l:i.ac8 18 .l:.ab l b6 19 .l:.fc l lbe7 ! 20 @hl .l:.d5 and in Karpov-Y usupov, London Ct (5) 1989 Black had no problems and even a modest at tack. b) 9 'flic2 is certainly natural, intending to stop . . .e5 cold after 9 ... lbxc3 1 0 'iYxc3, but then Black can play 1 0 ... dxc4 (1 0. .. lbc6!? is worthy of consideration) 1 1 iLxc4 c5! , his al ternative freeing move. Then White finally catches up in development by 1 2 O-O, and Black has time to protect his centre by 1 2 ... lbd7 with ...cxd4 and/or ... b6 to follow. Theory rates this as equal, but perhaps it's a place for White to in vestigate further in the hunt for a small advan tage. We now return to the position after 9 .l:i.c 1

(D):

9 ... c6 It seems strange to put more pawns on light squares. But this time we can easily grasp the idea: Black wants to play ... e5, so he has to pro tect the pawn on d5 first. More important is the manner in which he does it. White must now try to find a useful move, and capturing the knight by I 0 lbxe4 dxe4 1 1 lbd2 e5 ! has long been known to be equal. Instead, 9 ... lbxc3 1 0 .l:i.xc3 dxc4? 1 1 iLxc4 would leave White a valuable tempo ahead of the game. 10 .ltd3 lbxc3 11 .l:i.xc3 dxc4 12 iLxc4 1 2 .l:.xc4 is sometimes played, but that's a different story.

1 2. . . 'lld7 1 3 O-O (D) At this point we'll look at two games, one a well-known classic of attack (with Black play ing 1 3 ... e5), and the other a typical old-style Queen's Gambit with positional manoeuvring (with Black playing 1 3 ... b6). Incidentally, Sad ler suggests 1 3 ... c5! ?. It's quite logical, and something to consider if Black's standard plans all come up short or you simply don't like them.

The obvious idea is to avoid the potential sequence of ... e4 and . . . lll b6 with an attack on the valuable bishop on c4, followed by bringing out Black's c8-bishop, his problem piece. White also introduces a little threat. This can be seen by comparing the old line 1 4 dxe5 lllxe5 1 5 lllxe5 'iYxe5 1 6 f4 'iYe4, after which 1 7 j,,d3? ! allows 1 7. .. �xe3+; then lengthy analysis shows that Black can escape with his extra pawn. But with the bishop on b3, White threatens 1 5 dxe5 lllxe5 1 6 tllxe5 �xe5 1 7 f4, when l 7 ... �e4 could be answered by 1 8 .ltc2 followed by 19 e4 and t o great effect, since White's central majority would be mobilized. Needless to say, Black won't wait around for that to happen. 14 ...exd4 There have been a few games since this one in which Black tried to delay opening up the po sition so quickly. These alternatives may be playable but they have led to some attractive wins for White:

From Black's point of view, we see the same structure occurring in the main-line Slav ll'Bh4xf5 variations, and the Nimzo-Indian with ... �f5 and �xf5, among other openings. One of the ideas of allowing ... ll'Bxf4 is that White's central pawns will clamp down on the freeing move . . . e5.

One motivation for Capablanca' s Varia tion was to avoid certain orders in the Lasker Variation; for example, ones in which White exchanges on e4 after 6 ...h6 7 ..th4 tl'Be4, or the line in which White plays 8 ..txe7 Wixe7 9 cxd5 tl'Bxc3 10 bxc3 exd5 1 1 °iVh3. See the section on the Lasker Variation to make sense of that ex planation. As it turns out, however, neither of those ideas is particularly effective for White, so the relevant difference between the two vari ations has to do with the h-pawn, which is ei ther on h6 (in the Lasker Variation) or on h7 (in the Capablanca Variation). You'll see what I mean in the discussion about 1 1 O-O below. At this juncture I'll concentrate upon the unique move 1 1 tl'Be4 (A), with a briefer look at

1 1 O-O (B).

11 tl'Be4 (D) This was Alekhine's solution in his World Championship match versus Capablanca and later in a famous game versus Lasker. White's idea is to keep the pieces on and mobilize his centre later. It still has promise. 11• •. tl'i5f6 Black retreats in order to challenge White's knight. He still intends . . . e5 if possible. It is the best-known move. Black shouldn't play 1 1 ...e5?! immediately, if only because 1 2 O-O!

Further more, 1 1 ...Wib4+ 1 2 Wid2 Wixd2+ 1 3 'iit xd2!, from Alekhine-Capablanca, Buenos Aires W ch (6) 1927, is a thankless position for Black. This queenless middlegame features White's cen tralized king and mobile centre pawns, whereas Black hasn't solved the problem of his queen's bishop. And of course, Black's weakness at d6 doesn't help matters. Nevertheless, Black's position after 1 1 tl'Be4 is fundamentally sound, so arguably he can keep things in hand by l 1 .. .b6 with the simple idea . . . i.b7 and ...c5.

6 tl\f3 h6 7 i.h4 b6 (D) Now we are moving into a territory of more complex and usually more dynamic positions than we saw in the Lasker and Capablanca vari ations, which after all were aimed at exchang ing pieces and reaching some kind of simplified equality. After 7 ... b6 pieces tend to stay on the board longer, and the resulting unbalanced situ ation creates difficult and double-sided play. What is Black doing? It's not so mysterious, at least not to begin with. He'll play . . . i.b7, shor ing up d5. That allows him to play for the freeing move ...c5, often prepared by ... tl'ibd7. Notice that the move 7 ...c5?! straightaway would ex pose the unprotected status of d5 after 8 dxc5 i.xc5 9 cxd5 exd5 10 �c l (for example), when Black will have to take up a passive position merely to hold on to his material. By playing ... b6 and . . . i.b7 first, the move ...c5 will defi nitely be on the cards, and ... tl'Be4 at the right moment can also be effective. White has a large number of strategies rang ing from simple exchanges to exertion of long term pressure by clamping down upon any free ing move by Black, especially ...c5. In almost all cases White restrains his own aggressive ness until Black's position is under control. It turns out that Black can answer this method of play in two very different ways. In many lines Black is the one trying to mix things up; he wants to do this before falling into some kind of static disadvantage. This can involve pawn sac rifices for activity and other tactical devices.

36 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

However, in a majority of variations he will gain the bishop-pair, so that gives him a choice: he can still look for energetic unbalancing moves but he also has the option of consolidat ing his position before slowly opening up the game on the bishops' behalf. In those cases it may be White who undertakes a vigorous ad vance before he loses the long-run battle. It is this unpredictability and potential dynamism that attracts players to the Tartakower Variation. In order to gain familiarity with the positions, and to achieve some depth of understanding, rll concentrate on just a few of both players' set-ups by looking at a series of games. Fortu nately, the ideas cross over into other lines of the Tartakower, and of the Queen's Gambit in general. The Older Exchange Line 8 cxd5 This is the older move, which received a lot of attention before it began to appear that White might get better chances by complicating the situation instead. Nevertheless, some players still use 8 cxd5, and very rich positions can re sult.

many Tartakower variations (although there are usually more pieces on the board). As we discussed in Chapter 3 of Volume 1 , Black' s c5- and d5-pawns are called 'hanging pawns' . Whether they are good or bad depends upon how well protected they are, how mobile they are, and what activity can be generated around them. In this kind of position White wants to restrain the advance of the pawns for the mo ment and then target them, much as one fights against an isolated pawn. For this purpose he has pinned Black' s pawn on c5 and can in crease the pressure on it down the c-file. The move ...d4 isn't on the cards (yet), and an im portant idea (executed in the Fischer-Spassky game below) will be to force one pawn to ad vance so as to blockade both. Black's position has its own good points. The c5-square is well defended, and Black will normally play ... tl'Bd7 to reinforce its protection. Then the b-file can be a real asset. Black can ap proach the situation in two ways: a) he can try to attack White's b-pawn down the open file and provoke the move b3, after which ...a5-a4 or ...a5 and . . . 'i¥b7-b4 is possi ble; or b) he can simply play ...c4 without provoca tion because, although that permanently gives up the d4-square, it also discourages the move b3 and facilitates an attack down the b-file. You'll see these ideas in more than one line of the Tartakower Defence. 15 i.e2 as 16 tl'Bd4 Also a standard idea. The knight can go to b3 in order to put pressure on Black's c-pawn, or in some cases White will exchange the bishop on e6. Now Black plays a surprising move: 16• .• tl'Ba6! 17 ..txa6 Else the knight comes to b4.

colour. What' s the point? Essentially it's that Black' s bishop is poorly placed for this pawn structure. It was actually better on c8, so the reasoning goes. And as we mentioned above, Black's bishop very often retreats from b7 to c8 and then (usually) goes to e6. So White in that case has gained one move by taking two moves to capture the knight! In the meantime, why is White giving up the bishop-pair? Essentially, he feels that it' s a sufficiently controlled posi tion that he can use his well-placed knights to make progress, probably with a pawn advance before Black' s bishops find good homes for themselves. Black on the other hand thinks that as long as his queenside pawn-structure can't be compromised by White (by means of b4-b5, for example), and as long as the advance e4 isn't effective, he will be able to open the game at his discretion and use the bishop-pair to his advan tage. It' s easiest to understand this by exam ples:

The main line, which is now used by a large majority of masters. White tries to hold down . . .c5 and also prepares a minority attack by b5 in some positions. There are several fascinating alternatives ( I I °i¥b3, for example) that you may find it interesting to research for yourself. I think that it is more useful, however, to see 1 1 b4 in depth.

The queen move in tends to preserve White's good light-squared bishop and take advantage of the position of Black's on f5. 8 .•. tt:'Bf6 Kasparov was on the other side of the board and played 8 . . . tt:'Bd7 9 f3 tt:'Bb6 1 0 e4 .te6 in Karpov-Kasparov, London/Leningrad Wch (7)

White doesn't want Black's knight settling in on e4. What's more, f3 prepares g4 in some cases so as to gain space and drive away Black's bishop. 9 ...c5?! It's hard to believe that this move in combi nation with the next constitutes a positional mistake, but perhaps Black should be more pa tient. The straightforward 9 ... h5, stopping g4 (as well as .th6), was played ten years later in Topalov-Karpov, Wijk aan Zee 1 998. That game continued 10 .td3 .txd3 1 1 'iVxd3 tt:'Ba6 1 2 tt:'ige2 tt:'Bc7 1 3 O-O tt:'Be6 14 .te5 and it' s fair to say that White has some advantage; Topalov went on to win. Needless to say there have been other games in this line before and since. 10 .th6! (D)

White ignores his development to stop cas tling, and he prevents . . .h5.

This exchange turns out to hurt Black badly, both on the e-file and on the kingside. Maybe moves such as dxc5 and .tg7xf6 or g4-g5 were becoming problems, but probably not with White still undeveloped. Therefore Black could try 10 ... tt:'Bc6; e.g., 1 1 dxc5?! ( 1 1 .tb5 ! a6 1 2 .txc6+ bxc6 1 3 tt:'ige2 gives White some ad vantage due to Black's castling situation; 1 1 g4 is well answered by 1 l ....te6) l 1 . ...txc5 (or l 1 ...d4 ! ?) 12 .tg7 .l:i.g8 1 3 .txf6 'iVxf6 14 tt:'Bxd5 'iVd6 1 5 e4 O-O-O with a lot of open lines for a pawn. 11 exd4 (D)

This doesn't look good for Black. For start ers, White's queen protects his bishop on h6, so that it is ready to take over that square after a possible exchange. And in general White's de velopment is easy, while Black needs to untan gle his pieces. 11• .•a6 1 1 ...

You should commit this pawn-structure to memory: it's almost always better for White!

There are multiple paths and obstacles for both sides to get to or avoid the main lines. Fortu nately, most of these were already discussed in the introduction to this chapter. Here I'd like to fill out some variations that we've missed.

[diagram]
Here 3 tt:'Bf3 tt:'Bf6 4 tt:'Bc3 .lte7 5 cxd5 exd5 6 .ltg5 is a possible path to the Carlsbad Varia tion, which is one of our two main lines in this section, but Black is not forced to play that way (as explained there, 6 ... c6 and . . . .ltf5 may avoid it). All major issues with an early tt:'Bf3 are gone over in the chapter introduction. There are more details at the end of the chapter. 3 .•. tt:'Bf6 4 cxd5 ( D)

4. ..

exd5 4 ...tt:'Bxd5 can transpose to a line of the Semi- Tarrasch (the standard sequence for which is 4 tt:'Bf3 c5, when 5 cxd5 tt:'Bxd5 6 e4 tt:'Bxc3 7 bxc3 can follow). White's most aggressive approach (and Black's most confrontational reply) is 5 e4 tt:'Bxc3 6 bxc3 c5 7 tt:'Bf3 (this completes the transposition; 7 l:i.bl !? is interesting, to prevent . . . .ltb4+ in some lines; by targeting b7, White hinders the development of Black's queen's bishop) 7 ... cxd4 8 cxd4 .ltb4+ 9 .ltd2 .ltxd2+ 10 'iVxd2 (D). We've arrived at the starting point of many a famous battle. Most lower-ranked players don't like to concede the ideal centre to White, who can advance his central pawns to make a passed pawn or aim his forces at Black's king. But Black has no weaknesses and can think about taking over queenside light squares as he does in the Griinfeld Defence. The variation as a whole is probably more difficult for Black to play than for White. I won't discuss the line ex cept to show the famous example Polugaev sky-Tal, USSR Ch (Moscow) 1 969, in which

'iVd6! ? would keep the knight in the centre and prevent 'iVf4; that looks like a good way to play it) 1 5 .ltd3 .l:!.c8 (D). Here White initiates the key manoeuvre 1 6 d5 ! exd5 1 7 e5 ! . For a pawn, he has blocked Black's bishop and freed his own, winning the d4-square for a knight while targeting Black's king. The last factor proved decisive: l 7 ... Cllc4 18 'iVf4!

The threat is Clle7+ and if Black's rook strays, h6-h7 decides. Let's return to 4 ... exd5 (D): We've reached the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit, written about in great detail in countless books and articles. One reason for this, perhaps even the main one, is that the im portant strategic ideas are so clear and defin able, and thus easy to write about. They can be presented in a relatively simple fashion or with more detail, depending upon the level of so phistication the writer wants to indulge in. The particular version of queenside minority attack that arises from the Exchange Variation, for ex ample, is the standard one given in almost ev ery textbook, with a host of well-known set-ups for both sides. However, the more carefully that you scrutinize the Exchange Variation, the more you appreciate the subtleties that inform its execution in practice. Right off, we see that in most variations none or only one pair of mi nor pieces is exchanged up to the start of the middlegame. Ordinarily, any opening with such properties allows for complex and original play. Most Tartakower Defence lines in the Classical Queen' s Gambit fit that description, and it is no coincidence that the Exchange and Tartakower are by far the two most popular QGD variations in modem grandmaster chess. We should start with the basics. Why would White free Black's light-squared bishop, his problem piece in the variations that we have ex amined thus far? Doesn't this negate the whole point of playing 2 c4? White gets the c-file, to be sure, but Black gets the e-file, arguably a more important one. I think the answers to this question are more accidental than logical. It turns out that in this precise position Black nor mally has no particularly good square for his liberated queen's bishop and must be satisfied with the passive move ... .lte6 (or - often worse - ...b6 and ... .ltb7). Why? In the first place White usually develops by .ltd3 and/or 'iVc2

48 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

and prevents ... i.f5, whereas ... i.g4 is either impossible, because one of the moves f3 or h3 has already been played, or undesirable, be cause the move f3 is extremely valuable even if Black' s bishop retreats to g6 via h5. The other strong point behind cxd5 is that now, if and when Black tries to attack White' s centre via . . .c5, he has to reckon with the idea of dxc5, isolating Black's d-pawn (this is especially true if White has occupied f3 with a knight and not a pawn). In most variations, the arrangement of Black' s pieces is not such that the isolated pawn is compensated for by his activity, as it so often is in other openings (in the Exchange Vari ation, for example, you will see a knight on d7 rather than the more active c6). Thus variables not already inherent in the pawn-structure, i.e., the particularities of piece dispositions, happen to favour White's otherwise illogical exchange on d5. Note that these are exceptional charac teristics that are not shared by other Exchange Variations, such as those in the French Defence ( 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 exd5) or the Slav ( 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 cxd5 cxd5). 5 i.g5 (D)

Actually, some writers call this the starting position of the Exchange Variation 'Proper' , because i.g5 is part of the standard set-up. At some point in the naming process, however, things become ambiguous and there's no point in fretting over subtleties. 5 ... i.e7 There are a number of other move-orders, but in this position the most significant alternatives tend to converge upon the positions and struc tures that follow. An important side-variation is 5 ... c6 6 e3 (6 'iVc2 prevents Black' s next, but that's another move that is associated with nu merous subvariations) 6 ... i.f5 7 'iVf3 ! i.g6 8 i.xf6 'iVxf6 9 'iVxf6 gxf6 (D). It looks ridiculous to allow White to get into an ending with Black having weak doubled pawns and no positive chances, but especially at master level there are players who don't nec essarily mind playing with a slightly worse po sition if they think they can ultimately achieve a drawn result. Fortunately most of us aren't like that; and anyway, in a real game there are al ways plenty of chances to win. The variation which seems to have the most promise for White at this point in time is 10 tt:'Bf3 tt:'Bd7 1 1 tt:'Bh4 (or 1 1 g3 followed by tt:'Bh4) 1 l ...tt:'Bb6 (Black in tends to play ... tt:'Bc8-d6 to protect the vulnerable f5-square) 1 2 g3; for example, 12 ... tt:'Bc8 1 3 f3 tt:'Bd6 14 '1ii> f2. This is a position in which Black will generally have to wait around while White can try several plans in order to make progress. An example with a different move-order but not radically different strategy is Van Wely-Short, Wijk aan Zee 2005: 1 0 tt:'Bf3 tt:'Bd7 1 1 tt:'Bh4 i.e7 1 2 g3 tt:'Bb6 1 3 f3 a5 14 @f2 a4 15 .l:i.c l tt:'Bc8 16 i.e2 tt:'Bd6 17 .l:i.hd 1 O-O 1 8 i.d3 .l:i.fe8 1 9 g4 i.f8 20 tt:'Be2 i.h6 2 1 f4 i.xd3 22 .l:!.xd3 i.f8 23 tt:'Bg3 .l:i.a5 24 .l:i.c2 .l:i.b5 25 tt:'ihf5 tt:'Bc4 26 b3 axb3 27 .l:i.xb3 .l:i.xb3 28 axb3 tt:'Ba5 29 tt:'Bh5 .l:!.e6 30 .l:i.a2 b6 31 .l:i.a4 1-0. Impressive, although naturally Black has alternatives. If he wants to enter into the 7 'iVf3 i.g6 line, Black should study what White's logical set-ups are and specifically how to respond to them. For his part, White has to decide whether to avoid the ending altogether in favour of more complex play.

QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECUNED 49

We now return to the position after 5 ... i..e7

(D):

6 e3 6 'iVc2 can be played here, perhaps to prevent an early ... i..f5. It's worth noting that in some variations with 'iVc2 and O-O-O soon thereafter, Black's most dangerous idea is to play ...c5, hopefully quickly, in order to exert pressure down the c-file and in some cases to put his knight on c6, where it is a bit closer to White's king. And there are other problems for White when he plays an early 'iVc2, particularly (but not limited to) situations in which he has devel oped his knight to f3: Black can play ...g6, with the idea of ... i..f5, gaining a tempo or exchang ing a good bishop on d3. Also, Black's knight will sometimes develop via a6, irritating White because of the possibility of ... tt:'Bb4 but also leaving open the manoeuvre ... tt:'Bc7-e6, which has the same result as the conventional route ... tt:'ibd7-f8-e6. For all that, Black can only try one plan at a time, and White has ways of trying to counter each one, so 6 'iVc2 is certainly play able. The following game isn't the most pertinent example of 'iVc2 ideas, but at least it begins that way. I present it for those of you who think that the Queen's Gambit Declined is boring. The ac tual move-order of this game is slightly differ ent from the one we've been following. Guseinov - Magomedov Dushanbe 1999

[diagram]
exd5 6 i..g5 c6 7 'iVc2 (D) So far so normal: White plays 'iVc2 so as to prevent ... i..f5. He has also delayed e3 in order to retain the possibility of playing e4 without wasting time. 7 ... tt:'Ba6 Black develops his knight to the side of the board. As noted, this combines the idea of . . . tt:'Bb4 with that of ... tt:'Bc7-e6, a standard cen tralization in the Exchange Variation. 8 a3 Before undertaking central action, White an ticipates Black's planned attack by ... g6, ... tt:'Bb4 and . . . i..f5. By stopping ... tt:'Bb4, however, he uses up a precious tempo.

8...g6 9 e4 tt:'Bxe4! 10 tt:'Bxe4 tt:'Bc7! ! (D)

Amazing. Black remains a piece down for a moment in order to regain it favourably. This isn't just a clever move, but a necessity if Black wants to avoid the significant disadvan tage that would follow both 1 0. .. i..f5 1 1 i..xa6 i..xe4 1 2 'iVc3 and 1 0. . .dxe4 1 1 'iVxe4. 11 'iVcS!?

50 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

This move prevents Black from castling but works out badly. Both sides have options on al most every move, and strategy has to some ex tent been superseded by tactics. But there are a few points at which the game is informative in a positional sense. 11 ..• dxe4 12 'ii' e5 .l:i.f8 13 'ii' xe4 .ltf5 14 'ii' e3!? It's not clear whether this i s objectively best, but notice that 14 'ii' xe7+ 'ii' xe7+ 15 .ltxe7 @xe7 (D) is the kind of position strong players will do almost anything to avoid: White's d-pawn will ultimately be lost (for example by exchanging off White's knight on f3), and with accurate play the game will end in Black's favour. Hence the retreat of the queen, which at least leads to complications.

Since ...c6 will only encourage b5, and . . . c5 has been stopped, White stands better both on the queenside and in the centre. This all depends, of course, upon whether Black can't simply grab the unprotected b-pawn.

queenside pawns from advancing and then im prove the positions of his pieces. If Black doesn't allow White's knight to f4, it may even make the journey tbg l -e2-g3-f5 to Kasparov's favourite square for a knight. The key for White is not to exchange pieces. With the two rooks and two minor pieces each remaining, the op posite-coloured bishops will favour the side with the superior position. Incidentally, there was no profound incon sistency or logical error in Black's strategy of gaining time by omitting ...c6. The specifics of the situation, expressed by the tactic 10 b4!, was an unfortunate accident of the position. In the event, Black had to make an extra queenside pawn move after all ( 1 0. ..a6), and yet another follows:

tt:Jbd7 (D) In this position, still following the main line of the Exchange Variation, White makes a con sequential decision. Where he puts his king's knight will determine the nature of further play. First, we look at putting it on f3 (the Carlsbad Variation), and then on e2 (the Modem Ex change Variation). Carlsbad Variation 9 ll:Bf3 (D) As explained more than once, the move tZ:lf3 may not actually be a decision now, but one already made at an earlier stage. Because so many players use move-orders with an early tZ:lf3, even 1 d4 d5 2 tZ:lf3, the Carlsbad Varia tion is more important in practice than the Modern Exchange Variation. It is as strategi cally rich as any other QGD variation. By putting his knight on f3, White gives up the plan of f3 and e4 for the time being. But the knight controls e5 and can go there at the right moment, and then there can follow either f3 or the ambitious f4. Apart from that there are an array of other choices including playing e4, by which White takes on an isolated pawn in order to attack (usually after placing rooks on d l and el). The most famous strategy of all is the mi nority attack by b4-b5. When one includes other variations in which it occurs, thousands of games have been played using the minority

attack and thousands of pages written about it. As indicated before, the ideas behind the attack are relatively simple and easy to understand. Not surprisingly, actually putting them into practice is an art that depends upon profound understanding of the timing and therefore feasi bility of each plan. The interesting thing about the Carlsbad Vari ation is that White can mix and match these plans, switching from one to another in mid stream! That factor makes it one of the most strategically complicated lines in chess and, I think, a much more difficult variation than the Modem Exchange with i..d3 and tbge2. Black needs to react to all this and can do so by knowing the major themes. As is the situa tion with White's ideas, the relevant manoeuv res have to be timed according to circum stance. Black's most rudimentary freeing plan is ... tbe4, which White avoids in certain lines and allows in others. Another favourite idea is to try to get some sort of kingside attack. This includes the move ... i..d6 in a majority of such cases. For example, White will often play i..xf6 in order to divert Black's bishop to f6 and speed up his minority attack by b4. Then, even at the cost of two tempi, Black will use the time for ...i.. e7-d6. Another standard idea is to chal lenge White on his own turf on the queenside. That can involve an early ...a5, or ...a6 with ...b5 (perhaps with ... tZ:lb6-c4 to follow). 9 . . . l:.e8 This is almost always played. Black takes over the e-file in preparation for an eventual ... tbe4 and clears the way for ... tbf8 in order to protect h7. It's also very useful to play ... tbg6 or ... tbe6 in many variations. 10 o-o tt::i rs (D) At this point White has many reasonable moves. Let's see some games. 11 l:.abl Karpov - Ljubojevic Linares 1989 We'll start with one of the oldest moves, pre paring the direct b4-b5. Karpov plays White, which is interesting because he was the most prominent player to begin using 1 1 h3 (as played in the next few games). After you see this game you'll wonder why he switched!

This is the traditional anti-Carlsbad proce dure. Essentially, Black wants clarification and a strong central presence to counteract White's on the queenside. A good alternative is the queenside restraint plan by 1 1 .. .a5, usually followed up by some sort of kingside attack ( ... tbg6, ...i..d6).

I think that practice shows how difficult it is to make some kind of general principle about piece combinations with this pawn-structure. Further more, Black's pieces are more actively placed here than we are used to, with the knight, bishop and queen all potentially covering c5.

Before getting to more complicated mate rial, let me repeat what I said about the immedi ate exchange of pawns, 3 cxd5 exd5 (D ), in the introduction to this chapter, adding some de tails. The sequence actually called the Exchange Variation goes 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lLic3 lLif6 4 cxd5 exd5, generally with 5 .i.g5. But if White tries to get to that position by 3 cxd5 exd5 4 lLic3, Black doesn't have to reply 4 ... lLif6. He can play 4 ...c6. Then 5 .i.f4 is outside the realm of a true Exchange Variation and anyway, Black can equalize easily by 5 ... .i.d6, or go for more by 5 ... .i.f5. Notice that this differs from the important Alatortsev Variation, which goes 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lLic3 .i.e7 (which has its own section above). In that case, after 4 cxd5 exd5 5 .i.f4, Black would have to use up an extra tempo to play 5 ... .i.d6, and the move 5 ... .i.f5? is simply bad after 6 'tfVb3. Conclusion: even though the Alatortsev order doesn't permit White to play an Exchange Variation, there is no automatic equalizer for Black after the moves 4 cxd5 exd5 5 .i.f4.

3 Slav and Semi-Slav

1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 (

D)

In this chapter we'll be investigating the Slav complex, embracing all variations of the Queen's Gambit that begin with 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6. The Slav Defence is long-established as one of Black's most solid and effective answers to 1 d4. Max Euwe famously used the opening in his world championship matches versus Ale khine in the 1930s, and in the last two decades various forms of it (including the Semi-Slav, discussed in this chapter) have grown tremen dously in popularity. Chess professionals in particular have found that the Slav's solidity is complemented by the dynamic counterattacks which can arise if White plays aggressively for an advantage The Slav move 2 ...c6 reinforces Black's d5- pawn and it therefore begs comparison with the Queen's Gambit Declined (a.k.a. 'QGD': 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6). In the QGD, Black's second move 2 ...e6 blocks off his own bishop on c8, making development of that piece difficult. That is not true of the Slav Defence, although 2 ...c6 uses up the c6-square, which in most openings is the best square for Black's queen's knight. This elimination of a possible ... lLic6, Black's 'ideal' development, is considered to be a prime draw back of 2 ...c6. A comparison of these two open ings' respective disadvantages, however, would seem to favour the Slav over the Queen's Gam bit Declined, since after 1 d4 d5 the move ...lLic6 tends to be fairly ineffective anyway. A much more important consideration is that in the Slav, Black has wasted a tempo if he wants to play the important move ...c5, so often a key move (or positional threat) in the QGD. It's also revealing to compare the respective Exchange Variations of these two openings. In the Queen's Gambit Declined, I d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lLic3 lLif6 4 cxd5 exd5 gives White a 2- 1 central pawn-majority (a desirable feature for him); whereas in the Slav, I d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 cxd5 cxd5 leaves the central pawn count the same. Super ficially that would seem to favour the Slav ver sion over the QGD. Again, things are not so easy. First, there are many players who prefer such imbalanced structures, and in the QGD Exchange, some would argue that Black's open e-file is more useful than White's open c-file. In addition, the QGD move 2 ...e6 affords Black the opportunity to develop his king's bishop quickly and thus enables the desirable move ...O-O in short order. In the Slav Defence, by con trast, Black will take some time to play ...

O-O

because he has to find a place for the f8-bishop, and trying to do so by a speedy ...e6 would seem to contradict the main advantage of 2 ...c6, i.e., to be able to develop the c8-bishop quickly. I shall use the name 'Slav' for lines in which Black doesn 't play ...e6 before bringing his queen's bishop out, or at least doesn't eliminate that option within the first few moves. By con trast, 'Semi-Slav' denotes a variation that be gins with both ...e6 and ...c6 on the first few moves; for example, I d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 lLic3 e6, or here 3 ...lLif6 4 lLif3 e6, or 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lLic3 c6, etc. This will include the Meran Varia tion, described in its own section. Although the most common lines in the Slav and Semi-Slav include ...dxc4, Black can also play moves such as ...a6 and ...g6. The latter moves hold the d5 point and emphasize the fundamental solidity of this defence.

SLAV AND SEMI-SLAV 71

Solidity tends to indicate lack of ambition, but that's not necessarily so in the Slav, since most of the main lines are unbalanced. It is true, however, that Black will seldom be playing for an early initiative or tactical chances unless White provokes him. A reason for this can be seen by the picture after the second move. Black is certainly not ready to waste a move on the pawn-break ...c5, but the only other way to challenge the centre would involve ...e5, a move unlikely to happen soon in view of the fact that White will almost always play lllf3 on this or the next couple of moves. Nevertheless, Black's second move has a po tential dynamism that will express itself in spe cific situations. For example, in most variations of both the Slav and Semi-Slav, Black will play ... dxc4 at a fairly early stage. Then, although it may seem trivial, White needs to pay serious at tention to recovering his pawn, because Black may play simply . . .b5 and hang on to it (com pare the Queen's Gambit Declined or Accepted, where this is a rare occurrence). Should this possibility require the move a4 on White's part, he has used up a tempo and weakened his b4- square. Already on his third move, then, White has a limited choice of continuations that avoid the forced loss of a pawn and yet still contain some punch. His candidates for the job are 3 cxd5 (the Exchange Variation), 3 lllc3, and the main move 3 lllf3. In the right situation White might prefer to gambit his c-pawn for compen sation elsewhere, leading of course to unbal anced play. You have seen or will see that all major openings have move-order issues. The Slav is no different but the majority of important deci sions come on very early moves and mostly comprise independent set-ups rather than trans positions. The description that follows is a re source to which you can return after you gain some experience. 3 t2Jf3 Although 3 t2:lf3 is the main move, White sometimes uses 3 lll c3 ( D) in order either to by pass certain lines or to play independently. Two of the most frequent continuations are 3 ... lllf6 4 cxd5 cxd5 5 .1i.f4, which is considered in the Exchange Variation section, and 3 ...e6 4 e4, the Marshall Gambit, discussed in the Semi Slav section. A couple of unique move-orders to watch out for as White, or to use as Black, are: a) 3 ... dxc4, which is quite complex after 4 e3 b5 5 a4 b4 6 lllbl (6 llla2 e6 protects the pawn on b4; there usually follows 7 .1i.xc4 lll f6 8 lll f3, again considered equal) 6 ... .1i.a6 7 'iVc2 t2:lf6 8 .1i.xc4 .1i.xc4 9 'iVxc4 'iVd5. All this is the ory that I won't pursue; it's simply good to know it exists. Or White can play 4 e4 (D). This is somewhat more ambitious: 4 ...b5 (or 4 ...e5 5 lllf3 exd4 6 'iVxd4 'iVxd4 7 lllxd4 with prospects of a small edge for White) 5 a4 b4 6 t2:la2 (6 lll ce2!?) 6 ... lllf6 7 e5 llld5 8 .1i.xc4, af ter which Black has various set-ups involving ... .1i.f5, ... .1i.a6, or simply ...e6. White would like to get in the moves .1i.d2, lll c l -b3 and l::t c l . b) 3 ...e5 !? is the Winawer Counter-Gambit, about which a lot has been written. Obviously if Black can get away with this move unpunished he will have freed his game entirely. I'll just give a skeletal structure of the main lines and refer you to theory to get the details: 4 cxd5 (4

White's plan is to weaken Black's pawn-structure by .1i.xc6 (when ...bxc6 is normally best), trade dark squared bishops by .1i.b4, and then mount pres sure down the c-file. He might, for example, play a rook to c 1 and occupy c5 with a knight after the preliminary llla4. From Black's per spective (after .1i.xc6 and ...bxc6), he will have two bishops and pressure down an open b-file, with prospects of ...c5 after, say, the moves ... 'i'Bb6 and . . . llld7. At the moment White seems to be getting very slight advantages in this type of position, but even those may well prove to be illusory. The whole line is quite playable for Black in any case. c) 4 ...g6 5 lll c3 .1i.g7 is a hybrid Grtinfeld/Slav variation that is known as the Schlechter Slav. This position can also arise via 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 g6 3 lllc3 d5 4 lllf3 .i.g7 5 e3 c6. After, for ex ample, 6 .1i.d3 O-O 7 O-O ..llg4 8 h3 .1i.xf3 9 'i'Bxf3 e6 10 l::t d l lll bd7 (D) White wants to use his two bishops and space advantage and slowly make progress on the queenside, whereas Black is happy that White's dark-squared bishop is re stricted and will strive for . . .e5. An ultra-solid position has arisen. Some times Black can consider ... dxc4 followed by ...e5 but that brings White's light-squared bishop to an aggressive diagonal. At the moment the desirable move ...e5 is difficult to implement because Black's d-pawn requires defence. As a general rule, the player with two bishops will have some advantage unless the opponent's knights already have an available outpost or he can create one by means of a forcing attack. Here, since Black cannot do so, White probably retains a small edge. Still, these positions are very resilient and one could also argue Black's bishop on g7 is so much superior to White's on c 1 that he can claim full equality. Note that it doesn't help White to open the game immedi ately because that would activate his opponent's knights: 1 1 e4! ? e5 ! 12 dxe5 ( 12 exd5 exd4 1 3 dxc6 llle5 14 °it'e2 lllxd3 15 l:!.xd3 bxc6 with an equal position; 12 .1i.e3 dxe4 13 lllxe4 lll xe4 14 .1i.xe4 'fih4 15 d5 f5 16 dxc6? fxe4 17 'fig4 "it'xg4 1 8 hxg4 lll f6 and Black has the advan tage) 12 ... lll xe5 13 'i'Be2 lllxd3 14 l::t xd3 l::t e8 with dynamic play that appears evenly balanced.

74 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Slav Main Line Now we move into the realm of the Slav proper, leaving the Semi-Slav (4 ...e6) for later. Black begins with:

4. ..

dxc4 This is a rather strange-looking move, at least to the inexperienced player. With his first three moves, Black has carefully maintained his pawn on d5 and prevented e4. Now he sur renders his control of that square and grants White a central majority to boot! Perhaps that might make sense if 4 ... dxc4 won a pawn, but White can regain the pawn on c4 fairly easily. As is often the case, Black's motivation fol lows from a combination of the goals and the specifics of the position. He would like to de velop his pieces, and since 4 ... e6 cuts off the queen's bishop, it would be nice to place that piece on f5 to be followed by ... e6 and kingside development. However, the immediate 4 ... i.f5?! is one of those cases in which the bishop comes out a bit too early, because White has played tbc3 instead of e3 (that is, as opposed to 3 t2:lf3 t2:lf6 4 e3 .1i.f5 above). Play can continue 5 cxd5 ! and now: a) 5 ...cxd5?! 6 'i'Bb3 ! ( D). 6 ... 'i'Bb6!? (6. .. .1i.c8 is an admission of failure but perhaps best; 6 ... b6 is always weakening in such positions - White can take advantage of Black's vulnerable light squares by 7 i.f4 tbc6

with the idea l::t d l ) 7 'i'Bxb6!? (White can also grab a pawn by 7 t2:lxd5 t2:lxd5 8 'i'Bxd5 e6, and return it advantageously by 9 'i'Bb3 'i'Bxb3 10 axb3 i.c2 1 1 .1i.d2 t2:lc6 12 l::t c l .1i.xb3 13 e4)

7 ... axb6 8 .1i.f4 e6 9 e3 .1i.b4 10 .1i.b5+ and White stands better because Black's pawns are vulnerable. b) 5 ... t2Jxd5 also seems to fall short of equal ity; e.g., 6 'i'Bb3 (6 t2Jd2 !? is strange-looking, but e4 can't be stopped so it probably produces some advantage; the benefit of the central ma jority outweighs White's loss of time) 6 ... 'i'Bb6! 7 t2:lxd5 (or 7 'i'Bxb6 axb6 8 t2:lxd5 cxd5 9 e3 tbc6 10 .1i.b5 .1i.d7 1 1 .1i.d2) 7 ...

Instead of 4 ... dxc4 or 4 ... .1i.f5?!, 4 ... a6!? (D) is an ultra-sophisticated attempt that asks White what his plan is while preparing to develop his queen's bishop to f5 or g4. I won't go into theory, but a few features of this position are easily explained. In variations without ...a6, the usual response to ... i.f5 or

SLA V AND SEMI-SLAV 75

... .1i.g4 involves the move 'ii' b3, attacking the b-pawn. But after 4 ... a6, Black can play ... .1i.g4 or . . . i.f5 and answer White' s 'ii' b3 by either ... b5, which forces a resolution of the centre, or the remarkable ... l:!.a7! ?. One point of the latter move is that Black needn't devote his queen to defence of b7 and thus it is less exposed to at tack. To clarify that a bit you might want to compare the lines after 4 t2:lc3 .1i.f5?! 5 'ii' b3 °'J/i/c7 or 5 ... °'J/i/c8, which expose Black' s queen to potential attack down the c-file. It's also worth noting that the move 4 ...a6 is a very useful one in the Exchange Variation after 5 cxd5 cxd5, since it prevents t2:lb5 as well as White' s stan dard move .1i.b5. In fact, we shall look at a line that comes from 4 ...a6 in the Exchange Varia tion section below. 5 a4 The Geller Gambit 5 e4 b5 6 e5 attempts to use White's broad centre for attacking purposes and mix in some tactical opportunism. In the process there arise positional features involving the struggle for light and dark squares by both players. To give a taste of this complex gambit, let's take a brieflook at the old main line, which goes 6 .. . t2:ld5 7 a4 (D). 7 ... e6!

here Black's bishop is outside the pawn-chain, but in real danger of being cut off, whereas Black's knight on b4 is a definite plus) 9 ... .1i.g6. At this point let's break off in order to explore an idea that many of you must have been won dering about: 10 .1i.xa6 ! ? bxa6 (D ). White captures the knight on a6 to double and isolate Black's pawns on a7, a6 and c6 (the latter on an open file). He also has two central pawns and a nice support point on e5 for his knight, so that moves like lll e5 and °iVf3, per haps followed by h4-h5, are potential threats. What are the downsides? First, he has given his opponent the two bishops, which happen to have attractive open lines available. Second, he has weakened his light squares, a serious issue with this particular pawn-structure. Black has also gained the b-file along which his rook can attack the backward pawn on b2. Finally, White has lost a move capturing the knight and will have a difficult time organizing an attack down the c-file before Black plays ...c5 and puts pres sure on White's centre. Thus we have a typical trade-off between static and dynamic factors. White needs to respond firmly; for example, 1 1 llle5 .1i.d6 ( l l ...c5 !? 1 2 a5 ! .1i.d6?! 1 3 'it'a4+ @f8 14 'it'c6!) 12 lll xg6 (12 'i'Bf3 l:tc8 ! 13 e4 .1i.b4! 14 lllxg6 hxg6 15 .1i.e3 c5 16 l:tdl 'i'Ba5 and the dynamic side is getting the better of it) 12 ...hxg6 13 g5 with some kind of dynamic equilibrium after 13 ... lllh5 14 lll e4 or 13. .. llld5

14 e4 lllxc3 1 5 bxc3 c5 16 dxc5 i.xc5 17

'it'xd8+ l:txd8. In fact, this trade of bishop for doubled a pawns arises repeatedly in chess openings. For example, there are several variations of the King's Indian Defence in which Black plays ... llla6 and White bites with .1i.xa6. One such is

1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 g6 3 lllc3 .1i.g7 4 e4 d6 5 .1i.e2 O-O

Black's task, then, is to make sure that it can't advance (i.e., e4 cannot be played) until he is ready to snipe at the centre and force White into some undesired change of struc ture. From White's point of view, Black's pawn-structure is super-solid and will only be completely broken down by e4 and d5 . Alter natively, White has the option of e4-e5, seek ing attacking chances. 7 •• . .1i.b4

SLA V AND SEMI-SLAV 77

Black indirectly increases his control over e4.

8 O-O (D)

A basic position. We can see some general features of the game developing. White has a central majority (2: 1 ), and Black has a restraint formation with the light-squared bishop in front of the pawn-chain (see Chapter 3 in Volume 1 on pawn-structures for an explanation of the various types of restraint centres). In the situa tion before us, Black is not waiting for e4 but preventing the advance of the e-pawn by piece play. He has two pieces attacking e4 and a third ready to exchange off a piece defending that square. Whether or not that situation persists, he will try to gain time for the characteristic pawn-breaks ...c5 and ...e5. Note that Black's bishop is on an outpost on b4 and cannot be expelled by pawns; therefore White may need to retreat his knight or divert resources to drive the bishop away. As a first plan, White would like to play f3 in order to get e4 in, but that would require either a knight re treat or advance to e5, and both moves will al low an early ...c5 . This leaves White with two basic approaches: a) He can support a central advance with his pieces, the classical approach. In that case, White wants to pose Black the challenge of confronting an ideal centre; b) He can chase down Black's bishop on f5 by a variety of methods, including the direct 6 tt:lh4. In that case, should White decide to cap ture the bishop on f5 he will have to forego e4 for some time, but that may not be a bad trade off. These goals can operate in tandem. The more specific decision about whether and when to try to expel Black's bishop on b4 will vary according to circumstance. The 6 e3 variation is probably the most in structive one in traditional Slav practice. It produces games permeated by strategic and positional themes that will be usable in many contexts. 8 ... lllbd7 Black will normally choose between this move and 8 ... O-O. The decision comes down to one's goals and some tactical assessments. Depending upon your goals and who you're playing, a practical drawback of 8 ... lllbd7 is that it opens up some possibilities for an imme diate draw. White can play 9 'it'b3, when Black has to choose between the following: a) 9 ...a5, allowing a draw by 10 llla2 (D). 10 ....1i.e7 (10. ..'iVe7? 1 1 lllxb4 'iVxb4 1 2 'iVxb4 axb4 13 .1i.d2 really isn't acceptable for Black) 1 1 'it'xb7 l:tb8 12 'iVa6 l:ta8 13 'iVxc6 l:tc8 with a draw by perpetual attack. After 9 ... a5, Black can't really avoid this draw, but White can, and often does, playing either 10 llla2 .1i.e7 1 1 lllh4 or 10 lllh4. The last move can lead to, for example, 10 ... .1i.g6 (10. .. .1i.g4 1 1 f3 i.h5 is a good alternative) 1 1 g3 ! ?, not just protecting the knight but also in tending the exotic idea lllxg6, l:tdl and .1i.fl g2. b) 9 ... 'it'b6 is an extremely risky variation that most players would like to avoid even though it may be survivable for Black: 10 e4 (10 lllh4 is still possible) 10 ... .1i.g6 1 1 .1i.xe6!? fxe6 1 2 a5 ! .1i.xa5 13 'iVxe6+ @d8 14 e5 and as I

customarily say about such random positions, please consult the books ! Black may stand sat isfactorily, but you should commit the tactics to memory if you want to live long against a strong player. Instead of 8 ... t2:lbd7, 8 ...O-O solves that prob lem, because now 9 'i¥b3 'i¥e7 ! (protecting b7 as well as b4) is considered fine. On the other hand, Black loses some flexibility and time in some variations (compare the ... .1i.g4 lines below, in which Black delays castling). Furthermore, he may not want to allow t2:le5 ; e.g., 8 ... O-O 9 'i¥e2 .1i.g6 10 t2:le5 t2:lbd7 1 1 t2:lxg6 hxg6, and here 12 t2:la2 is interesting. What is the solution to this quandary?

B: 9 ...O-O.

A)

9 ... i.g4 Black has a simple idea: to eliminate White's f3-knight and then temporarily restrain White's pawns with his own on c6 and e6. I talked about this structure in Chapter 3 of Volume 1 . As usual, ...c5 and/or ...e5 are Black's long-term goals. Lugovoi - Kovalevskaya St Petersburg 2000 10 l:tdl 'iYaS Black wants to gain a tempo to implement his plans. Sensing no immediate attack, he doesn't feel that ...O-O is necessary for the mo ment, and may even play ... O-O-O later. 1 1 e4 'iYhS (D) You will see this idea in several lines: Black wishes to cripple White's kingside pawns. But in doing so he gives White the bishop-pair and an even stronger centre. Instead 1 1 ...O-O trans poses to a normal position, and l l .. . .1i.xc3 ! ? 12 bxc3 'i¥xc3 13 l:ta3 ! ? or here 13 .1i.b2 i.xf3 14 gxf3 'i¥a5 1 5 d5 ! ? gives White a lot of compen sation for a pawn. Regardless of the exact as sessment, taking on that kind of position seems impractical for Black. 12 l:td3!? This interesting move avoids having doubled pawns on f3. One alternative is to force Black to carry out his plan by 12 h3 ! ? .1i.xf3 13 'i¥xf3 'i¥xf3 14 gxf3; e.g., 14 ... O-O 1 5 a5 (gaining space) 15 ...a6 16 i.e2 (16 .1i.f4!?) 16 ... l:tfd8 17 l:ta4 .1i.e7 (the position should be equal; White's structural immobility detracts from his two bishop advantage) 1 8 f4 t2:le8 19 .1i.e3 l:tac8 20 .1i.f3?!

98 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

along the way, including move-orders that lead to the same endpoint. First, the move-order 2 ...e6 (D) is often used to get to the Semi-Slav, if Black wants to delay ... lt:Jf6 on the third move. That is, Black can get to the desired Semi Slav position by playing 2 c4 e6 3 lt:Jc3 c6 4 lt:Jf3 l2Bf6 5 e3 lt:Jbd7. Why would he want to play 2 ...e6 first, and then 3 ...c6? Because once White is committed to 3 l2Bc3, Black has gained in several ways: a) He has eliminated any line in which White plays lt:Jd2; b) He has helped himself in certain varia tions with ... dxc4 and ...b5, because ... b4 will then attack the knight on c3 with tempo. c) Finally, Black may be happier playing the unbalanced pawn-structure that results from 2 c4 e6 3 cxd5 exd5 than the symmetrical one af ter 2 c4 c6 3 cxd5 cxd5. All that sounds good, but there's always a trade-off. One drawback to this order is that it allows the Marshall Gambit, 4 e4. See the note on that below. A further move-order that avoids both the Exchange Slav and the Marshall Gam bit is 1 d4 l2Bf6 2 c4 e6 3 l2Bf3 d5 4 lt:Jc3 c6. The trade-off then is that Black needs to be willing to play a Nimzo-Indian. 3 lt:Jc3 3 lt:Jf3 might discourage the idea of delaying ... lt:Jf6 because White can try 3 ...e6 4 ii.g5 ! ?, a rather obscure but interesting option. This would also not be possible with the 2 c4 e6 3 lt:Jc3 or der. I'm not going to give you the details about all these choices, but want to make you aware of what's out there so that you can reflect upon what suits you best. 3 ...e6 3 ...l2Bf6 4 l2Bf3 e6 transposes to the main po- sition of the Semi-Slav. Other options are con sidered in the introductory notes to 3 l2Bc3 at the beginning of this chapter. 4 lt:Jf3 An alternative is the Marshall Gambit, 4 e4 ! ?

This usually leads to the gambit 4 ...dxe4 5 l2Bxe4 ii.b4+ 6 ii.d2 'ifxd4 7 ii.xb4 'ifxe4+, when Black is a pawn up but has lost the dark squares. This is a sharp variation to which a very large amount of concrete theory has been devoted; it should probably be learned by heart. I won't go into the details here, but so far it has not deterred top players from using this move order as Black. On the other hand it seems that White is always coming up with new ideas, and the gambit may suit players who enjoy specula tive attacks. There is also a positional way to answer the Marshall Gambit, namely, 4 ... ii.b4 (D).

f6 (D) The combined moves ...e6 and ...c6 give us what is called the Semi-Slav Variation. It has become one of the most fertile areas for investi gation in modem chess play. But what is going on here? First Black denies c6 to his knight and then blocks the open diagonal for his bishop on c8! Why? Obviously the answer cannot be rapid development, because he's making pawn moves. And although Black has a strong point at dS (every one of his moves, including 1 . . .dS, has increased control of that square), White has more space and better control of the centre as a whole. In general Black's position has to strike one as passive. And yet the Semi-Slav is associ ated with extraordinarily exciting play. Let's see why. In the first place, Black has a threat:

S ...

dxc4, after which his pawn on c4 can be de fended by ...bS. To see that this is actually a threat, take a look at the move S g3 below, which turns into a gambit (not a terrible one, but still not to most people's taste). So White needs to do something that prevents, neutral izes, or compensates for the capture on c4. The obvious move for that purpose is: 5 e3 This is the main line that we shall explore. I'll get to S ii.gs in a short note below. Other moves have their disadvantages which are en lightening to look through, especially to under stand why the main lines are main lines. Here are a few that may be of value in that respect: a) S a4 (to prevent . .. bS should Black decide upon ...dxc4), when Black can simply develop by, e.g., S ...

0..bd7, or exploit the new hole on b4

by S ... ii.b4 (with ... tb.e4 and perhaps . . . 'WiaS in mind) 6 i.d2 O-O (or 6 ... cS) 7 e3 cS. This ex ploits White's passively-placed bishop on d2, which is disconnected from the defence of d4. Black intends to play ... tb.c6 and capture on d4, whereas 8 dxcS tb.c6 takes over the centre; e.g., 9 cxdS exdS 10 ii.e2 ii.xcS 1 1 O-O l:te8 with ideal activity for an isolated queen's pawn posi tion. b) S 'Wib3 defends the c-pawn with the hope of developing via ii.f4 or ii.gs. It can be met by simple development such as ...

0..bd7, but the

forcing sequence S ... dxc4 6 'ii xc4 bS ! is sur prisingly effective and has more or less elimi nated S 'Wib3 as an attempt to gain the advantage (the same applies to S 'Wid3 dxc4; in that case Black has another good option in S 'ii d3 b6!). The play can proceed 7 'ii d3 b4! ? 8 tb.e4 tb.xe4 9 'Wixe4 ii.b7 10 e3 tb.d7 1 1 ii.c4 ii.e7 12 O-O O-O with equality, Korchnoi-Tischbierek, Zu rich 1 999. c) S g3 dxc4 6 ii. g2 (D) can tum into a real gambit. 6 .. .

This is one of the most thoroughly played and analysed variations in modem chess. It is characterized by lengthy tactical and sacrificial sequences, with play in which half a tempo changes the entire nature of the game. Many fans and specialists devote their time to study ing and extending Botvinnik Variation theory, and it would do you no good for me to rehash a selected fraction of it, since to master these lines on either side of the board requires a great deal of playing experience and very specific study of tactical sequences. The Anti-Moscow above (S ...h6 6 ii.h4 gS 7 ii.g3 dxc4 8 e4 bS) is of the same nature, being extremely theoretical. It's not yet worked out to the outrageous extent that various Botvinnik lines are (30+ moves), but it's still dependent upon hoards of posi tion-specific tactics. Neither variation is within the scope or intent of this book, but that should not discourage a lover of fascinating chess the ory. 5 . . . lt:Jbd7 (D)

SIA V AND SEMI-SIA V 101

The natural 5 ... lbbd7 introduces the stan dard Semi-Slav lines that we'll examine. It is very flexible, allowing for Black's bishop on f8 to go to e7, d6 or b4. In the meantime, Black de velops a piece and supports either ...c5 or ... e5 should the opportunity arise. Before moving to what White plays next, let's examine the Semi-Slav from another per spective. Take the moves 1 d4 d5 2 lZ'Bf3 lZ'Bf6 3 e3 e6 4 c3 c5 5 lZ'ibd2 lZ'Bc6 6 i.d3 (D). Do you recognize this position? It's the Clas sical Colle System, considered one of White's dullest variations in d-pawn chess! The Classi cal Colle is sound enough, but grandmasters rarely play it, and indeed I'm not sure that a top-ten player has tried to play this form of the Colle in decades. Ironically, the Colle System with the move b3 (omitting c3) has attracted a number of strong grandmasters over the last 15 years or so. But when one looks at the reversed Semi-Slav position, Black has forgone this pos sibility ...b6. So how can a notoriously dull opening be so popular with colours reversed, played a full tempo down? We'll discover some concrete reasons shortly, but more general is sues apply. The nature of reversed openings is such that Black' s goals can differ from White's in the same position. Obviously Black is usu ally satisfied with equality in a system where a dynamic imbalance cannot be achieved by force. Then, too, White has to commit himself to a specific 6th move versus the Semi-Slav set-up, giving Black some extra information with which to respond flexibly by choosing the appropriate counter. Let's continue with our Colle example (from the diagram after 6 i.d3): sometimes Black plays 6 ... i.d6 (6 ... Wi/c7 7 dxc5 i.xc5 8 b4 i.d6 is a better version for Black, but we're continu ing with the analogy) 7 dxc5 i.xc5 8 b4 i.d6

Here it might be useful to jump ahead and glance at the first few moves of the Meran Vari ation main lines below. In this position (after 8 ... i.d6), Black, who is a tempo down on the Semi-Slav lines, will not play ambitiously with . . .e5 as White does in the Meran Variation. Rather, he will play something like ... lbe5, or ... a5, answering b5 with . . . lbe5. Such a strat egy is certainly dull, but it should equalize. That's the difference between a counterattack whose basis is the opponent's aggression (in the Meran, White usually plays for advantage with e4-e5 and exposes himself to attack), and Black's willingness to play more solidly in or der to equalize in the reversed position. Now we return to the subject of this section,

You' ll have to bear with me on these compari sons and transpositions. It isn't necessary to know them, but you might want to return here after you have played some games and want to make sense of them. We come to a crossroads. White can play 1 0 d5 or 1 0 e5. Reynolds Attack 10 d5 This introduces the wild Reynolds Variation, ideal for specialists or for anyone who thinks that his opponent won't be prepared for it! The move d5 is always critical in such positions be cause it opens lines for White's pieces to work with. The positional basis for d5 also stems from the fact that if White waits for ...cxd4, both Black's bishop on f8 and knight on d7 will have active posts, whereas now they are lim ited by their c-pawn. Variations stemming from 1 0 d5 constantly interact with those beginning with the moves 8 ... i.b7 and 8 ... Wi/c7, so I'll mix the material. 10 .•• 'ifc7 The most 'flexible' move.

4 Introduction to the Indian Defences

The Indian Defences to 1 d4 are at the heart of modem chess theory. The Indian systems that I shall be covering all begin with 1 ...lll f6. This de velopment of the knight stakes out a claim to e4 and forestalls White's intended occupation of that square. Other first moves such as 1 . .. c5 and l . ..d6 may lead to forms of lndian Systems, and the Dutch Defence with 1...f5 is another method of impeding 2 e4. I feel that it belongs in its own category, with the exception of an infrequent side-variation, sometimes called the 'Dutch In dian', which involves 1 . . .e6 and ... .tb4+ at an early stage. After 1 ... lllf6 we see the move 2 c4 (D) in the clear majority games by masters. By this move White inhibits 2 ... d5 and prepares 3 lllc3 with out blocking his c-pawn. The second most pop ular move 2 lll f3 will often be followed by c4 on one of the next few moves, sharing the same basic idea. Experience has shown that 2 lllc3 lacks the punch to threaten Black's position, mainly because it isn't possible to enforce e4 after 2 ... d5. However, I should say that this is a result of specifics and not of inviolable princi ples. The idea that one shouldn't block the c pawn in 1 d4 openings has its exceptions; a cou ple occur as early as the second move, as in the Dutch Defence variation that goes 1 d4 f5 2 lll c3 and the Chigorin Defence, 1 d4 d5 2 c4 lll c6. At this point (following 2 c4), White would like to play e4, establishing a broad centre and laying claim to central space. Black must de cide upon a strategy. He can directly thwart that advance by, for example, controlling the e4- and d5-squares; e.g., 2 ...e6 3 lll c3 .tb4 (the Nimzo-Indian Defence) or here 3 lllf3 b6 and ...3l.b7 (the Queen's Indian Defence). Alterna tively, he can allow White to play e4, setting up his strong pawn-centre. The establishment of an ideal centre would seem to be the goal of all openings and therefore advantageous for White. But for White's centre pawns to give him the advantage two things must hold true: a) The pawns must actually control the cen tral squares, which is usually the case against the Indian Defences. b) They must be secure against dissolution, which may or may not be the case in the Indian Defences. Thus Black plans to attack White's centre and/or to arrange things such that any advance by White backfires. Even in the latter case he must eventually attack and compromise White's centre or suffer under a cramped and probably untenable situation. The strategy just described is usually introduced by ... g6 in conjunction with either ...d6 (the King's Indian Defence), ... d5 (the Griinfeld Defence) or ...c5 (the Ben oni). The latter is a sort of hybrid solution, since 2 ...c5 (threatening to impair White's centre by ...cxd4) already allows the incursion of White's pawn to d5, and e4 will follow if White wishes. Whether White's centre has been strengthened or weakened thereby is open to dispute. Let's take a quick look at how the major In dian defences unfold in the first few moves. The King's Indian Defence ( 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 g6 3 lllc3 3l.g7; e.g., 4 e4 d6 5 lllf3 O-O) is in one sense the most radical one: it doesn't put a piece or pawn on the fourth rank for the first five moves ! That phenomenon doesn't usually continue further, although we have some funny lines in the KID like the Panno System with 4

INTRODUCTION TO THE [ND/AN DEFENCES 115

ctJf3 d6 5 g3 O-O 6 j_g2 tll c6 7 O-O a6 followed by 8 ... .l::t b8 and often 9 ... j_d7, in which case Black has gone 9 moves without placing any thing beyond his third rank. When Black in stead plays his usual ...e5 at an early stage, he blocks off his own bishop, but creates a di lemma for White about how to react. At first sight the Griinfeld Defence ( 1 d4 ctJf6 2 c4 g6 3 tllc3 d5) is superior to the King ' s Indian in vi tal respects: the move ... d5 directly challenges White's centre, so that Black gains some space to work with. His bishop on g7 will be un blocked and remain so indefinitely, sometimes well into the endgame. In conjunction with the moves ...c5 and ... tll c6, for example, the queen on d8 and the bishop on g7 exert strong pres sure upon the key d4-square (the move ... 3l.g4 can also come in handy in that respect if White has a knight on f3). In reality, White is compen sated due to some specific features of play. If White plays 4 cxd5 tllxd5 and then makes the principled move e4, then either Black' s knight must retreat, giving White time to bolster his ideal centre, or the knight has to exchange on c3, when of a sudden White has shored up d4 with a pawn and is able to fight for control of that square. The outcome of that engagement, combined with some other factors, produces a competitive balance which attract players on both sides of the Indian Systems. The Nimzo-lndian was the first of the In dian openings that really caught on among the world's top players, and it's easy to see why, The Nimzo-Indian combines rapid develop ment with central control, to the extent that Black may even be said to be on equal footing with White in the centre proper (depending upon the variation, of course). Furthermore, he faces only rare situations like those in the King's Indian and Griinfeld in which White has a formidable set of pawns on e4 and d4. One might complain that Black therefore has no particular target, but the main action results from the exchange . . . 3l.xc3, which cedes the bishop-pair to White but often saddles him with doubled c-pawns. The Queen's Indian Defence also deploys Black's forces so as to control e4 and d5. Black receives a bit of a break in that regard because White's 3 ctJf3 not only fails to control e4 and d5, but interferes with potential central occu pation that might follow from White's moves f3 and e4. Thus the Queen's Indian has been considered a safe and solid defence. You should keep in mind, however, that White con trols more space, and surprisingly dynamic play can result from the natural imbalance that entails. The Modem Benoni involves a different set of issues. On the positive side, Black has the quasi-permanent advantages of a powerful, un obstructed bishop on g7 and an open and very useful e-file. But unlike practitioners of the other Indian Defences, he faces a powerful and almost irremovable pawn on d5 that restricts his mobility and development. Of course there is much more to say about the Indian Defences in general, but the real dif ferences and similarities are best shown in their individual contexts.

Black threatens discovered check and the knight can't be captured. Still, White can try 6 a3 (6 'V//i xg7? tlle4+ 7 '>t>e2 'V//i f6 and Black re mains a piece ahead), when the trap that Black has to avoid is 6 ... 3l.a5? 7 'V//i xg7 tll e4+ 8 b4 and after Black defends his rook, his bishop will be captured. Instead, 6 ... 3l.e7 ! 7 bxc3 O-O leaves Black with an extra pawn and a great position. Thus 4 e4 deserves a '?' after all. These moves are good to play through if you are inexperi enced in the opening phase of the game. Similar ideas can arise in other openings including the Sicilian Defence and French Defence. Let's return to 3 ... 3l.b4. Apart from prevent ing e4, this move fights for control of the cen tral light squares. All three of Black's moves have directly or indirectly helped him control d5, and two of them have done the same for e4. This emphasis on light squares is characteristic of most Nimzo-Indian variations, at least for the first five or six moves. For example, Black will frequently play ...b6 and ... 3l.b7 next, also watching over the d5- and e4-squares. That's not all. Whether or not Black chooses to play ...b6, he has other light-square themes. The move ... d5 is a part of many variations, staking further claim to e4 and adding the queen to the mob of pieces defending d5. In addition, occupation of the light squares by ... tll e4 is common, followed by .. .f5 to cement control of e4. Chess being what it is, of course, this delight fully simple picture proves deceptively com plex as Black may later tum to moves such as

[diagram]
tllc6, ...d6 and ...e5 in order to challenge or defend dark squares ! Still, the abundance of light-square themes lends a distinctive charac ter to Nimzo-Indian play that often extends well into the middlegame. One of the most obvious features of 3 ... 3l.b4 is that it introduces the possibility of ... 3l.xc3+, giving White doubled pawns. As we discussed in the introductory chapters of Volume 1 , those doubled pawns are particularly bad because the forward pawn on c4 is incapable of being de fended by pawns, and it can easily be attacked (see below). The better part of Nimzo-Indian variations have one or more points at which ... 3l.xc3 is the best move. However, that capture usually comes at the cost of giving White the bishop-pair. In some cases White also takes command of the centre, although if embarked upon too early, the occupation of the centre may have drawbacks, such as queenside weak nesses, overextension, or simply the inability to exploit extra space. Another advantage that Black has is speedy development in the first few moves. After his third move he is already ready to castle, whereas White has quite a few moves to go, perhaps e3 followed by 3l.d3, tllf3 and O-O. In the meantime, he may throw in moves such as a3 and 'V//i c2, which don't con tribute much to getting White' s pieces out. Thus White's policy in most variations is a cautious consolidation of his position involving protection of his centre and development. Black would like to disturb the position's balance in his favour, usually combining piece-play with one or more pawn-breaks. White almost inevi tably has to make pawn-structure concessions, either the aforementioned doubled c-pawns, an isolated pawn, weak light squares on the queen side, or loss of space in the centre as Black ad vances. The issue becomes whether the situation stabilizes enough for White's bishop-pair to ex ert itself, in which case Black can be in real trouble. The bishops' merits vary from position to position; we'll see both how ineffectual they can be in some of the variations that follow, and how devastating in others. Samisch and Related Lines Under this heading we shall be covering lines where White plays an early a3, and Black cap tures on c3, doubling White's pawns. There are several forms that this can take, depending on whether White plays a3 immediately, or after 4 f3 or 4 e3, often waiting until Black has played ... d5 before playing a3. The traditional form of the Samisch is as follows:

1 d4 ctJf6 2 c4 e6 3 tllc3 3l.b4 4 a3!? 3l.xc3+

5 bxc3 (D) The Samisch Variation is in many ways the most instructive of all Nimzo-Indian lines. It seems odd to force Black into ... 3l.xc3+, a move that he is likely to play anyway, and thus to ac cept the weak doubled c-pawns while losing time. For some rather subtle reasons, however, it turns out that there are advantages to forcing Black to commit to a strategy before he can

NIMZO-[NDIAN DEFENCE 119

react to White' s. Indeed, 4 a3 was one of the earliest methods of play versus the Nimzo Indian and many of the best players of the time, including the long-time World Champion Bot vinnik, were infatuated with possession of the bishop-pair. Remember that having two bishops versus a bishop and a knight, or two bishops versus two knights, is generally advantageous, although you have to assess each case individu ally (especially in this opening). White ' s idea is to compel Black to part with his bishop before he changes his mind and retreats, something that occurs in other lines. In contemporary chess, both 4 a3 and its cousin 4 f3 have once again become quite popular. Similarly, White can follow up the move 4 e3 with 5 a3, or even 5 3l.d3 and 6 a3, often producing the same basic structure. As mentioned above, the motivation for this is often to wait for Black to commit him self to playing ...d5. The reason for this is that some of the most challenging lines at Black' s disposal against the 4 a3 move-order involve him avoiding ... d5 and attacking White's c4- pa wn with his pieces. The Samisch Variation is the ideal starting point for discussing the Nimzo-lndian because it contains a majority of the fundamental themes that arise from the opening. On a simple level, we may say that the strategies resulting from 4 a3 can usually be characterized as one of the following: a) White undertakes to gain ground with his central and kingside pawns, creating threats or forming a basis for a direct attack by pieces. Typically this involves ideas such as f3 and e4 (or g4, which also grabs space), e4-e5 and/or f4-f5-f6. For his part, Black attempts to block those pawns with his own, usually with moves like ...e5 and/or .. .f5. b) White tries to activate his bishop-pair, which requires line-opening pawn advances or exchanges. Black endeavours to restrict White's bishops to passive roles behind their own pawns. c) Black wants to win White's weak for ward c-pawn or expose his weaknesses on the key queenside light squares. He tends to ex change pieces in order to neutralize White's kingside efforts. White can either strain to pro tect his weak c4-pawn with pieces, or sacrifice it for activity. d) Alternatively, Black will play moves to contest the centre: either ... d5, or some combi- nation of ... d6, ...e5 and ... c5. Then he can even think about initiating play on the kingside. I shall devote an exceptional amount of space to exploring these schemes. They will play out in the following variations: A: Systems with ...d6 and ...e5; B : Systems with ... d5; C: Systems with ...c5 and/or ... b6. As this is a book of ideas, the latest theory will not always be covered (the last section is exceptional in that respect), and I'll be using some classic games that throw the strategies and set-ups into relief. Before moving ahead I shall very briefly mention a curious move: 5 . . . llle4 (D) This received several tests in the 1 96 1 World Championship match between Tal and Botvin nik, the latter playing White. Black attacks White's c3-pawn but this ad vanced knight is subject to being driven back

from his d-pawn. Now he hasn't time for .i.d3, and 8 d5 li:Jb8 ! 9 .i.d3 li:Ja6 (D) (or 9 ... li:Jbd7) lets Black take over the inviting c5-square for his knight. Indeed, the c5-square is a 'true' out post, in that it can't be attacked by enemy pawns: In this position it will prove difficult for White to organize any pawn-breaks, since f4 will be met by ...exf4 with additional Black firepower along the e-file aimed at the back ward pawn on e4. Furthermore, the a4-square is an inviting target for Black, who can play . . . .lld7 and ... 'iVe8 at some point, complement ing a knight on c5. Another theme that we shall see throughout this chapter concerns the possi- ble move ...c6. Here Black may play ...c6 and . . .cxd5 to open the c-file for his rook ( ... l:!.c8), which puts considerable pressure on White's pawns on that file. This all stems from the inac curacy 6 'iVc2. Of course White's position isn't hopeless. He can still play for lt:Je2 and lt:Jg3 or f4 at some point. But the timing of all this is delicate. After 6 'iVc2, Ragozin actually played 6 .. .O-O?! 7 e4 e5 8 .ll d3 ! c5 ! ? (now 8 ... lt:Jc6 9 lt:Je2 ! holds the centre together nicely) 9 li:Je2 lt:Jc6 10 d5 lt:Je7 1 1 f3 li:Jd7 1 2 h4 (here's the problem: left to his own devices White will launch his pawns for ward to take over as much space as he can; then he can mount an attack) 1 2. . . li:Jb6 1 3 g4 ! (D). Compare this with the last diagram: Black has lost his outpost on c5 and can't play ...c6 to create pressure on the queenside. Staking out as much space as possible is a key element of White's strategy in the Samisch. The game con tinued 1 3. . .f6 14 lt:Jg3 <;t>f7 ! 15 g5 lt:Jg8 16 f4 <;t>e8 1 7 f5. Black' s king has escaped but his pieces are confined to the first few ranks and he stands poorly. 6 ...O-O 7 e4 e5 8 .i.d3 c5!? Black's choice is important. He tries to force things in the centre and on the queenside but it's nice to have ...c6 in reserve; for example, 8 ... lt:Jc6 9 li:Je2 h6 (versus .i.g5) 10 d5? ! lt:Ja5 1 1 .i.e3 b6 1 2 lt:Jg3 .i.a6 1 3 'iVe2 c6! 1 4 O-O l:!.c8

In that case Black can attack along the c-file by exchanging pawns to control the c4-square. Had he played ...c5, he would have run out of pieces able to attack White's pawn on c4. Of course, l 0 d5 wasn't forced. 9 lt:Je2 lt:Jc6 10 O-O ! ? An intentional pawn sacrifice.

The question is whether Black should stand pat or win a pawn and liquidate White's centre. If you play either side of the Samisch or another Nimzo-Indian variation involving e3 and ...c5,

Black plays what may seem the most natural move on the board (though is not so common via this precise move-order), staking out terri tory in the centre to neutralize White's usual advantage in space. True, White can and usu ally will 'undouble' his pawns by cxd5, but that has some drawbacks after the simple reply . . .exd5: a) it frees Black's bad bishop on c8; and b) gives his king's rook good scope along an open central file.

6 e3 (D)

This move reaches a position that is more of ten seen via the move-order 4 e3 d5 5 a3 .i.xc3+ 6 bxc3. In that sequence, White doesn't play a3 until Black is committed to ... d5. Instead of 6 e3, it's tempting to bring the queen's bishop out before shutting it in by e3. That brings us to our first example of ...d5 in the Samisch, an illustration of how White can go fundamentally wrong. Botvinnik - Kotov Groningen 1946

[diagram]
bxc3 d5 6 cxd5!? Now White could have achieved the normal position by 6 e3. See the next game.

6. ..exd5 7 .i.g5?! (D)

The strongest player in the world at that time shows us what not to do when playing his own system! White's logic is to place his dark squared 'bad' bishop outside the central pawn chain that will be formed by e3 and d4. How ever, this slows down the important development of his kingside and weakens White' s queenside dark squares.

[diagram]
A dynamic response. Black has ... 'iVa5 in mind, hitting the c3-pawn and unpinning the knight on f6. 7 ... h6 is also not a bad move, be cause if White plays 8 .ll xf6 'iVxf6, he loses his most important asset, the bishop-pair. Never theless, Black would have used the extra tempo ...h6 to achieve this and the position would be objectively equal, with a technical battle in store. By the way, the obvious alternative after 7 ...h6 is 8 .llh4, but that is even worse for White be cause it allows the direct attack 8 ...g5 9 .llg3 tt'Je4, when Black is attacking the c3-pawn and would like to threaten the g3-bishop by . . .h5 or play . . .c5 followed by ... 'iVa5. The point to re member here is that the rapid exertion of queenside pressure definitely outweighs the weaknesses created by ... h6 and ...g5. A useful old saying is "Weaknesses aren't weaknesses unless they can be attacked". This may not be 1 00% accurate, but is a good rule of thumb. 8 f3!? White tries to stop ... tt'Je4 and may have ideas of playing e4 later. The move f3 is always dangerous (great reward but great risk). The problem is that after the natural 8 e3, 8 ... 'iVa5 forces some awkward defence like 9 'iVc2 tt'Je4 10 .llf4 cxd4 1 1 exd4 tt'Jc6. Then Black is threatening ... tt'Jxd4 !, and 1 2 tt'Jf3 .i.g4! can be followed by ... .llxf3 and/or ... l:tc8, putting pres- sure on White's backward c-pawn. 1 2 tt'Je2 i.f5 is a perfect picture of light-square domination. 8 ... h6 9 .i.xf6 But now the dark squares are in trouble (look at that weakness on e3) ! Retreat isn't attractive

One of those paradoxical moves that grand masters are good at finding. Releasing the pres sure on d4 in this way is generally bad but here it stops .i.d3 and tt'Jd3 while containing the ter rible threat of ...g5. The rest of the game is short and sweet:

6 e3 (D)

6 ... c5 Now for an important move-order issue. The position after 6 . . .c5 could also have oc curred via the common move-order 4 e3 d5 5 a3 .i.xc3+ 6 bxc3 c5 or 4 e3 c5 5 a3 .llxc3+ 6 bxc3 d5. In the move-order here, however, Black isn't already committed to . . .c5 and he doesn't have to play it yet (the trade-off, of course, is that in the 4 a3 move-order, Black is not committed to playing . . . d5). For example, he can insert 6 ...O-O, when 7 cxd5 exd5 8 .i.d3 b6 9 tt'Je2 .i.a6 tries to get the light-squared bishops off the board immediately. The obvi ous continuation for White is 1 0 O-O .i.xd3 1 1 �xd3. Then Black might play 1 1 . . .�c8 ! ? 1 2 f3 �a6, winning light squares like c4. But that simplification doesn't solve the problem of the centre after 1 3 �xa6 tt'Jxa6 1 4 tt'Jg3 (D). Then the advance e4 will follow, emphasizing the su periority of the white bishop over the poorly placed knight on a6. For example, 14 ... l:!.fe8 15 l:!.el c5 16 e4 dxe4 1 7 fxe4 cxd4 1 8 cxd4 l:!.ad8 1 9 .i.b2 tt'Jb8 20 l:!.ac l tt'Jbd7 2 1 l:!.c7 and White clearly has the upper hand.

l:!.eS (D) Without counterplay down the e- and c-files, Black would have nothing to do but wait for White's attack. This position has occurred scores of times in master play, normally via 4 f3 or 4 e3. We' ll follow a game that is instructional because we get to see White's plans in pure form, and also a straightforward strategy for Black. Tisdall - Bjarnason Reykjavik 1989 13 tt:Jg3 'iVd7! As in Botvinnik-Capablanca, Black takes aim at the light squares, in this case a4 and b5. Even ... 'iVb7 might operate against the e4 push.

NIMZO-INDIAN DEFENCE 12 7

14 l:.a2! ( D) Strange to say, this manoeuvre of the queen's rook to the centre may be the only way to play for advantage. Not only does White swing over to support the e4 push, he does so while still pre venting ... 'iVa4 and keeping his queen's bishop free to go in either direction. The idea of l:!.a2- e2 (or l:!.e2-f2) followed by e4 in this type of po sition goes back to the 1 940s and early 1 950s (at least in terms of consistent usage) and has become a standard part of White's weaponry in this and even a couple of other openings, notably Queen's Gambits. Sometimes l:!.a2 is played with the knight still on e2, in which case White has the new idea of g4 and tt'Jg3 with g5 and e4 to follow. Naturally Black has his own re sources, and in spite of most writers' and play ers' mistrust of his position he hasn't scored that much worse than in other variations. 14 ...l:.acS! (D) 15 'iVd3!? Perhaps more accurate is 1 5 l:!.e2, which has indeed played in a few games. Then Black's most successful idea has been 15 ...cxd4 16 cxd4 l:!.c4! (D) with double-edged play. White will have to place his bishop pas sively on b2 to enforce e4. Lutsko-Kveinys, Tallinn 2001 continued 17 'iVd3 b5 1 8 .i.b2 tt'Jc7 ! 19 e4 tt'Je6 (this standard defensive move hits f4 and d4) 20 l:.d2 tt'Jf4 2 1 'iVe3 tt'J6h5 22 tt'Jxh5 tt'Jxh5 23 g4? ! tt'Jf6 24 e5 'iVc6 25 l:.g2 tt'Jd7 with advantage to Black. 26 f4 would be met by 26 ... tt'Jf6 and ... tt'Je4, and 26 'iVd3 by 26 ... tt'Jb6! 27 f4 tt'Ja4. In lines like these White's bishop on b2 really is a bad bishop! But his play is fairly easy to improve upon. 15 ... 'iVa4 16 l:!.e2 tt'Jc7!? The logical follow-up t o Black's play is

Notice that if 17 ...cxd4 1 8 cxd4 li:Je6, White's bishop can now settle in on e3, whereas if it were already committed to b2, he would have to deal with ... lt:Jf4.

on the kingside, both for the sake of attack there and to drive Black' s pieces away so that he can play e4 after all. In the meantime Black has a greater emphasis on preventative measures against attack by White. Many such variations arise via the move 4 f3; for example, 4 f3 d5 5 a3 .i.xc3+ 6 bxc3 O-O 7 cxd5 exd5 8 e3.

Currently, at least, White's ex tensive and varied efforts to gain an advantage in that position have proven fruitless, although a robust middlegame may ensue. There are also independent moves for Black within the basic Botvinnik structure, as in this game: Gheorghiu - Fischer Havana OL 1966

NIMZO-/NDIAN DEFENCE 131

In spite of losing his dark-squared bishop, White enjoys control of the centre and king side. It turns out that his attack almost plays it self. 18 ••. bS 19 eS as 20 tZ:lhS WVb6 21 tt:Jf6+ gxf6 22 gxf6 @hs 23 WVh6 .l:!.g8+ 24 @hl tt::i rs 25 .l:!.gl lbg6 26 .l:!.gS 1-0 An interesting relationship exists between the same .itd3, lbge2, f3, lbg3 set-up that oc curs in the Nimzo-Indian and in the Exchange Queen's Gambit. In both cases White wants to use his central majority and enforce e4 fol lowed by e5. Of course, the bishop on g5 in the Queen's Gambit is outside the central pawn chain and seems to play a completely different part from that on b2 or c 1 in the Nimzo-Indian, especially when ..ltxf6 is played with . . . ..ltxf6 as a reply. In both cases, however, White's main idea is e4-e5 (driving a piece away from f6 with tempo), followed by f4-f5 . And there is another connection, as illustrated by this po sition: This comes from our section on the Ex change Queen's Gambit. The bishop has re treated from g5 to f2 via h4, in part to avoid a forced exchange that can occur if the bishop re mains on g5 too long (by ... lbh5 or ... tbg6 and ...h6, for example), but also in order to defend the e3/d4 centre and allow for e4. Isn't this pretty much the function of the 'bad' bishop on b2 in the Nimzo lines that we have just seen? In simi lar fashion, Black will play ...c5 to increase pres sure on d4 and discourage the key advance e4. In both openings White may well switch to an attack via g4. Obviously meaningful differences exist. In the QGD, Black hasn't exchanged his dark-squared bishop for a knight. But we see how White in the Nimzo-Indian can achieve an effective attack with surprisingly reduced ma terial, a prime example being the Botvinnik Capablanca game above . Sarni sch Main Line with . . .cs and . . . .i.a6 After the 4 a3 move-order, Black frequently adopts a set-up in which he doesn't move the d pawn or e-pawn, but plays to blockade White's potential advances on both sides of the board. This strategy has been strengthened by specific move-orders in recent years. First let's see how the issues evolved with practice.

[diagram]
bxc3 O-O For a few comments on this move-order, see the next section.

[diagram]
This fixes the forward doubled pawn on c4 as an easy target of attack and eliminates any idea of White freeing his pieces by pushing his pawn to c5. Amongst the large set of options in the Samisch (and Nimzo-lndian), Black has 6 .. .b6 7 .itd3 ..ltb7, when 8 f3 is the normal move and has had mixed results. Much more interesting is Vaganian's recent move 8 lbe2 ! ?, offering a promising gambit: 8 ... ..ltxg2 9 .l:!.gl .itf3 (if 9 ... ..lte4, then 10 lbg3 !) 10 .l:!.g3 ..lte4 1 1 f3 ..ltxd3 1 2 WUxd3 with compensation for the pawn. Nevertheless, both sides have chances for ad vantage. 7 .itd3 lbc6 8 lbe2 b6 9 e4 lbe8! (D)

132 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

At first sight this gives a strange impression: Black doesn't develop a piece and moves the knight backwards. The retreat is justified by three considerations: Black avoids the annoy ing pin ..ltg5, he prepares to answer f4 with .. .f5, and he manoeuvres the knight towards the d6- square from which point it will attack c4 again. An early game Bronstein-Najdorf, Budapest Ct 1 950 illustrates what not to do as Black: 1 d4 tZ:lf6 2 c4 e6 3 tbc3 ..ltb4 4 a3 ..ltxc3+ 5 bxc3 c5

6 e3 tbc6 7 itd3 O-O 8 lbe2 d6 9 e4 lbe8 (the

(there was still time for 1 1 . ..f5 ! ) 12 f5 ! e5? (an innocent-looking move which loses the game !) 1 3 f6 ! (D). There is no good answer; for example, l 3. .. tZ:lxf6 14 ..\tg5 ! and Black will not survive lbg3-h5 and/or ..\txf6 with lbg3 and WVh5; and l 3. ..gxf6 14 d5 tZ:le7 1 5 ..lth6 tZ:lg7 1 6 tZ:lg3 is al most as bad. This is why f5 is seldom allowed and f6 almost never. You can see the rationale behind the blocking manoeuvre .. .f5.

10 O-O ..lta6

Getting to work on that c-pawn. Black's plan is simple and White needs to create something in the centre or kingside to counter it.

11 f4 f5

There's the blockading move that we men tioned. Notice how, by preventing f5, Black has prevented White's queen's bishop from moving to the kingside and perhaps joining in an attack. This same idea occurs in the Closed Sicilian line 1 e4 e5 2 tbc3 tbc6 3 g3 g6 4 ..ltg2 ..ltg7, where White plays f4 soon thereafter and Black replies ...f5. Similarly, in the King's Indian At tack, White will often arrange the move f4 and run into ...f5. Black has alternative approach: he can allow White to go one step further and then blockade by 1 1 ...f6 ! ? ( l 1 ...tLla5 1 2 f5 f6 is a similar idea) 1 2 f5 (D). The board is full of tension. A game Tisdall Amason, Husavik 1 985 went 1 2. .. cxd4 1 3 cxd4 .l:!.c8 14 ..\td2 ! exf5 ! 1 5 WVa4 fxe4 16 ..ltxe4 ..ltb7; here 17 WVc2 ! looks good, when 17 ...g6 1 8 ..\td5+ @g7 1 9 WVc l g5 20 tbg3 lbd6 2 1 WVdl is a sample line. Black has all kinds of options, however ( l 2. .. .l:!.c8 is an obvious one). I wouldn't bet on either side after 1 1 .. .f6. We now return to 1 1 .. .f5 (D ): From the position after l 1 .. .f5, we look at two games:

N!MZO-/NDJAN DEFENCE 133

Yusupov - Karpov Linares 1 993 12 lbg3 (D) At almost every juncture White has tried to exchange pawns, sometimes gaining a small advantage. In this position the exchange seems to help Black's structure as much as White's; e.g., 12 exf5 exf5 13 dxc5 bxc5 14 ..lte3 d6 1 5 .i.f2 WUd7 is a simple example. But the assess ment of these and similar plans can and will change as players refine their move-orders.

This move took over theory and practice for a while after Karpov won two games versus Yusupov. But 1 2. .. tt:Jd6 is logical, attacking the c4-pawn and defending f5. One possible prob- lem for Black is 1 3 exf5 exf5 ( 1 3. .. tZ:lxf5 14 lbxf5 exf5 1 5 dxc5 bxc5 16 WUf3; 1 3. ..cxd4 ! ?) 14 dxc5 bxc5 1 5 ..lte3, when his loose pieces make the defence difficult. 13 .ite3 (D) Keeping the tension in the centre. Again White can open the position with 1 3 exf5 exf5 14 dxc5 bxc5. Then 1 5 WVa4 is very interesting, and a tactical line that has occurred several times is 1 5 ..lte3 d6 ( 1 5. . .

Black can follow up with moves like ...WVc8 and ....l:!.b8 with a complex position that like so much else may be worked out by the time you read this book! What's important here are not the specific moves and ever-changing theory, but the overall situation: the burden is on White to alter the pawn-structure and/or dy namics of the position before Black consoli dates and wins positionally. This applies to a great number of Nimzo-Indian positions that involve ... .i.xc3+ and bxc3, and is worth keep ing in mind over-the-board. 13 . • . cxd4!?

4 e3 and the H ubner

Variation

[diagram]
For most of the modem history of the Nimzo lndian Defence, this modest advance has been played more often than any other move. Over the last decade or so 4 WVc2 has become a top level favourite and has recently surpassed 4 e3 on most levels of tournament play, but not by much. Between them these moves dominate Nimzo-Indian practice. In general one can say that 4 e3 is more flexible for both sides, leading to a remarkable number of formations, some times only barely related! I'll stick with a few popular variations whose lessons extend into other lines. We'll look at 4 ...O-O and 4 ...c5, each in their own section. Another important move is 4 ...b6. I'm not devoting space to it, but compare the Queen's Indian Defence of the next chapter. At this point we have some move-order is sues that are seldom addressed although obvi ously known to most masters. It says something about the technical nature of the Nimzo-Indian that tiny differences in move-order have such important positional effects. Because this is all rather confusing, I'm going to make a compari son of the consequences of playing 4 ...O-O and 4 ...c5 in terms of reaching desired positions. Otherwise, whether you're White or Black, it will be easy to get off on the wrong foot. Early Castling 4

••• O-O (D)

Castling is the most popular move at the top levels versus 4 e3. It is nevertheless a committal decision and it's interesting to see which of White's standard set-ups will achieve more or less against a castled king. White has four pri mary options (which are the same ones he plays versus 4 ...c5): 5 a3, 5 ..\td3, 5 tbe2 and 5 tZ:lf3. I'll look at the knight moves as main lines. 5 a3 enters into Siimisch territory, which we've been over. And 5 .itd3 is a transpositional bee hive, as follows: a) Should Black play 5 ... d5, then 6 a3 ! ? ..ltxc3+ 7 bxc3 followed by tbe2 should be compared with the Botvinnik Siimisch. b) Alternatively, 5 ... c5 leads to a number of positions depending upon what White chooses. I should mention that 6 tZ:lf3 d5 7 O-O is one of the classic positions of the Nimzo-Indian. It can

Both 'bl ' and 'b2' are the type of IQP posi tions which we discussed and of which I gave numerous examples in Chapter 3 of Volume 1 . 5 tbe2 (D) Torre - U nzicker Wijk aan Zee 1981 White plays conservatively, hoping to avoid the doubled pawns that would otherwise arise after ... ..ltxc3+. He wants to drive away the bishop and then expand in the centre. The drawbacks to this knight move include hemming in the bishop on fl and developing rather passively. 5 ...d5! Because this counter is available, 4 ...O-O is arguably the best order versus the tbe2 sys tems, or at least the easiest to play. Another strategy to exploit White's slow development and knight placement is 5 ... .l:!.e8 6 a3 .itf8 !?, when a recent game continued 7 d5 d6 8 g3 tbbd7 9 ..ltg2 tbe5 ! 10 b3 exd5 1 1 cxd5 ..ltg4 1 2 f4 tbed7 1 3 WVc2 ..ltxe2 14 @xe2 ! ? c6 1 5 dxc6 bxc6 16 e4 tbc5 1 7 ..lte3 d5 ! 1 8 e5 tbg4 1 9 ..ltd4 f6 20 ..ltxc5 fxe5 ! 2 1 @f3 e4+ 22 @e2 ..ltxc5 23 tbdl ..\tb6 with enormous centre pawns, Av rukh-P.Carlsson, Turin OL 2006.

4. ..cs (D)

This is the best path to take if you want to end up in the Hubner Variation, which is the subject of this section. 5 .itd3 Now 5 tZ'Be2 gives White some aggressive op tions and causes much more trouble for Black than does the position after 4 ...O-O 5 tZ'Be2 d5. The extra complications that come with 4 ... c5 could be a disincentive for Black in practice, but that depends upon specific variations. Here's an overview of 5 tZ'Be2 lines: 5 ... cxd4 (5 ... d5 6 a3 ..ltxc3+ 7 tZ'Bxc3 cxd4 8 exd4 dxc4 9 ..ltxc4 is satisfactory for Black but not to everyone's taste; Black can also play 5 ...b6! ? 6 a3 ..lta5, which has traditionally been a sideline but is considered fully playable) 6 exd4 d5 (6 ...O-O 7 a3 ..lte7 8 d5 exd5 9 cxd5 .l:!.e8 1 0 d6 ..\tf8 has a lot of theory attached to it, with difficulties for both sides, but perhaps a little more for Black if White really knows what he's doing) 7 c5 tZ'Be4 8 .i.d2 tZ'Bxd2 9 WUxd2 (D). 9 ...a5 (9. ..O-O 10 a3 ..lta5 ! ? is also possible)

tbc6 14 ..ltc2 and White gets genuine attacking chances. It just takes some study to catch up with this, especially by White. 5 ... tZ'Bc6 5 ... ..ltxc3+ 6 bxc3 tZ'Bc6, trying to get to a Hubner Variation, is a big positional error be cause White can play 7 tZ'Be2! instead of 7 tZ'Bf3. Then he is a full tempo ahead of a normal Samisch position because he skipped a3. 6 tZ'Bf3 ..ltxc3+ Only now does Black play this way, when White's knight on f3 obstructs its own pawns. 7 bxc3 d6 (D) This is the 'real' Hubner Variation, made fa mous by Hubner himself, but also by Fischer with his positionally devastating win over Spassky in their world championship match. Black has intentionally 'wasted' a move by ex changing on c3 without waiting for White to play a3. The point is that he plans ...e5, a move that wouldn't be particularly attractive if the c-pawns hadn't been doubled; e.g., if White

N!MZO-/NDJAN DEFENCE 139

had WVc2 in before ... ..ltxc3. The irony here is that in the Samisch Variation White is happy to 'waste' the tempo a3 in order to make his ideas work; whereas in the Hubner Variation, Black does the opposite (wastes a move by not wait ing for a3) for much the same reason! What are the general characteristics of the variation? Black is about to play ...e5, so as to partially close the position, and if White plays e4 and d5 (a common set-up) then the position is blocked on at least the queenside and in the centre. Therefore we expect more action on the king's wing. That explains why Black may not rush to castle, as he did above; he may well play . .. O-O-O. White may also choose not to castle, according to taste. On the one hand castling gives White an extra move to see what Black is doing. On the other hand, since the closed cen tre renders White's king safe enough, foregoing O-O can give him an extra tempo to carry out other manoeuvres. At this point the play therefore splits into 8 O-O and lines in which White plays without (or delays) O-O. Lukacs - Stohl Austrian Cht 1994

This is the most direct and one of the two most important replies to 4 'i¥'c2. In many ways it is the most logical. As indicated above, White's queen has abandoned defence of d4, so the threat of ...dxc4 is a serious one. If you think in terms of the Queen's Gambit Declined, it seems aw fully early for White to have his queen on c2. In fact, the first thing that we'll look at can tum into the equivalent of the QGD Exchange Variation, 5 cxd5. That can lead to a quiet game or a com plex tactical game depending upon what the players want. We'll get an overview of the mate rial by looking at instructive games, which as usual are mainly aimed at strategy and less at bringing you up to date with theory.

144 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

5 cxdS I shall just give an outline of the alternative 5 a3 �xc3+ 6 'i¥'xc3. Much of its theory has be come a matter pure analysis, heavy on tactics.

This is merely a proposition, and there may prove to be exceptions, but to me it indicates that a funda mental dynamic balance exists in some opening variations that cannot be overcome even by the most ingenious ideas. We now return to the position after 5 cxd5

By choosing this move, Black refuses to commit to a plan and waits to decide upon his choice of ...d5, ... c5, or ...b6.

5 e4 (D)

Talk about a fundamental challenge to 4 ... O-O! White simply takes over the centre. This had been condemned for years and designated an error by some sources; then someone decided that it might be OK to suffer a little as long as he could win the battle of control over vitally important central turf. As of this writing 5 e4 has been doing about as well as any other varia tion in the Nimzo-lndian. It is so committal, however, that I wouldn't be shocked if it were 'solved' in the sense of giving Black a clear

NIMZO-/NDIAN DEFENCE 155

path to equality or even better. Whatever hap pens, however, an examination of 5 e4 must be worth it, if only for the average player to under stand why such a natural move hasn't always been one of White's main choices and why it has become one. We' ll first look at 5 ... d6, a re sponse that Black has used to avoid the most critical lines, and then 5 . . .d5, directly challeng ing the centre. For the curious, other moves such as 5 ...c5 seem playable. The Slow Line 5 ...d6 (D) Apparently unchallenging, Black's simple move has its strengths. Much as in other varia tions of the Nimzo-lndian, he wants to block ade the big centre in order to attack it later. 6 a3 a) The logical alternative 6 ..td3 avoids dou bled pawns, but anything that doesn't support d4 allows Black to transform the pawn-structure to his liking: 6 ...e5 ! 7 lbe2 ! ? (7 a3 ! ..txc3+ 8 bxc3 transposes to our main game; 7 d5 allows for a variety of choices, since the c5-square has opened up for Black's bishop on b4 or his knight on b8; e.g., 7 ... lba6 8 a3 ..txc3+ 9 'ifxc3 lbc5 10 f3 lbh5 intending ... °ifh4+ and/or ...f5) 7 ...exd4 8 lbxd4. This position was contested as far back as the 1 930s. Black can continue 8 . . . ..txc3+ 9 'ifxc3 l:.e8 1 0 f3 d5 1 1 cxd5 lbxd5 12 °ifb3 lbb6 with complications. Or he can choose 8 .. . l:.e8 9 O-O ! ? ..txc3 10 'ifxc3 lbxe4 1 1 °ifc2 lbf6 1 2 ..tg5 h6 13 ..th4 with some com pensation. Even 8 ... lbc6 9 lbxc6 bxc6 has been tried with reasonable prospects. One other thing to note is that Black can retreat to c5 with his bishop in all these lines, especially after a3, and have satisfactory play. b) I should mention that 6 e5 ! ? is also played, when White's centre isn't as vulnerable as it looks. 6 ... dxe5 7 dxe5 lbg4 8 lbf3 lbc6 9 i.f4 or 9 a3 can follow, with complex play that I won't pursue here. 6 ... ..txc3+ 7 bxc3 e5 We have a Samisch Variation in which Black has played ...e5, with the important difference that White has played e4 in one jump. On the other hand the move 'ifc2 isn't necessarily that useful, and the advanced centre is potentially ex posed. The resulting strategies can vary wildly. To begin with, Black threatens ... exd4 followed by ... lbxe4, so White's next move is natural: 8 i.d3 (D) Here the main moves are 8 . . . lbc6 and 8 .. .c5, for which I shall give game examples. Black's other continuation is 8 ...b6 9 lbe2 ..tb7 1 0 O-O l:.e8, which attempts to force White into playing d5. This is a traditional way for Black to proceed in the Nimzo-lndian, but White doesn't have to oblige (perhaps having the queen on c2 is worthwhile after all !): 1 1 lbg3 lbc6 1 2 i.b2 lbe7 ! ? 1 3 f4 lbg6 1 4 i.c l ! lbd7 ! ? 1 5 f5 lbgf8 1 6 f6!

Although highly praised, this advance does have the problem that it will inevitably open the c-file and expose White's weaknesses.

have to be assessed on an individual basis. It's surprising that White can allow Black to de velop so quickly with threats; after all, he only has two pieces out and is far from castling.

160 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

7 .....tb7 (D) There is a considerable body of theory and practice behind the move 7 ... ..ta6, although it is still not considered as important as the simple fianchetto. In grandmaster games in which 4 'ifc2 is played, this position is reached more often than any other. For the most part the variations turn technical, however, which dampens the interest of many lower-level players. I'll give a couple of games to indicate what both sides may be after. 8 f3 Kasparov - Timman Linares 1993 There's a logic to this move that goes beyond enforcing e4, namely, that control of the square itself lies behind most of White's strategies in this variation. For example, apart from 8 f3, White sometimes plays 8 lbf3 and then 9 lbd2, as in the next game. Or, in other lines, a knight will come to c3 via e2. White does have one other idea that is specifically connected with 8 f3 : his knight can develop to h3 and then per haps f2. But this highlights a negative aspect to White's whole approach: he is still a long way from developing his kingside. 8 ... dS!? (D) Black employs the easiest idea, which is to challenge White's centre before it becomes mo bile. But 8 ...h6! is helpful in several lines, since after 9 ..th4 it takes the bishop away from the queenside and centre, in particular e3. There's also a tactical point to forcing the bishop back, as seen in the note to move 1 0.

9 e3 lbbd7

These last two moves have become so cus tomary that (ignoring the omission of ...h6 for the moment) the majority of games with a ...d5 defence begin here. 10 cxdS! exdS A tactic that often applies in these positions is 1 0. .. lbxd5?! 1 1 ..txd8 lbxc3 1 2 ..txc7 lbd5 1 3 ..tf4 lbxf4 1 4 exf4. White's pawns are crip pled, but he's still a pawn ahead and this posi tion has lacked takers from Black's side . ..td3 and lbe2 will follow in most lines, with @f2 a good centralizing move. However, it's important to note that if the moves 8 ...h6 9 ..th4 were inserted, as they usu ally are, then in this line Black could answer ..tf4 with ... g5 ! and win the e3-pawn. That position is known to be equal. In fact, White hasn't been able to prove any advantage in the lines after 8 ...h6 9 ..th4 d5, although the debate continues. 11 ..td3 (D)

Targeting the e-pawn right away. Now it looks as though ...h6 is a threat. 12 lbe2! h6 13 ..th4! In fact, we've transposed to a normal posi tion except that Black didn't have the opportu nity for an effective ... lbxd5. 13 .. •c5 The point is that 13 ... l::!. xe3? loses to 14 ..txf6! lbxf6 15 ..th7+.

[diagram]
An important positional idea is that 16 ...cxd4 is well answered by 1 7 exd4! (D), even though 17 lbxd4 places a knight in front of the isolani opposing the bad bishop. That latter position isn't bad, but it does give Black nice posts on e5 and c5 for his d7-knight. After the recapture by the pawn, we have a position that could come from the Queen's Gambit. Every key central square is covered and White, whose position looks innocuous at the moment, can slowly activate his pieces, in particular a rook to the e-file and his bishop to g3. Again, stability favours the bishop-pair. 17 lbc3! lbf8 18 l:.fel lbe6 19 ..th4 lbg5

6 Queen's Indian Defence

[diagram]

1 d4 '2lf6 2 c4 e6 3 ctJf3 (D)

By playing 3 '2lf3 White enters into a contest about move-order choices. By omitting or put ting off '2lc3 he avoids the highly-respected Nimzo-Indian Defence ( 1 d4 '2lf6 2 c4 e6 3 '2lc3 .lfi.b4) and indeed, this is generally consid ered the main motivation behind 3 '2lf3. Other wise, with a few exceptions mentioned below, White gains little by delaying 3 '2lc3 versus the main defences to 1 d4, and he can sacrifice some popular options. Let me clarify that by examples. After 3 '2lc3, White might want to enter into a variation not accessible after 3 ctJf3, such as the Exchange Queen's Gambit 3 ... d5 4 cxd5 exd5 5 ii.gs c6 6 e3 .lfi.e7 7 .lfi.d3 O-O 8 '2lge2. White's commitment to '2lf3 precludes a number of popular options. In fact, even the Classical Queen's Gambit Declined that arises from 1 d4 '2lf6 2 c4 e6 3 ctJf3 d5 4 '2lc3 differs in several ways from 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 '2lc3, al though they will often transpose. In the latter order, for example, Black might play 3 ... .lfi.e7. These positions are dealt with at some length in Chapter 2 on the Queen's Gambit. Another restriction imposed by 3 '2lf3 comes up in the Modem Benoni. White has eliminated certain options that arise after 3 '2lc3 c5 4 d5 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 e4 g6; for example, 7 .lfi.d3 .lii. g7 8 '2lge2 O-O 9 O-O, 7 f4 i..g7 8 i..b5+ (or here 8 ctJf3) or 7 f3 .lfi.g7 8 i..g5. Obviously, none of those variations can be played after 3 ctJf3 . Thus, when playing 3 ctJf3, it's necessary to build a repertoire around these limitations. In actual practice, most players are not deterred by that task. 3 ...b6 (D) The Queen's Indian Defence (a.k.a. 'QID') is defined by this move. Notice that after 3 '2lc3, 3 ...b6?! allows 4 e4 with superior central control, something Black really doesn't want to let happen. After 3 '2lf3 b6, however, Black in tends to keep a determined hold on the central light squares and permit neither a successful e4 nor d5 . This can involve the moves ...d5 or . .. f5, if necessary, and often includes occupation of e4 by either a knight or a bishop. White for his part may strive directly to en force e4 by moves such as '2lc3 (perhaps pref aced by a3 to prevent ... .lfi.b4) and 'iVc2. Or he can do the same, but slowly, by means of g3, .lii. g2 and ctJc3 or '2lbd2 depending upon the sit uation. His ultimate set-up and strategy will de pend upon what Black specifically undertakes in the centre. The resulting tension can produce

both strategically and tactically interesting chess. This is a lesson to players everywhere, because for many years the Queen's Indian De fence had the reputation of being a dull opening that normally led to a drawish position. In fact, that reputation still holds among some lower rated players, although it shouldn't. I'm going present an overview of the varia tions and ideas of the Queen's Indian, with a mix of older and newer games. The emphasis will be on a few of the typically dynamic ideas that are being played in modem chess.

After 4 g3, Black makes a decision as to how he wants to counter White's space advantage: 4 ... .lfi.b7 or 4 ... .lfi.a6. The Classical 4 . . . .tb7 4 ... .lfi.b7 This is the older move, which generally leads to a quieter game but not always so. 5 i.g2 White's plan is O-O, Cl'Bc3, and then d5 or 'iVc2 and e4. 5 ... i.e7 (D) Where do the pieces belong? Basically Black has to develop his kingside, get castled, and make sure that White doesn't play d5. His other natural choice is 5 ... .lfi.b4+, when 6 .lfi.d2 i..xd2+ (6 .. . .lfi.e7 ! ?) 7 'iVxd2 Cl'Be4 8 'iYc2 O-O 9 Cl'Bc3 sets up an old trap: 9 ... 'l'Bxc3? 10 'l'Bg5 ! and Black is losing material ! This is a typical tactic that is worth knowing, although Black had to make some weak moves to allow it.

So 8 i.d2 is logical, preparing 9 d5. But the interest ing part is that if Black captures White's bishop on d2, White counts upon having a big centre and better development that will outweigh the bishop-pair. That is a bit unusual when there are no weaknesses in Black's camp, but it has been shown to be true in this particular position. Thus you will very seldom see 8 ... 'l'Bxd2. 8 ... .lfi.f6 The other well-known move is 8 ... f5, when 9 'iVc2 .lfi.f6 10 l:tadl ! has won some nice games. 9 l:tcl (D) This is the basic position of the main line.

.lfi.b4+ 6 .lfi.d2 i.e7 7 '2lc3 Instead of 7 i.g2, White plays directly for e4, a natural and logical plan.

The theory of the variation with 4 g3 i.a6 5 b3 i.b4+ is ever-expanding. We may soon find out if Black can effectively neutralize White's play in this manner or will have to suffer under a long-term disadvantage. Whether the Queen's Indian supplies a satisfactory defence to 3 lllf3 depends in part upon his solution to 4 g3. Petrosian System (4 a3)

1 d4 lll

f6 2 c4 e6 3 lll f3 b6 4 a3 (D)

At first you may think that this move is a ter rible waste of time. Obviously, White is trying to prevent ...i.b4, but is it worth a tempo? And what else does 4 a3 do? To begin with, prevent ing ... i.b4 is worth a lot more than it may seem. It's not just that the Nimzo-Indian (3 lll c3 i.b4) is such a bother to play against, but that Black has already committed himself to ...b6 (and thus ... i.b7 or ... i.a6). That is a set-up in which a knight on c3 is particularly useful. Specifically, a knight there not only supports e4 (as does a knight on d2 or queen on c2), but also the pawn advance d5 (a move that loses its support after llld2 or i¥c2). This is important because once Black has fianchettoed his queen's bishop, a white pawn on d5 can become particularly irri tating. In response to this potential threat, Black can of course play ...d5, but that accedes to a type of pawn-structure that Black may not pre fer once committed to ...b6. To understand this. let' s compare that formation with the Queen's Gambit Declined. The only major variation in which Black plays ...b6 is the Tartakower. In deed, if play from the diagram proceeded 4 ...d5 5 lll c3 i.e7 6 i.g5 O-O 7 e3 i.b7 (7 ...h6 is a po tential waste of tempo: 8 i.xf6!), Black would have a standard position of the Tartakower Vari ation in which the move a3 can justifiably be re garded as useless, or nearly so. But once Black has weakened his queenside squares, White has other options; e.g., 6 cxd5 ! exd5 (6 ... lll xd5 7 e4) 7 i.f4 O-O 8 e3 (D).

White has serious queenside pressure be cause of Black's weaknesses there (l:i.c 1 and ei ther i¥h3 or i¥a4 might prove useful). In fact, the move lll b5 becomes an immediate theme (e.g .. 8 ... i.f5 9 lll b5 llla6 10 i¥a4), because White's profligate 4 a3 actually prevents ... i.b4+ in re sponse ! 4 ••. i.b7 We'll follow this as the main line but it's quite possible that other moves are as good or better: a) 4 ... i.a6 is very popular. Black has done well in this line, and he retains a degree of flexi bility in his choice of piece placements. The main line goes 5 i¥c2 i.b7 ! (this is a hyper modem idea: first Black diverts the queen and

1 74 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

then wastes a move to cover e4; but what's the point?) 6 lbc3 c5 ! (the queen no longer sup ports the move d5, so Black can break up the centre in this way) 7 e4! (taking over the largest share of the centre; 7 dxc5 would concede d4) 7 ... cxd4 8 lbxd4 (D). As in the Sicilian Defence, Black has a central majority and would love to achieve ...d5. For the moment, that move fails to cxd5 and i.b5+, so White has some time to strengthen his cen tre. The queen on c2 can either be a drawback (it sits on the open c-file) or an advantage (it al lows White's rooks to connect more quickly). Here Black has played 8 ... lbc6 and 8 ...d6 with reasonable success. A complicated alternative is 8 ... i.c5 9 lbb3 lbc6! (not only does Black de velop quickly but he also targets the only weak ness in White's position: the hole on d4) 10 i.g5 h6 1 1 i.h4 lbd4! 12 lbxd4 i.xd4 13 i.d3 (the white e-pawn needs protection) 13 ...

15 O-O-O O-O 16 'lt>bl d6 1 7 i.xe5 dxe5 (D).

There's that doubled e-pawn structure that we talk about periodically through the book. Whether the pawns are ultimately useful or a problem is as yet unclear, but notice that both d5 and d4 are covered so that White can't put a piece on either square, and of course d4 will serve as an outpost for Black's pieces. On the other hand, White has no targets for Black to attack and he has a potentially important queen side pawn-majority. Khenkin-Adams, Bundes liga 2002/3 continued 1 8 i¥e2 l:i.d8 19 i¥e3 (White could consider some kingside attack with, say, 19 g4 or 19 f3 and g4 next) 19. .. l:i.d4!

Now White's most ambitious move is 5 d5.

Note that we've arrived at a Benoni in which Black has two extra moves ...b6 and ... i.d7 for White's one. Nevertheless, this trade-off fa vours White, who can handily play moves such as .ltf4 with tempo. Conversely, Black's plans are disrupted because he would like to play ei ther ... lba6-c7 (not possible here) or ...l:i.e8 and ... lbbd7, in which case he needs to move the d7- bishop. That points to the move l l ... i.g4, when 12 i.f4 i.xf3 13 i.xf3 i¥e7?! prepares ... lbbd7, a familiar plan from the Modem Benoni of

What are the characteristics of this position? Black has the bishop-pair and White's f-pawns are doubled. Nevertheless, White light-squared bishop is better than its counterpart on b7, he has the g-file, and a well-timed knight jump to e5 can be useful. Black can try to gain space on the queenside ( ...b5 and ...a5 or ... lbb6, for ex ample) or use piece-play on the kingside ( ... l:i.e8, ... lllf8-g6). In the meantime, White might shift his pieces to the kingside ('lt>h l , l:i.gl , i¥c2, e3, lbe2-g3), especially since any attempt to play b4 can be weakening. But 6 ... lbxd5 (D) is the most important con tinuation: Apart from the main lines with 4 g3, this is probably the most heavily analysed position from the Queen's Indian Defence. By 'surren dering the centre' but keeping the long diagonal open for his bishop, Black announces his policy of allowing White to form a strong centre and then sniping at it from the wings. The resulting positions resemble the Griinfeld Defence in spirit. Black's bishop will usually be on e7 in stead of g7, but Black's quest for the queenside light squares gives the two openings a similar flavour.

1 77 At this juncture White normally plays: A: 7 e3 or B: 7 i¥c2. We' ll look at games that express typical ideas behind both moves, by no means attempt ing to recreate the current theoretical standing of the variation. A complex alternative is 7 i.d2, which intends a recapture with the bishop after ... lllxc3; this idea normally appears after 7 i¥c2. There are also a number of variations with 7 i¥a4+ and/or �g5 that haven't produced spectacular results, probably because the move a3 isn't so useful in that case.

7 King's Indian Defence

Before we even begin, I should explain that the King's Indian Defence (a.k.a. 'KID') is actu ally a set of moves that has no specific starting point. That is to say, Black plays 1 . . .tll f6, 2 ... g6, 3 ... .lll. g7, ...d6 and almost always ... O-O (nor mally in that order), versus almost any first move by White other than l e4. But we shall concern ourselves with the King's Indian De fence in its original meaning, that is, versus d4. The best way to introduce ourselves to the KID is to take a stroll through the first few moves. 1 d4

1 c4 lll

f6 can transpose into a 1 d4 version of the King's Indian Defence should White play d4 on any of the next several moves. The same applies to 1 lll f3; for example, 1 .. .tll f6 2 d4 g6, etc.

1...tllf6 (D)

2 c4 2 lll f3 g6 is another route that often trans poses to c4 lines. Of course that order might lead to independent systems; for example, 3 .Ill. gs, 3 .lli. f4, and a number of lesser options that are not covered in this book. A very brief word on the first two, since I'll have a bishop-devel opment theme over the next few moves. a) 3 .Ill. gs is an offshoot of the Torre Attack. Black can play any number of systems and any number of move-orders, but in deference to my lectures about ...cS in these contexts, I'll point out that after 3 ... .lll. g7 4 tll bd2 (versus . . . lbe4 ) 4 ...c S i s a legitimate choice, with one important line proceeding S .lll. xf6 .lll. xf6 6 lll e4 �xd4 (or 6 ...

Again ...cS is to be consid- ered at most points; e.g., 3 ...cS is theoretically equal and 3 ... .lll. g7 4 e3 d6 S h3 (to have a place to hide after ... tllhS) S ...O-O 6 .lll. e2 cS can be played, among others. In both cases Black has an eye on the move ... \Rb6. This is relevant to points that I make below. 2 ... g6 3 lll c3 This time 3 lll f3 .lll. g7 4 g3 can be of inde pendent significance and will generally trans pose to the Fianchetto System, which I shall not be covering in this book. 3 ... .lll. g7 (D) This position may be considered the begin ning point for the King's Indian Defence. a sto ried opening associated with dynamic slugfests of the highest order. It was championed by

KING 'S IND/AN DEFENCE 185

That's quite a superficial account of play in the King's Indian, and such positions don't even arise in many variations. But the 'threat' of their occurrence underlies a lot of what both sides actually do in terms of strategy. The other positional factors that interact with this opening are too numerous to mention, so I'll leave that to analysis and examples in specific variations. My emphasis will be on the major systems that begin 1 d4 tt'Bf6 2 c4 g6 3 tt'Bc3 i.g7 4 e4 d6. They constitute the large bulk of master prac tice, and along with g3 systems they account for well over 90% of grandmaster games. Be cause the main lines are so instructive, I'll only briefly examine some instructive alternatives in what follows. Selected Alternatives to 4 e4

1 d4 tt'Bf6 2 c4 g6 3 tt'Bc3 i.g7 (D)

There are of course many alternatives to 4 e4, but none of them except the g3 variations are very popular. Therefore I'll point out only a few options with ideas that you might want to be aware of. I'll try to tie this section together a bit by emphasizing the move i.g5 in many con texts. 4 tt'Bf3 This flexible development of the king's knight introduces most serious deviation from main lines. Almost any set-up following from 4 e3 can be met by ...d6, ... O-O and ...e5 (sup ported by a piece if necessary). 4 i.f4 is a legiti mate move and will usually transpose into some other variation after 4 ...d.6. Both sides should be aware that Black's attempts to exchange such a bishop by means of ... tt'Bh5 (for example ) are an important consideration. Compare lines below. Our main theme is the development of the queen's bishop to g5 at various stages. Here 4 i.g5 can be met by 4 ...c5 (4 ...h6 5 .lth4 d6 is normal and fine, of course; ...c5 may follow soon anyway), and if 5 d5, 5 ...h6 6 i.h4 'ika5 7 °iVd2 g5 8 i.g3 tt'Bh5 (D) followed ... tt'Bxg3 with equality. What should be noted is that, unsupported by a knight on f3, the move 9 i.e5 cannot be played. That is the move that White should look for if Black has not yet played ...d6 (see the next note). In this kind of position, which is ubiquitous in the King's Indian and Benoni, hundreds of top-level games have confirmed that Black's two bishops at least compensate for his slightly weakened pawn-structure. Regarding the latter. we can apply the old saying: weaknesses aren't weak unless you can exploit them. 4 ...d6 Once White is committed to 4 tt'Bf3, castling by Black seems to have lost the disadvantages that it has in the order 4 e4 O-O. That doesn't mean that it's a better move than 4 ...d6, but it al lows Black a few new options; for example. 4 ...O-O 5 i.g5 c5 (the move ...c5 is thematic if the c I -bishop strays to the kingside; see below )

186 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

This is known as the Smyslov System, which is very solid and a good choice for White if he doesn't fancy too complicated a position. He opts for quick development and well-placed pieces without trying to capture too much of the centre. For his part, Black doesn't feel very threatened and can play to gain some space on either wing. He also hopes to chase down White's dark-squared bishop as above. As for 5 .lli. f4, Farago-Bilek, Budapest 1965 saw a creative solution to 5 ... O-O 6 h3, a rather irritating move which is frequently played to preserve the f4-bishop and avoid having it chased down as in the examples that we keep seeing. The game went 6 ...c5 (6 ... lll h5 7 .lli. h2 is the point) 7 e3 \Ra5 ! 8 \Rd2 cxd4 9 exd4 e5 ! ( D). 10 .lll. e3 (not 10 dxe5? dxe5 1 1 .lll. xe5, when l l ...Ii.e8 wins material, and l 1 . . .tllc6 is also very strong) 10. ..tllc6 1 1 d5 lll e7 12 .lli. d3 tlle8 (12 ... tllf5 13 .lll. g5 h6) 13 O-O f5 with equality. This even looks like a King's Indian! We now return to 5 .lll. g5 (D):

5 •.. h6 Black prepares yet another combination of chasing the knight and . . .c5. After 5 ...O-O 6 e3, the obvious 6 ... tll bd7, to prepare ... e5, can be met by the sophisticated and well-tested move 7 \Rc2! ; e.g., 7 ...e5?!

Instead of this, 6 ...c5 7 .lll. e2 .lli. f5 intending ... tlle4 is often recommended, as Smyslov himself played when Black versus Pachman. That is hardly the most incisive line, however, and shouldn't put anyone off playing 5 .lll. g5. 6 .lll. h4 g5 7 i.g3 lll h5 Once again both sides have to decide where to put their pieces. The following is a logical way to continue:

KING 'S IND/AN DEFENCE 187

for his own pieces. The conflict between this wish and the vulnerability of his centre to Black's attacks underlies the players' strategies for most of the opening phase and sometimes well beyond.

4. ..d6 (D)

This is almost universally played after 4 e4. Black's intent is to restrain eS and stake out some claim to the centre. I shall only remark upon 4 ... O-O in the introductory note to the Four Pawns Attack below, in the context of that vari ation. Although I won't entirely neglect other vari ations, I shall devote most of this chapter to the Four Pawns Attack (S f4), and the Classical Variation (S lllf3), with an emphasis on the lat ter. The King's Indian is so vast that one could devote this book to its many fascinating varia tions, but in line with the philosophy that un derstanding can only be gained by attending to details, I have decided to specialize in those two variations. The examination of the Four Pawns continues my policy of taking the most obvious attempt at refutation of an opening in order to gain some insight into its character. To do this we might ask which moves would probably be proposed by the average player if he were see ing an opening for the first time, especially if he'd heard that the opening wasn't supposed to be any good. That is, which variation would he instinctively use to demonstrate that the open ing was disadvantageous? For the King's In dian Defence, the Four Pawns Variation seems the obvious choice in that respect, because it at tempts to punish Black immediately for not oc cupying the centre. The Classical Variation of the King's Indian Defence is one of the most subtle and complex variations in chess, but at the same time it has some broadly applicable ideas that are quite straightforward, especially about pawn-struc tures and their treatment. Thus the inexperi enced player can gain insights that will help him begin to play the KID, and there will be material that should help players of any level to refine their understanding. In addition to these two systems, I have in cluded sections on the Averbakh Variation (S .lll. e2 O-O 6 .lll. gS) and the Samisch Variation (S f3). They feature a few unique pawn-structures and in particular emphasize the formations with the move ...cS that don't appear in the Classical Variation. First, to complete the discussion that we've had about .Ill. gs lines, I'll focus on the move S .Ill. gs and tie it in with the earlier examples we looked at, both practically and philosophically. After S .lll. gS, Black can castle, but one might ar gue that S ...O-O isn't optimal because it justifies White's play after 6 \Rd2, preventing ...h6 and preparing attack in many lines. Of course that's hardly disastrous, but S .. .h6 is the more ambi tious choice: 6 .lll. h4 (if instead 6 i.e3, 6 ... tll g4 is a good response, and 6 .lli. f4 can be met effi ciently by 6 ... tllc6 7 dS eS !); and now 6 ... cS !

We've now seen this move several times; in the King's Indian and most 1 d4 openings, an early move of White's queen's bishop to f4 or gS indicates that Black should strongly con sider ...cS as his reply (immediately or within

This incomplete discussion of 4 ...O-O isn't directly important (after all, hardly anyone plays the move!), but we can begin to get a feel for typical King's Indian considerations.

5 f4 (D)

The Four Pawns Attack, White's most ambi tious approach and probably the first one that would occur to a player who has never seen the King' s Indian, but knows the importance of central control and occupation by pawns. In the 1 920s when the King's Indian became more than a curiosity, the Four Pawns was indeed used by the likes of Alekhine, Bogoljubow. among other leading players. The dynamic possibilities and chances for a quick knockout were surely considerations in their reaction. Most textbooks (and this one) will show some examples of the triumph of the centre in other openings; e.g., something along the lines of I e4 eS 2 lll f3 tllc6 3 .lll. c4 .Ill. cs 4 c3 tllf6 5 d4 exd4 6 cxd4 .lll. b6? 7 dS tlle7 8 eS and Black's pieces are driven into passivity as a result of the unopposed onslaught by White's centre pawns. How much better it should be to play moves like eS and dS, when they are protected by pawns on either side! Furthermore, Black is supposed to stake a claim in the centre before he is overrun, right? Of course, it's not so easy for White; advantages of this nature always have their accompanying disadvantages. In the case of the Four Pawns KID, we see that the pawns on c4 and f4 are also restricting the scope of White's bishops on fl and c l . Perhaps this isn't a dominant concern because once the pawns advance, at least one is normally ex changed. For example, in the main lines Black will trade off his e-pawn for White's c-pawn or e-pawn. Still, the cost in time to erect such a centre has to be considered. Furthermore, the advance of pawns in any chess opening leaves open the risk that they might become weak. In the Four Pawns KID. we see that the squares e4 and d4 are no longer able to receive the support of the pawn moves c3 and f3, so they are more exposed to attack: this is particularly true of d4, since it is indi rectly attacked by Black's bishop on g7 and can be disturbed by the pawn moves ...c5 and ...e5. Furthermore, the squares e3 and d3 may be considered 'interior weaknesses', since they are also without support. In most situations. inte rior weaknesses on the third rank are difficult to exploit, being within the defensive range of so many pieces. But that can be a different matter if the centre in front of them is compromised. If and when White's pawns advance further to d5 and/or e5 (which is the plan, after all), e4 and d4 become interior weaknesses as well. Then

190 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

those front pawns are within range of Black' s forces, which are waiting on the second and third ranks for just such an opportunity to tear into the ill-protected foot soldiers. That worst case scenario for White would result from his over-enthusiasm. It turns out that White should usually marshal his pieces to support the centre pawns and wait for the right opportunity to press forward. Or in some cases he will count upon them as cramping influences and forego a gen eral advance indefinitely. These methods pro vide the rationale for White' s entire enterprise. 5 ... O-O 6 lll f3 (

This is Black's traditional main line. He at tacks the centre at its weakest point on d4; but at the same time wants to unleash the power of the bishop on g7. 7 d5 There are two frequently-used ways to devi ate from this natural move: a) White might want to take the King's In dian player out of his normal channels by 7 i.e2 cxd4 8 l2'lxd4 (D).

White aims for a Maroczy Bind structure (characterized by c4 and e4). This is a safe choice, but compared to the Sicilian Defence version in Volume 1, the move f4 instead of f3 weakens e4 and makes it easier for Black to find counterplay; for example, 8 ... lba6!

From the position after 9 cxd5, I'll present a short overview of the daring 9 ... ctJbd7 and then look at two main moves, 9 ... l:.e8 and 9 ... i.g4, citing games with a selection of the most essen tial treatments and tactical motifs of the Four Pawns. Several of these also apply to other openings. The main alternative 9 .. .b5 ! ? ex presses a different philosophy, trying to divert White from protection of his centre. The first threat is ... b4, which limits White's options. If White plays the obvious move 10 i.xb5?!, Black has a tactic that you simply have to know if you're playing the King's Indian or Benoni with either colour: 10 ... lbxe4! (D). 1 1 lbxe4 'ii a5+ with the idea 12 lbc3 (12 'it>f2 'ii xb5 13 lbxd6 wins a pawn but misplaces White's king and weakens his light squares) 1 2. . . i.xc3+ 13 bxc3 'ii xb5.

This brings to the fore the conflict between White's direct e5 and Black's attempts to destroy the central pawns before they strangle him. I'll use two exem plary games to investigate the nature of the re sulting play: Blokh - A. Feldman

(this is the move that opens up White's pieces: his important moves are ctJd5 and i.c4 or i.b5) 14 ... ctJxf3+ 1 5 i.xf3 ctJf8 !

'i!Yb6 ( D) 13 'i!Yd2!? An exciting move invented by the Four Pawns theoretician Blokh. Instead, one of the main lines of theory goes 1 3 O-O tbxe5 14 lbxe5 i.xe5 1 5 i.c4 i.f5 ! 16 ctJb5 a6 ! 17 d6 ! axb5 1 8 i.xf7 + !

OK, this is all theory (and was at the time), but it shows the near-perfect balance between at tack and defence that typifies this main line of the 9 ... l:i.e8 Four Pawns Attack. 13 ... ctJd7 It's always a critical decision for Black whether to capture the important e-pawn. The danger is that it will take too much time from Black's development. For example, Blokh anal yses 1 3. .. tbxe5 14 O-O-O c4 1 5 lbxe5 i.xe5 16 i.xc4 'i!Yc5 17 i.b3 lba6 18 l:i.hfl i.g4 19 d6!

Piskov - Parmentier Budapest 1989 10 ctJd2 (D) At first this move looks passive, merely pro tecting e4, but it has a very dynamic plan be hind it: White wants to get his knight to c4 and force e5 through. Why not just leave the knight on f3 and do the same? For one thing, advanc ing to e5 immediately gambits a pawn, as in the previous game. It also happens that a knight on c4 is ideally placed to attack the d-pawn (and the d6-square itself) if, for example, Black plays ...ctJfd7 at some point. Another very important advantage to lbd2-c4 is that a bishop can go to f3 to strengthen White's centre. Then if White

198 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

plays e5, this piece will defend the d-pawn against attack and can grow greatly in range. The formation with a bishop on f3 and knight on c4 also allows a rook on e 1 to provide direct support for a central thrust. Finally, it turns out that there is a dangerous sacrifice initiated by e5 and then playing ctJc4 with tempo. What should Black do? It's all a matter of timing. First of all, ctJc4 isn't a threat yet be cause the pawn on e4 hangs. Queenside activity is called for to activate his pieces before White can implement his plan. Specifically Black would like to play ...b5 and/or ...c4 to try to get a knight to squares like d3. 10 .•. lba6 A good defensive example was 10 ...a6 1 1 a4 lbbd7 12 O-O c4!? 1 3 @hl (13 lbxc4 lbxe4 14 lbxe4 l:.xe4 is equal, and has the point 1 5 ctJxd6??

White either plays in the centre by marshalling his forces to break through on the restricted square e5, or uses pawn advances on the kingside to launch a direct attack on that lightly-populated area of the board.

[diagram]
ctJf3 ctJa6 ( D) At first this may seem to be a strange way to counter a formation so imposing as the Four Pawns. As it happens, moving a knight to the rim is routine in the King's Indian Defence and relates directly to the centre. For one thing, the usual choices of a square for this piece are: a) c6, where it can be attacked by d5, and b) d7, where it gets in the way of Black's light-squared bishop. In this particular situation neither of those options is realistic. The strategy behind ... ctJa6 is to play ...e5 and then have the c5-square available for the knight in case White grabs the e5-pawn and tries to hold it. That will yield ac tive play. On a secondary level, 6 ... lba6 is a waiting move to see what White is up to. Black can still change his mind about ...e5 and play something like ... i.g4 or ...c5 instead. 7 i.d3 This is probably the most logical continua tion if White is planning to answer ...e5 with d5 at some point. Then his e-pawn is covered, a nice thing in view of a coming ... ctJc5. Some of the alternatives are just as important, how ever. a) 7 e5 might be the Four Pawns player's in stant reaction, since it stops ...e5 and at first the knight on a6 doesn't look relevant with regard to central play. But the latter part isn't true. 7 ... lbd7 (D) follows, when Black is about to play ...c5. Then one of several ideas is 8 i.e2 (White would like to be able to play d5 in response to ...c5 without losing his e-pawn; the only move that keeps the pawns intact on d5 and e5 is 8 'i!Ye2, but then 8 ...c5 9 d5 lbb6! prepares ...e6 to crack open the e-file vis-a-vis White's queen. so 10 i.e3 i.g4! could follow, with good play for Black) 8 ...c5 9 exd6 exd6 (9 ... cxd4 10 lbxd4 ctJb6 1 1 O-O iixd6 12 i.e3 leaves White's pieces nicely centralized, and 12. .. ctJc5? fails to 13 ctJdb5) and now: al) 10 O-O is reasonable.

Of course ...b5 might well activate White's pieces (imagine a bishop on b2), so that has to be well-timed. It may be that this is simply equal. b) 7 i.e2 is the main alternative (to 7 i.d3), and more frequently played. 7 ...e5 and now play comes down to a struggle over the dark squares: bl) 8 fxe5 dxe5 (D) and now: b 1 1) 9 CLJxe5 c5 ! .

5 ••.O-O 6 .i.e2 White's overwhelming favourite. As always, there are many options; for example, 6 h3 and 6 .i.g5. 6 ... e5 (D) Also almost automatic, although 6 ... tt'lbd7 can safely introduce ...e5, as explained in the 6 ...e5 7 O-O tt'lbd7 line of this chapter. 6 ...c5 is outside the scope of the discussion, sometimes transposing to a Maroczy Bind Sicilian (7 O-O cxd4 8 tt'lxd4) or to some kind of Benoni (7 d5). For a discussion of why exactly Black takes two moves to fianchetto his bishop and then promptly turns it into a bad bishop, see the dis cussion of this very subject in Volume 1 , Chap ter 2. From the position after 6 . .. e5, it's difficult to select some variations to talk about while ig noring others. As always, I shall try to discuss variations that are important for practical play, but even more so ones whose characteristic positions will apply to other variations in the King's Indian and openings in general. The fol lowing section is fitting that regard. Exchange Variation 7 dxe5 dxe5 White exchanges pawns and then queens. He either hopes that his quick development will al low him to get the better game, or that the sim plified position will suit his playing styl e. Some players use the Exchange Variation to obtain a draw, but that is a tricky business, to say the least. I repeatedly point out in this book that queenless middlegames are not end games. That is all the more the case with so many pieces left on the board. 8 'iVxd8 Although 8 O-O is sometimes tried, this ex change is really the point of 7 dxe5. Upon slower moves, Black can develop freely and gain time to cover the d5-square against inva sion. 8 . . • l:txd8 (D) The Exchange Variation may appear rather dull, and even a reason to avoid playing the King's Indian Defence. But the variation em braces positional ideas that are basic to KID play. First of all, you should always keep in mind that in most chess openings, the early exchange of queens will not eliminate winning chances for either side, and in some cases may even in crease them. With that in mind let's try to under stand what's going on in general terms. Initially White counts upon his central space and rela tively fast development (e.g., by .i.g5, tt'ld5 and O-O-O). These represent short-term advantages

206 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

that might be transformed into something more permanent. But White also cedes his opponent a true outpost on d4; a knight occupying that square will generally have great influence, so much so that White will usually not be able to gain concrete advantages by 'working around' it. If Black successfully implements the move ... c6. it leaves White's knights and rooks without the d5 pivot point, whereas the d6 point isn't easily accessible to knight nor to more than tem porary occupation by a rook (Black responds by ... tl:Je8, ... .i.f8, etc.). The situation with respect to each side's bishop is also significant. White's dark-squared and Black's light-squared bishops have excellent scope - they are 'good'. But White has to deal with a very bad bishop on fl (cut off by both the c- and e-pawns), whereas Black has blocked off his own bishop by ...e5. The second situation is not so grave in that Black strengthens his control of d4 thereby, and later the g7-bishop can be activated by a couple of different methods. A typical way to enliven things is ... .i.f8 and ... .i.c5 or ... .i.b4 as appropri- ate. Even ... .i.f6-d8-b6 puts the bishop on an ef- fective diagonal. How these trade-offs play out will determine the course of the game. As indicated, Black will attempt to post a piece on d4. Sometimes the move .. .f5 can be useful but that is generally not played until the pieces are reorganized. The c5-square is also crucial: a knight occupying it hits several im portant points in the enemy position, and the potential for ... tt'le6-d4 can cause White head aches. If Black gets a knight to c5 he will gener ally try to support it by ...a5. Finally, .. J'!e8 < protecting the e-pawn) and ... tt'ld7-f8-e6 may prove feasible. For his part White would love to achieve the moves b4 and c5 (or tt'la4 and c5), opening up the fl -a6 diagonal for the previously passive bishop and clearing c4 for pieces (a knight, for example, might travel to it by tt'ld2-c4). An other set-up is with a3, b4, .i.e3 and tt'ld2-b3. Once Black plays ...c6 and ...a5, his b6-square can be inviting to White's pieces. Finally, as mentioned before, White's lead in development may help him to force changes in the initial pawn-structure which, if it persists, will favour Black in the long run. Let's start out with a game in which White succeeds in achieving his goals. 9 .i.g5 Born - Tonneman corr. 1978 9 tt'ld5 tt'lxd5 10 cxd5 c6 1 1 .i.c4 cxd5 ! ? 12 .i.xd5 tt'ld7 1 3 .i.g5 l:te8 transposes to the next game. 9 ... .l:!.e8 10 O-O-O Again, 10 tt'ld5 tt'lxd5 1 1 cxd5 c6 12 .i.c4 cxd5 can transpose, but 12. ..b5 1 3 .i.b3 c5 !? is also played.

White wants to play f3 to solidify his centre, and by playing tt'lel he avoids ... .i.g4 (when ... .i.xf3 would strengthen Black's control of d4). Most importantly, he wants to bring his knight to the queenside to support expansion on that wing.

6 .i.e2 e5 7 O-O White normally chooses not to enter into the Exchange Variation, which can be understood from the examples in the last section. 7 O-O is the most flexible move, not committing to any central pawn-structure. Strongpoint Variation 7 ••• tt'lbd7 (D) This solid knight development was the pri mary way of playing for several decades after the King's Indian Defence first gained attention in the 1920s. During that time 7 ... tt'lbd7 natu rally generated many new ideas and wonderful games, but now has been overtaken by 7 ... tt'lc6 and 7 ... tt'la6. Nevertheless, specialists still find ways to benefit from it, sometimes moving be yond minor improvements to new methods of play. One appealing feature of 7 ... tt'lbd7 is that it is a central move and thus stays in contact with c5, e5 and f6, all key King's Indian squares. Compare 7 ... tt'la6, which only controls c5; or 7 ... tt'lc6 8 d5 tt'le7, a two-move continuation based largely upon transfer to the kingside. Situ ated on d7, Black's knight can be used to support e5 as a strongpoint, or to play ... ctJe5 or ... tt'lc5 if Black chooses to play ... exd4 at some point. The disadvantages of 7 ... tt'lbd7 relate pri marily to its failure to challenge White's space advantage and the fact that it blocks off Black's bishop on c8. This latter circumstance (which you' 11 note does not apply to 7 ... tt'la6 or 7 ... tt'lc6) means that achieving the move . . .f5 may be problematic, and that White can keep the centre fluid without worrying as much about immedi ate attacks on the kingside. Thus Black is un likely to dominate one side of the board or the other, although he has access to and plays on both wings. Another drawback has to do with a concrete feature of the King's Indian, that c7 is left unprotected, so that Black hasn't as much leeway to move his queen as he does after 7 .. . tt'la6. I haven't mentioned the greatest virtue of 7 .. .tt'lbd7 from our point of view: the play stemming from this move includes a majority of themes and concepts that characterize the entire Classical King's Indian! After 7 ... tt'lbd7 we see properties of the KID that don't appear after 7 ... tt'lc6 8 d5 tt'le7 (the main line of most of this chapter). For example, lines in which Black plays . . . tt'lc5 or . . .exd4, and situations in which White plays dxe5 in a more effective way than in the Exchange Variation.

Krush - Bologan Edmonton 2005 As explained above, this rook move (threat ening ... exd4) has been considered inferior be cause after 9 d5, Black's rook will have to return to f8 to support the thematic . . .f5. But Black is working with other ideas: 9 d5 9 ... exd4 was threatened with an attack on the e4-pawn. Instead, 9 'iVc2 tt'lg4 10 .i.g5 f6 1 1 .i.d2?! exd4 1 2 tt'lxd4 tt'lc5 1 3 h3?! f5 ! (a tacti cal theme to remember) 14 hxg4 .i.xd4 15 gxf5 gxf5 1 6 exf5 'iVh4 is good for Black. 9 ... tt'lh5!? This is a relatively recent idea (at least in its present form). It's worth noting that . . . tt'lh5 is normally an inferior move if White can prevent ...tt'lf4 by the move g3, as he does here:

10 g3 .i.f8! (D)

This is the beginning of Black's reorganiza tion: he directs another piece to prevent White's c5 advance, and he makes room on g7 for a knight. 11 tt'lel tt'lg7 Normally one would not expect to fianchetto a knight, but it supports the attacking move . .. f5 and makes it possible to play . . .h5-h4. Black's pieces are achieving a weird sort of coordina tion! 12 tt'ld3 1 2 b4 is a reasonably good move, although it didn't tum out well in Kutsin-Komliakov, Nikolaev 1995: 12. . . .i.e7 1 3 tt'ld3 f5 14 'iVd2 tt'lf6 1 5 f3 h5 16 l:tac l ?! h4! 17 c5 tt'lgh5 18 'it>g2 l:tf8 1 9 cxd6 cxd6 20 exf5 gxf5 2 1 gxh4 f4 22 .i.gl I:tf7 23 tt'lf2 l:tg7+ 24 'it>h l .i.f8 25 'iVel tt'lg3+ ! with a winning attack. 12 ... f5 13 f3 (D)

whose knight will probably end up on d4 once the bishop on e3 moves. 13 ... aS!? A recent arrangement of pieces, not neces sarily superior to the old one. But it's intrigu ing because it boldly fights for the queenside, where Black is assumed to be inferior. That is in fact a common theme in the modem King's In dian. The old move was 1 3. .. .i.e7, when a won derful example was 14 b4 (14 'iVd2 ctJf6 15 c5 fxe4 16 fxe4 tt'lg4 with equality) 14 .. . l:tf8 15 c5 tt'lf6 (another idea is 15 ... .i.g5 !? 16 .i.f2 h5 17 'iVb3 tt'lf6 18 cxd6 cxd6 with the idea ...h4) 16 I:tc l ! h5 17 tt'lf2 !

White will recover the b-pawn with a powerful queenside attack; he went on to win.

KING 'S /ND/AN DEFENCE 21 7

The knight moves to support a kingside at tack. 8 ... 'bb8 loses too many tempi. This position, introducing what is often called the Mar del Plata Variation, is the most popular one in the King's Indian Defence, and indeed one of the best-known in chess practice. I shall examine this variation in greater depth than it would normally merit because only a close in vestigation can give us an insight into how deli cately balanced the game of chess can be. The persistence of dynamic equality in variations with frenetic activity on both wings borders on the miraculous. Indeed, variations stemming from 8 ... 'be7 have survived more than 50 years of intense scrutiny by the world's strongest professionals (and computers), only to remain mysteriously resistant to solution. Players of all ages are taught this variation because it exem plifies the pawn-chain as well as the flank at tacks that are designed to break it up. From the diagram, the lines that best illus trate the traditional strategies arise from 9 'bel and 9 'bd2. In both cases White is not only initi ating a reorganization of forces but anticipating Black's plan of moving his knight and playing ... f5 in order to claim some territory. By moving his knight from f3, White does two things. First, by unmasking the e2-bishop, he prevents what is in general the most irritating knight move by Black, namely ... 'bh5; once that is played, the knight often goes to f4 and hovers uncomfortably close to White's king. After 9 'bel or 9 'bd2, Black has to shelve ... 'bh5 ideas for the time being. Black will have to be content with the move ... 'bd7 or ... 'be8 if he wishes to make way for .. .f5. Once Black's knight retreats, White is able to meet .. .f5 by bolstering his cen tre with f3, though he often avoids this until ... fxe4 is a real threat. The reason is that f3 can clarify Black' s plans, and encourage . .. f5, ... g4. etc. In a majority of games White will get a pawn to c5. Then he will: a) pile up pressure on the d6-pawn, perhaps by 'bc4, i.a3 and 'bb5; b) infiltrate down the c-file by means of some combination of doubling or tripling on it with his rooks and queen; c) if necessary, advance his a-pawn to fur ther enhance his queenside assault and in par ticular his threat to occupy the a7-square. Black on the other hand will get his pawns to f4 and g4 (sometimes supported by ...h5), in or der to: a) play ...g3 and dare White to find an an swer that avoids his sacrificial onslaught; b) play ... gxf3 and open the g-file for a di rect assault. Notice that in most Mar del Plata games. Black runs right past the base of the pawn-chain with the move ...g3, putting no pressure what soever on it! So much for traditional pawn chain theory, which would suggest ... h4-h3 in stead. It is often said that Black gets the better of this deal because his object of attack is the king. which no one can afford to lose, whereas if White captures a few queenside pawns and queenside squares, that's not immediately fatal. Indeed, Black's attack can succeed precisely because of the extra few tempi that he can use to punish White's king while his queenside and centre are collapsing. But the compensating fac tor for White is that his attack tends to proceed just a bit faster than Black's while his defensive walls are harder to breach. This not-so-delicate balance creates beautiful games on a regular basis. After 8 ... 'be7, White can also forego 9 'be I or 9 'bd2 and permit Black to play ... 'bh5 and ... f5. In those lines White will often end up playing on the queenside and kingside. The most important case of this arises when White plays 9 b4, the so-called 'Bayonet Variation· . It is very popular and also has a massive body of theory related to it. I have given it a brief treat ment at the end of the chapter. The themes

218 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

associated with 9 b4 are so variegated and tempo-dependent that only a thorough exami nation would impart to the reader genuine un derstanding and competence. Therefore I have concentrated upon two systems that feature pawn-chain themes in a wide variety of con texts. Such lengthy pawn-chains don't consis tently appear in most chess openings, and certainly not with such clarity of purpose.

9 Cbel

9 'bel (D) 9 'bel is a multipurpose move that has tradi tionally been White's most popular choice. On a fundamental level, it frees the f-pawn to go to f3 for defence (or to f4, but that move has be come rare). Apart from the functions described above that apply to both 9 'bel and 9 'bd2, the retreat to e l has its own virtues. It keeps a diag onal clear for White's bishop on c l . This turns out to be no small matter, since the move i.e3 is the key to the favourite modern variation that 9 'bel leads into. In addition, after the knight moves to d3 it supports the key pawn-break c5, attacking Black's pawn-chain. A major differ ence between this and 9 'bd2 is that White's knight on d3 can swing back to f2 for defensive purposes, i.e., to discourage Black's advance ...g5-g4. In combination with the move h3 (not always desirable because of the hole left on g3), White could actually have five defenders of g4 (queen, bishop, knight, and two pawns), with the knight being particularly important because capturing and leaving a piece on g4 is normally much better defensively than having to leave a pawn on that square. Finally, the knight will sometimes go to g2, in cases where White tries to stake out territory by g4; that plan is useful to be aware of but is not one that White imple ments much these days. There's always a drawback to any such move, and this time it has to do with the forward reach of White's knight in the two situations. Even if it has successfully supported the c5 pawn ad vance from its post on d3, White's knight is too far away Black's queenside and centre to put pressure on the d6-pawn, much less give weight to a further advance of White's queen side pawns. And of course from f2 it will do nothing in those respects.

9. •. 'bd7

There used to be more discussion about the merits of this retreat. Some books (and conven tional wisdom?) dismiss the alternative 9 .. . 'be8 (D) on the grounds that it does nothing versus White's advance c5; others that by not covering the e5-square it encourages White's f4 ad vance. But in theory there isn't anything wrong with

10 f4 exf4 1 1 i.xf4 h6 ! with ideas of . . .g5. Then

1 2 'bc2 f5 1 3 exf5 g5 followed by . . . 'bxf5 is a standard idea, with approximate equality. Black may want more, of course, but presumably White won't be thrilled with such a result. The similar 1 0 'bd3 f5 1 1 f4 exf4 1 2 i.xf4 ( l 2 'bxf4 c6 ! ?) 1 2. . .fxe4 and . . . 'bf5 is not considered bad for Black either. When assessing 9 ... 'be8, issues connected to White's move c5 are much more interesting. In several other lines of the Mar del Plata we see the knight go from d7 to f6 (to provoke White to

KING 'S INDIAN DEFENCE 219

play f3) and then backwards to e8( !) to defend Black's d6- and c7-squares, the latter being a common intrusion square for a rook, knight or queen. This is particularly the case when Black is defending against the 'bd2-c4 strategy exam ined in the next section, but also at a later stage of the main lines with 'be l . Moreover, while there are some subtleties to consider in this massively complicated situation, it turns out that Black' s defence in the older lines featuring 'bd3 (with c5) and 'bd2 (with c5 and 'bc4) don't suffer with a knight on e8. So what's the point of foregoing the immedi ate 9 ... 'be8 in favour of 9 ... 'bd7? In my opin ion, it's the fact that White's 'newer' strategy with an early a4 and attack on the a-pawn seems to gain in strength, since both the move ... b6 and the c6-square are more important in those lines. You can understand this by examining, for example, 9 ... 'be8 1 0 .i.e3 f5 1 1 f3 f4 1 2 .i.f2 g5 1 3 a4, when 1 3. . .a5 ( 1 3. . .'bg6 14 'bb5)

14 c5 'bg6 1 5 'bb5 would improve for White

upon the main ... 'bd7 lines that follow below. All this may sound picky, but anyone who is go ing to go into these heavily theoretical pawn storm variations should know something about such details. Whether the above is true is an other matter! I'm not sure that the distinction between knight retreats has ever been truly in vestigated in depth, and wouldn't be surprising if 9 ... 'be8 were revived once the details were worked out. At any rate, here's an entertaining game with various pawn-storm themes in which it was effective for a unique reason: Gelfand - Kantsler Israel 200/ 9 'bel 'be8 10 .i.e3 f5 11 f3 f4 12 ilf2 You will also see this .i.e3-f2 manoeuvre in the next section, but with Black's knight on d7 rather than e8.

1 3 a4 ! ? would be the test that corresponds to my speculation above, because Black wouldn't have the handy defensive idea 13 ...a5 14 c5 lbxc5 which is available if the knight is on d7, but illegal here.

But for those of you who are either tired of or fright ened by the theoretical wilderness, 9 a4! ?

The main idea is simply a5, gaining important space and extra control over b6. White's knight or rook may also use the a3-square. There's little the ory attached to this line, but a small selection of games. Here are some ideas: 9 ...a5 (after 9 ...

In two games with this move White stood clearly better.

13 a4 (D)

What is this move all about? With a4 on the board, White can more productively attack the a7-pawn (or square) with his knight on b5 and bishop on f2. This is so because ...b6 is met by a5, whereas if Black plays ... a6, tba7 has the important goal of eliminating Black's bishop on c8. As we have seen, that bishop is almost essential to Black's kingside attack. Barring

KING 'S IND/AN DEFENCE 229

that possibility, White has direct ideas such as a5 and even a6. In other cases a4 allows for a rook to come to a3 both in order to defend the kingside (e.g., Black plays ...g4 and White an swers fxg4, unmasking the rook on a3 horizon tally), and to double or triple major pieces along the c-file. Right now 13 ...a5 seems to be Black's best solution to 13 a4, which is paradoxical because it 'weakens' the queenside with tempo. But it also stops b4, which in tum makes c5 more dif ficult to achieve.

P.H.

230 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

a5 and continue his queenside attack. Then, whether Black captures White's pawn on a5 or not, White will gain targets on the queenside, such as c7, b6 or d6. d) Finally, by capturing on b4 with the bishop, White preserves his knight on d3 to go to f2 and protect against ...g4 in the traditional fashion. Of course there are difficulties with this procedure in terms of time; the whole thing's rather slow. White's bishop has to travel to e3, f2, el and b4, conceivably hurting his kingside defences thereby (for example, there won't be a i.gl defence). White's knight on c3 will have to get out of the way, although l2Jb5 may be a tempo well spent. And the move c5 will still be a long way from realization even after White completes the a5 plan. Nevertheless, Black's knight on d7 will have to move to f6 (or perhaps c5) at some point in order to continue with his kingside attack, at which point White's queen side chances will inevitably improve. For all that, 1 5 b4 immediately makes sense too, mainly because White must play b4 if he is going to open the queenside and he may be able to make use of the knight on b4 by, for example, going to c6 and supporting a5. However, it should be noted that a knight on c6 in the King's Indian will often be stranded there as Black moves to the kingside to pursue his at tack.

'iVe8! 27 h4 gxf3 28 i.xf3 i.g4! 29 i.xg4 tbfxg4 30 i.b6 'iVe7 31 tbxg4?! ll:lxg4 32 i.f2 f3! 33 g3 tbe3! 34 .ltxe3 l!xg3+ 35 'it>f2 l!g2+ 36 'it>xf3 l!xc2 37 l!xc2 'iVxh4 38 .l:!.gl l!xa4 39 tbc3 l!c4 40 'it>e2 i.h6! 41 i.b6 .l:!.xe4+ 0-1 9 lLid2 9 tiJd2 (D) There's a legitimate question whether this move or 9 tbel is better. As mentioned above, once White plays tbd2 it is unlikely that he will return to defend against, say, the standard pawn attack via .. .f5, .. .f4 and ...g5-g4. On the other hand, 9 ll:ld2 supports more aggressive inten tions on the queenside. White's idea is to play c5 (ultimately this is difficult to stop) and then place the knight on c4, which exerts tremen dous pressure on Black's queenside and centre, most obviously on the d6-pawn but also sup porting b5-b6, and infiltrating by tba5-c6 in some lines. All the time, the knight keeps an eye on the e5-pawn, the foundation of Black's position. If Black lets the e-pawn go (say, by ...dxc5, when White also has a bishop on b2), then the collapse of his centre causes an imme diate crisis (essentially, he has to get through to White's king immediately thereafter). A further consideration which affects the entire course of the play is the slow pace at which White is able to mobilize his c l -bishop and a l-rook. This gives Black opportunities to play on the queen side as well. In fact, Black' s play on that wing crops up in almost every major King's Indian system. These ideas are best illustrated by example. We look at 9 ... tbe8 and 9 ...a5. There are of course numerous alternatives, with the most important being 9 ...c5. I'll forego that in favour of giving more detailed coverage of the other two moves. Pawn Race 9 . • .tbe8 (D) After both 9 ll:ld2 and 9 tbel there are dis agreements over whether 9 ... tbe8 or 9 ... ll:ld7 is more accurate. In this position I won't go into that except to say that: a) 9 ... tbd7 protects against c5, with the ca veat that after b4 White might play c5 as a pawn sacrifice; b) 9 ... ll:le8 supports d6 so that a 'traditional " plan with c5, cxd6, tbc4 and tbb5 doesn't threaten the d-pawn or the c7-square. That may be more important. See the more detailed discussion of the same choice after 9 tbel .

So now it's a pawn-race, a la 9 ll:lel ll:ld7 .

Bringing the knight back to f6 negates the difference between 9 ... tbd7 and 9 ... ll:le8.

6 �gS (D) In the Averbakh, White tries to limit Black's options while keeping his own development flexible. I won't go into all the positional trade-offs between 5 tLlf3/6 j_e2 and 5 �e2/6 �g5, but one of White's immediate ideas is to attack Black's king via °i¥d2, j_h6 and h4-h5. For this, the bishop on e2 is useful in that after 6 ...h6 7 j_e3, 7 ... tLlg4 is prevented.

We shall also examine sev eral Samisch Variation games for that purpose.

[diagram]
The Samisch Variation is characterized by White's desire to protect his central squares e4 and d4, the first by a pawn and the second by pieces. This set-up is more difficult to attack by the means that we saw in the Classical Variation. If Black plays ...e5 and White replies d5 (by no means forced; see the first game), his favourite attack by ... f5-f4 and ...g5-g4 will achieve less for two reasons. First, White won't have to go through gyrations like ll'Bf3-el in order to attack on the queenside; that is, the moves f3 and j_e3 come without hindrance. Moreover, White will often castle queenside and sidestep a direct at tack on his king. He can then attack on either or both sides of the board, by means of h4-h5 or b4 and c5. I'll present examples below. Black has many approaches to the Samisch, but in general has benefited from remaining flexible. For some time now, 6 ...c5 has been the main weapon of top players. As in the Aver bakh Variation, we'll see Black trying to pry open the long diagonal. Of course, there is a very wide variety of other strategies that both players can employ after 5 f3.

9 O-O-O (D)

9 ...f4?! This familiar advance is Black's most primi tive approach, imitating the one that he uses against the Classical King's Indian. Perhaps my designation of '?!' is a bit harsh, but ...f4 is gen erally not a good idea for the reasons mentioned above. We shall examine it because the result ing positions illustrate White's core strategy versus ... e5/ ...f5 in clearest form. This situation can also arise in other variations in the Samisch such as 5 f3 O-O 6 .i.e3 lt:Jc6 (with a later ...e5); it is also seen in the King's Indian Attack, and even in the Modem Defence ( l .. .g6). Over the years, Black has had more success with the flexible 9 ... lt:Jd7, preparing ... tt:Jdf6 or ...lt:Jc5. White can react in various ways; a classic and still popular possibility is 10 .i.d3

Now: a) 10. .. tt:Jdf6 1 1 lt:Jge2 introduces another classic line. It affords White multiple choices such as exf5 followed by lt:Jg3, or simply h3, preparing g4.

This variation begins with a pawn sacrifice in order to enhance the power of Black's bishop on g7 and to increase control of the dark squares in general.

8 Grunfeld Defence

1 d4 tL'Bf6 2 c4 g6 3 tbc3 d5 (D)

With 3 ... d5, Black sets White an entirely dif ferent set of problems from those he does with the King's Indian Defence (3 ... .\lg7 followed by ...d6). Black challenges the centre immedi ately, and temporarily prevents White's advance e4. The combination of a dark-square strategy ( ...g6 and ... .llg7) with a light-square one (the move ...d5 will often lead to concentration upon the queenside light squares) is unusual in In dian systems where, at least initially, a particu lar colour complex is the focus of play (light squares in the Nimzo- and Queen's Indian, and dark squares in the King's Indian and Benoni). Similarly, the Queen's Gambit Declined and Slav Defences begin with concentration upon light squares. This attention to both colour complexes lends a particular flavour to the Griinfeld. In the main lines, when White captures on d5 and Black re captures with the knight followed by ... tbxc3, he immediately focuses on the dark squares ( ... .llg7, ... c5, ... tbc6 and ... .llg4), but soon turns his attention to light squares, either for purposes of restraint or occupation ( ...b6, ....llb7, ...e6, .. .f5 and ... tbc6-a5 or ... tL'Bd7-f6/b6). White too has a flexible set of formations that typically en compass both colours in the vicinity of his ex posed centre. The moves c4, tbc3, e4, 'i¥b3 and i.c4 attend to the light squares, whereas tL'Bf3/e2, .lle3 and 'i¥d2 oversee the dark squares. In addi tion, White's central advances are divided be tween e5 and d5. All this makes it difficult for those new to the Griinfeld to get a handle on what they should be doing. As is so often true, the central situation defines the optimal piece placement. If White creates a central majority by cxd5, he will gen erally concentrate upon establishing and then protecting an ideal e4/d4 structure. In a large majority of Griinfeld games by masters, White plays one of two systems that establish such a centre: A: The Exchange Variation: 4 cxd5 tL'Bxd5 5 e4 tbxc3 6 bxc3 (or 4 tL'Bf3 i.g7 5 cxd5 tL'Bxd5 6 e4 tbxc3 7 bxc3); B: The Russian System: 4 tL'Bf3 .llg7 5 'i¥b3 dxc4 6 'i¥xc4 O-O 7 e4. These are the archetypical Griinfeld varia tions, which I shall call 'Main Lines' . Black will try to undermine White's structure, nor mally by pawn attacks early on, but sometimes by piece-play first and pawn moves later (es pecially so in the case of the Russian System). In both instances we have a classic situation where one side captures the centre with support from his pawns, and the other tries to control the centre from the outside of it. I shall concen trate upon precisely that situation. Are there any elements common to all Griin feld systems? Not quite, but in most significant variations, Black plays ...c5 in order to break up White's centre. This applies to most of the main lines above but also to primary alterna tives such as 4 .llf4 .llg7 5 e3 c5 (or 5 ... O-O and 6 ...c5); 4 tL'Bf3 .llg7 5 .llf4 O-O 6 e3 c5; 4 .llg5 tL'Be4 5 .\lf4 tL'Bxc3 6 bxc3 i.g7 7 e3 c5; 4 tL'Bf3 i.g7 5 e3 O-O 6 .lle2 (or 6 .i.d2 or 6 .i.d3) 6 ...c5; 4 tL'Bf3 .llg7 5 i.g5 c5 (5 ... tL'le4 6 i.f4 tbxc3 7 bxc3 c5), etc. In addition, we have 4 f3 c5, 4 h4 c5 and the like. As a practical matter, Black's instinctive reaction to less ambitious White play

GRONFELD DEFENCE 249

should be an early ... c5. Black's two other stan dard methods for resolving central issues are ... dxc4 (as in the Russian System) and ...c6. But ...c6 is infrequently played, and it can easily lead into variations that are properly Slav De fences. For example, l d4 lt:Jf6 2 c4 g6 3 lt:Jc3 d5 4 lt:Jf3 i..g7 5 e3 c6 can come from the Slav move-order 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 lt:Jf3 lt:Jf6 4 e3 g6 5 lt:Jc3 i..g7, etc. The move ...c5 is therefore key to most Griinfeld lines, for reasons that are pretty obvi ous. First, it's easier for Black to attack d4 than e4. Then, you will notice that after the ex change ...cxd4 and cxd4, White's d-pawn is particularly vulnerable to the bishop on g7 and queen on d8, so that White can sometimes be pressured or even compelled to play either d5 or dxc5. The dxc5 option will often win a pawn, but it leaves White's pawn-structure shattered, with his c-pawn(s) exposed along an open c file; we shall see more about this below. The ad vance of White's d-pawn to d5 is critical in a wide variety of middlegame situations, and it will be discussed in context. Queenless middlegames appear more often in the Griinfeld than in other Indian systems. White's central majority may well be pitted against Black's queenside majority. In the Ex change Variation, without the c-pawns, Black is inclined to hold back his 2: 1 majority through out the opening and early middlegame. A fian- chetto by ...b6 is safe, and by comparison with ...a6 and ... b5, it reduces the impact of a4 and protects c5 from occupation by a knight or bishop. The further advance of Black's a- and b-pawns is usually weakening. In the Russian System, White is more likely to play d5 before .. . cxd4 occurs; in those cases, Black tempo rarily retains his 3:2 majority on the queenside, and we sometimes see a general advance by those pawns (for example, in the Hungarian Variation with ...a6 and ...b5 or the Prins Varia- tion with ... lt:Ja6 with ...c5 - see below). The moves ...c6 and ...e6 are often employed to iso late or eliminate White's pawn on d5. With or without the c-pawns, White's d-pawn can also become a passed pawn, and indeed in the queenless middlegames or endgames aris ing from our main lines it is very often the cen tre of attention. In more cases than not, the d-pawn is a strength with which Black must contend; even in the optimal cases in which he succeeds in securely blockading it, there may result only a stand-off, and White' s space ad vantage can still be a factor. Frequently, both White' s d- and e-pawns will survive long enough to be used to assist in space-gaining and attacking opportunities. We'll look at these and more specific issues as we move to the main variations. Exchange Variation The most popular variation of the Griinfeld has always been the Exchange Variation:

O-O

Over the next few moves there are many combinations of ...b6 and/or ... lZ'Bc6. We shall take time off for a couple of these because they show strategies unique to the Griinfeld which also contain themes and manoeuvres common to other chess openings. Theory from several sources approves of some of these lines to the extent that may worry players of 7 .i.c4. But Black must be careful; for example, 7 ...b6?! 8 'ii f3 (8 lZ'Be2 i..b7) 8 ...O-O 9 e5 i..a6! ? 10 .i.d5 ( 10 'ii xa8? .i.xc4 with terrific compensation: the bishop-pair, light-square domination, etc.; White is undeveloped, and passive rooks in the middlegame are often worse than bishops) 10 ...c6 l l i..b3 'ii d7 (D) ( l l . ..'ii c7 led to a se vere disadvantage after 12 h4! ? c5 1 3 h5 cxd4 14 cxd4, with an ideal attack, in Yusupov-Tim man, Tilburg Ct (7) 1986; the general rule is that h4-h5 can work if Black has made no prog ress against the centre). 12 e6!

It rep resents a kind of classical logic: develop the bishop actively to c4 (as opposed to e2), and put the knight on e2, a square from which it sup ports the centre but cannot be pinned (as op posed to lZ'Bf3). White also castles as quickly as possible, something that is usually delayed in the variations with 7 lZ'Bf3. Now we briefly examine a variation without ...c5 (8 ... ll:Bc6), and then tum to the main move 8 ...c5. Playing without . . . cs Razuvaev - Stohl Burgas 1992 8 ... ll:Bc6 (

Another option is 8 ... b6. Although we won't look at it here, theory's overall verdict seems to be that the move is playable with precise de fence. The attacking move 9 h4 is particularly dangerous and needs to be part of any prepara tion that one might make as Black. The text-move blocks the c-pawn, but con tains two other ideas to disturb White's game:

254 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

a) ... llla5, driving away White's aggres sively-placed bishop, often with ...c5 to follow; b) the central advance ...e5, to block the po sition.

9 O-O (D)

Natural. White has tried all kinds of things against 8 ... '2lc6 without achieving a great deal. The advance h4 is sometimes White's reaction in the Griinfeld if Black hasn't challenged d4 with a pawn; but here it looks as though 9 h4 llla5 10 .i.b3 ( 10 .i.d3 ! ?) 10. ..c5 1 1 h5 ctJxb3 12 axb3 cxd4 13 cxd4 isn't much of a problem; e.g., 13 ... .i.d7 !? (not the only move) 14 hxg6 hxg6 15 'ii d3 'iib6, Spassky-Stein, USSR Ch playoff (1) 1964. 9 . . .e5!? An entirely different structure from in the main lines. Black's move restricts the scope of his g7-bishop but changes the pawn-structure so that a plan like . . . b6, ... llla5, and either ... '2lb7-d6 or a well-timed ...c5 becomes possi- ble. 9 ... '2la5 10 .i.d3 .i.e6 is also played, when 1 1 .i.g5 followed by f4 has caused Black prob lems. This sort of aggressive expansion by White becomes possible when his centre pawns aren't attacked by ...c5. 9 ... b6 (D) is another popular move-order now that h4-h5 doesn't activate White's rook. The ideas are simple: ... .i.b7 and ...e5 or ... llla5 with ...c5. Quick development by White can be dangerous, although with accurate play Black should be OK: 10 .i.g5 .i.b7 (10. .. llla5 1 1 .i.d3 c5 is about equal; Black meets d5 with ...

256 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

The diagram position is a demonstration of the power of White's central pawns. Although White is a full exchange down, all of his pieces are centralized and he has available an assort ment of possible moves such as ll:Be4, Re4, d6 and lZ'Bd5, with Black's f7-pawn being particu larly vulnerable and his bishop on g7 shut out. Most importantly of all, the opposite-coloured bishops ensure that White's bishop on b3 can't be exchanged off. b) The game continued 2 l ...i..xg4 22 e5 ! i..xe2 23 Rxe2. Again, White has the big cen tre. and the opposite-coloured bishops contrib ute to the winning scenario. As so often in the Griinfeld, we get a d-pawn marching down to deliver the final blow: 23 ..

9 O-O ll:Bc6 10 i..e3 (D)

Just in time. Now White has defended the d4-pawn. What are the characteristics of this main-line position? Both kings are safe, so it comes down to several factors. First of all, there's White's central majority, with pawns ideally placed on e4 and d4. That by itself isn't necessarily bad for Black, who may be able to restrain and then attack them. The question is whether the pawns can advance or cause other damage. With that in mind, let's consider what White would do if you gave him a move. The expansion via 1 1 f4 allows 1 1 ...i..g4. Playing h3 as a preparatory move can be considered, but at this point it looks slow. The advance 1 1 e5 is plausible, but creates central light-square weaknesses that Black is likely to be able to occupy. The move 1 1 d5 can be answered by l l .. .lZ'Be5 12 i..b3 b6 and ... i..a6 (or even 1 1 ...lZ'Ba5 12 i..d3 e6); in both cases White has difficulty in playing c4 to protect the centre. That suggests some ideas: l:tc 1, allowing d5 in many variations without the rook hanging, and/or a combination of 'ii d2 and i..h6. Some attack by f4 may follow later, all the more so if White can eliminate the pow erful g7-bishop by means of i..h6. If White achieves these things, his centre pawns and piece-play will control the board. What advantages does Black have? First, as usual, the c4-square is loose and a potential out post for a knight or bishop. The fact that ... lZ'Ba5 can be played with tempo is especially encour aging in that regard. Black also controls the open d-file and can play ... cxd4 to put pressure on the d-pawn and open his c-file. Since White is on the verge of consolidating as described above, that leads one towards two fundamental strategies. Black can get a rook to d8 and as sault White's centre straight on. That is the classical approach, which often begins with ... 'ii c7, giving Black the subsequent choice of ...e5 to challenge d4, or ...e6 and ...b6 to restrain White's pawns. No immediate action is taken to attack White's side of the board. Alternatively, Black can try to exploit the enemy queenside light squares as quickly as possible, ideally by moves such as ... ll:Ba5-c4 supported by the light-squared bishop, a rook on c8, pawn on b5, and so forth. One problem with this second plan

GRUNFELD DEFENCE 257

is finding a good square for the bishop on c8. Thus if Black wants to follow the light-squares strategy, he will probably require an early se ries of forcing moves to carry it out. Let' s look at both plans. Classical System 10• . . 'ii c7 (D) This is sometimes called the Smyslov Varia tion, and elsewhere the Shamkovich Variation. The traditional reason for this move is to follow up by .. J::t d8. A disadvantage to that policy is that it weakens f7, not only directly but in the long term if White plays for f4-f5. 11 l::t cl White is responding to an indirect threat of ... cxd4, although at the moment (were it Black's turn to move) 1 1 ...cxd4 12 cxd4 lZ'Bxd4 13 i..xf7+ and lZ'Bxd4 would favour White. Never theless, l::t c 1 gets off the long diagonal, protects c3, and most importantly serves as a strong dis incentive for ... cxd4. The immediate 1 1 i..f4 is also critical: l 1 .. .e5 12 i..g3 (compare 1 1 l::t c l J:i.d8 1 2 i..f4 e5 13 i..g5 !, hitting the rook) 1 2. .. lZ'Ba5 !? (12. .. 'ii e7 13 d5 lZ'Ba5 14 i..d3 f5 is equal) 13 i..d5 i.. e6! (grabbing light squares even if it means crippling one's pawns !) 14 i..xe6 fxe6 15 l::t bl a6, intending ... ll:Bc4, is equal. l l. .. l::t d8 (D) This position is strategically very rich and after many years no clear verdict has been reached. I'll give two classic but genuinely il lustrative game excerpts to demonstrate the main themes. Gligoric - Smyslov Yugoslavia-USSR 1959 This is one of the original, archetypal games that showed the latent strength of Black's posi tion. 12 h3 White wants to play f4 without facing ... .li.g4 with the idea of ... i..xe2. Since 12 h3 uses time. however, the immediate 12 f4 was nevertheless a main line for some years, with the idea 12 ... i..g4

13 f5 !? gxf5 (or 13. ..

lZ'Ba5) 14 h3 i..xe2 15 'ii xe2. This attack eventually seemed to peter out after, for example, 15. ..cxd4 16 cxd4 'ir'd6 (or 16 ... 'ii g3 17 l::t f3 'ii g6! 18 exf5 'ii f6, block ing the attack and targeting the centre, with equality) 17 exf5 ( 17 l::t xf5 lZ'Bxd4 18 i..xf7 + Rh8) 17 ... ll:Ba5 18 'ii g4 ll:Bxc4 19 l::t xc4 Rh8 with equality. Generally the disappearance of White's powerful light-squared bishop means an end to Black's problems. A logical alternative is 12 'ii d2, when Black can play the solid 1 2. .. 'ii a5 intending ... cxd4, or go for more with 1 2. ..a6!? 13 f4!? (White can also play 13 i..h6 b5 14 i..d3 'ii d7 15 i..xg7 Rxg7 16 d5; e.g., 16 ... lZ'Be5 17 c4 or 16 ...c4 17 .i.c2 e6 18 lZ'Bf4 ! ?) 13. ..b5 14 i..d3 f5 !

This is a superb dem onstration of determined pursuit of the light squares by Black. Nevertheless, White could have played better and the whole line is unclear. 12 ... b6 13 f4 e6 First, Smyslov restrains the centre.

(D) This is the key to Black's game. Without the move f5 at White's disposal, his bad bishop on e3 is reduced to defence and Black has greater pressure along the a8-hl diagonal. 17 e5 A real concession, because White no longer has an effective pawn-break. However, he main tains a space advantage. What's more, the alter native 17 exf5 exf5 would leave d4 vulnerable to the bishop on g7.

i..g4 This sortie has always been important, but has taken over modem theory for the last few decades. First let's mention the alternative 10 ... ll:Ba5 1 1 i..d3 cxd4 12 cxd4 at this point: a) It's interesting that 12 ... i..e6 looks very much like the main line 10 ... i..g4 1 1 f3 ctJa5 12 i..d3 cxd4 13 cxd4 i.. e6 below, except that White hasn't strengthened his centre by f3 (you may want to consider this again after you read the chapter). So how can it be that Black almost never plays this way? It turns out that by in serting 10. .. i..g4 1 1 f3, Black gains several ad vantages that arise in specific lines. The main difference is that he has the options of ... 'tWb6+, ... 'tWxd4+ and ... i..xd4+ (or ... i..xe3+) in some situations. Furthermore, the bishop on e3 can be attacked by moves such as ... 'tWa3 or in a few cases even ... i..h6. b) Black's attempt to force a draw by means of 12 ... ll:Bc6 (i.e. 13 i..c4 ll:Ba5, etc.) fails to do so after 13 i..b5 (13 i..c2 b6 14 i..a4 and l:tc l is also advantageous) 13. .. i..g4 (13. .. i..d7 14 l:!bl e6 1 5 'tWd2) 14 f3 .i.d7 15 l:tbl e6 16 'tWd2 with an edge. c) The most positionally interesting of devi ations with this order is 1 2. ..b6!?, with the in tention of ...e6 and ... l:te8. White has generally

GRUNFELD DEFENCE 261

gained a small advantage here by normal means ('tWd2, l:tadl and i..h6, for example), but it's not much. The game Gligoric-Tukmakov, Odessa 1975 illustrates another plan in the Griinfeld that we haven't seen. It comes up when ...e6 has been played: 13 l:!c l e6 14 e5 !? i..b7 15 lZ'Bf4 'tWe7 !? 16 'tWg4 ctJc6 17 h4! lZ'Bb4 18 .i.c4 b5 19 i..b3 (D).

White has a k:ingside bind and the better prospects. The question is one of timing: if Black can plant and keep a piece on d5 right away, he should be OK. The problem is that White not only threatens to attack on the king side but has the c5 outpost ( lZ'Bd3-c5), which en sures his superiority.

11 f3 lZ'Ba5

Issues of move-order are confusing here, but if you want to understand the position they are important. If Black now plays l 1 . ..cxd4 12 cxd4 ll:Ba5 (D) (this can also be arrived at by 10 ... cxd4 1 1 cxd4 i..g4 12 f3 lll a5), we reach this position: Then 13 i..d3 i..e6 will transpose to the main line in games below. There are, however. two differences. First, by capturing on d4, Black is allowing White the option of 13 i..d5 (D ), which is theoretically equal but can be annoying in practice.

Theory calls this equal. although Black still has to play accurately. Then there's 13 l:tc l ll:Bxc4 14 .:.Xc4. to which a lot of theory is also attached. Again Black needs to be a little careful even if winning the bishop-pair can't be objectively worse for him. Neither of these options is a problem if the pawns on c5 and c3 are retained (seebelow ). A further significant difference between l 1 . . .'2la5 and l 1...cxd4 1 2 cxd4 ll:Ba5 is that in the 'Seville Variation' below with 1 2 i.xf7+. the pawns are still on c3 and c5. whereas with the l 1 . ..cxd4 order we have 1 3 i..xf7+ :xn 14 fxg4 and those pawns are traded. (You· n have to jump ahead to make sense of this de scription.) At this point the question becomes whether Black prefers the i..xf7 + lines with the pawns still on the board. Unfortunately. one needs loads of specific study to answer that. But there's a possible saving grace. If Black believes that the best defence to the Seville ( or a good one) is to play ...cxd4 and ...e5 later (see below), then you will see that the move order is unimportant and that you don't need to

262 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

exchange now, thus avoiding 13 i..d5 and 13 l:tc l . Hopefully some or all these nuances will become clearer as you go through the following material. We now return to l 1 ...ll:Ba5 (D): This is the main-line position of the .i.c4 Ex change Variation. We now have two basic vari ations that have thus far been taken seriously. Seville Variation 12 i..xf7+!? It's pretty easy to see that 12 fxg4? l2Jxc4 (with tempo!) is positionally bad. We look at 12 i..d3 cxd4 13 cxd4 .i.e6 below.

l:txf7 13 fxg4 The 'Seville Variation' was so named be cause of several games that Karpov played with it against Kasparov in their 1987 match in Se ville. The ideas behind it are intriguing, in part because they are superficially unprincipled. 13 ...l:txfl+ 14 Wxfl (D)

White has won a pawn, which is of some value even though it consists of a doubled g pawn. His centre is superior to Black's and, given time, potentially mobile. Black has his own advantages; for example, a wonderful out post on c4 for his knight and some play against White's rather draughty kingside. In spite of a large body of theory and experi ence with 1 2 .i.xf7+, the ensuing play is not of such a critical nature that one needs to commit much to memory. I'll look at two games that should cover the main ideas and strategies. Karpov - Kasparov Belfort 1988 This game has been used in many books, de servedly so. It is representative of White's ideas and beautifully played. To get a more balanced view of the opening, see the game excerpts within the notes. ..• 'ii d6 14 ...

(D). We'll see this more than once: the problems that Black has when he sets up this blockade with ...e5, ...c5, ...b6 and ... lZ'Bd6 tend to come from a4-a5. That can be surprisingly difficult to meet, as here: 20 ...c4 (else White plays c4 and a5) 2 1 'ii c2 i..f8 22 Whl lZ'Bb7 23 lZ'igl i..c5 24 'ii e2 i..xe3 25 'ii xe3 'ii f7 26 ll:Bf3 with much the better game for White, Sakaev-Van Wely, Internet blitz 2004.

15 e5! 1Wd5 ( D) What's this? With 15 e5, White just ceded all those light squares Black loves so much! In addi tion, for a mere extra doubled pawn, White has exposed his king, given himself a bad bishop, and hardly attended to his development! For all that, there are some real dangers for Black. If, for example, White plays g5, his bishop's prob lem will be less important than that of Black's ' good' one, which is imprisoned indefinitely. Also, White has the easy-to-underestimate ad vantages of space and a central majority. Notice that if he gets moves like @gl and tl:Bf4 in, Black will have serious weaknesses to cover. For his part, Black's advantages are fairly obvious: a beautifully centralized queen on d5, an outpost for the knight on c4, and numerous possible open files for his rooks. One difficulty, however, is that he has to achieve any progress by use of his pieces alone, since he has no pawn-breaks. 16 .tf2!

The Gambit Lines 12 .td3 cxd4 13 cxd4 .te6 (D) w Now White really needs to do something about incursions on c4, because ... .tc4 threat- ens to win the light squares and ... tl:Bc4 would create immediate tactical problems. Since 14 'iVa4 a6! threatens ...b5, White has only two se rious moves that protect c4, both requiring ma terial sacrifice. The first is the gambit 14 l:i.c l .txa2 15 'iVa4. White also has the exchange sacrifice 14 d5 ! ? .txal 15 'iVxal , whose assess ment at the moment is not fully resolved. In spite of over 45 years of investigation into 14 d5 by hundreds of grandmasters, a few new ideas are still being found at the top levels. Neverthe less, the play is dependent upon countless tac tics which don't lend themselves to general understanding, so in this case there is only a limited amount to be gained through broad dis cussion of the opening as such. In fact, the spe cifics of the attack are really in the realm of the middlegame proper. Thus I shall limit my dis cussions of both 14 l:tc l and 14 d5, providing some general contours of the play. Geller's 14 :tel 14 l:tcl With this move White covers c4 and offers a pawn. Black must accept or be driven back by the move 15 d5. 14• •. .txa2 (D) This position has fascinated players and theoreticians for many decades. After many years of intense scrutiny, Black seems to have solved his problems in the very main lines with the move 1 5. .. .tb3. Whether that will re main true is still an open question, and both sides can still experiment with little-played moves. I'm only going to show one game, because White hasn't made much progress in the last few years. H illarp Persson - Rowson Torshavn 2000 15 'iVa4 (D) This is the most popular move by a huge margin: White forces Black's bishop to move and gets his pieces out as quickly as possible. Black's light-square strategy, with which we are so familiar, should work well after the straightforward attack 15 f4 a6! 16 f5 b5 17 e5.

that White's queen's bishop tends to go to e3, but sometimes to g5 or b4 to harass Black' s e pawn. The other bishop is an opportunist, head ing to c4 if possible, but being quite content on the long diagonal if there is an exchange of Black's bishop on g4 for a knight on f3. White's rook on bl likes to swim around on the fourth rank via b4, and his other rook on fl will often go modestly to e l to protect the e4-pawn, or to d l to help advance the d-pawn. For his part, Black simply needs to develop his pieces safely. His bishop on g7 is ideally placed, and his knight would usually like to at tack White's centre from c6, although ... lLid7- b6 is also played. Obviously, Black's rooks be long on open files, but the one on a8 may stay there in order to support and advance the a pawn. Finally, we have Black's light-squared bishop, which can go to d7 or b7, but in view of White's attack will usually go to g4 in order to exchange off a white piece. The ideas above are only starting points, and you'll need to look at a lot of games in various books to get a deep understanding for how to play these lines.

Black's plan is as yet undefined but can consist of a combination of ... lll fd7-b6 and ... lllc6. He has the flexibility of a change of plans if necessary, by, for example, ... lt:lbd7, ...c5 or ...e5. The logic is essentially that the bishop on g4 (usually exchanged on f3) and the knight on c6 combine to put pressure on d4, pressure which is increased when ... lll fd7- b6 unmasks the g7-bishop. Black will some times choose to restrain White's centre by ... e6. Against all this White will normally play d5 at some point. But then we have the ideal under mining situation for Black: as opposed to many other variations in which Black plays ...c5 and White plays d5, here Black has both the c7- and e7-pawns in reserve to challenge the pawn on d5 or at least prevent it from becoming a passed pawn. That's not a bad collection of virtues. What does White have in return? Of course, the cen tre. In this case it's a centre that is reasonably easy to support with pieces and for the mo ment not attacked by any pawns. Furthermore, Black's ... lll fd7-b6 is slow, so White has the luxury of castling queenside or playing l:!.dl , and/or 'wasting' a tempo on h3 in order to fol low up ... ilxf3 with attack on the king side along the open file. Some specifics are also of interest: when Black plays ... lllc6 and ... lll b6, White doesn't always have to retreat but can make the more aggressive move �c5 . All this makes for intriguing play. Now let's explore these ideas by exemplary games:

may be less productive to challenge White' s centre later b y means of . . .e6 for a few reasons, among them the fact that after an eventual ...exd5 White has the additional option exd5. There may also be times at which White's dxe6 is a good move. 4 lllc3 4 lll f3 is an important continuation, although it will usually arrive from the popular move order 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 e6 3 lllf3 (to avoid the Nimzo-Indian Defence 3 lll c3 ilb4) 3 ...c5 4 d5. That move-order is particularly significant be cause White's choices are limited by the knight on f3, i.e., he can't play popular variations with the moves f4 and f3. See also the discussion of

Wie5) 8 ... O-O 9 e3 .Md8 !?, intending ...d5. The normal and reliable line is 5 ... lllxd5. Then Black equalizes after 6 Wixd5 d6 (or 6 ... lll c6; also, 6 ... i.e7, to meet 7 b3 with 7 ... ilf6, is considered fine for Black) 7 lll f3 lll c6 8 e4 ile6 9 Widl ile7 with equality. White has created the d5 outpost but a piece is a long way from occupying it (llld2-fl -e3-d5) and a piece on d5 might be exchanged anyway. White's rarely-chosen option 5 lllxd5 lllxd5 6 cxd5 (D) is rather instructive: It turns out this particular simplification fa vours Black. White's knight is one of his best

pieces and after Black plays ...g6 and ... i.g7 (or ... ile7-f6), the exchange of the f6-knight will give Black' s bishop an open view along the a l-h8 diagonal. Indeed, in the main lines with 5 cxd5 d6 (i.e., without 5 lllxd5 lt:lxd5) Black of ten has to move the knight from f6 to a medio cre square, precisely to increase the bishop's range and in order to hold up e4-e5. 5 ...d6 (D) Black intends to play ...g6 and ... ilg7, but first he stops White's advance d6, and he also opens a diagonal for the c8-bishop. At this junc ture, we'll look at the main moves, 6 e4 and 6 lllf3 (with g3). It's also worthwhile to consider some of the lines involving the move ilf4 as we go along. At this point 6 ilf4 develops quickly and targets Black's weakest pawn on d6. A third-rank pawn that isn't on an open file is nor mally pretty easy to defend, but in the Benoni, Black's can be vulnerable, at least enough to disturb his development. A case in point is 6 ...g6 7 Wia4+!? (the most forcing continuation,

g6 Black prepares ... ilg7. At this point we again come to a major fork in the road. We shall look at 7 tt:Jf3, the Classical main line in which White develops normally and without delay; this generally leads to relatively quiet posi tional play. The resulting positions have been debated in more detail than any others in the Modem Benoni. Then we look at the pawn storm systems that follow from the aggressive 7 f4, which itself leads to several distinct attack ing formations. These lines will get their own relatively de tailed sections. I have made that decision based upon the desire to address the most fundamen tal issues inherent in the Benoni without clut tering the presentation. Keep in mind that the Modem Benoni is considerably less popular than the other 1 d4 openings that we deal with in this volume. Nevertheless, there are several other consequential variations that need to be addressed, if only in a selective manner:

Nevertheless, his kingside pieces are undeveloped, and 13 ... 'iVd6 14 lZ'Bc6 @f8 ! blockades the d-pawn. This re sults in a surprisingly good position because that pawn can be weak and Black has an effec tive queenside majority. Naturally White has a lot of options (the move 9 .td3 above is promis ing), although Black has done well in this varia tion as a whole. Although I won't be examining the 'Modem Main Line' with .lld3 and h3, I'd like to take a quick look at it in terms of pawn-chains. There are numerous orders to get to the basic position; for example, 1 d4 lZ'Bf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 lZ'Bc3 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 e4 g6 7 lZ'Bf3 .llg7 8 h3 O-O 9 .lld3 (D). White has the mini-chain e4/d5, and Black has d6/c5. Let's talk about attacking these chains. White would like to get e5 in, attacking the base of the chain. Moves that might assist that are l:tel and .llf4. The alternative f4 is weakening and hard to implement, but not out of the question in the long run. On the queen side, White has the option of b4 to attack the front of the chain, a favourite positional device, most appropriate after Black plays ...b5. For his part, Black can't legally make pawn contact with the front of White's e4/d5 chain, and .. .f5 in such a position tends to be risky (the more so in this particular variation) because of the giant hole created on e6.

c) on b7, the bishop will run into White's well-guarded d5-pawn; d) even on d7, it can obstruct Black's devel opmental scheme, in which ... lZ'ibd7 is very of ten involved, and sometimes ... lZ'ifd7 will be desirable to prevent White's e5 advance. The good news for Black is that in any given opening situation, one of those squares tends to be both available and useful. For example, ... .tg4 is played in several main lines in order to release the pressure on e5. After an ex change on f3, it turns out that a combination of knights of d7 and f6 with a rook on e8 and bishop on g7 produces a harmonious set-up in which the knight-pair is often as good as the bishop-pair, and even better in terms of sup porting Black's goals in the centre and on the queenside. And a bishop on d7 can be surpris ingly useful in supporting ...b5 after Black's knight makes a typical journey from a6 to c7. Here's a common picture: Black has been trying to enforce ...b5 and White to prevent it. Now that this advance is imminent, White will often play a5, after which Black can play ... lZ'Bb5 (supported by the bishop on d7), a good move that eyes d4 and even the exchange on c3. Alternatively, after a5, ... .tb5 is sometimes played to contest the c4-square. 8 .te2 O-O 9 O-O (D) We've made a couple more moves. There arises a crucial issue: will Black be able to mo bilize his queenside majority? The move ... b5 is his most likely pawn-break, mainly to prepare ...c4 and/or ... b4, but also giving his pieces some space to work with. The less frequent move ...c4 (by itself, that is, without ...b5) can sometimes provide enough piece-play to compensate for the loss of the important d4-square. Then ... lZ'Bc5 attacks the e-pawn and puts pressure on the in terior weaknesses on d3 and b3 (assuming that White has played a4). Barring either ...b5 or ...c4, Black will suf fer a cramped position on the queenside. Thus White will concentrate his efforts in this area and of course look to e5, with the emphasis de pending upon the specifics of the position. White normally plays a4, which in conjunc tion with his light-squared bishop and knight on c3 is meant to hold down ...b5, at least until White implements his own goals. If White can suppress Black's principal freeing moves, he will have time to organize an attack of his own. Assuming that White has control of the sit uation just described, then Black will have to look to the kingside. Remember that waiting around is usually bad for him since White has the best long-term weapon, the central major ity. The other break against White's pawn chain is . . .f5, difficult to organize because it weakens the interior square e6 so badly. Nev ertheless, Black does succeed in breaking up the centre with ...f5 in a minority of positions, mainly because White's move exf5 will acti vate Black's bishop to f5, from where it can create threats. Finally, Black can try to launch some kind of effective kingside attack by, for example, ...g5-g4 or by some combination of ... lZ'Bh5, ... tt:Je5, . . . .te5, ... tt:Jg4 and/or ... 'iVh4. The latter attack arises surprisingly often be cause White is so concerned with the queen side and moves his pieces in that direction . Thus in the Modem Benoni we are faced with a situation that arises in many d-pawn

296 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

openings: Black' s flank threats pitted against White's long-term advantages of space and cen tral pawn-structure. From the position after 9 O-O, we'll look at a few games that involve ... lZ'Ba6. In this situation play tends to be entirely on the queenside. Kelecevic - Burgermeister Lenk 2000 9 ... tt:Ja6 This may not be the most accurate move, be cause White can play 10 .tf4 and the knight is perhaps not best-placed on a6. Nevertheless, numerous masters have played 9 ... lZ'Ba6, and this game introduces and illustrates the key ideas of the ... lZ'Ba6 strategy in general. 10 lZ'Bd2 tt:Jc7 11 a4 l:tb8 To begin with, Black aims for ... b5 and White tries to prevent it. 12 f3 White feels that he can prevent ...a6 and ...b5 with a timely lZ'Bc4 and .tf4, sometimes in con junction with a5. Black will have a hard time defending d6 and getting anything at all started on the queenside. 12 ...b6! (D) In response, Black introduces an alternate strategy. His c8-bishop can't find a good square in this position, so he simply trades it off and then expands on the queenside. 13 tt:Jc4 Why does White assent to Black's plan? For one thing, it may be that he will retain the ad vantage by doing so. Furthermore, a slow move like 1 3 @h 1 might encourage Black to return to the standard plan by 13. ..a6 14 lZ'Bc4 b5 15 lZ'Ba5 .td7 with quite an interesting position in which White needs to find a way to proceed. 13 ••• .ta6 White's knight is awfully strong on c4, so it's worth giving up the bishop-pair to get rid of it. 14 .tgS h6?! This has been played in many games, but will lose a critical tempo. See the next game for a similar position in which Black plays ... 'iVd7, a move which should probably be considered at this point. 15 .te3 'iVd7 16 'iVd2! Even in a slow-looking positional line, every tempo counts. White attacks h6 and develops.

.txc4 17 .txc4 @h7 Now how will White stop Black from ex panding by ...a6 and ...b5, which is his main goal in most Benonis? 18 l:tabl! (D) He won't, but he'll stop the black pawns cold by playing b4. The combination of l:tbl and b4 is another manoeuvre that is characteristic of Benoni positions. Note that this attacks the front of the pawn-chain, a mode of play quite as common as attacking the base. In the mean time, White's queen protects the knight on c3, so all his pieces are safe and Black has no funny tactics along the al -h8 diagonal. 18 ... a6 19 b4! bS 20 axbS axbS 21 .td3 c4 White was threatening the c-pawn. 22 .tc2 (D) Let's take a tally of the opening and early middlegame: White has a space advantage and can use the d4-square for his pieces. He can also operate with the idea of e5. In return, Black

This is a stable variation, marked by ma noeuvring rather than tactics. As in the last game, Black is aiming for ...b5 via the moves ... lZ'Bc7, ... l:tb8 and ...a6 in some order. If White plays a4-a5, the knight on c7 may move to b5, exerting influence over d4 and c3. By playing

298 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

.tf4, and perhaps e5. He has an advantage in space and freer pieces, so he hopes that the re sulting positions will force Black on the defen sive. Neither side is consumed by the kind of tactics that characterize many main-line Benoni variations, so the underlying clash of ideas will be apparent throughout the opening stage.

11 f3 t:Dc7 12 a4 b6

Again, this is the distinguishing move. Pre paring ...b5 by ...a6 would allow t:Dc4 and .tf4, attacking d6, and let White invade on b6 (per haps with a5 first). To preface this with ... l:tb8 and ... b6 is slow and invites the move .tf4 fol lowed by e5, when the bishop on f4 strikes at the core of Black's position, through to c7 and b8. Therefore, as above, Black switches to the idea of a quick ... .ta6, both to get rid of the bishop that he can't use and to eliminate White's powerful knight. Of course this costs time and the bishop-pair, so a kind of positional balance results. We follow two games: Beliavsky - Portisch Szirak IZ 1987 13 t:Dc4 .ta6 14 .tgS Wfd7! (D) Black avoids ...h6, which only gives White a target. 15 l:tbl .txc4 16 .txc4 a6 17 b4 This is White's standard idea that we ex plained above; its purpose is to immobilize Black's pawns.

17. ..bS 18 .td3

18 axb5 axb5 would open the a-file for Black, who could fight for the initiative by ... l:ta3. Then the unprotected state of the knight on c3 makes it impossible to contest the a-file by l:tal , so Black could double or triple pieces on it.

18. .. c4 19 .tc2

Here White has achieved his goal of limiting Black's pawn advance. As in the last game, his bishop on c2 is as bad as Black's knight on c7. The difference is that the latter piece isn't stuck where it is, and White's knight on c3 is unpro tected. 19 ... bxa4! (D) This is a common theme: if Black can't win the a-file (in the case where White plays axb5), then he can often play ...bxa4 himself and win the b5-square for his knight on c7. 20 .txa4 Instead, 20 t:Dxa4 ! ? l:tab8 covers b6. There might follow 2 1 t:Dc3 t:Db5 22 t:Dxb5 axb5 23 .te3 l:ta8 24 .td4 W/c7 (24 ... t:Dh5 25 .txg7 @xg7 26 Wf d4+ f6 and ... l:ta2 is also good) 25 l:tal lDd7, when Black's knight is better than White's light-squared bishop; for example, 26

This kind of pawn-structure will often fa vour White if Black still has his light-squared bishop (on d7, for example). But here Black has no such bad pieces and he does have key advan tages: he controls the a-file, has great pressure down the long diagonal, and his c-pawn has the potential to be mobile if White needs to rear range his pieces in defence. 23 ii.e3 Black's g7-bishop finally shows its stuff af ter 23 'iVd2 l:ta3 24 i.e3 l:txc3 ! 2S 'iVxc3 lZ'Bxe4 26 'iVa3 4'1c3 27 l:tbel lZ'ixdS with two passed pawns for the exchange.

(D) The difference between this and Beliavsky Portisch is clear: with the queenside closed, White can play in the two areas where he has superiority, the centre and the kingside. At this point the respective opening strategies have been played out, and White's has been the successful one.

7 f4 (D)

This move defines the basic starting posi tion for pawn-storm variations. Like other In dian systems that permit White to construct a large centre, a fundamental test of the Benoni is whether White's centre pawns can be used sim ply to roll over Black's position or at least cramp him beyond acceptable bounds. For ex ample, the King's Indian Defence essentially passes this test when confronted with the Four Pawns Attack. The Griinfeld Defence holds up well if, having established a d4/e4 centre, White plunges ahead with f4. In the Samisch Nimzo Indian, and in the 4 'iVc2 O-O 5 e4 variation, Black can defend against the blind advance of White's centre (with great care, to be sure). For all of these defences we find that White's ultra ambitious play can produce no more than dy namic equality. But interestingly, the Modem

310 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

We haven't examined many fianchetto lines versus Indian systems in this book. With this variation we have a solid approach that de fends d5, and to all appearances doesn't do much else. Of course that's not so. In the initial stages of the game, White proceeds along the principle of prophylaxis to counter Black's normal plans. Then he patiently reorganizes, implementing his own strategy of piece-play versus d6 and eventual expansion in the centre. This usually involves the manoeuvre llld2-c4, possibly in conjunction with .lli. f4. Of a sudden Black can be helpless against the threats, fre quently created by a delayed e4-e5. Remem ber that a central majority is often the last thing to be mobilized, but then it can prove deadly! On the flip side, White's bishop on g2 runs right into its own pawn on d5. Furthermore, Black's efforts to realize ...b5 and ...c4 benefit from the absence of the bishop from the fl -a6 diagonal. His most popular plan involves ...a6 and ... lll bd7 and, once White's knight gets to c4, he can play ... lll b6 or ... lll e5 to challenge it. There's also nothing wrong with ... llla6-c7 as long as Black is careful to watch the tactics. Finally, before White reorganizes his pieces Black can play for ... .l:!.e8 and ... lll e4. All this should be done as quickly as possible before White's pawns assert themselves. If White can fend off short-term threats, as he often can, he will normally remain with some advantage. Let's see games using these ideas. Play Down the e-File

Volume 1 examined the move 1 e4 and openings that derive from it. Volume 2 moved on to 1 d4 openings. Predictably, many readers and players were disappointed at the lack of coverage of the move 1 c4, otherwise known as the English Opening. 1 c4 is not only the logical partner to 1 e4 and 1 d4, but in itself a wonderful grounds for the study of positional ideas that encompass the entire range of chess prac- tice. It can be very useful as a complement to openings arising from 1 d4 and 1 lLlf3, since we find many overlapping themes; furthermore, transpositions from and to the English Opening abound af- ter those moves. Given all these considerations, this new volume seemed a good idea. Fortunately, I have an extensive history of writing about 1 c4, beginning with a set of four volumes in 1980 and continuing intermittently through my recent English Opening column for ChessPublishing.com. As in previous volumes, I shall work from the ground up, starting with very elementary choices on the first couple of moves, including ones that you will seldom or perhaps never see, in order to explain the elementary properties of the English Opening. For a primer or refresher on the first principles of opening play in general, see Chapter 1 of Volume 1. The next two chapters of that vol- ume may also be useful, since they identify the ideas and themes most often referred to in the book as a whole. This investigation of fundamentals is hardly the whole story, however. By the time that I get deeply into a given chapter, the complexity of my presentation increases and there will be mate- rial that should be sophisticated enough to appeal to players of all levels. Even in those sections, I have tried to talk about variations and typical positions on a very broad and basic level before plunging into details. Throughout the series I have tried to emphasize the variations which contain universal ideas and structures. Nevertheless, given the fact that fewer games are played with 1 c4 than 1 e4 or 1 d4, I have had the luxury of covering nearly all of its variations, as well as contributing much more up- to-date material and original analysis than in the previous two volumes. I hope that the latter proves useful on a practical level, as well as providing assistance with building a repertoire. Fortunately, although one should never pretend that a certain amount of memorization isn't essential to master any opening, the material in this book lends itself to a broader conceptual approach, and I have in- creased the role of verbal explanation accordingly. Taken as a whole, English Opening variations depend less upon tactical details than their king's and queen's pawn counterparts. I beg the reader's pardon for the dull repetition of assessments such as 'with equality', 'Black stands slightly better', and so forth. These inexact and ambiguous phrases are sadly necessary when presenting opening material with its necessarily truncated lines. There is nothing worse than consistently leaving the reader hanging with no conclusion, and yet it would only confuse matters to use a set of invented phrases to express finer distinctions. My compromise has been to provide verbal and/or analytical justifications whenever a position is significant enough to merit it, or when the assessment might be puzzling on the face of it. Regardless, you will have to put some effort into understanding the assessments and, hopefully, disagree with the inevitable set of mistaken ones. In that regard, almost all complex unattributed notes are my own. Incidentally, one convenient way to study this book is to find the main games in a large database. Then you can follow them in ChessBase (or a similar program) as you read. Having come this far, there's no getting around a Volume 4. Some of it will be devoted to a se- lection of the remaining chess openings; for example, the R€ti Opening (1 lLlf3) , various systems involving fianchettoes and f-pawn moves, as well as some gambits and so-called 'irregular open- ings'. A large portion of Volume 4, however, will be given to special topics such as choosing

10 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

openings, preparing openings, how to study openings, and broader discussions of practical issues facing the everyday player. My objective with this work is to provide instruction and analysis ranging from that appropriate for a low-rated developing player with, say, one or two years' experience, to a long-time player who is familiar with a good deal of theory. That is an ambitious goal, to be sure, and whether this volume fulfils it is a matter I leave for you to judge.

1 Introduction to the English Opening

1 c4 (D) is called the English Opening.

I first wrote about this opening three decades ago. Even then, it took me some 800 pages and four volumes to cover the relevant material, of- ten superficially. Since then, the theory and practice of the English has expanded to such a degree that previously minor lines provide ma- terial for lengthy articles, and major ones are almost unmanageable except on a conceptual basis. Professionals follow some theory up to and beyond the 20th move, just as in other openings. In addition, entirely new lines crop up on a regular basis. Fortunately, to a much greater extent than with 1 e4 or 1 d4, games in the English Opening tend to follow smoother contours as they de- velop, in that structures and strategies persist rather than dissolving into unstable imbalances or tactical melees. While there are many more independent subvariations to cover because the play is so fluid, it takes fewer games to become familiar with their properties. Let's start with the move 1 c4 and ask what White wants. His first goal is to control dS, ob- viously, and in particular, to discourage ... dS. In the most general terms, we can say that the move d4 is White's next objective. In other words, given a free move, White would ordi- narily play 2 d4; indeed, Black's main replies

1.. .eS and 1...cS are designed to prevent that.

This is analogous to the way in which, when White plays 1 e4, he is aiming for d4. Similarly, when he begins with 1 d4, he has in mind play- ing e4. Why, then, not play 1 d4 in the first place? To begin with, White might be disinclined to al- low 1 d4 dS; by playing 1 c4, he discourages l...d5?! 2 cxdS, which deprives Black of a cen- tre pawn and gains a tempo after 2 ... 'ilVxdS 3 ttJc3. Secondly, White may not want to expose himself to some of the annoyances that an early d4 brings; for example, a pin by 1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 e6 3 ttJc3 Bb4 or a pawn confrontation by 1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 cS. In contrast, after 1 c4 ttJf6, White can abstain from that kind of confrontation by 2 ttJc3 e6 3 e4 or 3 ttJf3 (see Chapter 11). Like- wise, after 1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 g6 3 ttJc3 Bg7 4 e4, White has a broad centre to defend and Black's counterplay is usually directed against the d4- pawn (by ... eS or ... cS). By playing the English Opening, White has the opportunity to choose 1 c4 ttJf6 2 ttJc3 g6 3 g3 Bg7 4 Bg2 and then S e4 or S ttJf3, in both cases foregoing an early d4 and leaving his pawns less subject to direct at- tack (see Chapter 12). Naturally, this comes without the advantages of controlling d4 and eS that 1 d4 brings. Let's talk about Black's first move and some move-order issues associated with it. The pri- mary and overwhelmingly-played replies to 1 c4 are 1...eS, 1...cS and 1...ttJf6, as examined in the body of this book. I won't be discussing other replies except as they relate to remaining flank openings in Volume 4 (including ... b6 systems, ... g6 systems and .. .fS systems). Most importantly for the practical player, Black can make his first move with the intent of transpos- ing into other openings entirely. For example, he might respond to 1 c4 with 1...e6, intending to play 2 d4 dS with a Queen's Gambit De- clined. That order may suit White, however, who by using it has sidestepped a number of Queen's Gambit options such as (after 1 d4 dS 2

12 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

c4) 2 ... dxc4 (Queen's Gambit Accepted), 2 ... c6 with a Slav Defence, or 2 ... tDc6 with a Chigorin Defence. White can also play 1 c4 e6 2 tDf3, and upon 2 ... d5, he has entered a Reti Opening with- out having to face an early ... ~g4 or ... ~f5. The Reti is investigated in Volume 4. Also with a mind toward transpositions, Black might answer 1 c4 with 1.. .c6, aiming for the Slav Defence that would follow 2 d4 d5. That may well be satisfactory to White, or he can again choose 2 tDf3, meeting 2 ... d5 with 3 g3 or 3 b3, entering what is called a Reti Slav variation. These lines appear in detail in Volume 4. Another important idea after 1 c4 c6 is 2 e4. Formally speaking, that is a Caro-Kann Defence (beginning with 1 e4 c6 2 c4), and can be found in the books under that move-order. It can transpose, after 2 ... d5, to the Panov Attack following 3 exd5 cxd5 4 d4 (see Volume 1), or to a set of less frequently-played continua- tions; for example, 3 cxd5 cxd5 4 exd5 tDf6 5 ~a4+, a line that will be discussed in the next volume in the context of hybrid systems (along with 2 e4 e5). Naturally there are other trans- positional ideas, such as those stemming from l...d6, when 2 d4 tDf6 3 tDc3 g6 is a King's In- dian, while 2 tDc3 e5 is seen in Chapter 3 via 1 c4 e5 2 tDc3 d6. I was surprised to see that contemporary lit- erature on 1 c4 assigns such different weights to Black's main replies. Each of the three books that I would describe as primarily white reper- toire books allots far more space to the Re- versed Sicilian variations (1 c4 e5) than to the Symmetrical variations (1 c4 c5), ranging from 50% more pages to twice as many. This seemed odd to me, since 1 c4 c5 variations are played as often as 1 c4 e5, until I realized how many more variations a player is responsible for when play- ing either the white or black side of l...e5. In addition, looking over the range of the English Opening and trying to decide upon a distribu- tion of material, I found that there was a more coherent structure of positional types arising from 1...e5, which is important in an instruc- tional tome. As described in the next chapter, study of the English Opening with 1 c4 e5 serves double duty because of the insights that it gives into the Sicilian Defence, which be- gins 1 e4 c5; the latter, of course, is Black's most popular response to 1 e4. Apart from gaining a greater understanding of the charac- teristic structures common to both openings, we can learn a great deal about the advantages of having an extra move in chess; after all, White is playing the Sicilian Defence with an additional tempo. What may prove surprising to some is that there are various disadvantages of having an extra move. All of the chapters in the l...e5 section deal with this issue, Chapter 2 in the most fundamental manner possible. For all that, the incredibly rich history of the superficially less dynamic 1 c4 c5 variations demands close scrutiny. This is especially so because the extremely common move 1 tDf3 precludes 1.. .e5 and very often leads to a Sym- metrical English; for example, after 1 tDf3 c5 2 c4 or 1 tDf3 tDf6 2 c4 c5. Two recent non- repertoire books which cover only a limited se- lection of English Opening variations, chose to present more lines with 1 c4 c5 than with I c4 e5, probably because they were written with no overt agenda for either colour. As it turns out, the main lines after 1 c4 c5 are quite as exciting as those following 1 c4 e5. I have given less expansive coverage to the group of variations beginning with 1 c4 tDf6. The practical and theoretical material produced by these is only a fraction of that generated by l...e5 and l...c5, in part because the move l...tDf6 so frequently transposes to the Sym- metrical or Reversed Sicilian lines following an early ... c5 or ... e5. One policy of the first three volumes of this series has been to concentrate upon 'important' openings, and in particular those whose structures and tactical ideas over- lap as much as possible with other openings. Of the l...tDf6 lines, I decided that variations re- lated to ... e6 systems and ... g6 systems best fit the bill, and have chosen to investigate a num- ber of those. I should warn the reader from the outset that in the English Opening, transpositions and ques- tions of move-order abound, so much so that they will sometimes prove annoying to all but the most sophisticated of players. Working out and drawing attention to these myriad issues is also no fun for the author. But I would be remiss to ignore transpositions that have a significant practical effect. Understanding move-orders means no less than getting the position you want, instead of one you don't like or know

INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH OPENING 13

nothing about. What is the point of studying and understanding openings if you can't get them on the board in the real world of play? Furthermore, knowing how to channel the game in the right direction can mean a tremendous advantage over your opponent in terms of time on the clock and energy expended. So, while you don't want to turn your study into drudgery, you should ab- sorb what you can of these move-order issues in a first reading, and then use this book as a reference when you find the need to sort things out later - for example, after playing a game. Finally I should say that in working through this volume, I found myself marvelling at the extent to which the English Opening embraces the many types of positions and structures that permeate chess practice in general. The term 'cross-pollination', which I describe in Volume 1, applies to the English Opening at least as much as to any other.

2 Reversing the Sicilian: 2nd Moves

Like other first moves, 1 c4 can evoke a sym- metrical response, in this case 1...c5, or a vari- ety of unbalancing replies that range from the highly committal to the very flexible. The un- wavering counter to 1 c4 is 1...e5 (D), establish- ing a direct and classical presence in the centre. w Not surprisingly, 1...e5 is the first move that occurs to players of little experience. But it turns out that masters also trust this naIve intu- ition and answer 1 c4 with 1.. .e5 as much as with any other move. Black's e-pawn advance has the same good points that 1 e4 does, that is, it fights for control of the centre while freeing his king's bishop and queen for development. By playing 1 ... e5, Black sets up a reversed Si- cilian Defence (l e4 c5), which has some pe- culiar implications. In the most basic sense, White's idea with 1 c4 is to control the central square d5 without letting his central pawns be- come targets. If you think about it, the Sicilian Defence is effective precisely because White has committed to 1 e4, i.e., White has presented Black with a target of attack, and he has fore- gone the chance to use his e-pawn in defence of d4. Given the enormous popularity of the Sicil- ian Defence (1 e4 c5), and in particular its repu- tation as a defence that creates Black's best winning chances, it may surprise you that so many top competitors (including most World Champions) have used 1 c4 e5 as Black, often exclusively. After all, any player of 1 e4 knows how difficult it is to generate chances in the Open Sicilian (i.e., those lines consisting of the moves 1 e4 c5 2 lDf3 followed by 3 d4 cxd4 4 lDxd4), without risking serious positional infe- riority. And they also know that when White avoids the Open Sicilian, even by using logical developing moves, Black still gets an opportu- nity to exert pressure upon White's position and create winning chances. He might do so by means of central control (for example, by play- ing ... lDc6, ... g6 and ... iLg7) combined with ei- ther queenside or central expansion. If there were a 'safe and solid' way to deny dynamic play to Black in the Sicilian, it would have changed the course of chess history. So you might ask (and many players have done so) why anyone would subject themselves to playing against the Sicilian Defence with a tempo less? It turns out that not only does 1 c4 e5 lead to a vast network of opening variations and diverse structures, it also provides a case study of the issues associated with reversed openings. This is a complicated subject only touched upon in the two previous volumes. If you understand the subtleties of reversed posi- tions, you will better appreciate the inherent imbalances in chess, and understand why Black can have so many positive winning chances in a game where the odds seem to be stacked against him. Naturally I've looked at this issue in other parts of the book, but it will be of prime impor- tance throughout the first few chapters. As it happens, many players intending to play an English Opening will use the move IlDf3, pri- marily to avoid lines with 1 c4 e5, and then fol- low with 2 c4. There are several basic reasons why Black can play the 'White' side of an opening a tempo down. The most important one has to do with the concept of 'information'. White gets an ex- tra move, to be sure, but Black has a look at that move and can thus adjust his strategy with the

REVERSING THE SICILIAN: 2ND MOVES 15

benefit of his extra information. In this sense, almost all of one's moves in chess come with the disadvantage oftipping one's hand. Natu- rally, the positive value of a move usually out- weighs this drawback, but the two factors can combine in unpredictable ways. Having an extra move in a reversed position can also put White in the odd situation that he has little positive to do. It turns out that many respectable openings for Black are essentially reactive, such that Black is waiting for White to make a committal move, perhaps an ambitious one, in order to get positive counterchances. When White takes on the reversed position, it is as though he is waiting for Black to do some- thing definite before he can respond with real effect. It may come as a surprise how often the tempo is of only moderate value to White. Finally, White sometimes feels that he should be playing for a win by virtue of moving first. But in a good number of chess openings, the best move for Black in a given position may lead to a dull equality without serious chances for either side. This might be acceptable for Black, but is not what White is looking for. Even defences generally thought of as dynamic when played as Black are sometimes revealed to be without bite when White tries to employ them with an extra move. Naturally, all of these advantages for Black in a reversed opening don't always compen- sate for the stark reality that White has an extra move. A tempo is, after all, a gain of time, and most practitioners of the English Opening en- joy taking up the challenge that 1...e5 implies. A skilful handler of the white pieces will often gain a comfortable advantage, simply because Black is not equipped to protect his centre at the same time as he wards off attacks in other sectors. Alternatively, White will sometimes achieve a typical Sicilian Defence advantage (for example, an advanced queenside attack) which might otherwise be impossible to achieve in the Sicilian itself. The variations arising from 1 c4 e5 are also more instructive than any others in the English Opening. Playing 1 c4 e5 is as basic to develop- ing chess skills as playing 1 e4 e5. In both cases, study and practice will increase your flu- ency in classical chess principles while dramat- ically improving your game. Working From the Ground Up White's most popular moves after 1 c4 e5 are 2 lLlc3 and 2 g3. Indeed, they account for a stag- gering 98% of all master games stemming from

1 c4 e5. In fact, if you factor in transpositions,

variations I assign to 2lLlc3 make up 94% of the total. In this chapter we look at why that is, and whether it should be so. Of course, one might say the same thing about other initial opening moves. For exam- ple, after 1 d4 d5, White pretty much sticks to 2 c4 or 2lLlf3. And 2lLlf3 really dominates play after 1 e4 e5. Still, 1 c4 e5 looks much more flexible, and superficially, at least six other moves seem reasonable, most of which are used in the reverse Sicilian position (following 1 e4 c5). Why then is 2 lLlc3 so overwhelmingly chosen and why is it practically automatic to play either 2 lLlc3 or 2 g3 ? The answer to this question can only be found by looking at other logical and consistent second moves for White. I'm going to do that in much more detail than standard books do be- cause White's second-move alternatives reveal much about what's going on in the Reversed Sicilian variations, particularly in terms of pawn-structures and associated strategies. Fur- thermore, we find that these alternatives have not been fully explored, so they may have a bit more practical value than has generally been thought. You will see that a knowledge of other openings is very useful in understanding these lines. 1 c4e5 (D) w

16 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

From this fundamental position, I shall look at the moves 2 d3 and 2lDf3 in their own sepa- rate sections. Before doing so, I think that we B can learn a lot by considering these rarely- played alternatives: a) 2 e4?! (D) may not be an out-and-out mistake, but it creates an outpost for Black on d4, one that is easily occupied. Unless White can get d4 in, his bishop on fl will be bad and his development will be cramped.

The most natural move is 2 ... lDc6, and if 3 lDf3 (in order to enforce d4), then 3 ... lDf6 4 lDc3 is a respectable line of the English Four Knights (Chapter 5) that goes 1 c4 e5 2 lDc3 lDf6 3 lDf3 lDc6 4 e4!? We shall see something about that position in Chapter 5. One important tactical theme in that case is that 4 ... .i.c5 can be met by 5 lDxe5!, with the idea 5 ... lDxe5 6 d4, forking two pieces and breaking Black's stran- glehold on the centre. Not surprisingly, that re- sults in a very unclear position. In the line we are currently considering, after 1 c4 e5 2 e4 lDc6 3lDf3, Black needn't bother with 3 ... lDf6, because he can clamp down further on d4 by 3 ... .i.c5!, and if 4 lDc3, 4 ... d6 prevents lDxe5 and has 5 .. .l Df6 or 5 .. .f5 in mind. Still better, Black can play 2 ... .i.c5(!) right away, to keep open the idea of ... c6, which would repel a knight from d5. Then 3 lDf3 can be answered by 3 ... d6, when a natural continua- tion is 4 d4?! exd4 5lDxd4 (D). White has gained some space but is slightly behind in development (it's Black's move), and his dark squares are vulnerable to attack. For example, Black has 5 ... ~f6!? (5 ... lDf6 6 lDc3 transposes to the next paragraph) 6lDf3 (after 6 .i.e3? lDc6 7 lDxc6 .i.xe3 8 fxe3 bxc6, White has a bad bishop and some very weak pawns) 6 ... ~g6!? 7 lDc3 lDf6 8 lDh4 ~g4 9 ~xg4 lDxg4 10 lDdllDc6 11 f3 lDge5 with the better development. To avoid trouble with ... ~f6, White can play 4lDc3 lDf6 and now 5 d4 exd4 6lDxd4. Then a natural sequence is 6 ... O-O 7 .i.e2 ':e8 8 f3lDc6 9 i.e3, which looks exactly like a King's Indian Defence, except that Black's bishop is on c5, where it went in one move, instead of g7! A standard idea from that opening is also good here: the move 9 ... lDh5! (D) intends ... lDf4 with ... ~g5, and in some cases ... f5. w A beautiful variation is 10 g3lDf4!!; for ex- ample, 11 gxf4 (11 lDxc6 lDg2+!) 11...lDxd4 12 .i.xd4 ~h4+ 13 'it'fl? (13 'iitd2 .i.xd4 fa- vours Black) 13 ... .i.h3+ 14 'iitgl ':e6 15 f5 .i.xf5! and so forth. And 10 lDxc6 can be met by 1O ... ~h4+! 11 g3? lDxg3, etc. In conclusion, it's not as though 2 e410ses by force, but there's no effective way for White to

REVERSING THE SICILIAN: 2ND MOVES 17

contest the outpost on d4 without falling dan- gerously behind in development. That is proba- bly obvious to most readers; nevertheless, the B details are instructive. b) 2 e3 is an acceptable move, imitating the Sicilian Defence with 1 e4 cS 2 liJf3 e6, but it commits White to a particular central pawn- formation early on, thus giving Black useful in- formation. Black can continue, for example, 2 ... liJf6 (D). w Then Black will have no complaints if White tries 3 d4!?, because 3 ... exd4 4 exd4 dS gives him a full share of the centre. After 2 e3 liJf6, the more flexible 3 liJc3 will be seen under the move-order 1 c4 eS 2 liJc3 liJf6 3 e3 in the first game of Chapter 4 (Van Wely-Kasparov). I should point out that 3 a3!? tries to transpose into a reversed Paulsen Sicilian after 3 ... dS 4 cxdS liJxdS, but Black needn't be so coopera- tive and, for example, the move a3 isn't terribly useful in lines beginning with 3 ... c6, or against a King's Indian structure following 3 ... d6 4 d4 liJbd7 S liJc3 g6 6 liJf3 i.g7, etc. Compare the alternative 2 a3 below. After 1 c4 eS 2 e3, 2 ... c6 can also be played; for example, 3 d4 exd4 4 ~xd4 (4 exd4 dS is fine for Black) 4 ... dS S liJf3 liJf6 6 liJc3 (D), when we have a reversed variation of the Ala- pin Sicilian (1 e4 cS 2 c3). When the queen is on d4, we find that varia- tions with the move e3 are less pointed than those in which White has played i.gS (the rele- vant comparison is with the reversed line in the Sicilian Defence, 1 e4 cS 2 c3 dS 3 exdS ~xdS 4 d4liJf6 sliJf3 e6, which is rather unambitious in comparison with S. .. i.g4). Of course, White has an extra tempo here and there will be plenty of chances to make such an unbalanced posi- tion interesting. Incidentally, the frequent rela- tionship between seemingly disparate openings is shown by the following Slav Defence varia- tion: 1 d4 dS 2 c4 c6 3liJc3 eS (this is called the Winawer Counter-Gambit) 4 e3 exd4 S ~xd4 liJf6 6 liJf3, with precisely the position we are discussing! c) 2 a3 is one of those semi-waiting moves that doesn't commit to a strategy, but has some point. It prepares a timely b4, for one thing. Think about it: after 1 e4 cS 2liJf3 followed by

3 d4 cxd4 4liJxd4, it's hard to find a variation in

which ... a6 isn't useful for Black. The problem is that, again, Black needn't co- operate with an early ... dS. Thus, for example, 2 ... liJf6 (D) (also fine are 2 ... g6 and 2 ... d6, among other moves). w 3liJc3 (3 b4 isn't very pointed when there's no black knight on c6 to kick around; an exam- ple would be 3 ... g6 4 i.b2 d6 S e3 i.g7 6liJc3

18 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

O-O with equality) 3 ... c6!? (Black might play this way in order to stir the pot; a simpler solu- tion is 3 ... g6 followed by a King's Indian set- up with ... d6, ... i.g7 and ... O-O) 4 d4 (4 ttJf3 is met by 4 ... e4 5 ttJd4 d5 6 cxd5 cxd5 {or even 6 .. :i!i'xd5}, when a3 isn't helping matters; Black can also answer with 4 ... d6, when the move a3 is again fairly meaningless) 4 ... exd4 5 ~xd4 d5

w Now we have a position very similar to that arising from 2 e3 c6 3 d4 exd4 4 ~xd4 d5 above, except that White has the opportunity to play the desirable move i.g5, since the bishop isn't cut off by a pawn on e3. Unfortunately, he has invested time on the unimpressive move a3, and he has a knight on c3 which isn't as well- placed as one on f3. Within the next few moves, Black threatens to gain space a tempo by means of ... c5 and ... d4. With that in mind, White might continue 6 ttJf3 (6 cxd5 cxd5 frees a square for Black's knight on c6, which will at- tack White's queen with gain of time; naturally that's not the end of the world for White, but it means that he is very unlikely to get anything out of the opening; furthermore, the immedi- ate 6 i.g5 can be answered by 6 ... i.e7, threat- ening ... c5, when 7 cxd5 cxd5 8 i.xf6 i.xf6 9 'ili'xd5?? loses to 9 ... i.xc3+) 6 ... i.e7 7 g3?! (or 7 cxd5 cxd5 8 e3 ttJc6) 7 ... c5 8 'iVd3 d4. You might compare this with I c4 e5 2 g3 ttJf6 3 i.g2 c6 4 d4 exd4 5 'iVxd4 d5 6 ttJf3 in Chapter 4; in that case, White can abstain from capture on d5 in some lines until the right moment. And even if White does exchange on d5, then after ... ttJc6 he can move his queen without having to suffer a direct attack from ... d4. If all that sounds obscure, a look at the variations in Chap- ter 4 will help. I should also note that Black can take his chances with an early ... d5; for example, 3 ... d5, even if that seems cooperative. We shall see lines with ... d5 below, and in future chapters. d) 2 b3 is perfectly good, but it lacks punch. White can, for example, combine it with g3 and i.g2 (a double fianchetto), to get a game with mutual chances. But when the king's bishop has to settle for a place on e2, it's highly unlikely that White will get any real prospects. Accord- ing to theory, one easy solution is 2 ... ttJf6 3 i.b2 ttJc6 (D). w

4 e3 (4 ttJf3 e4 5 ttJd4 i.c5 6 e3 O-O is equal;

Black can even play 6 ... i.xd4 7 exd4 d5, in spite of ceding the bishop-pair, since White's bishop on b2 is ineffective and his d4-pawn re- quires tending) 4 ... d5 5 cxd5 ttJxd5 poses White at least as many problems as Black. For exam- ple, 6 i.b5?! ttJdb4! is not pleasant, because of the attack on the d3-square. Of course, Black has many other replies to 2 b3. e) Finally, you may be wondering about the direct 1 c4 e5 2 d4?!. Then 2 ... exd4 3 'ili'xd4?! ttJc6 develops smoothly with gain of time. A trickier move is 3 ttJf3!?, when Black can play simply 3 ... ttJf6! (White's only real point is that he can meet 3 ... c5?! by 4 e3! dxe3 5 i.xe3; then, for the pawn, White has complete control of d5 and the d-file, and his pieces are coming out rapidly - this is a type of position worth re- membering, and parallels a similar gambit in the Sicilian Defence) 4 ttJxd4 d5!? (an ambi- tious freeing move; simple moves like 4 ... i.c5 should also equalize) 5 cxd5 'ili'xd5 6 ttJc3 (6 e3

Najdorf and Dragon Aspirations

[diagram]
For those who like the Najdorf or Dragon variations of the Sicilian Defence, which both begin with 1 e4 c5 2 tbf3 d6, it's only natural to consider the move ...

2 d3 (D)

Why isn't this played more often? The main problem, as opposed to 2 tbc3 and 2 g3, is that 2 d3 forfeits the chance to play d4 in one move. Let's see what that implies for both sides. 2 ... tbf6 a) Another logical move for Black is 2 ... tbc6, which is not quite as flexible in the sense that he relinquishes the option of ... c6. But it is flexible in another way if he intends ... g6 and ... i.g7, because in that case Black retains the options of playing ... tbge7 and/or ... f5 at some point. The Dragon or Najdorffan will most likely respond with 3 tbf3 (D). Then Black can highlight the drawbacks of 2 d3 by playing 3 ... g6 (alternatively, 3 ... tbf6 4 tbc3 is a main-line Four Knights Variation of Chapter 5, with White having played the rela- tively harmless 4 d3; see below). The best an- swer to an early ... g6 is often d4, but here 4 d4!? is a loss of a tempo, which means that Black will equalize easily. Play might go 4 ... exd4 5 tbxd4 i.g7 6 tbxc6 bxc6 and Black has free and easy play, a natural continuation being 7 g3 tbe7 8 i.g2 O-O 9 O-O d5, or 9 .. ..l:1b8. Take away d3 and ... tbc6 and we can see why such an early ... g6 can be risky: 1 c4 e5 2 tbc3 g6?! 3 d4! exd4 4 'iixd4, and now 4 ... tbf6? is disastrous due to 5 i.g5 with tbd5 next, winning a piece. White's best line, instead of 4 d4, is probably 4 tbc3 i.g7 5 g3, which is a kind of reversed Closed Sicilian (or 'Closed English') that we shall run into in Chapter 6. b) In a more original vein, notice how 2 ... c6, another Alapin Sicilian reversed, is perfectly playable for Black. In large part this is because Black hasn't committed his king's knight; for example, 3 tbf3 d6 4 tbc3 f5! (D) is a familiar kind of position except that White would like to have the move d4 in. This should be compared with a line that arises in Chapter 3: 1 c4 e5 2 tbc3 d6 3 tbf3 f5 4 d4 e4 5 tbg5 c6. In the diagram, White can only play d4 with loss of time. If he doesn't chal- lenge the centre, Black has few problems; for example, a logical continuation is 5 g3 tbf6 6 i.g2 i.e7 (there are other moves, but I'll show this for simplicity's sake) 7 0-00-08 l:tbl a5 9 a3 tba6 10 b4 axb4 11 axb4 tbc7 12 b5 i.d7 with a safe queenside and a nice central posi- tion. White could insist upon playing 5 d4!? a tempo down, when a sample line that parallels

20 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

w the Chapter 3 variation is S ... e4 6 lDgS h6 (Black assumes some weaknesses, as White wants, but with a gain of time and space) 7lDh3 gS 8 e3 lDf6 9 .te2 fIIe7 (in order to be able to answer 10 .thS+ with 1O ... lDxhS 11 fIIxhS+ Win) 10 O-O .tg7 11 b4 O-O with equality. Watch out for 12 .tb2? (12 ~hl! is better) 12 .. .f4! (D). w Black intends .. .f3, winning a piece. And he has the idea 13 exf4 g4, when the knight is trapped! Also losing is 13 f3 exf3 14 .txf3 g4. You should know this attacking theme, which comes up in periodically in a variety of open- ings. Very often the 'victim' of the tactic has fianchettoed; for example, in the Pirc Defence when Black answers eS with ... lDg4 and is chased back to h6 by h3; subsequently, White plays g4 and, with a great deal of luck, gets to use the fS trick. You may want to check out that opening to see what I'm talking about. Granted, all this is not very meaningful in terms of precise chess theory. Nevertheless, some useful ideas arise when we consider such lines. We now return to 2 ... lDf6 (D); w 3lDf3 With this move White is still hoping for a Najdorf or Dragon with reversed colours (e.g. 3 ... lDc6 and now 4 a3 dS or 4 g3 dS). The alter- native 3 lDc3 can be met by various moves, in- cluding the simple 3. .. lDc6, when 4 lDf3 is analysed in Chapter S under the move-order 2 lDc3lDf6 3 lDf3 lDc6 4 d3. If White chooses to play 4 g3, Black has new possibilities. The move 4 ... .tb4, for example, should lead to an equal game, even though someone wishing to get away from the beaten path as White might want to play S .td2 followed by a3 or lDdS and take it from there. Perhaps the most interesting comparison with a normal Sicilian Dragon is in the line 3 lDc3 lDc6 4 g3 dS S cxdS lDxdS. White's 'extra' tempo is d3 which, as so often, is committal in a partially detrimental way. That's because after 6 .tg2 .te6, Black can keep his knight on the desirable square dS. To explain that, let's con- tinue with the normal Dragon moves 7 lDf3 .te7 (D). Experienced English Opening players can compare 1 c4 eS 2lDc3 lDf6 3 lDf3 lDc6 4 g3 dS S cxdS lDxdS 6 .tg2 in Chapter S. In that case, White is threatening 7 lDxeS!, so Black usually plays 6 ... lDb6, because after 6 ... .te6 7 O-O, White is ready to play the advantageous move 8 d4. By contrast, in our present example, White has already committed to d3; this means that he can only advance the d-pawn to d4 at the cost of a tempo. This is a rather sophisticated point,

REVERSING THE SICILIAN: 2ND MOVES 21

w especially for those who don't play the Dragon; however, it's illustrative of the nuances that arise in reversed openings. Black can also play something solid versus 3 tbc3 such as 3 ... c6 4 tbf3 d6, after which he can choose either ... g6/ ... i.g7 with a standard posi- tion, or ... tbbd7, holding out for possibilities of ... d5 or ... g6. Instead, 4 ... d5? 5 cxd5 gives White the advantage, because 5 ... cxd5? loses a pawn to 6 tbxe5 d4 7 ~a4+!, and 5 ... tbxd5 6 tbxe5! tbxc3 7 bxc3 ~a5 8 tbf3 ~xc3+ 9 i.d2 favours White due to his better development and central pawn-majority. But watch out for the standard trap 5 tbxe5?? d4, winning a piece, because if the c3-knight moves, 6 .. :iVa5+ will win the knight on e5! A handy trick to know. We now return to 3 tbf3 (D):

3 ... tbc6 After 3. .. i.b4+!? 4 i.d2 i.xd2+ 5 'it'xd2, we have a type of Moscow Sicilian reversed (1 e4 c5 2 tbf3 d6 3 i.b5+, etc.); Black stands solidly enough if he continues 5 ... d6. As previously indicated, what are equalizing lines when play- ing Black in the Sicilian Defence are often less attractive for White in the English Opening, since he expects to retain an advantage. The question is always whether his extra tempo has real significance. In this particular case, White has enough interesting options that the reversed Moscow Variation may be satisfactory for him, regardless of whether equality is the technical verdict. 4a3 A typical Sicilian Defence move. Again, White hopes for 4 ... d5 5 cxd5 tbxd5 with a re- versed Najdorf and a tempo in hand. Black will usually not oblige, but see the next note. The 'Dragon-esque' 4 g3 allows moves such as 4 ... g6 (again because d410ses a tempo), or 4 ... i.c5, or 4 ... i.b4+. We shall also see that re- versed Dragon positions following 4 ... d5 5 cxd5 tbxd5 are satisfactory for Black. Finally, 4 tbc3 is a line of the Four Knights Variation, considered relatively harmless, which is not to say that White can't try it out. Black might have avoided this by 2 d3 tbc6 3 tbf3 g6, al- though that's hardly necessary. 4 ... g6 Solid play. Fianchettoing the king's bishop tends to be a reliable equalizer if White plays slow moves. Still, it's instructive to see what happens if Black cooperates by playing the provocative 4 ... d5!? 5 cxd5 tbxd5 (D). w If there's any position involving 2 d3 in which White should be able to exploit an extra tempo, it would be this one. Now the move from the Najdorf 'proper' is 6 e4 (6 g3 is a reversed

22 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Dragon structure in which a3 may not help much; 6 e3 is a reversed Scheveningen, likely to provide interesting but not inspiring play if Black responds ultra-solidly; 6 b4! is more am- bitious, when the game can go in many direc- tions, but White does well to put his knight on d2 and not c3, just as Black chooses ... lLlbd7 in the great majority of Najdorf variations) 6 ... lLlb6!? (this is normal in the reversed position, but 6 ... lLlf6 maybe be a safer course; you need to study the theory of the Najdorf to understand this line) 7 .lie3 (D) (7 .lie2 and 7 lLlbd2 are also logical moves, when b4 and .lib2 frequently follows).

After 7 .lie3, White is a tempo up in a re- versed Najdorf Sicilian. Nothing that he has done has tipped his hand in a negative way, so the real issue is whether Black has a modest way to avoid entering into the time-critical dy- namic lines which characterize the Najdorf. For this purpose, the careful 7 ... .lie7 is appropriate (rather than the energetic 7 ... f6 8 lLlbd2 .lie6 9 .lie2 ~d7 10 O-O O-O-O 11 b4, when White is a tempo ahead of the 'English Attack' of the Si- cilian Defence; that is a line characterized by dynamism and attacking ideas, so an extra move will be very important and therefore 7 .. .f6 is not a smart choice for Black). After 7 ... .lie7, we might see 8 .lie2 (8 d4 exd4 9 lLlxd4 lLlxd4 leads to the kind of simplification with which Black can be content when playing the Sicilian; of course, White wants more in the reversed position) 8 ... O-O 9 O-O .lie6 10 lLlbd2 as and Black's game is solid enough. Naturally, there are options here for both sides, as well as issues of move-order that I haven't mentioned. You can see that the play stemming from 4 a3 dS is flexible and balanced. White may like this idea of a reversed Najdorf, but he needs to keep in mind that few players of Black will do their opponents the psychological favour of playing 4 ... dS. Let's follow a game with our main-line move, 4 ... g6: w Wahls - Rabiega German Ch, Altenkirchen 2001

Sb4 This queenside advance is the most inde- pendent move, consistent with 4 a3. Instead, S lLlc3 .lig7 6 g3 O-O is a kind of Anti-King's In- dian variation from Chapter 12, in which you will see that .l:r.bl is generally more useful than a3 in supporting the queenside advance b4-bS.

REVERSING THE SICILIAN: 2ND MOVES 23

A fairly typical English Opening position has arisen, in the sense that White is exerting pres- sure with his g2-bishop along the long diagonal, and that he has reinforced his light-square con- trol by means of b4-bS. Black, in tum, is set to attack, either on the kingside by ... fS or in the centre by ... dS (often preceded by ... c6). In gen- eral, White has two related ideas that have been hampered (or delayed) by the insertion of a3. Normally he gets his best attacking chances by playing the move cS, at some point capturing on d6 and opening lines on the queenside. To im- plement this, however, White would ideally have the moves a4 and i.a3 in, and in the situation be- fore us, they both take two moves to implement instead of one. That's quite a loss of time, and guarantees Black reasonable chances regard- less of whether he plays on the kingside or in the centre. Another of White's customary strategies is a4-aS-a6; again, playing a3-a4 would lose a tempo in carrying out this plan. 9 ... a6 Black makes a tough decision that you will confront time and again in the English Open- ing, and in this book. If he opens the a-file and exchanges the aI-rook, that can either make it easier to defend his queenside (one less pawn there) or else help White to penetrate favour- ably down the a-file. Generally this is a matter of judgement, and the consequences are not im- mediately evident.

14 ••• ttJd7 A move characteristic of such positions: by doubly protecting the eS-pawn, Black prepares a possible ... dS, and his f-pawn is also freed to advance. The knight on d7 can also be well- placed for defence if it gets to cS. 15 ttJc3 'Wic7 IS ... dS and IS ... fS are decent alternatives. 16 ttJd2 White wants to strengthen his control of the hl-a8 diagonal. 16 'iWc2 also makes sense, in order to bring the fl-rook to the queenside. 16• •• ttJc5 Or 16 ... fS, when Black's mobile centre serves as a counterweight to White's queenside pres- sure. 17 ttJa4 ttJxa4 18 'Wixa4 i.g4? This move is logical, but falls for a sort of 'trick'. 18 ... dS is safe enough, possibly fol- lowed by ... i.e6 and .. .fS. After 18 ... i.g4? White could have played 19 cS!, when the queen on a4 attacks the g4-bishop, giving White time to play cxd6 and seriously weaken Black's pawn-structure. Sometimes the simple moves are the easiest to miss. The rest of the game was not of interest in terms of opening ideas. Improved Alekhine-Sicilian

1 c4 e5 2 ttJf3 (D)

By playing 2 ttJf3, White enters into an Ale- khine Defence (1 e4 ttJf6) with the extra move c4 in. The move 2 ttJf3 is also a reversed form of the Nimzowitsch Sicilian, which goes 1 e4 cS 2 ttJf3 ttJf6. Looked at from that perspective,

24 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

White has an extra tempo, that is, Black hasn't played ... liJf6 yet. Can White get an advantage in this way? While 2 liJf3 is hardly a super- weapon, I think that it is better than generally recognized, both as an independent variation and a transpositional tool. 2• •• e4 This aggressive move is easily the most im- portant one. Instead, 2 ... d6 is rather passive af- ter 3 d4. The alternative 2 ... liJc6 is a sound choice, aiming for transposition. Then White can play 3 liJc3, returning to a main line of the English Opening which goes 2 liJc3 liJc6 3 liJf3, while having eliminated a couple of pos- sibilities for Black. For example, had White played I c4 eS 2 liJc3, Black's intent may have been 2 ... d6, a popular move that can transpose into the King's Indian set-up after ... g6, but can also involve a sequence such as 3 liJf3 fS 4 d4 e4, which has a decent reputation for Black (see Chapter 3). Or Black might have prepared 2 liJc3 ..tb4, a move which has been approved of at the highest levels of play (this is also ana- lysed in Chapter 3). Since these options aren't available to Black after 2 liJf3 liJc6 3 liJc3, he will probably settle for the main lines, namely, 3 ... liJf6, or 3 .. .fS, which are analysed in Chap- ters S and 6 respectively. Alternatively, White can deviate by playing 3 d4, intending 3 ... exd4 4 liJxd4 liJf6 S liJc3, transposing to the 4 d4 variation of the Four Knights main line, which goes 2 liJc3 liJf6 3 liJf3 liJc6 4 d4 (see Chapter S). By this means, White would bypass one of Black's important options, 4 ... e4. After 3 d4, however, the immediate 3 ... e4! (D) is the truly independent continuation. w Then White should abstain from 4 liJgS?! (remarkably, this is already dubious; the inno- cent-looking 4 liJfd2 can be met with 4 ... e3!? S fxe3 liJf6, an apparently sound gambit that is unclear, but at least interesting for both sides; White can also consider 4 liJeS) 4 ... ..tb4+! S liJc3 (S i.d2?? 'iixgS) and Black can exploit the very lack of ... liJf6 to play the unique S. .. dS! (intending ... h6) 6 cxdS 'iixdS 7 a3 (pretty much forced in order to defend d4 without losing the knight on gS) 7 ... ..txc3+ 8 bxc3 liJf6 with excel- lent central control, very quick development, and the prospect of ... h6. This is not so different from other lines we shall see in this book that emphasize space and light-square control by Black. Players familiar with the Chigorin Queen's Gambit will see that Black very likely stands better than after I d4 dS 2 c4 liJc6 3 cxdS 'iixdS 4 e3 eS S liJc3 ..tb4 6 a3 ..txc3+ 7 bxc3 liJf6 8 liJf3 e4, a position which is itself quite playable for Black. One point of knowing a variety of openings is to be able to make such comparisons and therefore intuitive assessments about a position's worth. 3 liJd4 Who wouldn't want this type of reversed Alekhine Defence (1 e4 liJf6 2 eS liJdS), having the move ... cS already in? That would discour- age White from d4, which is his main move ver- sus the Alekhine. Of course, it's never that simple. Let's follow some games: Murey - Heran Condom 2004

attack) 7 ... i.xc3 8 dxc3, which is a standard structure pitting two bishops against the cramp- ing pawn. Compare the main-line Four Knights variations in Chapter S. Finally, 4 ... i.b4 is a natural-looking contin- uation, when White can take aim at e4 by S 'iic2

At first glance, this doesn't look too bad for Black, but it turns out that defending his e-pawn is a bother. For example, S ... tL'lc6 (S ... i.xc3 6 dxc3! sets up quick development by i.gS or i.f4 and perhaps O-O-O; alternatively, the gam- bit S. ..

This solution is approved by the conven- tional wisdom; in fact, 3 ... lLlc6 is often adorned by'!'. Black forestalls White's planned attack on the exposed e-pawn and compels a response. 4e3 White continues to follow the main idea from the Sicilian Defence (l e4 c5 2lLlf3lLlf6 3 e5 lLld5 4 lLlc3 e6). 4 lLlc2!? appears passive, but White plans to harass Black's e-pawn by means of lLlc3, g3 and i.g2, with lLle3 and sometimes d3 to follow.

I should add, however, that this variation is not as easy as I've painted it, and will repay a closer look. 4 •.• lLlxd45 exd4 (D)

Here, by analogy with the reversed position from the Sicilian Defence, Black would a1ready have a knight on f6. If he catches up with that position now, White will be glad to break up the centre; for example, 5 ... lLlf6 6lLlc3 d5!? 7 d3! exd3 (7 ... i.b4?? 8 'Wia4+; 7 ... i.f5 8 i.g5) 8 i.xd3 dxc4 9 i.xc4 with a pleasant isolated queen's pawn position which may favour White and is at any rate easier to play for him (O-O, l:tel and i.g5 are typical follow-up moves). However, precisely because Black is a tempo behind the Nimzowitsch Sicilian line (that is, because ... lLlf6 hasn't been played), he can oc- cupy that square, as follows: 5 •• JWf6! This simple move hits d4, which can be hard to defend. This is essentia1ly the reason why 2 lLlf3 is so seldom played. We have the typica1 case where playing with a tempo less has its ad- vantages, because f6 is free. The issue remains whether that benefit outweighs, or is outweighed by, the value of an extra move. 6d5?! Usually this is the only move given by play- ers and theoreticians. But since it turns out to be extremely perilous, White might look to con- test the initiative by 6 lLlc3!, giving up a pawn

for quick development and a central attack. Af- ter 6 .. :~xd4, I think that White should try the patient 7 .Jte2 (D). W

This delays the break d3 until White's king is out of the way. White intends to exploit Black's poor development, but he wants to get his pieces out before playing to win the centre and evict the queen. The prospect of ltJbS or ltJdS can be bothersome for Black. The only other source that I know of that mentions 6ltJc3 recommends 7 d3, which can be met by 7 ... .Jtb4; for example, 8 'iVb3 .Jtxc3+ 9 bxc3 'iVeS (or 9 ... 'iVd6). Then White controls the dark squares, yet needs to prove compensation for the pawn (which is not to say that it is lacking). Mter 7 .Jte2, the game might proceed 7 ... ltJf6

8 O-O, and now Black has to decide what to do

about the centre, as well as keep an eye on pos- sibilities like ltJbS and d4. A sample line might be 8 ... .Jtb4 (8 ... dS 9 d3 activates White's pieces, one point being 9 ... exd3 10 ltJbS!

For some rea- son, the cautious 12 ... ttJe5?! has been the most popular try at this point, when 13 i.e3 is the best and probably an adequate defence. l2. .. ttJxh2! is another good move, and a tactical device to remember. Black threatens ... 'ilVg3+ (which is naturally the answer to 13 !txh2?).

But a student can't truly under- stand 1 c4 e5 without appreciating why a Re- versed Sicilian is palatable for Black at all.

3 Introduction to 2 tDc3:

Black Plays Flexibly

1 c4 e5 2 ttJc3 (D)

Having looked at some other moves in the last chapter, you can see how 2 ttJc3 might be favoured. It controls the key squares e4 and d5, yet doesn't commit White to a central pawn- structure. For example, 2 ttJc3 leaves open the possibilities of playing d3, d4, e3 and e4, which is not the case with 2 d3 and 2 e3 (at least not in one move). Nor does it create a hole (as does 2 e4), or allow for an answer which renders it slow or irrelevant (for example, 2 a3 lets Black use a ... g6 solution, and most of the moves we considered in the last chapter were vulnerable to 2 ... c6). After 2 ttJc3, Black's traditional main lines begin with 2 ... ttJf6 and 2 ... ttJc6. But masters and grandmasters are very fond of some other replies, especially 2 ... d6 and 2 ... i.b4, ultra- flexible moves which have been proven to give good counterplay. The assorted variations stem- ming from them contain an astonishing number of themes and ideas which are common to the rest of the English Opening. Furthermore, the elastic nature of 2 ... d6 and 2 ... i.b4 allows Black to have an equal say in the pawn-formations that result out of the opening, something he may not be able to do in variations growing out of 2 ... ttJf6 and 2 ... ttJc6. At the same time, White has exceptional leeway in picking his own way through the opening. Some would say this is chess as it should be. Before turning to those moves, let's continue to pursue the philosophy that less frequently played alternatives can be as instructive as the normal ones. I think that a glance at rare and even inferior moves will help us understand what White wants from these positions, and what it is that Black should avoid. Following these moves I shall take a fairly close look at 2 ... f5, a periodically-played move which is use- ful to understand because of the typical struc- tures that it leads to. a) 2 ... b6?! doesn't go well with ... e5 (better with ... e6, to add to the bishop's influence along the long diagonal). 3 ttJf3 is the simplest reply: 3 ... ttJc6 (3 ... d6?! 4 d4 exd4 5 ttJxd4 gives White space and superior development while weaken- ing Black's light squares to boot) 4 e3 with d4 next is an excellent course for White. Naturally

4 g3 is also good, if unassuming.

b) 2 ... c6 (D), which is perfectly fine after 2 d3, 2 e3 and 2 a3, gives White two good re- sponses. w

30 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

First, according to the ideas discussed in the first two volumes, the move ... c6 should be a red flag for 3 d4, since a queen on d4 cannot be attacked by a knight on c6. Thus, should Black play 3 ... exd4 4 'iWxd4, he ends up short of space; e.g., 4 ... l2Jf6 (Black achieves nothing after 4 ... l2Ja6 S e4l2Jb4 6 'iWdl and 7 a3; 4 ... 'iWf6 may be best, although even the exchange of queens by S l2Jf3 'ii'xd4 6 l2Jxd4 is awkward for Black because of his weakness down the d-file and White's greater command of territory) S e4 d6 6 iLf4 followed by O-O-O, when the pawn on d6 has to be tended to. Instead of 3 ... exd4, 3 ... dS! may be best. Per- haps you remember the line 1 d4 dS 2 c4 c6 3 l2Jc3 eS from Volume 2, the so-called Winawer Counter-Gambit (and also mentioned on page 17 of this volume). By strange means, we've transposed to it! I believe that White gets some advantage here; theory also leans that way, but isn't definite on the point. Finally, the most obvious move after 2 l2Jc3 c6 is 3 l2Jf3. There follows 3 ... d6 (the alterna- tives are uninspiring) 4 d4, when Black does best to go for a type of Old Indian Defence by 4 ... l2Jd7 S e4 l2Jgf6. That position is of course playable, but White is generally thought to stand better with his space advantage. c) 2 ... g6 runs into a similar problem: 3 d4! exd4?! (3 ... d6 4l2Jf3l2Jd7, but again, not every- one wants to playa set-up with so little space) 4 'ii'xd4 'ii'f6 (best, in view of 4 ... l2Jf6?? S iLgS and l2JdS, winning) S 'iWe3+! (D) (this may be the best of many moves that have been played here).

S ... 'iWe6 (S .. :iVe7 6l2JdS transposes; after any other move, 6 l2JdS is too strong, the best try being S ... 'iti'd8!? 6 l2JdS 'ii'g7 7 iLd2! l2Je7 8 iLc3l2JxdS 9 cxdS f6 10 'ii'd4 i.e7 11 e4, etc.) 6 l2JdS 'ii'xe3 (but 6 ... l2Ja6 7 ~d4 f6 8 l2Jf3 c6 9 l2Jf4 is very pleasant for White) 7 iLxe3l2Ja6 8 iLd4! f6 9 O-O-O 'iti'f7 10 l2Jf3 c6 11 l2Jf4 with a clear advantage for White. Now let's move on to some more important answers to 2l2Jc3. Advancing the f-Pawn

1 c4 e5 2l2Jc3 f5 (D)

w In many variations that stem from 1...eS, Black can contest the centre and grab space with the move ... fS. Generally, Black would like to maintain his e- and f-pawns on the 4th rank for a while, building up with moves like ... l2Jf6, ... d6, and perhaps ... g6, ... i.g7 with ... l2Jc6 or ... c6; we'll see that in several lines. The immediate 2 ... fS has been played by some strong players, but it requires that Black shift strategies if White makes a direct challenge. 3d4! This seems to lose a tempo after 3 ... exd4 and ... l2Jc6, but note that Black's .. .fS is a non- developing move. In addition, advancing the f- pawn creates weaknesses, with the result that Black's control of e4 comes at the cost of a cer- tain looseness. Compare 2 ... d6 3 d4!? exd4 4 'ii'xd4 l2Jc6 below.

3 e3 followed by d4 is less pointed but reason-

ably effective. This may afford White a small advantage (although that's not clear), simply because Black has to respond to d4-dS. The

After 3 d4, we'll look at two game excerpts expressing different philosophies by Black: w Duczynski - R. Novak Czech Team Ch 1995 3 ... e4 (D) This is a standard pawn-structure, but nor- mally Black's e-pawn advance either comes with tempo (attacking a knight on f3) or when White's c1-bishop is shut in by a pawn on e3. Here White has a number of good moves (such as 4 ttJh3), two of which directly exploit Black's slightly overextended pawn-structure. 4g4!? White plays the most radical (and fun) move, undermining Black's structure immediately. 4 f3 is also promising, because 4 ... exf3 surrenders the centre; White can choose between 5 ttJxf3 and 5 exf3, having in mind i.d3, ttJge2, etc. Nor does 4 ... ttJf6 5 i.g5! look desirable for Black. Maybe 4 ... i.b4 is best, when 5 ttJh3! introduces the idea of i.g5, as well as planning ttJf4. 4 ... fxg4 Upon 4 ... g6 5 gxf5 gxf5 6 ttJh3!, f4 becomes a pure outpost for occupation by White's knight or other pieces; he is better developed and can easily exploit the g-file and Black's weak king- side squares. 5 i.g2 ttJf6 6 i.g5! i.e77 e3 d6 (D) w 8 h3! gxh3 8 ... g3, preventing the opening of the h-file, is often the way to cut down White's attack in such positions. Here, however, after 9 fxg3, Black's e-pawn won't last long and he'll end up with no compensation. 9 ttJxh3 Even 9 i.xh3 i.xh3 10 ttJxh3 would be good. The point of White's pawn sacrifice is to take over the light squares, with a few important side benefits such as accelerated development and the open h-file. 9 ... c610 ttJf4 (D)

32 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

White has a winning advantage. Black can hardly defend against 'iVh5+, whereas White also has ideas such as tDg6, tDe6, d5, etc. The W idea of the h3 sacrifice is one that recurs in vari- 0us environments, notably in the Dutch De- fence. Banas - Westerinen Gausdal1988 3 .•• exd4 4 'iVxd4 tDc6 Instead of 3 ... e4, Black more often tries to gain time by this means. 5 'iVe3+ (D) Among several options, this check is the most awkward for Black to meet, because it doesn't accede to a pure loss of tempo and de- lays his desired development by ... tDf6.

5 .. .'~f7!? Black's king sidesteps; this is the standard solution to his problems, logically hoping for ... tDf6, ... .Bb4 and ... %:reS with rapid develop- ment and counterattack. Instead, 5 ... .Be7?! 6 tDd5 leaves Black tied up, when White has tDf3/tDh3 and .Bd2-c3 as plausible follow- ups. Furthermore, 5 ... tDce7?! is strongly met by 6 tDf3 tDf6 7 "iVd3; White intends .Bg5 and

O-O-O.

But 5. . :Wfe7 is playable, and only mildly in White's favour after 6 tDd5 (6 ~g3!? tDf6!) 6 ... 'iVxe3 7 .Bxe3 .Bb4+! S .Bd2 (S 'it>dl .Bd6! has done all right in a few games) S. .. .Bxd2+ 9 ~xd2 'it>dS (D). This position is noteworthy: the pawn-struc- tures are mirror images of each other, both sides have one knight out, and both kings have moved! Black's bad bishop, restricted by the pawn on f5, is analogous to White's on fl, blocked by c4. Of course, White's knight is already on d5, whereas Black will have to work to get his on e4. Play might go 10 tDf3 tDge7 11 g3 d6 12 .Bg2. Here White can reorganize in various ways (for example, tDf4, %:rhdl and 'it>c3) and maintain some pressure. 6 tDh3! Naturally there are other moves.

1 c4 eS 2ltJc3 ~b4 (D)

It wasn't that long ago (relative to the history of the English Opening) that 2 ... ~b4 would w have been looked upon as a questionable if not downright weak way for Black to respond to 2 ltJc3. True, the move ... ~b4 is at least an option at some point in many main lines of the 1 c4 eS English, but not before a black knight is devel- oped, and not when the bishop can immedi- ately be attacked by ltJdS! But in the 1990s, the world's elite grandmasters began to play 2 ... ~b4 on a regular basis, such that it became one of the most popular variations of the Eng- lish Opening at the top ranks. Today 2 ... ~b4 is alive and well among grandmasters, and is a line that has to be coped with by most 1 c4 players (those who play 1 c4 eS 2 g3 notably excepted). Clearly, one of Black's plans is to play ... ~xc3, doubling White's pawns. This idea is seen in future chapters after 2 ... ltJf6; for in- stance, 3 g3 .i.b4 or 3 ltJf3 ltJc6 4 g3 (or 4 e3 .i.b4) 4 ... iLb4. Why is Black bypassing 2 ... ltJf6? In a word: flexibility. With a knight on f6, Black can't expand on the kingside by ... fS. Nor can he follow the often-desirable move ... e4 with ... fS, supporting the advanced pawn. Black might want to place the knight on e7, and there are other considerations. For example, in cases where White plays ltJdS and Black responds with ... c6, the advanced knight doesn't have the option of ltJxf6 and will often have to retreat. Looking on the bright side for White, 2 ... ~b4 is a committal move that gives him the opportu- nity to set up pawn-structures that he normally won't be able to. Furthermore, while the obvi- ous 3 ltJdS may eventually lose time, for the moment it attacks the bishop and paves the way for an early d4. A study of 2 ltJc3 iLb4 is extremely useful for the practical player. It can lead to positions

34 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

whose basic pawn-structures and themes are not only the same as in many other English Opening variations, but also very close to what we find in the Nimzo-Indian, Bogo-Indian, and even the King's Indian! Let's look at a series of games to get a feel for what can happen in this rich variation, and as a consequence, what can happen in the main lines of the 1 c4 e5 English. Before investigat- ing the main line with 3 lLld5, we'll look at games with a couple of moderately out-of- favour (although sound) moves, in order to clarify what the main issues are. I should mention that the natural 3 g3 will often transpose to other lines. For instance, 3 ... lLlf6 is the main-line variation 2lLlc3lLlf6 3 g3 iLb4, which is an attractive choice; see Chap- ter 4. Black can also go his own way; for exam- ple, 3 ... iLxc3 4 bxc3 d6 5 iLg2 f5!? when in Hodgson-Psakhis, Metz 1994, White tried the exotic 6 c5!? dxc5 (6 ... d5! seems safe enough, and Bf7lLlf3, 7 ... lLlc6) 7 iLa3lWd6 8 d4! exd4 9 cxd4 lWxd4 10 'iVc1 ! (D).

Here White had a powerful bishop-pair, open lines, and a big lead in development for his two pawns. The c-pawn isn't really defensi- ble in view of 1O ... lLld7 11 iLb2 'iYg4 12 iLf3 lWg6 13 lLlh3! threatening lLlf4. Lau - Mainka Budapest 1990

1 c4 e5 2lLlc3 iLb4 3 e3!? (D)

3 ••• iLxc3! 4 bxc3 Which way to recapture is always a major decision. We'll run across this repeatedly in this

book, so it's worth setting the stage now. Re- capturing towards the centre by 4 bxc3 gives White a valuable extra centre pawn, a factor which should never be underestimated. Never- theless, the resulting pawn-structure has its own drawbacks, especially if Black can exploit the light squares (for example, by ... e4, controlling d3). It's also a bit difficult for White to get his bishops out to productive squares because the centre is congested. The alternative recapture 4 dxc3 has its own pluses and minuses. Again, getting White's bishops out is a key consideration, and the c1- bishop will be served best if White can achieve the e4 advance. Black will generally try to pre- vent this and cramp White's game by 4 ... lLlf6

w Now there can arise varied and instructive situations: a) 5 'iVc2, to cover e4, can be answered nor- mally by 5 ... d6 or aggressively by 5 ... e4; com- pare White's other 5th moves. In fact, 5 ... d5!?

INTRODUCTION TO 2 !Dc3: BLACK PLAYS FLEXIBLY 35

6 cxdS 'iVxdS is also unclear (bishops versus space). b) S i.d3!? e4 6 i.c2 d6 (D). Black's cramping pawn counteracts White's bishop-pair, so White will try to undermine it. Typical play would be 7 ttJe2 O-O 8 ttJg3 flie7. Now White can only free himself by f3, but then there are new weaknesses which compensate Black for White's bishops: 9 f3! exf3 10 'i!Vxf3 ttJc6 11 O-O ttJeS 12 'iVf4 i.d7 and Black's eS outpost makes his position too solid to break down directly, whereas White has some weak squares on the e-file. Probably White should combine e4 and ttJfS, when ... i.xfS levels things. c) Maybe White should insist upon S e4, when Black could simply play S ... d6 or S. .. O-O, leading to a standard type of position in which White's lost tempo of e3-e4 helps Black con- solidate, with an interesting game ahead. Al- ternatively, Black can choose to liquidate by S. .. ttJxe4!? 6 'i!VdS! ttJf6 (6 ... ttJgS!? 7 'i!VxeS+ ttJe6) 7 'ii'xeS+ 'ii'e7 8 'ii'xe7+ <J;xe7. This pro- duces a position in which White's bishops in the open field are a force, all the more so if an endgame arises. In positions with bishops ver- sus knights, the side with the knights should generally try to create outposts for them by means of pawn-breaks, which is not possible here. And although White's pawn-structure is not ideal, it takes a little experience to under- stand that it meshes reasonably well with the bishops. This structure comes up in other open- ings, most famously on the black side of the Ruy Lopez. Having said all that, White's ad- vantage is a limited one. Let's return to the game with 4 bxc3 (D):

4 ... d6 4 ... ttJf6 S d4 (S d3 e4!? 6 dxe4 d6 7 i.d3 O-O leaves White a pawn up, but his c-pawns are weak) S. .. e4!?

Black can try to take the initiative immedi- ately by 6 ... dS. White best responds with 7 cxdS, opening a path for his king' s bishop (oth- erwise, ... d4 will disturb his development still further). Then we have an important type of po- sition closely resembling a Sicilian Defence in reverse, but where White has two bishops and Black an extra knight. Both recaptures have their own justification: a) 7 ... lbxdS 8 "iic2 (D) is a TaimanovlKan Sicilian without Black's f8-bishop and White's bl-knight.

That is, the Sicilian Defence line goes 1 e4 cS 2lbf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4lbxd4 a6 Slbc3 "fiIc7. In the English Opening position, whom does this trade-off favour? It's a difficult question, because White has the bishop-pair and Black is able to castle very quickly. Notice that the f8- bishop would be Black's 'bad' bishop, which would tend to get stuck on the passive square e7, or be blocked by the e-pawn on f6 or d6. For White's part, he has a central pawn-majority, and the usual fortification versus attack that the TaimanovlPaulsen variations afford (Black's knights are limited by the pawns on e3 and a3). He can also launch his minority attack (b4) quickly without a knight on the queenside get- ting in the way. You could play either side of this unique position. b) Katrein-Sherzer, Philadelphia 1990 went 7 .. :~xdS!? 8 b4 (White expands and inciden- tally prevents ... lbaS-b3) 8 ... O-O 9 ..tb2 .l:Ie8!

A logical game with clear-cut posi- tional themes. Now let's return to the most popular move after 1 c4 e5 2 ttJc3 ~b4, namely: 3 ttJd5 (D) This has the obvious point of attacking the bishop to gain a tempo.

Our main games will involve the moves 3 ... ~c5 and 3 ... ~e7. Black has several alterna- tives, a few of which are perfectly playable; for example: a) The English Opening can support some strange ideas; for example, 3 ... ttJa6!? (retaining the idea of ... c6) 4 a3 (4 ttJxb4 ttJxb4 5 a3 ttJc6 is one of those many positions in which White's two bishops are neutralized by Black's quicker development, with a likely ... ttJf6 and ... d5 to come) 4 ... ~aS!? 5 b4 c6 6 ttJc3! ~c7 7 d4!. R. Cook-H. Williamson, correspondence game

advantage by 7 ... ttJe7, since 7 ... d5?! 8 cxd5 cxd5 9 dxe5 ~xe5 10 ~b2 followed by ttJf3 and e3 (or even e4) leaves him with a bad isolated pawn. b) 3 ... ~a5 is in disrepute at the moment, al- though I'm not sure that it can't be reinvigo- rated. At any rate, the established games seem to show how the two bishops can outweigh other factors if they're just given a little time; for example, 4 b4 c6 5 bxaS cxd5 6 cxd5 'iYxaS

7 e4 (7 'i!Bb3 has also had success, supporting

.i.a3 and in some cases planning ~g3) 7 ... ttJf6 8 i..d3!?

Then White enjoys a standard advantage with two bishops and space. Although Black has a fine outpost on c5 which should not be dis- counted, he can't easily coordinate to play ... ttJfd7 in the near future. Meanwhile, White can put great pressure on the queenside by ttJc3, ~fbl and in some cases a5. In addition, he has better prospects in the centre and can even expand on the kingside at some point should it come to that, in order to open a second front. Poldauf - Kasimdzhanov European Clubs Cup, Rethymnon 2003

1 c4 e5 2 ttJc3 ~b4 3 ttJd5 i..c5 (D)

No mystery here: Black puts his bishop on a natural square and prepares ... c6. 4 ttJf3 The obvious 4 b4leads to a variety of unique positions; for example, 4 ... i..d4 (4 ... .i.f8!? is also played - the third move with the bishop and it's back home!

The primary alternative is 4 ... c6 slbc3; for example, S. . :f1e7, when White should strike in the centre by either

Similarly in- triguing structural issues arise from S d4..ltf8!? 6 lbd2 c6 7 lbc3 dS 8 e3 (D) with a kind of re- versed French Defence, a combination of the Tarrasch and Advance Variations!

By comparison with the Advance French, White is well ahead on time, but the knight on d2 isn't as effective as one posted on f4 (by way of e2 or h3), as happens in that line. Also, Black's knight on b8 is arguably better-placed than it would be on d7 (as is the case in the Tarrasch French). So White will probably exert pressure the centre by means of f3, with unclear consequences. 5 ••• e3!? (D) This exotic interference move looks like the best one! Instead, S. .

1 c4 eS 2 lbc3 .lib4 3 lbdS .lie7 ( D)

Here Black takes a modem approach to the position, voluntarily giving up the bishop-pair without apparent compensation! But on closer examination, we find a concrete explanation. Let's assume that White captures the bishop, as he normally will on one of the next few moves. This means that three moves of the knight have been consumed to capture a bishop that has moved twice. And if Black recaptures with his queen, he is another piece ahead in develop- ment - notice that it is practically unassailable on e7, so the problems associated with getting a queen out too early don't apply here. More im- portantly, White has no easy way to get his kingside pieces out without subjecting them to attack (lbf3 is met by ... e4), so he can quickly get a cramped position. Black, on the other hand, is just two moves away from castling, and can play for ... d5. Of course, we needn't feel sorry for White, either. After all, many a master has made a liv- ing off using the bishop-pair. Notice too that, as yet, Black has no outposts for his knights. The trade-offs are similar to some lines of the Bogo-Indian and the Nimzo-Indian, in which Black gets ahead in development but White gains the bishop-pair without conceding any

If he wants to prevent d5, Black can play 8 ... exd4 9 'iVxd4 (9 i.xd4 f5 with ... tLlc6 to fol- low) 9 ... tLlc6, trying to bring about dynamic complications. Then White's best move is 10 'iVc3 (D).

w Black can also work up counterplay by at- tacking the front of the pawn-chain with 9 ... c6, a common idea in this pawn-structure. By soft- ening up White's centre and opening up some lines, Black both discourages O-O-O and gains new opportunities; for example, 10 ~d2 (one idea after 10 ttJe2 cxdS 11 cxdS!? is l1...fS 12 exfS .i.xfS 13 g4 e4 14 gxfS exf3 IS 'iVd4 :e8) 1O ... cxdS 11 cxdS (11 'iVxdS ttJc6! 12 O-O-O .Be6! intends 13 'iVxd6?

As far as the opening is concerned, I don't see why Black shouldn't be happy with either 7 ... exd4 or 7 ... ttJhS (if only because of 8 .i.e3 exd4), both promising a balanced game. On the other hand, White has a spatial edge and excel- lent long-term prospects if he can control the position. This variation is concrete and tactical enough that variation-specific preparation is strongly recommended. The Ultra-Flexible 2 ... d6: Introduction

1 c4 eS 2 ttJc3 d6 (D)

w This modest move is very popular with expe- rienced players because it is so adaptable. That is, Black doesn't commit a knight and can still opt for systems with fundamentally different pawn-structures. For one thing, he can choose between ... ttJc6 and a move of the c-pawn ( ... c6 or ... cS). Similarly, he can set up with ... fS and ... ttJf6, or ... fS and ... ttJe7, or ... ttJf6 alone, or else ... ttJe7 alone. Those choices can be mixed with ... .i.e7 or a fianchetto ( ... g6 and ... .i.g7),

46 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

and so forth. In general, Black can switch strate- gies in response to White's own piece deploy- ments, rather than embark upon a single-minded course. Thus 2 ... d6 is a typically modem approach to the opening phase of the game. It limits White's ability to impose his choice of set-ups upon the position. On the other hand, 2 ... d6 has the obvious disadvantage of blocking in Black's bishop. Furthermore, since any such noncom- mittal move by Black also increases White's options, White can continuously adapt to his opponent's strategies. To begin with, White's main choices are 3 d4, 3 12Jf3 and 3 g3. I'll concentrate upon particularly distinctive lines arising from the first two moves, since so many continuations after 3 g3 (D) either trans- pose or closely resemble other systems in this book.

For example, 3 ... l2Jc6 4 i.g2 g6 Sl2Jf3 i.g7 is a Closed English (Chapter 6), and 3 ... l2Jf6 4 i.g2 (4 d4 exd4 S ~xd412Jc6 is a version of the main line 3 d4 below) 4 ... g6 S 12Jf3 (or S e4) leads to King's Indian variations that we'll be examining in Chapter 12. The fairly popular 3 ... fS either transposes to another variation or produces a type of ... fS po- sition to which I'm devoting plenty of space elsewhere. But I should mention that 3 ... fS can be met by the challenging 4 d4, when Black has various options; for example, 4 ... e4 (4 ... i.e7!? makes sense, challenging White to enter into the ending after S dxeS dxeS 6 ~xd8+ i.xd8; this is fascinating and hardly explored - proba- bly 7 e4!? is critical) S f3 12Jf6 (sometimes S. .. exf3 is played, followed by ... l2Jf6 and per- haps ... g6; that may be preferable) 6 i.g2 (6 fxe4!?) 6 ... exf3 712Jxf3. In this position, White has broken down Black's centre and probably holds some advantage in spite of his own weak- nesses on the e-file. Many other unique lines are possible after 3 g3; for example, 3 ... i.e6 4 i.g2 (or412Jf3, with the idea 4 ... i.xc4 S ~a4+ or 4 ... c6 S d4!) 4 ... c6 (4 ... l2Jc6 is a line from the Closed English in Chapter 6) S d3 (S b3 allows S ... dS!) S ... l2Jf6 6 12Jf3 i.e7 7 O-O O-O 8 b3, thinking about d4 and/or e4. Not surprisingly, there are many other ways for the players to come to an agreement upon a mutually acceptable position. Active Lines with 3 d4

3 d4 exd4 4 ~xd4 (D)

This is a very ambitious variation, and at the same time a risky one. White's basic idea is al- ways to control dS, thus preventing Black's freeing move ... dS. His command of the d-file should help him in that regard. White also de- velops a piece; that may seem a bit trivial, since Black can attack the queen by ... l2Jc6, but the net effect varies from case to case. In fact, we have already seen several exam- ples of playing d4, and after ... exd4, recaptur- ing by ~xd4. Let's compare some positions arising in the first few moves by using this framework of advantages and disadvantages: a) An example in which White gets the best of both worlds is 1 c4 eS 2 12Jc3 c6 3 d4 exd4 4 ~xd4 (incidentally preventing ... dS). Even then,

INTRODUCTION TO 2 tiJc3: BLACK PLAYS FLEXIBLY 47

the queen may eventually be exposed to attack, but not before it has had time to arrange an opti- mal escape. b) 1 c4 e5 2 d4?! exd4 3 'ilVxd4?! liJc6 was examined in Chapter 2. After White's queen re- treats and Black's next move (normally ... liJf6), Black will already have two minor pieces out, and in addition, ... d5 will be easy to enforce. c) In this chapter, we saw 1 c4 e5 2liJc3 f5 3 d4 exd4 4 'ili'xd4 liJc6. There .. .f5 is a non- developing move which even creates the poten- tial for certain weaknesses (e6, for example), so it looks as though White has the better of the bargain. Indeed, we looked at 5 ~e3+, which is promising, although hardly decisive, for White. At least the move ... f5 controls e4 and adds force to the idea of ... liJf6-e4. Let's return to our main position after 2liJc3 d6 3 d4 exd4 4 'ili'xd4. Here the situation isn't so one-sided. Black gains a tempo with 4 ... liJc6, but the move 2 ... d6 is not entirely positive for him, since it restricts the f8-bishop and effec- tively concedes control of the vital d5-square for the time being. On the other hand ... d6 opens a line for the c8-bishop and directly con- trols a central square (e5). Thus Black gains a modest edge in development, which can quickly grow as White tries to get his pieces out. In the end, White control of territory (in particular his control of d5 along an open file) competes with Black's activity (stemming from his develop- ment), and that's why so many grandmasters have chosen to play this variation from one side or the other. Let's turn to games: Ruban - Miles Belgrade 1988

1 c4 e5 2liJc3 d6 3 d4 exd4 4 ~xd4liJf6 (D)

As opposed to 4 ... liJc6, with the obvious gain oftempo, 4 ... liJf6!? has a more subtle idea: to leave the queen on d4, subject to later attack on the long diagonal following ... g6 and ... i..g7, all the while keeping open the options of ... c6 and ... liJbd7. 5b3

5 e4 is a reasonable option, with the idea

5 ... g6 (5 ... liJc6) 6 f3 i..g7 7 i..e3!? followed by ~d2 with a unique set-up. The best-known al- ternative is 5 g3. Then 5 ... g6?! 6 i..g2 (6 ~e3+ w 'iUe7!?) 6 ... i..g7 7 'ilVe3+ is a bit awkward to meet, as in Kasparov-Short, Barcelona 1989; nevertheless, 5 ... liJc6 6 'iUd2 i..e6 is one of Black's more comfortable versions of the main line, that is, 4 ... liJc6 5 'iUd2liJf6 6 g3 i..e6 be- low. 5 ••• g6 (D) w 6i..b2 After 6liJd5 i..g7 7 i..g5 liJbd7 8 'iUe3+ ~f8 (or the transposition 6 i..g5 i..g7 7liJd5liJbd7 8 'iUe3+ ~f8), Black is left ahead in development and ready to play ... c6, and/or castle by hand with ... h6 followed by ... ~g8-h7.

(D) You could do worse than to study such posi- tions in order to broaden your command of pawn-structures. Notice that the absence of light-squared bishops distinguishes this position from some other English Opening variations, as well as from the Maroczy Bind variation of the Sicilian Defence. Superficially, one might think that the trade of bishops would favour White. In formal terms, after all, it is his 'bad' bishop that is exchanged. The question in such positions, however, is whether Black can sum- mon up the piece activity to counter White's significant long-term advantage. This often in- volves attacking light squares that can no lon- ger be guarded by White's bishop. Here those squares include h3, d3, f3 and often, depending upon specifics, b3. For example, a common outcome of the advance ... as-a4 would be the capture of a pawn on b3 ( ... axb3), which might be followed with ... lbfd7-cS, hitting d3 and b3. Finally, the moves ... fS, ... bS and ... dS can be said to attack the most important light squares of all. This all sounds very nice, but if Black isn't able to succeed in creating outposts and/or weaknesses at a fairly early stage, White can slowly drive back Black's pieces, advance his pawns, and stearnroll Black without much ef- fort. The move lS ... c6 fulfils the needs of the position as described. Given even one extra move here, White could probably consolidate. Thus Black concedes a weakness on d6 in re- turn for activity. He can create threats with his queen from as or b6, and simultaneously cause White to worry about ... dS, the ultimate line- opening move. Whether this works is a matter of timing and the skill of the respective players. Incidentally, some people think that the side with more space should avoid exchanges, but

50 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

that is a poor rule at best. Here White would love to trade a few minor pieces and then utilize his space advantage. w 16l:tfe1 16 l:tad1 ~b6 17 'iYc2 axb3 18 axb3 also holds together, since 18 ... ltJfd7 19 ltJa4 keeps Black's knight from settling in on c5. That is probably about equal.

w We have reached a sort of main line. Great players have been willing to take both sides of this position.

9 Ji.g2

In Korchnoi-Spassky, Lugano 1982, White played the immediate 9 ttJh3. This knight heads for f4, to control d5 (the advantage of this move-order over 9 Ji.g2 and 10 ttJh3 will be seen below). For all the indignities that we have seen White suffer in this 3 d4 line above, this kind of bind may be his reward. The knight will come to f4, watching over d5, followed by Ji.g2, and Black's piece-play alone looks insuf- ficient to stir up tactical trouble. Furthermore, if Black plays aimlessly, White will be able to steadily increase his advantage and dominate the play. The game continued 9 ... ne8?! 10 ttJf4 Ji.g4

11 Ji.g2 ttJe5 (according to Korchnoi, 11...g5!

Black is seriously cramped, so he tries to break White's grip on the centre: 14 ... a6 15 ttJcd5 ttJxd5 (Black's plan of 15 ... b5 runs into trouble after 16 ttJxf6+ Ji.xf6 17 c5!) 16 ttJxd5 Ji.e6 (16 ... b5? is still a mistake following 17 c5! dxc5 18 f4) 17 ~c2 c6 18 ttJf4. White has won the opening; he has more space and a weak d- pawn to target. Black should look for something else here; for example, 9 ... a6!

In contrast to 3 d4 exd4 4 ~xd4, which sacri- fices development for the sake of central con- trol, 3 ttJf3 gets a piece out and shares the centre. In our main line, no pawns are ex- changed, so the resulting play tends to be more positional in nature. 3 ... f5 This is one of the better places for Black to advance his f-pawn, because the knight on f3

58 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

allows him to play ... e4 with tempo should his centre be challenged. 3 ... f5 is the move that most uniquely exploits the flexible nature of 2 ... d6. Other logical-looking moves have their own quirks: a) 3 ... lDc6 4 g3 is the Closed English of Chapter 5, but Black has given White the op- portunity for 4 d4!. Assuming that the move 2 ... lDc6 was otherwise acceptable to him, that was a better route to get to the desired posi- tion. b) Likewise, 3 ... g6 4 d4 is a shaky way to arrive at ... g6/ ... iLg7 systems, especially be- cause White gets the advantage after 4 ... iLg7?! (4 ... lDd7) 5 dxe5 dxe5 6 ~xdS+ ~xdS 7 e4!. This cedes the d4-square to Black, but after 7 ... lDc6 S iLg5+ f6 9 O-O-O+ iLd7 10 iLe3, there's no way to take advantage of it, and White has the direct idea of c5 with iLc4 and doubling on the d-file. Of course, other plans are available depending upon Black's response. c) White is supposed to have the advantage after 3 ... lDf6 4 d4 e4 5 lDg5 iLf5 (D). w But that assessment can be disputed; for ex- ample: cl) 6 '(Rc2 h6! 7 lDgxe4lDxe4 SlDxe4 'ili'h4, as in Boleslavsky-Bronstein, Candidates tourna- ment, Budapest 1950, has generally been evalu- ated as better for Black. However, 9 '(Ra4+ (9 lDxd6+ iLxd6 10 'ili'xf5 iLb4+ 11 ~dl 'ili'xd4+

12 Rc2 is hardly clear!) 9 ... iLd7 (9 ... lDc6 10

lDg3) 10 ~c2 iLf5 11 'iVa4+ seems to draw, in view of 11 ... iLd7 12 'iVc2 iLf5, etc. Still, a draw stemming from Black's 6th move isn't much of an achievement for White, and his only alterna- tive, 9lDxd6+, is risky. c2) 6 g4 (D) is the preferred way to win the centre without the weakening f3.

Theory likes White after this move, yet it seems to produce a game with chances for both sides. Now White's goal is to take over the cen- tre; for example, 6 ... lDxg4?! 7lDgxe4 c6?! S h3 lDf6 9 lDxf6+ 'iVxf6 10 e4, Komarov-Rom- anishin, St Vincent 2000. Black should prefer 6 ... iLxg4 7 iLg2 lDc6 S lDgxe4 lDxe4 9 lDxe4 (instead of9 iLxe4 ~d7!? and ... O-O-O) 9 ... iLe7 10 lDg3, and here simply 10 ... O-O looks per- fectly playable, since White's centre is immo- bile. For example, 11 iLe3 iLg5! or 11 ~d3 J::!.eS 12 e4? d5! with the idea 13 cxd5 ~xd5! 14 exd5?? iLb4++. You get the impression that the received wisdom about some of these minor lines isn't fully trustworthy.

4 d4 e4 (D)

We reach a very common position in high- level chess, indicating both players' willingness to mix it up. If Black is satisfied with his play here, and likes the lines following 3 d4 exd4, he will have a repertoire based upon 2 ... d6 that

INTRODUCTION TO 2 lDc3: BLACK PLAYS FLEXIBLY 59

w doesn't sacrifice the opportunity for dynamic play. On the other hand, if White can gain a safe edge in this position, it gives him a way to by- pass the complexities of 3 d4 and 3 g3. By playing 4 ... e4, Black wants to force the white knight to an awkward square and main- tain a space advantage, whereas White hopes that Black is overextended. Typically White will try to undermine the e4 point or advance on the queenside. He has several reasonable moves, and I think it's fair to say that all of them lead to complex play with plenty of life. Let's briefly examine two of these responses to 4 ... e4 before turning to games. a) 5lbd2 (D) is sound, but passive.

There can follow 5 ... lbf6 6 e3, and Black can equalize with the standard plan of 6 ... c6 intend- ing .. .tba6-c7. He can then develop normally by ... J..e7 and ... O-O, or in some cases ... d5 and ... J..d6 might follow. Also played are 6 ... g6 7 J..e2 i.g7 and 6 ... c5!?, to put pressure on the d4-pawn and try to induce it to go to d5. b) A deceptively ambitious move is 5 lbgl !?

White has ideas of imitating a French De- fence with colours reversed by playing e3, and this provides opportunities for both sides; for example: bI) 5 ... c6 6 lbh3 and now 6 ... d5?! 7 cxd5 cxd5 8 'iHb3 (or 8 J..g5) 8 ... lbc6! 9 e3 lbf6 10 J..d2!, intending lbf4, favours White. Naturally,. Black won't be inclined to go along with this, and can play 6 ... J..e7! (versus 7 J..g5) 7 lbf4 lbf6 8 e3 O-O, perhaps with ... lba6-c7 in mind. A variant on this is the immediate 6 ... lba6 7 e3 (7 J..g5!? is interesting) 7 ... lbf6 8 lbf4lbc7 9 d5! J..e7 10 b3!? 0-011 J..b2 J..d7 12 J..e2 g5! with unclear play. Both sides can be confident of getting their share of the action in such posi- tions. b2) Black probably wants to avoid 5 ... lbf6 6 J..g5!, when White's side is easier to play; for example, 6 ... J..e7 7 e3 O-O 8lbh3 c6 9 lbf4 lba6

10 J..e2 (D).

60 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

This is pretty much the ideal set-up for White in terms of piece coordination and availability of pawn attacks on all parts ofthe board (b4-bS, dS, f3 and even h4-hS). He may not have a forced advantage, but the position is promising. One game went 1O .. .'~Jc7 11 ~3 h6?! (ll...lIb8 120-0 i.e6! 13 f3 exf3 14lIxf3! is slightly in White's favour) 12 i.xf6 i.xf6 13 liJg6 ~e8, Shvedchikov-Iashvili, Moscow 1999, and here

14 O-O makes it difficult for Black to unwind.

1 c4 e5 2liJc3 d6 3liJf3 f5 4 d4 e4 5 i.g5!?

By contrast with other lines in which he plays e3, White gets his bishop in front of the pawn-chain first. The drawback is that it helps Black develop quickly: 5 ... i.e7 S. .. liJf6 is also possible, when after 6 liJd2 i.e7 7 e3 O-O the set-up with ... c6 and ... liJa6-c7 has equalized. However, 6liJgl is more attrac- tive - compare SliJgl in the previous game. 6 i.xe7 'Wixe7 (D) w 7liJd2 With 7liJglliJf6 8 e3, White wants to playa sort of French Defence without his bad bishop. Black needn't cooperate by playing an immedi- ate ... dS, since he also has 8 ... O-O 9liJh3 c6 10 i.e2liJa6 11 'iVc2liJc7, Uliashev-Lukin, St Pe- tersburg 1992. Then ... dS or ... i.e6 and .. J:tb8 can follow, with a strong centre. For his part, White can go for queenside action via b4-bS. 7 ... liJf6 8 e3 O-O 9 i.e2 c5!? Black would like to provoke White into play- ing dS, which would give his own knight a fine square on eS and introduce the prospect of at- tack by ... f4. 10 liJb3 i.e6 11 O-O i.f7 This is useful in preventing f3, since the e- pawn will hang after ... exf3. 12lIc1liJa6!? 13 'iVd2 (D)

White prepares lIfd 1 to exert a little pressure down the d-file. He also renews the idea of f3, although it's not always clear whom that fa- vours.

13. .. l:lad8 14liJal!? (D)

A clever idea. White wants to free his b- pawn for defence (by b3) or attack (by b4); and even more so, he would like to play liJc2 and B. The main alternative is 14 BlIde8, and now IS f4! prepares liJdS and could give White the faster attack, especially since the natural plan of ...

Illescas- Hodgson, Spanish Team Ch 1993 continued 7 ... ttJf6 (7 ... iLg7 8 h4 g4 9 e3 ttJd7 10 ttJge2 h5 11 ttJf4 gave White the desired advantage in Portisch-Seirawan, Mar del Plata 1982; of course, the game is only beginning) 8 h4l:tg8?! 9 hxg5 hxg5 10 ttJh3 g4 11 ttJf4 c6 12 e3 ttJa6 13 iLd2 ttJc7 14 'i!kb3 "fIe7 15 O-O-O l:tb8 16 iLe2 iLd7 17 f3!, and Black's king was stuck in the middle. 6 ttJh3 This is the main move, but perhaps more at- tention should be given to 6 h4!? (D).

The idea is to anchor the knight on f4 after ttJh3-f4. 6 h4 is sound because of the pseudo- tactical point that 6 ... h6 7 ttJh3 iLxh4 is risky in view of 8 ttJf4 (or 8 e3) 8 ... iLg5!? 9 ttJg6l:th7 10 c5!? with the idea iLc4. Then Black should steer clear of 1O ... d5? 11 ttJxd5! ~xd5 12 iLxg5. After 6 h4!?, moreover, the thematic 6 ... c6 can be met by the developing move 7 iLf4, while 7 d5!? is also playable. That brings us to 6 ... ttJf6 7 e3, when the complicated position af- ter 7 ... O-O 8 iLe2 c6 9 d5!? (9 ttJh3 ttJg4 10 h5!? is quite unclear) 9 ... ttJa6 has been tested a few times and seems about equal. Maybe White should consider the simple 7 iLf4, when a com- plex battle could result from 7 ... ttJh5 8 e3!? g6; e.g., 9 ttJh3 with the idea 9 ... iLxh4 10 iLh6, or even 9 iLh2 h6!? 10 ttJh3 iLxh4 11 iLe2 fol- lowed by ttJf4. There is certainly plenty to try out here! 6 ••• c67 e3 ttJf6 8 ttJf4 ttJa6 (D) w This position has arisen in many games, and contains the same ideas that we've seen in the notes. White has several possible plans, includ- ing d5 (to grab space and control e6), f3 (to break up the front of the pawn-chain), and b4- b5. Black would like to play moves like ... d5 and ... g5, but can take his time with ... O-O, ... ttJc7 and ... 'it>h8. If White then plays d5, Black will often simply capture on that square and train his forces upon the pawn there, which is effectively isolated. 9h4 Played in the clear majority of games. White assumes that ... g5 will be strong at some point, so he may as well prevent it now.

B lack has achieved considerable pressure, while White has made no progress versus his opponent's centre.

The timing of this move is critical. White could also consider a more neutral approach such as 11 ~b3. l1 ... cxdS ll...ltJd7 with the idea ... ltJe5 is similar, but Black wants to clarify the central structure. 12 cxdSltJd7! (D) w Black takes advantage of the fact that White's d5 has given him the e5-square and activity along the al-h8 diagonal. Even White's pawn on h4 has become a problem, discouraging him from castling. 13 g3?! Now White's kingside pawns are static and f3 is weak. Also, after 13ltJe6? ltJxe6 14 dxe6 ltJe5 (or 14 ... ltJc5) he soon loses a pawn. Best is 13 h5!, although Black can be quite satisfied af- ter 13 ... ltJe5. 13 ... i.f614 ~f1 14 i.d2 i.e5!? 15 .l:tc1 ltJf6 was the stem game Ruban-Anand, Palma de Mallorca 1989; that makes it difficult for White to defend his d-pawn in the face of attacks on it by ...

Perhaps this rook would be better off on dl, watching over the d-pawn. After 19 .i:thc1, Black should probably play 19 ... 'iVe7, intending ... 'WIf7; for example, 20 ltJb5ltJcxd5!, based upon 21ltJxd5!? (21ltJxa7 i.c6!) 2l...ltJxd5 22 ~xd5?? i.e6. It looks as though this fascinating main line is wholly satisfactory for Black, and that White should investigate the rarely-played 6 h4. It's amazing how much active and refreshing chess can be generated from a simple move like 2 ... d6. Because of its flexibility, both players will combine to shape the nature of the contest, which can run the full gamut from highly tacti- cal to subtly positional. 4 2 ... ttJf6 and g3 Systems Introduction to 2 ... lDf6

1 c4 e5 2 liJc3 liJf6 (D)

w Having explored some other moves after 1 c4 e5 2liJc3, we'll tum our eyes to the traditional continuation 2 ... liJf6, which contests the key central squares d5 and e4. By this means Black continues his imitation of White's main Sicil- ian Defence set-up, that is, I e4 c5 2liJf3, and asks his opponent to commit to a formation. In this chapter, I'll examine systems with an early g3 and .ltg2, primarily 2 liJc3 liJf6 3 g3 (D), which has been central to the historical de- velopment of the English Opening.

When White plays 3 g3, he is doing what a clear majority of Sicilian players would do as Black. By this I mean that, when playing against most variations of the Sicilian Defence in which White omits the move d4, Sicilian devotees use ... g6 and ... .ltg7 as their default plan. After 1 e4 c5, for example, we see 2liJc3 liJc6 and now 3 g3 g6 or 3 f4 g6. Versus 2liJf3liJc6 3 .ltb5, the fianchetto by 3 ... g6 is also the most popular move. Thus it makes perfect sense to follow 1 c4 e5 2liJc3liJf6 with 3 g3. Here trade-offs be- tween time and information assume special im- portance, and we can learn a lot about both the English Opening and Sicilian Defence by com- paring and contrasting similar positions. It turns out that both 3 ... .ltb4 and 3 ... c6 take on a char- acter which might not be anticipated if one were only looking at them with the eyes of a Si- cilian Defence player. Much the same applies to White's other fian- chetto line I c4 e5 2 g3. This closely resembles a Hyper-Accelerated Dragon (1 e4 c5 2 liJf3 g6) with reversed colours; and again, Black's knowledge about White's intentions allows him to compensate for being a tempo behind. As usual, we'll get oriented by looking at a few rarely-played third moves for White. As we see in this game, they resemble White's 2nd moves in Chapter 2 and may even transpose. Van Wely - Kasparov Tilburg 1998

[diagram]
With this flexible move, White is aiming for some sort of reversed Sicilian Defence or French Defence position, preferably leading to rela- tively unexplored positions. Although hardly a dire threat to Black, 3 e3 is one of White's more interesting irregular choices; it also has the po- tential to be used as a transpositional tool. Alternatively, White can go for even more modest pawn moves. One of these, 3 d3, isn't 2 . ..tbj6 AND g3 SYSTEMS 65 very forceful, since it relinquishes the possibil- ity of d4 for the time being. I discussed and ana- lysed this in Chapter 2 under the move-order 1 B c4 e5 2 d3 ~f6 3 ~c3. Similarly, 3 a3 (D) is flexible, but too modest to give an advantage.

Black has several good answers, among them: a) 3 ... ~c6 4 b4 (4 ~f3 g6 is a pleasant vari- ation of the English Four Knights for Black - see Chapter 5) 4 ... g6 5 ~b2 ~g7 with equal- ity, since trying to disturb Black's development by 6 b5 ~d4 (or 6 ... ~e7 7 ~f3 d6) 7 e3 ~e6 doesn't achieve anything. b) 3 ... g6 is another good idea: 4 ~f3 ~c6, intending 5 b4?! e4! 6 ~g5 ~g7 7 J:1bl O-O! with the idea 8 ~gxe4 ~xe4 9 ~xe4 ~e8; we'll examine this in Chapter 5 under the order 2 ~c3 ~f6 3 ~f3 ~c6 4 a3 g6. c) 3 ... c6 is unexciting but sufficient: 4 ~f3 (4 d4 exd4 5 'iWxd4 ~a6!, and ... ~c5 will soon come with the threat of ... ~b3, illustrating the drawbacks of a3; White should avoid 6 b4?! c5! 7 'iVe5+ ~e7 8 b5 ~c7) 4 ... e4 5 ~d4 d5. This gives us a reverse variant of the Alapin Sicilian (1 e4 c5 2 c3 ~f6 3 e5 ~d5 4 ~f3 ~c6 5 d4), with an extra move a3 for White, which is not necessarily an advantage for him. Play might go 6 cxd5 ~c5!? 7 ~b3 ~b6 and capturing the c-pawn with 8 dxc6?! ~xc6 is very risky, as in the reversed position. Better is 8 d3 exd3 9 'tixd3 O-O! with equality. We now return to 3 e3 (D):

[diagram]
Here are a couple of alternatives for Black, often leading to structures and ideas that we've seen elsewhere: a) 3 ... d5 (somewhat obliging, but not neces- sarily bad) 4 cxd5 ~xd5 5 ~f3 (5 'iWc2 resem- bles the Taimanov Variation of the Sicilian) 5 ... ~c6 (5 ... ~xc3 6 bxc3 ~d6 7 d4 is another well-known reversed Taimanov Sicilian posi- tion in which White has an extra tempo; White wants to utilize his central majority while Black would like to scare something up on the king- side; my guess is that most strong players would prefer to have the white pieces, but it's certainly playable for both sides). After 5 ... ~c6, we've arrived at a position that can also arise by means of the more conventional move-order 2 ~c3 ~f6 3 ~f3 ~c6 4 e3 d5 5 cxd5 ~xd5. At this point, the seldom-played 6 'tic2 is a good alternative to look into, but the approved move is 6 ~b5 (D).

White is held to stand better held, but that isn't at all clear. Black can continue 6 ... ~xc3 (6 ... 'iWd6!? looks slow, but is not so easy to re- fute; White has tried 7 d4 exd4 8 ~xd4!? ~xc3 9 bxc3 ~d7 10 O-O with only a small

advantage) 7 bxc3 i.d6 (not 7 ... e4?! 8 tZ'le5 ~d5 9 ~a4 i.d7 10 tZ'lxd7 'iitxd7 lli.c4!) 8 e4 (8 d4 e4! with the idea 9 tZ'ld2 'ti'g5!) 8 ... O-O 9 O-O (9 d4?! is a book move, but Black might find 9 ... exd41O cxd4 .l:te8! 11 e5 i.b4+) 9 ... 'iVe7! 10 l:!.bl i.d7 with apparent equality. b) 3 ... i.b4 is a standard move that White plays in the Sicilian. Then 4 tZ'lge2 is a tempo ahead of the variation 1 e4 c5 2 tZ'lf3 tZ'lc6 3 i.b5 e6!? 4 O-O (4 i.xc6 is sometimes played) 4 ... tZ'lge7, often chosen by grandmasters. Once again, the question is whether an extra tempo means enough for White. Interesting play re- sults; for example, 4 ... O-O 5 a3 i.xc3 (5 ... i.e7 6 d4 is also complex) 6 tZ'lxc3 and now 6 ... c6 can be met by 7 d4 exd4 8 ~xd4 d5 9 M, which gives White the bishop-pair for little gain. So 6 ... tZ'lc6 is more natural, when 7 ~c2!? d5 8 cxd5 tZ'lxd5 9 i.d3 g6 10 i.e2!? with the idea d3 produces a unique and intriguing situation. In comparison with a Sicilian Defence, it's not clear whether Black's missing bishop is worth more or less than White's missing knight. We see how reversed positions take on a character of their own, or at the very least have their own dynamic. If White feels comfortable with these lines, and with the options in our main game, he might enjoy playing 3 e3 as a way to enter combat without requiring too much in the way of theoretical preparation. Now we return to 3 ... tZ'lc6 (D): w 4a3 This is an ambitious attempt to expand on the queenside. Instead, 4 tZ'lf3 transposes to the variation 3 tZ'lf3 tZ'lc6 4 e3, examined in Chap- ter 5. In any case, Black's rapid development renders 4 d4?! dubious following 4 ... exd4 5 exd4 i.b4! (e.g., 6 d5 tZ'le5!). 4 ... g6! (D) Black has the lUxury of fianchettoing, since White has no pressure on the centre. In fact, as a rule of thumb, the move ... g6 is a good choice in the English Opening when White is developing slowly. w 5 b4 Black can equalize against 5 d4 by 5 ... exd4 6 exd4 d5, when 7 i.g5 i.e7! 8 tZ'lf3 i.g4 high- lights the poor state of White's kingside devel- opment. 5 ... i.g7 6 i.b2 O-O (D) w 7d3 Even though this looks consistent with a Si- cilian Defence, it will be hard for White to get his kingside pieces out. A Taimanov-style ap- proach would be 7 ~c2!, when the play can go in many directions; for example, 7 ... .l:te8 (try- ing to discourage tZ'lf3 by means of the move

This is a typically double-edged Sicilian Tai- manov position which looks unclear and would be fun to play. 7 ••• .l:!.e8! 8 ~c2 If White were in a Najdorf set-up with tbd2 instead of tbc3, he could bypass ~c2 and play 8 tbf3, but here that is well met by 8 ... e4!

Black's 3rd-Move Options Now we'll return to 3 g3 (D), the main subject of this chapter, which is described above in general terms.

I have given most of my attention to 3 ... .Bb4 and 3 ... c6. Nevertheless, following the philoso- phy of working from fundamentals, I'll take an abbreviated look at some of Black's other third moves, beginning with these: a) 3 ... g6 will normally lead into another sys- tem, very often related to the King's Indian De- fence. Along those lines, Black has a couple of ways to avoid the standard variations that arise later in this book. A nice game that shows some basic ideas is Chiburdanidze-Uhlmann, Aruba 1992: 4 .Bg2 .Bg7 S d3 (I've adjusted the game's move-order to make the point that S tbf3 is the normal way to shoot for advantage by playing d4; in fact, Black either opts for a slow King's Indian Defence after S ... d6 6 d4, or he assumes a theoretically slightly inferior line following S ... tbc6 6 O-O O-O 7 d4 exd4 8 tbxd4; it's worth noting, however, that some strong players use this latter variation) S ... O-O 6 tbf3 l'!e8 (by means of his move-order, Black has gone without ... d6 and can now try for ... dS di- rectly) 7 O-O c6!? 8 tbd2?! (a slow move; White should probably react with more urgency; for example, he can discourage ... dS by 8 .igS, planning 8. .. h6 9 .Bxf6 "iWxf6 10 e3 with the idea of d4, although that gives up the bishop- pair) 8 ... tba6 9 l'!bl dS 10 b4 dxc4?! (simply 1O ... tbc7 assures Black of an ideal, well-pro- tected centre and the better game) 11 tbxc4 tbdS!? 12 tbxdS?! (White can avoid strengthen- ing Black's centre by ignoring the b-pawn; Ribli recommends 12 tbe4! with the idea 12 ... tbaxb4 13 tbcd6l:te7 14 .igS!, ending in advantage) 12 ... cxdS 13 tbe3 .Be6 14 ~a4 tbc7 IS bS 'iVd7 (Black has the big centre, and threatens ... a6) 16 ~3 d4! 17 tbc4 tbdS 18 .Bd2 tbb6! 19 a4 tbxc4 20 dxc4 )lac8 (it's not only that Black is attacking the backward c-pawn; more impor- tantly, his own centre pawns are ready to ad- vance) 21l:tfc1 .Bf8!? 22 as .ifS 23 l'!b2 e4 24 b6 axb6 2S axb6 (2S "iWxb6 runs into 2S ... .Ba3) 2S ... .icS 26 .Bf4l:1c6! 27 .Bc7 l'!ee6 (D).

w rather than f3/f6, because from there it can at- tack the opposing d-pawn. Whether such an ad- vantage is enough to convert into a win is an open question, but here White stands better af- ter 9 lbge2 lbc6 10 .Bg5 .Be6 11 O-O O-O 12 lbf4. b12) Black can also play 5 ...

One of the most serious theoretical shifts in the English Opening came with the discovery that 3 ... i.b4 is not only playable, but gives Black as many chances for advantage as White. For decades, a majority of players had concen- trated upon 3 ... c6, the Keres Variation, which will be discussed later in this chapter. Regard- less of the precise theoretical state of 3 ... c6, the move became associated with lines in which Black had to play very accurately to escape seri- ous trouble. Moreover, Black suffered a number of well-publicized defeats with 3 ... c6. Black's shyness about playing the Reversed Dragon with 3 ... d5 4 cxd5 liJxd5 was influenced by similar experiences, although that has changed today. At any rate, the move 3 ... .i.b4 has done more to discourage 3 g3 than any other factor, and accounts for the fact that 3 liJf3 is now White's most popular move among masters. It is also responsible for the increased interest in 1

c4 eS 2 g3, which obviously renders ... iLb4 ir- relevant for the time being. Of course, some of this is fashion, and a number of masters use 2 ttJc3 ttJf6 3 g3 as their main weapon. Moreover, if a few top-level play- ers reconsider 3 g3 iLb4 and come up with new ideas for White, 3 g3 will soon become the trendy choice. Even as theory stands today, many theoretically 'equal' positions that result from it are interesting and full of content. w Larsen - Petrosian Milan 1975

1 c4 ttJf6 2 ttJc3 eS 3 g3 iLb4 (D)

4 ttJf3 4 iLg2 is by far the favourite move here, but there are some logical points behind this un- common choice. For one thing, White tries to make Black commit to the defence or advance of his e-pawn before he can play ... O-O and ... l:te8, moves that often follow 4 iLg2. A cou- ple of lesser ideas for White are worth mention- ing: a) 4 ttJdS is in general not an effective idea if 4 ... ttJxdS S cxdS doesn't attack a knight on c6. Compare 4 iLg2 O-O S ttJdS below (specifically, the note to White's Sth move in the game Kor- chnoi-Tseitlin). b) The tempo-winning 4 iVb3 ttJc6 S ttJdS looks more to the point. However, after s ... iLcs White's queen is poorly placed on b3. The best-known example is 6 e3 0-07 iLg2 ttJxdSl 8 cxdS ttJe7 9 ttJe2 d6 10 O-O c6 (1O ... iLg41 11 f3 iLd7 is the simplest equalizer) 11 d4 exd4 12 exd4 iLb6 13 iLgS iLd7 followed by ... h6, and Black had satisfactory play in Korchnoi-Kar- pov, World Ch (game 2S), Baguio City 1978. 4•.• e4 (D) Black takes up the challenge; 4 ... ttJc6 would enter the Four Knights Variation of the next chapter. w S ttJd4 S ttJgS has the disadvantage that after S. .. iLxc3 6 dxc3 O-O 7 iLg2 .l:e8 8 "i;¥c2 iVe7 9 O-O d6 10 ttJh3 iLfS 11 ttJf4 c6, White's knight has made four moves to get to f4, a square that he usually uses as a springboard to dS. Since dS is unavailable, White even has to be wary of the move ... gS followed by ... h6, when the knight will become stuck and vulnerable on h3. S••. ttJc6 Black directly challenges the knight on d4. This is the standard idea, as we shall see in many games. Nevertheless, he has other ap- proaches to this kind of position. A logical al- ternative is S ... O-O 6 iLg2 l::!.e8 (or 6 ... iLxc3 first), with two-sided play following 7 iVc21? iLxc3 8 dxc3 h6 9 iLf4 d6 10 O-O-O ttJbd7. 6 ttJc2 (D) It's important to know that 6 ttJxc6?! dxc6 opens too many lines for Black; after the move ... iLfS, White's d-pawn won't be able to ad- vance safely. There are very few lines in which ttJxc6 is White's best course. 6 .•• iLxc3 7 dxc3 We already discussed the differences be- tween recaptures in our analysis of 1 c4 eS 2 ttJc3 iLb4, and we'll keep running into them. Here 7 bxc3 isn't as challenging. It can be an- swered conventionally by 7 ... O-O or 7 ... iVe7, but 7 ... dS! 8 cxdS iVxdS is a more active idea,

intending 9 i.g2 ~S. White often ends up with a backward d-pawn that can't be advanced without creating weaknesses. 7 ... h6 7 ... 0-08 i.gS is somewhat better for White because Black's knight is already on c6 and the manoeuvre tLle3-dS gains effect. Another way to justify the text-move is that White's bishop has no better square than gS. 8i.e3 This gives the game a unique character, whereas 8 i.g2 O-O 9 O-O is seen in Chapter S. 8 ...

2.JtJj6 AND g3 SYSTEMS 73

Now White has to consider how to make progress. It's informative to look at this as a re- versed-colour variation of a line of the Rosso- limo Sicilian, which goes 1 e4 c5 2liJf3 liJc6 3 .tb5 g64 O-O i..g7 (D). w In our English Opening version, Black has a tempo less; so couldn't White claim some ad- vantage by playing typical Sicilian moves at this point? Unfortunately, as we have learned, knowing what your opponent is doing can par- tially compensate for being a tempo behind. Thus anything that White does commits him to a structure and/or piece placement, and Black can adjust his strategy accordingly. Let's exam- ine some continuations to see whether that's sufficient for Black to equalize. We'll start with the Rossolimo Sicilian posi- tion. How does White try to make progress after 40-0 .tg7? I'll show some standard ideas with a selection of theoretical details, and then com- pare them with our English Opening 3 ... i..b4 variation. A side benefit is that I shall provide belated coverage of the Rossolimo Sicilian it- self! a) In the Sicilian, 5 c3 is usually answered by 5 ... liJf6, since liJc3 is no longer available to White. Let's be clear about that. In our English Opening variation, after 3 g3 i..b4 4 i..g2 O-O 5 liJf3 l:!e8 6 O-O e4 7 liJd4, Black has the ideal move 7 ... liJc6!, after which 8liJxc6?! dxc6 gives Black open lines and freer play (see the game Cuellar-Uhlmann below). In the Sicilian posi- tion, White's 'extra' move is 5 c3, so if he meets 5 ... liJf6 with 6 e5 liJd5, he can't then play the desirable liJc3. There might follow 7 d4 cxd4 8 cxd4. After 8 ... d6 9liJc3, 9 ... liJxc3 10 bxc3 O-O is theoretically equal, while 9 ... i..e6!? is in- triguing. Instead of 6 e5, White can develop slowly, but to gain any advantage he has to play ambitiously at some point; for example, 6l:!el (a move rec- ommended more often than not) 6 ... O-O (D). w Now White has two main approaches: al) 7 d4 d5! (this is more ambitious and probably better than 7 ... cxd4 8 cxd4 d5 9 e5 liJe4, a well-known position in which, how- ever, Black stands satisfactorily) 8 e5 (8 exd5 ~xd5 9 c4 ~d6) 8 ... liJe4. Remarkably, we've reached a position that is probably slightly more difficult to play from White's side of the board! a2) 7 e5liJd5 8 d4 (D).

Now 8 ... d6!? is a challenging move that might attract some players, but the most solid variation is 8 ... cxd4 9 cxd4 d6. After 10 liJc3, one line is 1O ... dxe5 11 i..xc6 bxc6 12 liJxe5, when 12 ... 'ifb6 should be good enough (13 ~a4

74 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

i.xe5 14 dxe5 lLlxc3 15 bxc3 i.e6). But, as above, 1O ... i.e6!? is even more interesting. Then 11 lLlg5? is very strongly met by 11 ... dxe5 12lLlxe6 fxe6 13 i.xc6 bxc6 14 dxe5 't!fb6, and after the natural 11 i.g5, ll...dxe5 12 i.xc6 bxc6 13 lLlxe5 1:tc8 holds on to the bishop-pair and contemplates moves like ... f6 and ... c5. In conclusion, White's move 5 c3 in the Si- cilian Defence tips his hand, and Black can choose the appropriate defensive system. Com- pare variations of the English Opening below in which Black can play ... c6 successfully, only because White isn't able to respond by lLlf3! b) Returning to the Rossolimo position after 40-0 i.g7, 5 I:tel (D) fights for an edge without committing to the move c3.

Now 5 ... lLlf6 might be met by 6 e5 with the idea 6 ... lLld5 7 lLlc3!, again utilizing the avail- ability of White's c3-square. In fact, 6lLlc3 in- tending e5 is also good. Nevertheless, tipping his hand by 5 .:i.el once again limits what White can achieve. It's more logical for Black to play the typical defence 5 ... e5, since the rook on el is not very useful in that case (in a couple of situations, it might even be better placed on f1, supporting the ad- vance f4). Then there are various continuations, but with Black intending 6 ... lLlge7 to reinforce c6, the most common one is 6 i.xc6 dxc6 7 d3 WIIe7!? 8lLlbd2 (8 b3; 8 a3!?, with ideas ofb4, when 8 ... a5 !? is interesting) 8 ... lLlf6 9 lLlc4lLld7 . I think White may have a very small edge in this line, but it hasn't translated into much in prac- tice. In the reversed English Opening position, af- ter 4 i.g2 O-O, Black can hold off with the move ... 1:te8. As we just saw, the best position for that rook isn't known yet. c) Returning to the Rossolimo Sicilian, 5 lLlc3 (D) is another instructive attempt.

But this is also a committal move, and per- mits Black to play 5 ... lLld4. Remember that ... lLld4 is more effective when White has a knight on c3, so that an exchange on d4 forces White to lose a tempo after ... cxd4. Probably 6 l:1el would follow, permitting the exchange on b5 to uncertain effect. Compare the reversed English Opening po- sition, after 3 g3 i.b4 4 i.g2 O-O. Black hasn't played ... lLlc6, so 5lLld5 is harmless (the knight can be exchanged without loss of time); see the note to move 5 in Korchnoi-Tseitlin below. Furthermore, 5 ... e5 is a perfectly adequate reply to 5 lLlc3, especially since a knight or bishop on d5 can be exchanged off (after 6lLld5 lLlge7, for example). In that case, Black's pre- ferred set-up would be ... lLlge7, ... O-O, ... d6, ... i.e6 and ... d5. d) Finally, in part because he hasn't made much progress with the 5th moves above, White has turned to the slightly cooperative 5 i.xc6. We already looked at this and the reversed posi- tion by transposition in Chapter 3 in the game Illescas-Sisniega, Novi Sad Olympiad 1990 (see the note to the main move 8 ... lLle7). Spe- cifically, we saw the position after 5 i.xc6 dxc6

Then White has the broad choice of playing in the centre by .Be3, attacking on the kingside with f4 or g4, and advancing on the queenside with

White's set-up was originally considered the best way to meet 3 ... .Bb4; as it turns out, Black

White has cre- ated a gaping hole on d4, so Black hurries to control it. But this illustrates a great strength of the Botvinnik System: it creates only one weak- ness, and White's play on the rest of the board is multi-faceted, as we'll see. 8d3

8 h3 is another continuation for White, with

the idea of 'it'h2 followed by launching the f- pawn forward: a) 8 ... lDd4 9 d3 c6 10 'it>hl lDe8?! allows White to demonstrate another basic idea in the Botvinnik: lllDxd4 .i.xd4 12lDe2 .i.b6 l3 d4 WIIe7 14 .i.e3lDf6 15 ~d3l:[e8 16lDc3 (D).

We have a picture of White's desired set-up in a great many Reversed Sicilian variations: pseudo-outposts on e4 and d5 in conjunction with a queenside b-pawn attack and unob- structed bishop on g2. The a-file can also prove useful. Black's counter-strategy is also stan- dard: via ... c6 and ... d5 he wishes to deny White those juicy squares.

In the early days of the Keres this was quite popular. White attacks e5 and practically forces the following concession in the centre. 4 .•• exd45 'tWxd4 d5 (D) White's queen is aggressively placed, and he will try to train his pieces on d5; the moves i.g2 and i.g5 serve that purpose. But first he has to make some fundamental decisions over this and the next few moves, primarily when to ex- change pawns, taking into account that Black might play ... c5 or ... dxc4 at the right moment, and that if White exchanges pawns on d5, he opens the way for Black's knight to come to c6 with tempo. This means that move-order is w critical. Let's look into the theory in the context of this game. 6cxd5 White wants to fix the pawns right away, but as mentioned, this permits Black to develop by ... tZ'lc6 and encourages the advance ... d4 with further gain of time. If White can wait before exchanging on d5, Black may have to play the suboptimal ... i.e7 or ... i.e6 at an early stage. One of several issues is whether ... dxc4 will be an easy equalizer in that case. This all plays out in the following examples: a) 6 i.g2 i.e6 (6 ... dxc4 7 ~xc4 i.e6 8 ~a4 tZ'lbd7 is considered equal, but White's pieces seem to coordinate slightly better; for example, 9 tZ'lf3 tZ'lc5!? 10 'iVc2 'iia5 !?, and now not 11 i.d2 tZ'lb3!, but 11 i.e3!

That is unconvincing after 8 ... tbc6 9 'ilia4 (after 9 i.xf6?, both 9 ... tbxd4 10 i.xd8 tbc2+ and the safer 9 ... gxf6 followed by ... d4 favour Black) 9 ...

Compare 6 tbf3 below; in fact, 12 ... O-O would transpose directly to that line. c) Still another try is 6 tbf3 (directed against ... d4) 6 ... i.e7 (6 ... dxc4!? is also reasonable), when White again has to deal with Black's po- tential expansion: cl) 7 i.g2 cS! 81\Vd3 d4 9 tbe4 tbc6 with a position that is level or slightly favouring Black, Pfleger-Keres, Bamburg 1968. c2) 7 cxdS cxdS 8 i.g2 tbc6 9 'iVa4 O-O 10 O-O (D) is a standard position characteristic of the isolated queen's pawn.

You can see that Black's game in the Keres Defence depends upon some very delicate play, so the popularity of 3 ... ~b4 (after 1 c4 e5 2 liJc3 liJf6 3 g3) is understandable. White Plays 2 g3

1 c4 e5 2 g3 (D)

2liJc3 is still the dominant move in the Eng- lish Opening by a large margin. Nevertheless, over the last decade, White has increasingly played the fianchetto 2 g3 in order to avoid cer- tain bothersome variations that can arise after 2 liJc3. This can greatly simplify his task; for one thing, playing 2liJc3 means that in several varia- tions White has to deal with the move ... ~b4, 2 ... l:iJj6 AND g3 SYSTEMS 91 and 2 g3 sidesteps them (I'll discuss that pres- ently). On the other hand, 2 g3 commits White to a fianchetto and thus eliminates numerous varia- tions which involve some combination of moves such as lbc3, lbf3, e3, d4, etc. Therefore, before plunging into lines stemming from 2 g3, it's worthwhile to discuss the ramifications of this choice. First, we want to see which sequences of moves after 2 g3 can lead to independent lines, and which will transpose into other English Opening variations (or even to other openings entirely). Then, what are the concrete advan- tages and difficulties that accompany it? Right off, someone who plays 2 g3 should consider what he wants to do after 1 c4lbf6 (D) (instead of l...e5). Then 2 lbc3 e5 already commits White to learning 1 c4 e5 2lbc3lbf6 variations, which is one thing he is trying to steer clear of by play- ing 2 g3! In that case White would have to deal with theory that is unique to both 1 c4 e5 2 g3 and 1 c4 e5 2 lbc3 lbf6. That's a lot to ask. White can choose 2 lbf3, of course, but that may have nothing to do with the kinds of posi- tions that he is aiming for. So one question would be how 1 c4lbf6 2 g3 fits in with White's plans. Unfortunately, this opens a new can of worms. For example, how does White want to cope with 1 c4lbf6 2 g3 e6? Presumably 3 i.g2 d5 or 3 lbf3 d5 follows, when White can play 4 d4 with a Catalan, or leave his d-pawn alone and enter into some kind of Reti with b3 and i.b2. In addition, White has to consider 1 c4 lbf6 2 g3 c6 and 3 ... d5. Or, against a King's Indian Defence (which would proceed by 1 c4lbf6 2 g3 g6 3 i.g2 i.g7), does he want to be committed to the fianchetto variations? And so forth. The bottom line is that when White plays 1 c4 with the inten- tion of 1...e5 2 g3, he has to consider whether to accept the transposition 1 c4 lbf6 2 lbc3 e5, enter into 1 c4 lbf6 2 lbf3, or be prepared for variations outside the traditional scope of the English Opening. Having said all that, here are some concrete considerations that might go into a decision about whether to play 2 g3 after 1 c4 e5.

1 c4 e5 2 g3: Favouring White:

a) In some cases, the difference is easily seen. For example, 2 lbc3 i.b4 enjoys a good reputation, whereas 2 g3 i.b4? has nothing to recommend it! b) Similarly, with 2 g3 lbf6 3 i.g2, White sidesteps 2lbc3lbf6 3 g3 i.b4, analysed above. c) 2 g3 lbf6 3 i.g2 d5 4 cxd5 lbxd5 is a re- versed Accelerated FianchettolDragon. White has a few options apart from 5 lbc3 (which transposes to the main line). For example, he can play 5 lbf3!? lbc6 6 O-O. If Black then con- tinues 6 ... lbb6 (not forced), White can bring his queen's knight to d2 instead of c3 by means of, for example, 7 d3 i.e7 8 a3 O-O 9 lbbd2. Ulti- mately, this may not bring give White an advan- tage, but it's a different and legitimate way of playing. We'll see it below. d) In some lines, there is no knight on c3 that can be attacked by ... d4. This occurs prom- inently in the variation 1 c4 e5 2 g3 lbf6 3 i.g2 c6 4 d4 exd4 5 ~xd4 d5 6 cxd5 cxd5 7 lbf3 lbc6 8 ~a4, as opposed to 1 c4 e5 2lbc3lbf6 3 g3 c6 4 d4 exd4 5 ~xd4 d5 6 cxd5 cxd5 7 lbf3 lbc6 8 ~a4 d4 (attacking the knight on c3).

1 c4 e5 2 g3: Favouring Black:

a) As we've seen in Chapter 3, the sequence 2lbc3 f5 allows 3 d4!. But after 2 g3, 2 ... f5 has fewer drawbacks for Black, and 2 g3 d6 3 i.g2 f5 eliminates most lines in which White plays an early lbf3 and d4. Whether this should worry White is open to debate. b) The move-order 2 g3 c6 can present unique problems for White. In particular, 3 d4 i.b4+ is increasingly popular, and the similar 2 g3 lbf6 3 i.g2 c6 4 d4 i.b4+ usually trans- poses. Obviously this strategy isn't available to Black after 2lbc3.

92 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

c) Furthennore, following 2 g3 c6 3 tbf3 e4 4 tbd4 dS S cxdS, Black can recapture with his queen (S ... 'iVxdS), as he can in the line 2 g3 tbf6 3 i.g2 c6 4 tbf3 e4 S tbd4 dS 6 cxdS 'iVxdS (D). w Again, 2 tbc3 eliminates this possibility. See below for details. d) Another difference between 2 g3 and 2 tbc3 is that 2 g3 tbc6 3 i.g2 g6 followed by ... i.g7 almost always gives Black a Closed English variation (reversed Closed Sicilian) of Chapter 6, which is very popular among 1.. .eS players. In that case it's difficult for White to avoid 4 tbc3 i.g7, which is then the main line. But if White uses the move-order 1 c4 eS 2 tbc3 tbc6, he has the extra possibility of 3 tbf3, when 3 ... tbf6 is a main-line Four Knights Vari- ation (see below), whereas 3 ... g6 and 3 .. .fS can be answered by 4 d4 (or 4 e3), in both cases cir- cumventing the Closed English. There are a few more issues, and it may take some independent investigation to be sure that you're comfortable with 2 g3. Gulko - Korchnoi Hastings 1988/9 lc4eS2g3fS A simple attempt to grab space and control e4. Unfortunately, there's no space to cover all of the alternatives with their transpositions, most notably 2 ... d6 and 2 ... tbc6. A few starternotes: a) 2 ... d6 is ultra-flexible, and keeps open options of ... fS, ... c6 and ... g6; for example, 3 i.g2 fS (or 3 ... tbc6) 4 d4, and now even the elastic move 4 ... i.e7 is possible, when the ex- change of queens is harmless. b) 2 ... tbc6, as mentioned above, virtually en- sures a Closed Sicilian or other respectable line; for example, 3 i.g2 g64 tbc3 i.g7. Here 3 .. .fS!? 4 tbc3 tbf6 is a tempo-down Sicilian Grand Prix Attack, when S e3 discourages both S ... i.cs be- cause of 6 tbge2 and S ... i.b4 due to 6 tbdS. 3i.g2 In the previously-examined case of 2 tbc3 fS 3 d4, Black was pretty much limited to 3 ... e4 and 3 ... exd4, both playable, but arguably leav- ing White with some advantage. But after 2 g3 fS 3 d4!? (D), there are new possibilities.

One is 3 ... d6; this is better than in the 2 tbc3 fS 3 d4 d6 case, if only because 4 dxeS dxe5 5 ~xd8+ isn't as effective when White has spent a move on g3. Furthennore, 3 ... e4 4 tbc3 tbf6 has led to various set-ups for both sides; as al- ways, White should consider the manoeuvre tbh3-f4. This brings up the simplest answer to 3 d4, namely 3 ... i.M+. Then4i.d2 (4 tbc3 exd4!? S ~xd4 tbf6 is possible too) 4 ... i.xd2+ 5 ~xd2 d6 6 i.g2 tbf6 7 tbc3 O-O transposes to the game. That's hardly the whole story, of course, and it will help to compare other ... fS lines. 3 ... tbf6 4 d4 (D) At this point 4 tbc3 arrives at a position that could have come from 2 tbc3, and both sides should be aware that 4 ... i.b4! is a fully legiti- mate choice, especially since S tbdS tbxd5 6 cxdS doesn't attack a knight on c6. 4,..i.h4+ Black develops quickly and clears the way for ... O-O. 4 ... e4 may not be so bad; for example, S tbc3 i.b4 6 i.gS 0-07 tbh3 h6 8 i.xf6 iYxf6 9 tbf4 c6 10 h4 tba6!? with the idea ... tbc7. 2 . ..tlJj6 AND g3 SYSTEMS 93

5 iLd2 iLxd2+ 6 ~xd2 d6 7 ltJc3 White can also exchange queens by 7 dxeS dxeS 8 ~xd8+ 'it>xd8 (D). w This type of ending, which appears in vari- ous forms over many opening lines, will vary in assessment from position to position. Here Black has an excellent pawn-structure, so the issue is whether White can upset the balance, usually with rapid development and a pawn- break. Under normal circumstances, the two tempi spent on g3 and iLg2 aren't ideal for ac- complishing this, so Black shouldn't have too many problems. A sample line is 9ltJc3 '3;e7 10 O-O-O c6 11 ltJf3?!

It's difficult for White to demonstrate an ad- vantage following 2 g3 fS. On the other hand, there arise plenty of interesting positions which will test the two players' skills. w Markowski - Krasenkow Polish Team Ch, Zakopane 2000

1 c4 e5 2 g3 c6 (D)

I'm going to emphasize this move because it leads to basic types of positions, including those with the isolated queen's pawn and with an ad- vanced centre. To begin with, Black threatens simply 3 ... dS. Again, we have the odd case in which Black is playing a tempo down compared with 1 e4 cS 2 c3, and one would think that White could take advantage of this. But the g3 move can be a mixed blessing for White, as seen in this and the next games. We'll leave some questions of move-order until later, specifically of the choice between 2 ... c6 and 2 ... ltJf6 3 iLg2 c6, which very often transpose. 3d4 Following 3 iLg2 dS 4 cxdS cxdS S d4, both S ... e4 and S. .. exd4 6ltJf3 iLb4+ 7 iLd2 iLcs are satisfactory answers if one knows the theory. This might not fit Black's designs, however, so he sometimes chooses 3 ... ltJf6, when 4ltJc3 dS! returns to the Keres Defence section and 4 d4 iLb4+ is discussed in later games.

94 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

3 ... exd4 It's always hard to know when Black can play the cramping advance ... e4. If White has B played both g3 and i.g2, Black can often pro- tect e4 and make the bishop on g2 look ineffec- tive. Here White has made only one of those moves, so he has a good shot at gaining the ad- vantage after 3 ... e4 44Jc3: a) Suba-Timman, Thessaloniki Olympiad 1984 went 4 ... fS!? S h4!? (D).

This flexible flank advance supports i.gS and anticipates that after a knight gets to f4, it will be difficult to drive it away by ... gS. Black continued S ... 4Jf6 (perhaps S. .. 4Ja6 64Jh34Jc7 should be tried) 6 i.gS h6 7 i.xf6 'iixf6 8 e3 (now White has got rid of his bad bishop and tries to establish a favourable French Defence) 8 ... g6 9 4Jge2 d6 10 4Jf4 4Ja6 (White has the better minor pieces, but he needs a plan) 11 g4! (a marvellous positional blow; Black can't hold the kingside together) 1l...~g8 (ll...4Jc7 12 hS gS 13 4Jg6 ~g8 14 'fib3! prevents Black from developing normally) 12 'iib3 4Jc7 13 gxfS!?

At first it looks weak because of S cxdS cxdS 6 'iWb3 (D). Then 6 ... 4Jf6? allows 7 i.gS and 6 ... 4Je7 7 i.f4 a6 comes up short after 8 f3 exf3 9 4Jxf3 4Jbc6 10 e4! i.e6, Korchnoi-Bacrot, Match (game 4), Albert 1997, when I think 11 4JgS! is strong; for example, 11...4Jxd4 12 'iWxb74Jc2+ 13 'it>f2 4Jxal 14 4JbS!. But that's not the end of the story, because Black has 6 ... 4Jc6!, when the most critical line is 7 'iWxdS!? 'iixdS 8 4JxdS 4Jxd4 9 4Jc7 + (9 i.gS is equally complex but apparently all right for Black when the dust clears) 9 ... ..t>d8 10 4Jxa84Jc2+ 11 'it>dl4Jxal; here several games have been played without success for White, the simplest continuation being 12 b3 b6 13 i.b2 i.b7 14 i.xal (144Jxb64Jxb3) 14 ... iLxa8 with equality. So perhaps 4 ... dS is a satisfactory move after all. Another promising sign is that the obvious S4Jh3 is relatively harmless after the surprising S. .. dxc4! 64Jxe4 i.b4+. Lines in which White plays e3 should be compared with the Advance French. There the 'extra' move g3 is not always useful. 4 'iixd4 (D)

4 ... d5 4 ... 4Jf6 S i.g2 4Ja6!? is another reasonable course for Black, combining the ideas of ... 4Jb4 with quick development by ... i.cS. For example, 2 ...tbj6 AND g3 SYSTEMS 95 6 4:Jf3 iLcs 7 'liVeS+ 'liVe7 8 'liVxe7+ ~xe7. White can try to claim a slight edge because of his potential grip on d5 and Black's knight on a6, but it's hard to believe that's worth much; for example, 9 4:Jc3 dS 10 cxdS liJb4 11 O-O liJbxdS. Of course, there's much more to be said about S ... liJa6, and White needn't despair of finding interesting ways to try for advantage. 5 iLg2 Without descending too far into the morass of move-order issues, White often plays S liJf3 here, although that permits S ... dxc4 with fair chances for equality. 5 ••• iLe6 Black could play S ... dxc4, but decides to go in another direction and force White's hand. 6 exd5 exd5 7 liJf3liJe6 S 'liVa4 iLe5! There are other ways for Black to set up, of course. The text-move is the most forceful, and it covers d4. 90-0 liJf6 (D) w This position is similar to one that occurs in the Keres Defence (2 liJc3 liJf6 3 g3 c6), but counterbalanced White's pressure against the weak black pawns) 13 iLxf6!? gxf6 (D). w White has ceded the bishop-pair, and to some extent the dark squares, to create doubled, isolated pawns in his opponent's camp. The difficulty is that those pawns aren't yet subject to effective attack, and they cover some nice squares; Black will probably follow up with .. J:tab8 and ... .l:tfc8. In the meantime, White manoeuvres to occupy cS and/or play e4. This is unclear. UliJc3 O-O 12liJd3! In positions with an isolated d-pawn, a knight on d3 is often well-placed. 12• •• iLd4!?

See how the picture has transformed: White has a weak isolated pawn, a bad bishop, and a vulnerable kingside, whereas Black has a knight ensconced on the forward outpost d4. Now 23 llxd4? loses to 23 ... 'iVb6. For all that, White does have a useful pin on the d-file to work with. The game continued 23 'it>hl 'iVf6 24 e5! (White solves two of his problems in one shot!

Simply put, he has got rid of his f8-bishop and then placed his central pawns on dark squares, leaving the 'good' c8-bishop on the board. The pawn on e5 secures a foot- hold in the centre, and Black retains the option of playing ... exd4, ... d5, or ... e4. In return, White has his own healthy share of the centre. His bishop on g2 is also 'good', as- suming that he plays e3. Or, if White chooses e4 instead, he gains the traditional space advan- tage conferred by pawns on e4 and d4 versus e5 and d6 (aided by the pawn on c4). Finally, Black has the only weak central point, that is, d6. 7lLlc3 White can try to anticipate the coming at- tack on his c-pawn by playing 7 e3 first. Then 7 ... i.e6 8 b3 exd4 9 exd4 d5 10 c5!?

White captures the centre and grabs space, incidentally preventing ... e4. These are real accomplishments. Note, however, that the ad- vance e4 is not without drawbacks: White has no dark-squared bishop, and this exposes points such as d4 which that bishop might have de- fended. Instead, 12 dS is natural, denying Black's knight its way back to cS via e6. Then 12 ... c5

13 e4 (D) leads to a normal-looking King's In-

dian/Old Indian position.

White probably has some advantage; he can attempt to expand on either wing following, say, lbc1-d3. For his part, Black has the stan- dard Old Indian idea of playing ... hS-h4 in con- junction with a knight on g6; if in tum White plays h4, he will only achieve a later f4 at the cost of weakening g4 and h4. On the queenside, ... a6, ... J::tb8 and ... i.d7 can at least aim for ... bS.

104 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Because of White's move-order, Black can try to keep his knight in the centre for a long time by playing 6 ... iLe7 (D). w One interesting consequence is that if White continues with the set-up we are considering (d3 and tDbd2), Black's knight remains on its best square; for example, 7 d3 O-O 8 a3 as 9 b3 (9 tDbd2 iLe6) 9 ... iLe6 10 iLb2 f6 11 tDbd2 'ilVd7 was very comfortable for Black in Carl- sen-Gelfand, Moscow (blitz) 2007. Thus, if White doesn't want to revert to the conventional Dragon set-up by 7 tDc3, he should play 7 d4, when the main line is 7 ... e4 8 tDeS fS 9 tDxc6 bxc6 (D). At this point there's quite a bit of theory, so I'll simply list some abbreviated lines: a) 10 'ilVa4 is played more often than other moves. The conventional solution is 1O ... 'ilVd7, with the idea of ... cS. Topalov-Timman, Wijk aan Zee 1999 went 11 .l:i.d1 cS! 12 'ilVxd7+ iLxd7 13 dxcS iLe6! and the game was level. b) Carlsen-Gelfand, Moscow (blitz) 2007 went 10 tDc3 O-O 11 f3!? exf3 12 exf3?! (12 l:lxf3 followed by e4 is equal) 12 ... iLf6 13 .l:!.el .nb8. This is quite awkward for White. c) 10 tDd2 is a good try, although several an- swers are reasonable.

This is the point: the knight goes to d2, as it does in many Najdorf and Scheveningen varia- tions with colours reversed.

5 Four Knights Variation

1 c4 e5 2 lLlc3 lLlf6 3 lLlf3 (D)

3 •.. lLlc6 Now that we've seen the theory of 3 g3, the motivations behind 3 lLlf3 should be easier to understand. First, it's more forcing and there- fore restricts the opponent's options. Black's usual response is to protect his e-pawn by 3 ... lLlc6, when he has forfeited the possibility of ... c6, a move that plagued White in our pre- vious chapter in the variations stemming from both 2 g3 and 2lLlc3lLlf6 3 g3. Furthermore, in lines with ... lLlc6 and ... .i.b4, White's lLld5 will tend to be more effective, not only be- cause a counter with ... c6 isn't on the cards, but because ... lLlxd5 tends to lose a tempo after the recapture cxd5. As always, such advantages come with dis- advantages. By playing 3 lLlf3, White encour- ages ... e4 with tempo, and indeed that move is key to Black's play in many of the most impor- tant variations. Furthermore, White foregoes the development by lLlge2 (or lLlh3), reducing the likelihood that he will attack Black's centre byf4. Why 3 ... lLlc6? Simply because the e-pawn needs protection and the only other serious moves are 3 ... e4 and 3 ... d6. After some experi- ence with the gambit 3 ... e4?! 4lLlg5 b5!? (else the e-pawn falls for nothing), it turns out that declining the pawn sacrifice by 5 d3! secures a pleasant advantage based upon White's central control and development. The relevant analysis can be found in various books. Defence of the e-pawn by 3 ... d6 is primarily a transpositional device; for example, after 4 d4 lLlbd7, 5 e4 will transpose to either an Old In- dian Defence, if Black plays 5 ... .i.e7, or to a King's Indian Defence if Black plays 5 ... g6. The game stays within English Opening terri- tory after 4 d4 e4 5 lLlg5 .i.f5, which was ana- lysed in Chapter 3 under the move-order 1 c4 e5 2lLlc3 d6 3 lLlf3 lLlf6 4 d4 e4 5lLlg5 .i.f5. In any case, 3 ... d6 forfeits the chance to play ... .i.b4 or ... d5 (at least in one step); those moves are two of Black's main weapons versus 3 g3. The position after 3 ... lLlc6 (D) is called the 'English Four Knights Variation', and is a tradi- tional main line. w The first question is whether White can prof- itably play the thematic pawn-break 4 d4 (see beloW). That move has undergone a modest re- vival; although the conventional wisdom is that Black achieves equality, the debate goes on. Then we have a series of less dramatic choices for White on his 4th move such as 4 d3, 4 e3 and 4 g3. Black has many possible responses to all of these, but an intriguing question is whether he can afford to enter a reversed Open Sicilian

FOUR KNIGHTS VARIATION 107

(1 e4 cS 2 lLlf3 lLlc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lLlxd4) by play- ing 4 ... dS S cxdS lLlxdS. Two issues arise: a) Which of White's fourth moves will be useful versus ... dS and productive in its own right? b) Is Black's position in the normal Open Sicilian so compelling that when White plays it with an extra tempo, it will propel him to the advantage? That is, if White simply plays a use- ful 'Sicilian' move such as 4 a3, 4 d3 or 4 g3, will 4 ... dS S cxdS lLlxdS allows him a lasting edge? Or, if Black plays safely, are White's prospects strictly limited? We've asked this question before about analogous positions in Chapters 2, 3 and 4. In general, 3 lLlf3 is more popular than 3 g3 because Black has a much harder time proving equality, and can easily end up with the small disadvantage that we associate with moving second. After 3 ... lLlc6, let's look at games with a va- riety of fourth moves, beginning with some less conventional ones. Slower White Approaches 4a3 Korchnoi - Salov St Petersburg 1997 White reasons that ... a6 is a handy move in al- most every Sicilian Defence, so it makes sense to try it for White. a) 4 b3 can't be too bad, but isn't very force- ful. Perhaps the easiest response is 4 ... g6 fol- lowed by ... iLg7 and ... O-O. In fact, the obvious 4 ... dS S cxdS lLlxdS 6 iLb2 lLlxc3 7 iLxc3 iLd6

8 d3 O-O also equalizes.

b) 4 d3 (D) is a common choice, but too slow to pose a real challenge to Black because it forfeits the chance to play d4 in one move. bl) As against other quiet moves, the all- purpose 4 ... g6 is satisfactory, leading to the King's Indian/Closed hybrid of Chapter 12 if play continues S g3 iLg7 6 iLg2 O-O 7 O-O d6. b2) Black also frequently chooses 4 ... iLM with the idea of an early ... e4 and/or ... dS. S iLd2 O-O and now: b21) 6 g3 may not inspire, but gives chances for a slight edge after 6 .. J:te8 7 iLg2 iLxc3 8

iLxc3 dS 9 cxdS lLlxdS and now 10 O-O!, in re- sponse to which 1O .. J:tb8!? intending ... lLlxc3 and ... b6 has been played. Kotronias solves the problem of the bishop-pair after 10 iLd2 with 1O ... lLld4! 110-0 iLg4!. Notice also that the ag- gressive 6 ... lLld4!? with the idea ... lLlxf3+ and ... c6 has held its own in practice. b22) One high-level example is 6 e3 ne8 7 ~c2!? iLxc3 8 iLxc3 dS 9 cxdS lLlxdS 10 iLe2 iLfS! 11 l:tdl (Black's tactical point is 11 e4 lLlf4! 12 exfS lLld4!) ll...aS 12 O-O file7 with equality, Ehlvest-Kasparov, Reykjavik 1988. b3) If Black doesn't want to go in those di- rections, he can also answer 4 d3 more ambi- tiously by playing a reversed Open Sicilian with 4 ... dS S cxdS lLlxdS. This is an extremely instructive position to investigate by substitut- ing various normal Sicilian moves for White at this juncture. For example, 6 e4!? (D) is like a Sveshnikov Sicilian in reverse.

White's problem again has to do with his ex- tra move, in this case d3. In the reversed lines,

108 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Black has the aggressive move ... i.b4 if White's d4-knight retreats. Here, because of White's extra move d3, the development i.bS is not available. A typical line goes 6 ... ttJb6 (6 ... ttJf6 is also perfectly satisfactory; for example, 7 i.e2 i.g4 8 O-O i.xf3!? 9 i.xf3 ttJd4, Moroze- vich-Grishchuk, World Ch, Mexico City 2007; and even 6 ... ttJxc3 7 bxc3 i.cs isn't bad) 7 i.e2 i.e7 80-00-09 a4 i.e6! 10 i.e3 (10 as ttJd7) 1O ... ttJd7 (anyway!) 11 d4 exd412 ttJxd4 ttJxd4 13 ~xd4 c6 14 as ttJcS IS ~eS ttJb3 16 l:l.a4 i.d6 17llVhs g6 18 ~6 i.eS with full equality, Carlsen-Topalov, MorelialLinares 2008. Of course, White has options apart from 6 e4 in the position after 4 d3 dS S cxdS ttJxdS. 6 g3 is a Reversed Dragon, which we'll see below; and 6 e3 is a reversed Scheveningen. But in general, when playing with this d3/e3 pawn- structure, White has more chance of gaining the advantage if he can place his queen' s knight on d2; you might compare the N ajdorf Variation of the Sicilian with its extraordinarily effective knight on d7. In our line, with White's knight on c3, Black should be able to equalize, but you might want to confirm this for yourself. Let's return to the main game with 4 a3 (D).

4 .•• g6 Broadly speaking, if ... i.b4 isn't possible, then ... g6 will be a good alternative. It makes sense against any slow move like 4 a3. Other moves: a) Black can also treat White's whole idea with disdain and play 4 ... dS S cxdS ttJxdS (D) anyway. Confronted with the 'extra' move a3, Black may not want to attack as White does in an w Open Sicilian position, preferring to look for simplifying ideas that yield equality. White, on the other hand, already has the central majority. Let's look at a few continuations: al) 6 e3 has several good answers. First, 6 ... i.e7 7 i.bs1Wd6!? is effectively a tempo up for Black on a line we've seen via the move- order 2 ttJc3 ttJf6 3 e3 in Chapter 4, because 4 a3 has proven irrelevant. A more provocative course for Black in this variation is to try the gambit that White plays with reversed colours, that is, 7 ... O-O!? 8 i.xc6 bxc6 9 ttJxeS i.d6! with the idea 10 ttJxc6 1Wgs. It's unlikely that White's pawn being on a3 helps him much. Finally, Black can playa Four Knights Sicilian in reverse by 6 ... ttJxc3 7 bxc3 e4 8 ttJd4 ttJeS, when the pawn on a3 even prevents the stan- dard idea i.a3. In each case, you'd have to compare the reversed positions concretely to be sure of what the differences are. a2) 6 e4 is a Sveshnikov without the possi- bility of 6 ... ttJdb4, but as above, White's posi- tion after the unexciting 6 ... ttJb6 is probably not helped by the weakening move a3. Further- more, Black can play the forcing 6 ... ttJf4 7 d4 exd4 8 i.xf4 dxc3 9 bxc3 1Wf6 (9 ... ~xdl + 10 Itxdl i.xa3 is also possible due to the pawn on a3) 10 1Wd2 i.g4 11 eS 'iVe6. Black actually gets a better position than White does in the re- versed lines, because his queen has access to b3 and ... i.xa3 is possible in some situations. a3) Beim-Rublevsky, Frankfurt 2000 con- tinued with the more flexible 6 ~c2! i.e7 (6 ... ttJxc3!?) 7 e3 O-O 8 i.bS!? (8 i.d3 is strate- gically interesting; for example, 8 ... g6 9 ttJxdS ~xdS 10 h4 i.g4 11 i.e41We6 12 b4) 8 ... i.g4! 9 i.xc6 i.xf3 10 gxf3 bxc6. Black's pressure

against vulnerable points down the d- and b- files compensates for his weak pawns on the open c-file. b) 4 ... d6 can lead to a calm position follow- ing S e3 g6 6 d3 (6 d4 Ji..g7 is solid) 6 ... Ji..g7. Black's move-order has the advantage that S d4 can be answered by S. .. e4 6 liJgS Ji..f5. Com- pare the 2 ... d6Iines in Chapter 3; here White's move a3 is not useful. We now return to 4 ... g6 (D): w 5 d4 Usually the best answer to the move ... g6 is to counter directly like this (or to play e3 and d4). Here the effectiveness of S d4 is somewhat reduced because a3 has become irrelevant. I mentioned the dubious move S b4? in Chapter 4 (via 2 liJc3 liJf6 3 a3, etc.). Black responds S. .. e4! 6 liJgS Ji..g7 with the idea of ... h6 and after liJh3, ... gS, hemming in the knight on the rim. Then 7 .i:!.bl O-O! 8liJgxe4liJxe4 9liJxe4 .i:!.e8 gives Black more than enough compensa- tion. The problem is that Black is developing too quickly for White to coordinate. For exam- ple, 10 liJc3 (10 d3 dS! 11 cxdS 'iVxdS 12 e3 fS 13 liJd2 as! gives us the familiar sacrificial idea 14 bSliJd4!) 1O ... d6 11 e3 Ji..xc3 12 dxc3 'iVh4! intending ... Ji..g4 or ... Ji..fS (not 13 g3?? li'e4). 5 ••• exd4 6liJxd4 Ji..g7 7 Ji..g5!? White tries for maximum central control. 7 liJxc6 bxc6 8 g3 O-O 9 Ji..g2 J::te8 puts Black ef- fectively a tempo ahead of the Three Knights Variation of Chapter 6, since a3 is at best inef- fectual. Nor does 7 g3 go very well with a3; for example, 7 ... O-O 8 Ji..g2 .i:!.e8 is comfortable for Black. Note that getting queens off via 9liJxc6 dxc6! 10 'iVxd8 .l:i.xd8 11 Ji..f4 Ji..e6 doesn't help White's cause. 7 ... h6 8 iLh4 O-O 9 e3l:te810 iLe2 (D)

... liJxd4!? Korchnoi proposes 1O ... dS. This is a dynamic tactical device that you should look for in simi- lar positions (whether from the King's Indian or Modem Defence, for example), especially if ... gS is possible for Black. The primary points are that 11 liJxd5 is inferior due to 11...gS 12 liJxf6+ (12 Ji..g3liJxd5 13liJxc6 bxc6 14 cxdS iLxb2) 12 ... iLxf6 13liJxc6 bxc6, and 11 cxd5 is also ineffective after 11...liJxd4 12 exd4 gS with the idea 13 Ji..g3 liJxdS 14 O-O c5!? (or 14 ... c6). This sequence works because White hasn't castled and every move by Black has been directly aggressive. Of course, White isn't that badly off, and can play 11 liJxc6 bxc6 12 cxdS cxdS, with chances for both sides. 11 exd4 g5 Again, 11.. .dS! was a good move. 12 iLg3liJe4 13 O-O d6 14 iLd3!

A fascinating move which looks ridiculous because it creates a big hole on d4. But the weakness is compensated for by the control that White has over dS and the consequent

110 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

difficulty that Black faces in freeing his game. In practice, White can slowly work around the centre, usually by playing g3, i.g2 and O-O, and then aiming to achieve f4. Black's task is to exploit the d4 outpost or otherwise chal- lenge White's centre.

4. .. i.h4

The other established variation goes 4 ... i.c5 5ltJxe5! (else after 5 ... d6, White's pawn-struc- ture looks rather silly) 5 ... ltJxe5 6 d4 i.b4 7 dxe5ltJxe4 8 'iVd4ltJxc3 9 bxc3 (D).

Now 9 ... i.e7 is supposed to be about equal after 10 'iVg4 Rf8 11 'iVg3 d6, but White has some interesting and untried options such as 10 i.d3 0-0110-0 d6 12 i.f4. Black's alternative is 9 ... i.a5 10 i.a3 d6 11 exd6 O-O 12 O-O-O cxd6 13 'iVxd6!? (13 i.xd6l:te8 14 i.d3) 13 ... 'iVxd6 14 i.xd6 J:le8 15 Rb2 i.d7 16 i.d3 i.c6 17 f3, an ending that has arisen in some top-level games. Black should be able to work his way to a draw with extremely accurate play, but the average mortal will probably be unsatisfied with this.

[diagram]
6 a3 simply pushes Black to where he wants

to go after 6 ... i.c5 7 b4 i.b6. 6 i.e2 is playable but non-threatening. 6 ... h6 Probably not the optimal solution to the po- sition, but it does prevent a piece from going to g5. Black has other ideas such as 6 ... O-O and 6 ... i.c5, leading to complex positional strug- gles. For example, 6 ... i.c5 7 i.g2ltJd4 8ltJxd4 i.xd4, as in Gulko-Karpov, Reykjavik 1991, leaves White a choice of plans: ltJe2 followed by d4 (assuming the bishop retreats from d4), or implementing the pawn-break f4. Theory considers this line to be equal. The logical 6 ... i.g4 is consistent with the theme of controlling White's weak square d4. An excellent illustration of both sides' ideas was Bu Xiangzhi-Bacrot, Turin Olympiad 2006:

7 h3 i.xf3 8 'iVxf3 ltJd4 9 'iVdl c6 10 i.g2 O-O

11 O-O i.c5! (retreating the bishop to c5 is typi-

cal, and why not? Once Black has sidestepped 4 ... i.c5 5 ltJxe5, the bishop can return to its ideal post) 12 ~h2 (D) (12ltJa4 'iVe7 13ltJxc5?! dxc5 leaves White's d-pawn as a target down the open file).

A representative position from this variation. The combination of ... i.g4xf3 and ... i.c5 has cemented control over d4, whereas White has opportunities based upon kingside expansion: 12 ... a5 13 f4 b5!? 14 f5 b4 15 ltJa4ltJd7!? (or 15 ... i.a7) 16ltJxc5 dxc5 (16 ... ltJxc5 17 f6!) 17 g4 f6 18 h4 h6 19 i.d2 ~f7!. The king escapes to the centre and frustrates attacking plans by White. The game was logically drawn. 7 i.g2 i.xc3+?!

FOUR KNIGHTS VARIATION 111

This exchange is rather cooperative, giving White the bishops and eliminating d4 as an outpost. While this pawn-structure may be ac- ceptable for Black, he has trouble finding counterplay. One alternative is 7 ... i.g4, again retaining the option of ... i.cS. 8 bxe3 i.e6 9 lbd2! White has two ideas: he can continue lbfl- e3 and lbdS or lbfS, a manoeuvre not possible after O-O; and by keeping his king in the centre he can neutralize Black's potential attack by ... 'iVd7, ... hS-h4 and/or ... lbh7-gS. Still, castling and combining ideas of lbh4-fS and f4 is also a reasonable strategy. 9 ... hS 10 l:i.bl b6 11 h4lbd7 12lbn lbe7 13 lbe3 f614 d4! (D)

If you compare this position with a Nimzo- Indian Defence, you will see that White's pawn on c4 is well-defended and that the move f4 is coming under better circumstances than in most lines of that opening. White has the advantage. 14 ••• lbf8 IS l:i.b2! This rook will be useful on the second rank, whether on d2, e2 or f2. IS. ..

For a long time this safe move was quite pop- ular, since it prepares the highly desirable ad- vance d4.

Finally we arrive at the move that most grand- masters play. White's idea should be obvious by now: to control the hl-a8 diagonal, get castled, and attack in the centre or on the queenside.

For many years this move was entirely ig- nored, since it isolates White's e-pawn. Now it has put some players off 4 ... i.cS altogether! White's idea is simply to get his pieces out while exerting pressure down the d-file and maintaining a space advantage. White has various slower moves. He can play 8 i.e2, for example, covering g4. For his part, Black can insert ... O-O and/or ... a6 before committing to ... d6. However, it turns out that the positional themes tend to be similar regard- less of move-order, so I'm only going to look at the traditional main line 8 d3 (8 h3 d6 9 d3 will transpose) 8 ... d6 (D). Black's obvious intent is to control the out- post on d4, at the same time using the pseudo- outpost on eS for his pieces. White wishes to develop as actively as possible and use his good bishop to make threats, normally in conjunc- tion with play down the f-file and/or a break with M. In addition, he has an outpost on dS,

122 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

which in comparison with Black's on d4 is somewhat difficult to make use of, because he hasn't another piece to support it. White generally covers g4 first by 9 h3, and after 9 ... O-O, Black has a number of possible plans, but the time-tested idea of ... ttJe8-c7-e6 almost always seems a good remedy. For exam- ple, 10 ~g2 (or 10 .tg2 ttJe8 11 .:tn ttJc7 12 ~gl ttJe6 with equal chances) 1O ... ttJe8 II.te2 ttJc7 12 g4?! (this doesn't really do much, espe- cially as ... f5 is not Black's plan; better is 12 .te3 ttJe6 13 ttJd5 ttJc6, Garcia Gonzales-Uhlmann, Leipzig 1973, and now White should consider exchanging off his bad bishop by 14 .tg4, be- cause 14 ~d2 ttJed4 15 .th5 .l:.b8 gives Black excellent queenside prospects) 12 ... ttJe6 13 .te3 a6!? (attack with ... b5 is part of Black's arsenal; he can also play simply 13 ... ttJc6 and ... ttJed4, followed by a similar queenside expansion) 14 'ii'd2.l::i.b8 15 ttJd5 b5 16 b3 ttJd4!? 17 .tdl .te6! with a pleasant advantage, Garcia Marti- nez-Boey, Skopje Olympiad 1972. White has- n't a very constructive plan, and he has to watch out for a well-timed ... .txd5. 8 ••• cxd4 9 WNxd4 O-O (D) Now White can't play 10 'iVxe5?? ttJg4+, of course, but he has got quite a bit of traction from these positions. Along with the two bish- ops and pressure against Black's weak d-pawn, the open f-file and outpost on d5 can come in handy. It's worth noting, however, that Black has his own trumps, most importantly a won- derful knight on an outpost square that is in front of an isolated pawn on an open file! Fur- thermore, his remaining bishop is a good one, which can exert pressure on that weak e-pawn. In those respects, his position resembles a Sicil- ian Defence. Notice that Black's two knights, rook and queen are poised to maintain a piece on e5 after exchanges, whereas White some- times has to recapture with a pawn in response to a piece exchange on d5. Although White can exert a degree of pressure in this position, I think that it is acceptable for Black.

w As in other variations of the English Four Knights, 4 ... ~b4 is the theoretically most ad- vanced and complex answer to 4 g3. Some people consider it the main line of the entire Reversed Sicilian, which is hard to argue with. As we see with other lines involving ... ~b4, the simple development of a bishop spawns an as- tonishing number of unique situations. My aim is to find unity where I can by relating similar structures. 5~g2 For reasons of space, I'm going to forego a treatment of the moves 5 ljjd5 and 5 ~g2 O-O 6 ljjd5. Some specialists use one or the other, pri- marily as a way to steer clear of main lines and perhaps to play with less risk as White. This may come at the cost of reducing one's winning chances, because according to current theory Black has some fairly clear solutions that per- mit him to equalize without too much trouble. That is not to say that he shouldn't study these lines in order to be prepared, nor that White won't want to investigate them for potential use as a surprise weapon. 5 ••• 0-060-0 At this point Black's main moves are 6 .. J:te8 and 6 ... e4. In fact, other moves are legitimate, and the subtleties of move-order, including transpositions, are too complicated to go into here (nor are they well covered in theory books). But I think that it's worth thinking about the ef- fects of playing 6 ... ~xc3 (D), which is a rea- sonably good move in and of itself, but also a very instructive one. w Black's two recaptures illustrate the overlap of this ... ~b4 system with earlier ones in this book: a) After 7 dxc3, 7 ... e4 8ljjel transposes to a main line below, but here Black can play solidly by 7 ... d6, when White will have difficulties breaking down Black's centre. For example, 8 "fic2 (White wants to get e4 in; the alternative 8 ljjel ~e6 9 b3 'ilVd7 10 ljjc2 ~h3 llljje3 ~xg2 12 'it>xg2ljje7 gives Black at least equality; for

w White lacks a d-pawn to attack in the centre, and playing f4 at some point may come up short after ... exf4, since so many black pieces can be trained against e4. This kind of position can fairly be called equal. b) Thus the recapture 7 bxc3 is generally pre- ferred. Then Black can play 7 ... e4 (for 7 ... .l:!.e8, see below). In doing so, he agrees to 8 lZ)g5 l:!.e8, transposing to a main line considered later, but he has prevented White from playing some of the effective lZ)el lines below, since now 8lZ)el d5 9 cxd5 'iVxd5 is fully satisfactory for Black. The main drawback to this move- order is that White can play 8lZ)d4, possibly en- tering into a notorious and important line that goes 8 ... .:te8 (8 ... d5 should definitely be con- sidered, when 9 d3! isn't clear) 9 d3 h6!? (the- ory holds that 9 ... exd3 10 exd3 h6 is adequate for Black, but that can be challenged) 10 dxe4!

This is Kasparov's move, which may yield White some advantage. The idea is to open lines for White's pieces and mobilize his king- side majority: 1O ... lZ)xe4 11 ~c2 d5!? 12 cxd5 'iVxd5 13 l:!.dl ! (Kasparov himselflost a classic battle to Karpov after 13 e3 lZ)a5!? 14 f3 lZ)d6

To that end, Black's 8th- and 9th-move options should be consid- ered.

What a strange idea! White reduces his con- trol of d4 and e5, while taking two extra moves

FOUR KNIGHTS VARIATION 125

to land on the uninspiring c2-square. OK, then White attacks the b4-bishop, but as we have re- peatedly seen, Black is going to play ... ~xc3 anyway. What's the point? For one thing, White's bishop on g2 is unmasked, covering the key e4- and d5-squares. If, after ... ~xc3, White opens the d-file by dxc3, a subsequent ~g5 and ttJe3 will strengthen that pressure. Before turning to 7 ttJel, here are the open- ings of two other famous games involving other logical responses to 6 ... ne8: a) Petrosian-Gheorghiu, Moscow 1967 went

7 d3 h6!? (preventing ~g5; 7 ... ~xc3 would re-

turn to normal lines) 8 ttJd5! ~f8 (8 ... ~c5 keeps the bishop more active; the trade-off is that White may gain time by attacking it with M) 9 ttJxf6+ fVxf6 10 ttJd2! d6 11 ttJe4! ~d8 12 ttJc3 (D).

White's knight has gone from gl to c3 in four moves! As a result, we have arrived at a typical English Opening position, in which the emphasis is upon exploitation of the long diag- onal above all else. Black would normally be ahead in development, but he too has expended time in playing ... h6 and ... ~M-f8, whereas the rook on e8 might be better-placed on f8 anyway, to support .. .f5. The game continued 12 ... ~d7 13 b4! fVc8 14 nbl ~h3 15 e4! (a re- markable move! It's not so strange to put one's pawns on light squares if the g2-bishop is coming off the board, but White does so at the cost of granting Black a ready-made outpost on d4; the point is revealed by moves 17 and 18) 15 ... ~xg2 (15 ... ~e6 16 ~e3 ~e7 17 f4! is the other idea behind 15 e4) 16 'it>xg2 g6 17 h4! ~g7 18 h5! g5 19 ttJd5 ttJd4 20 ttJe3 f5 21 ~b2!, and White has won the crucial f5-square, dooming Black's bishop to passivity. He went on to win. b) Smyslov-Mestel, Hastings 1972/3 was another inspiration for English Opening devo- tees: 7 ttJd5 e4 (7 ... ~c5! is a solid alternative) 8 ttJel d6 9 d3 ~xel 10 Ihel exd3. Now 11 'iYxd3 should favour White, but Smyslov finds a more ingenious solution: 11 ~g5! dxe2 12 lhe2 I:txe2 13 'iYxe2 ~e6 14 ttJxf6+ (Smyslov mentions 14 ~xf6 gxf6 15 nel) 14 ... gxf6 15 ~h4. For a pawn, White gets to shatter his op- ponent's kingside and retain his well-placed pieces. 7 •.• ~xc3 8 dxc3 e4?! 8 ... h6 is normal; compare the next game. It's instructive to see how White happily gives back the bishop-pair for control of the centre: 9 ~g5! h6 10 ~xf6 ~xf6 11 ttJc2 d6 12 ttJe3! (D)

The ttJel-c2-e3 manoeuvre is employed in most situations involving dxc3 and ... e4. What wasn't realized for some time was how much more powerful this set-up is when White has had the opportunity for ~g5 and ~xf6. Black will have considerable difficulty protecting his e-pawn, and the idea of a timely ttJd5 keeps Black off balance. 12•.• l:i.e5 One of White's main ideas is f4, and in the case of 12 ... ~f5 13 f4! it is particularly strong, threatening g4. 13 ~b3! l:tb8 14 nadl b6 15 ~c2 ~f5?! 16 nd5!

My selection of examples is meant to reflect how representative tactics and posi- tional trade-offs interact. The positions are rather unstable, however, and there is certainly no hard-and-fast rule as to where both sides should put their pieces. A correspondence game between two top players is an appropriate vehicle for examining such a theoretical varia- tion. 9f3 White challenges e4 with the f-pawn, by far the most common strategy in modem chess. It's worth looking briefly at the pawn-structure and the play that results from the older and natural 9 d3 exd3 10 exd3 (D). White has opened up his bishop's long diag- onal and kept the bishop-pair. On the other hand, his centre is relatively immobile and Black has no weaknesses. I'm not going to cover the position in any depth, but the follow- ing options seem most important: a) 1O ... d6 is solid. A logical continuation is II ~b I h6 12 tbe4 tbxe4 13 .Jixe4 tbe5 with only a faint edge for White, if any, after 14 .Jif4. b) 1O ... b6 is also sensible, when White will usually aim for d5 with his knight; for example, II tbh3.Jib7 12 tbf4 with a small advantage. A significant alternative is 11 .Jid5!? tbxd5 12 cxd5, when 12 ... h6 can lead to the drawing line 13 tbxf7!? 'it>xf7 14 ~h5+ ~g8 15 dxc6 dxc6 161i.xh6 gxh6 17 ~g6+ ~h8 18 ~xh6+ ~g8 19'iiig6+~h8 20~ael!? J.d7!, and here White should repeat! c) The best move may well be IO ... h6. Then 11 tbf3 b6 is Black's standard plan to oppose the long diagonal, but he might also consider ll...d5!? 12 cxd5 tbxd5, which is a familiar type of position in which White's central pawns are targets. White's most frequent reply to IO ... h6 is 11 tbh3, when 11...d6 is usually played. But I think that it would be consistent with similar positions in this book to open things up for the knights by 11...d5!. Then it's White who has to work to get his share of the play. For example, 12 cxd5 tbxd5 13 J.d2 tbe5! 14 d4 J.g4! 15 f3 J.xh3 16 J.xh3 tbc4 with dominant knights and weak squares in White's camp, or 12 tbf4!? dxc4 13 dxc4, and either 13 ... .Jig4 14 'iiib3 tbe5 or the simple 13 ... 'iVxdl 14 .l:f.xdl tbe5 favours Black because of White's weak light squares. Thus 9 d3 isn't terribly promising. We return to 9 f3 (D):

130 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

9 ... e3!? This is I.Zaitsev's remarkable move, made famous by Karpov's use of it versus Kasparov. The very important alternative is 9 ... exf3 10 lL'lxf3 d5, after which White has two primary choices: a) The traditional main line (condensed) af- ter 11 cxd5 goes 11..:~xd5 12 lL'ld4 ~h5 13 lL'lxc6 bxc614 e3 .i.g4 15 ~a4l:te6 (D) (the al- ternative 15 ... .i.e2 also leads to equality after 16 l:txf6 gxf6 17 .i.xc6 .i.f3 18 .i.xa8 l:txa8 19 fVh4 ~xh4). w 16 .l:i.b1 (or 16 .i.a3 .Jte2 17 !!f4lL'lg4 18 h3 lL'le5) 16 ... .Jte2. Now the stem game Sigurjons- son-Smyslov, Reykjavik 1974 saw 17 .l::te1?, losing to 17 ... lL'lg4 18 h3 ~f5 19 .u.xe2 ~xb1 20 ~xg4 'iVxc 1+ 21 'it>h2 I:!.d8 22 fVb4 h6 23 c4 ~d 1 24 lIf2 ~e 1 0-1.

There's a lot of unexplored territory here. Black plays

11...lL'le412 'iVc2 (D) (versus ... lL'lxc3) and now:

bI) 12 ... dxc4 13 l:tb1 f5 14 g4! is Kaspa- rov's fine conception, to break down Black's grip over e4. There have been many tries for Black, but nothing looks very good. Briefly: b11) The original game Kasparov-Ivanchuk, USSR Ch, Moscow 1988 went 14 ... ~e7 15 gxf5 lL'ld6 16 lL'lg5 'iVxe2 17 .i.d5+ ~h8 18 'iVxe2 l:txe2 19 .i.f4 lL'ld8 20 .i.xd6 cxd6 21 lIbel! l:!.xe1 22l:txe1 .i.d7 23 l:te7 .i.c6 24 f6! 1-0. b12) Kasparov thinks that 14 .. .fxg4 15lL'le5 lL'ld6 16lL'lxc6 bxc6 17 e4 is best, but White has the better chances. b13) 14 ... lL'ld6!? 15 .i.g511Vd7 16lL'lh4 (Stohl suggests 16 .i.f4) 16 ... lL'lf7 (P.David-Polak, Olomouc 1995) and I think White should play 17 .Jtcl! with the idea 17 ... f4 18 l:txf4 g5 19 .l::txf7 ~xf7 20 lL'lf5 with e4 to follow. b2) 12 ... .Jtf5! seems underestimated.

The light squares are always the key to Black's play against the bishops. White has at least four logical moves here.

w b21) The most direct is IS 1:.f4, which is well met by IS ... fS 16 g4?! (16 1:.bl ~aS 17 cxdS 'iixdS) 16 ... ~aS 17 gxfS gxfS 18 1:.xfS ~xc4 with a positional superiority for Black, Solonar-Meins, Altenkirchen 200S. b22) A second way to prosecute this line is IS .Bf4; for example, IS .. .fS 16 cxdS 'iixdS 17 g4! 1:.e7! 18 e3 'iic4 19 1:.ac1 1:.ae8 with an equal position, Gretarsson-Stefansson, Reykja- vik 2004. b23) Also critical is IS 'iid3 fS, and Black seems to hold his own after 16 .Bf4 1:.c8!? 17 g4 1:.f8, or 16 1:.bl ~aS 17 cxdS 'itxdS 18 .Bf4 1:.ac8!; for example, 19 1:.bS 'itxa2 20 .ieS c6 21 1:.bbl 'iidS. b24) Arguably the most important sequence is IS 1:.bl ~a5 16 cxdS 'iixdS, when 17 .Bf4 ~c4 18 'iid3 1:.ac8 19 1:.b4 bS 20 a4 a6 21 axbS axbS 22 g4 is given by Pritchett as favouring White. However, Black seems OK if he plays 22 ... c6. So perhaps 9 ... exf3 is satisfactory for Black, but let's return to 9 ... e3!? (D). w lOd3 Various grandmasters have played 10 dxe3!?, in order to get rid of the annoying pawn on e3 and acquire a central majority of sorts. Natu- rally, White's pawn-structure suffers, but two bishops often become effective with shattered pawns and pawn sacrifices. Black seems to have several methods of holding his own, yet I can't help showing the game Kasparov-Sad- vakasov, Astana 2001, which is illustrative of broader issues: 1O .. :+}Ve7 11 ~h3!? 'itcs 12 ~f4 llVxc4 13 e4 d6 14 ~d3 (Kasparov men- tions 14 .Be3!? ~xc3 IS .Bf2 with compensa- tion; that will take the form of the bishop-pair coming to life after ~dS) 14 ... ~eS IS 'itxc4 ~xc4 (D). w White has two bishops, but they're passive and his queenside pawn-structure is weak and blockaded.

132 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

After this we enter a relatively forced se- quence. 11 cxdS tDxdS 12 ~b3 hasn't been deeply explored: 12 ... tDaS!? (12 ... 'iVxgS 13 f4 'iVhS 14 i.xdS and now 14 ... 'iVxe2!? IS i.xf7+ c;t>h8 is interesting and probably OK for Black, while 14 ... i.g4 has also been suggested) 13 'iYa3 b6 (13 ... 'ilVxgS 14 ~xaS 'iVeS is considered equal, although White might want to look care- fully at IS i.b2) 14 f4 i.b7 IS i.b2 cS with chances for both sides, Gulko-Ivanchuk, Hor- gen 1995. 1l. .. tDaS 12 'iVa3 c6 13 cxdS cxdS 14 f4 i.g4 14 ... tDc6!? was played in Kasparov-Karpov, World Ch match (game 2), Seville 1987, when IS l:tbl is held to give White the advantage, but that could bear some further investigation. IS tDf3 Likewise, I'll skip over ISl:!.el, which is con- sidered equal due to the line IS ... h6 (IS ... l:!.c8!?) 16 tDf3 tDc6 17l:!.bl 'iVd7; for example, 18 i.b2 i.h3 19 c4 i.xg2 20 c;t>xg2 d4, Schacher-Maki Duro, European Clubs Cup, Izrnir 2004. IS. •. tDc6 (D) w All right, what have we here? Black com- mands more space and his intrusive pawn on e3 interferes with White's pieces. His king is safe and his pieces are well-developed (the queen's rook can be placed aggressively on c8 or take on a useful defensive role on b8). Black may also be able to scare up some kingside chances, if only because several of White's pieces are cut off from that sector, a result of the e3-pawn 'di- viding the board in two', in Kasparov's phrase. For all that, White may stand slightly better from a theoretical point of view. His position is very elastic, in that most attempts by Black to make progress will serve White's pieces well, in particular his bishops. Given enough time, he may be able to create and exploit weak- nesses on Black's queenside, as well as open- ing lines for his queen's bishop, probably by means of c4 at some point. Of course, not all of this is necessarily achievable, and practice has yielded mixed results. I'll simply indicate a few paths.

16 h3 (D)

Possibly 16 nb 1 'ilVd7 17 'iVb3 b6 18 i.b2 is better because it avoids weaknesses. On the flip side, Black can keep his bishop aggressively posted on g4 and hold forth the option of a properly-timed ... i.h3.

Two other ideas give you a feel for the com- plexity of this variation: a) 16 ... i.xf3 and now: al) 17 l:!.xf3!? d4 18 i.b2 :tc8 19 lIbl, Gulko-Komeev, Montreal 2006. Now 19 ... dxc3 20 i.xc3 tDdS would cement the influential pawn on e3. On the other hand, the disappear- ance of Black's d-pawn does wonders for the white bishops. a2) 17 i.xf3 allows Black to do without ... d4 for a while: 17 ... hS!?(orI7 ...

Black could divert White by using ... h6, ... gS and ... lbhS to attack his somewhat loose kingside; for example, 17lbe 1 (intending B lbc2 and/or ':f3) 17 ... lbhS!? 18 ':f3 (18 Rh2 gS) 18 ... gS!? 19 fxgS (19 lbc2 g4 20 hxg4 i.xg4 21 ':xe3 ':xe3 22 lbxe3 i.xe2 23 lbxdS i.xd3 is unclear, to say the least!) 19 .. :~VxgS (with the idea ... d4 and ... lbeS) 20 lbc2 lbxg3 21 i.xe3 'iVh4 and Black has an opportunistic position, intending 22 i.f2lbxe2+ 23 'it>f1 ~S 24 ':e 1 i.fS! with unclear prospects. 17 'iio>h2 "fic718 ':bl (D) Good enough, although 23 i.xf6! gxf6 24 B i.xdS looks stronger still. 18 ... b6?!

In Chapter 4 (the 2 g3 section) we looked into the Reversed Dragon lines in which White doesn't play lbc3, but rather sets up with d3, lbbd2 and a3.

Since the ideas in these two systems tend to be the same, r m not going to go into the Reversed Dragon very

deeply, but the set-up is popular with leading players and if White plays the English Four Knights he definitely should know the funda- mental themes and strategies . . If Black doesn't like to retreat with 6 ... lbb6, he has to put up with the early pawn-break d4 by White. For example, 6 ... .lte6 (White was threatening 7 lbxe5, and 6 ... .lte7 doesn't help: 7 lbxe5! lbxc3 8 .ltxc6+ bxc6 9 dxc3; further- more, after 6 ... lbxc3 7 bxc3 e4, 8lbd4lbxd4 9 cxd4 'iVxd4 10 lIbl is a promising gambit, with White a tempo ahead of a similar Sicilian line, in a position where a tempo truly counts! 8lbgl is also good, since it's not possible to protect e4 without concessions) 7 O-O .lte7 8 d4, and 8 ... lbxc3 9 bxc3 e4 can be met by 10 lbel f5 11 lbc2 with the idea f3, or 10 lbe5!? lbxe5 11 dxe5 'iVxdl 1211xdl; for example, 12 ... .ltf5 13 lId411d8 14 .lte311xd4 15 cxd4 f6 16 f4 fxe5 17 fxe5 c6 18l:tbl b6 19 llf1, Marin-Kveinys, Istanbul Olympiad 2000.

It isn't con- sidered terribly dangerous, and Black has more than one reasonable response, including 8 ... .lte6 and 8 ... a5, but the most unique riposte is the bi- zarre-looking 8 ... g5!? (D). w Black's brute-force idea is ... g4 and ... h5-h4. That is naturally no guarantee of advantage, or even equality. But it has been successful in enough games, sometimes devastatingly so, that one wonders why White isn't using the idea versus the regular Dragon. The answer, of course, is that he has already castled! I'll leave you to the books and databases if you want fur- ther details on 8 lIbl. b) 8 a4 a5 has fallen from favour, perhaps because b4 is a 'real' outpost for Black, whereas b5 is only a temporary one.

White has the dual ideas of ii.g5, trying to clarify his positional advantages by avoiding attack (see below), and ~dl, to enforce d4. The immediate 10 b4!? is also played, as it is in the Reversed Dragon, with White having gained the extra move ii.e3.

Black's choice of a structure with .. .f6 has become more popular than any other. Perhaps White should be looking at this same formation in the Sicilian Defence, if only as a way to avoid enervating theoretical work. 11 ••• a5 Compare this more aggressive move with the idea of playing ... tiJd4 directly from the previous game. Here l1...tiJd4 12 tiJd2 c6 13 tiJde4 has been played a lot, having in mind some combi- nation of e3, .i.b2 and a queen move to prepare lIdl. Black should steer clear of 11...~d7?! 12 tiJe4! tiJdS 13 ~c2, which favoured White in Karpov-Hjartarson, Candidates match (game 2), Seattle 1989.

w 13 tiJd2 White's most common idea versus ... tiJd4 is this retreat. It covers b3 and prepares to boot Black's knight out with 14 e3. 13 ... ~c8 A surprising number of strong players have barely settled in their chairs when they had to get up again, as a result of playing 13 ... tiJdS?? 14 .i.xdS! .i.xdS IS e3 tiJe6 16 e4.

White can also go the other way: IS 'iiVc2 fol- lowed by l:!.dl and, with luck, tiJce4-cS. At some point, the move a4 may become essential to stop ... a4. Compare the game. 15 ••. tiJd6 This stops tiJc4, which might be the answer to IS ... a4.

16 a4 .i.g4! 17 f3 .i.e6 18 f4 tiJf7 19 tiJb3?

White takes his eye off his charge on a4. Probably 19 .i.b2 is correct. ... .i.b4! 20 ~c2 .i.h3 (D) There's no reason for 20 ... .i.xc3?! 21 ~xc3 tiJxa4 22 ~c2. While this is playable for Black, giving up his dark-squared bishop is a high price to pay. w 21 tiJe4 .i.xg2 22 ~xg2 f5 23 tiJf2 At this point, 23 ... exf4! 24 gxf4 ~d7! would target a4 again, after which 2S tiJd2 tiJdS! 26 tiJc4 ~e6 leaves White all bottled up. We can safely say that the relevant part of the opening is over. Even discounting White's errors above, Black seems able to equalize in this variation by means of natural moves. In general, the Reversed Dragon produces unbalanced positions which continue to attract master players on both sides of the board.

6 Three Knights and Closed English

The main subject of this chapter is the Closed English, which, broadly speaking, is defined by

1 c4 e5 2 lbc3 lbc6, but I use it to refer to the

lines that continue 3 g3 g6 4 .tg2 .tg7. An- other set of independent variations begins with 3 lbf3, and I'll start with those.

1 c4 e5 2 lbc3 lbc6 3 lbf3 (D)

White is willing to transpose to the English Four Knights variation after 3 ... lbf6. Other- wise, Black has two main ways to go his own way, as illustrated in the next two games, with alternatives in the notes. Three Knights Variation

[diagram]
Yakovich - Peek Amsterdam 1995 This is called the Three Knights Variation'. Apart from 3 .. .f5 (featured below), Black's other options are unimpressive; for example, 3 ... d6 4 d4 takes the centre, and Black is also vulnerable to the advance d5. 3 ... .tc5 is well met by 4 e3! (with the idea 5 d4), after which White wins the centre with tempo; Black has the particular problem that the normal idea 4 ... d6 5 d4 .tb6 runs into 6 b4!

Now 7 c5 is threatened, winning the bishop, while 6 ... lbxb4? loses to 7 ~a4+ lbc6 8 d5, and the best sequence 6 ... exd4 7 exd4 as still leads to a clear advantage for White following 8 b5 lbce7 9 .td3. After 3 ... .tc5, by the way, the trick 4lbxe5!? is best met by 4 ... .txf2+! 5 ~xf2 lbxe5 6 d4 ~f6+!' This favours White after, say, 7 ~el lbg4 8 ~d3 ~f2+ 9 ~d2, but not by much. The best irregular 3rd-move option from Black's view might be 3 ... .tb4!? Then 4lbd5 e4!? and 4 ~c2 d6 5lbd5 are directions to look in. It's likely that White will come out with a modest advantage. 4d4 White takes the principled course of grab- bing the centre when it is offered him. He can also play slowly by 4 d3 or 4 g3, heading for a Closed English. More significantly, some play- ers may not feel comfortable facing 4 e3 intend- ing 5 d4. Then 4 ... .tg7 5 d4 d6 is a natural course, but Black has to be willing to play with less space if White chooses d5 soon; his main consolation is that e4 will follow at the cost of a tempo (e3-e4). The most interesting option is 4 .. .f5 5 d4 e4, which might be compared with 3 ... f5 4 d4 e4 below. In that case, Black may

Then Black dis- covered the nice solution 6 ... tbce7! with the idea of ... c6 and rapid development. Mellado- G.Georgadze, Manresa 1995 continued 7 tbxd4 c6 8 tbxe7 tbxe7 9 'iVd2 h6 10 i.h4 0-011 e3 dS with a level game. 5 •.• i.g7 6 tbxc6 bxc6 7 g3 tbe7 A distinguishing move, which prepares cas- tling, covers c6 in anticipation of ... d6 or ... dS, and keeps the long diagonal open.

9 ••• d6 Both sides have open lines for their bishops, so the most important elements are White's control of space and Black's doubled c-pawns. The latter can be a target, as can Black's a- pawn, but they can also be an advantage, in that they help to cover the central squares, and the b-file has been opened for Black's rook. 10 i.g51IbS iO ... i.e6 is well met by 11 'iVd3. Oddly enough, iO ... f6!? is a reasonable move based upon the idea 11 i.d2 i.e6, when 12 ~d3 isn't available, and 12 ~a4 'iVd7 is fine for Black. Still, either 11 i.f4 or 11 .te3 should be enough to maintain a modest advantage. 11 'iVd2 c5 121Iadl i.e6 Black would like to neutralize the powerful g2-bishop, but after 12 ... i.b7?? 13 i.xb71:txb7 14 tbdS f6 IS tbxe7+ ~xe7 16 'iVdS+ White wins material and the game.

w The move 3 ... f5 takes on extra significance when you realize that, apart from the slightly shaky 3 ... g6, it is the main way to bypass 3 ... ltJf6 with a transposition to the English Four Knights Variation. Since Black has played 2 ... ltJc6 in- stead of 2 ... ltJf6 3 ltJf3 ltJc6, it's likely that he is trying to steer clear of the latter position. Thus if White is happy playing against 3 .. .f5, he can use 3 ltJf3 to steer the game away from the Closed English (i.e. 2ltJc3 ltJc6 3 g3 g64 .Jtg2 ..Bg7).

142 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

4d4 Rohde - Zsu. Polgar New York 1992 White challenges the centre, in order to es- tablish a superior pawn-structure. This is easily the most significant independent continuation, because 4 d3 ttJf6 S g3 can be answered by S ... g6 (or S. .. .tb4) 6 .tg2 .tg7 7 O-O O-O, trans- posing into the Closed English section with ... fS below. 4 ... e4 (D) w In a sense Black's opening is anti-positional, because dS is under White's command, and if Black's centre is attacked by f3 he may well have to surrender his e4 strongpoint. On top of that he always has to deal with the tempo- winning advance dS. Finally, as we have seen in similar positions, Black's pawn-structure invites a white piece to land on f4, presenting further difficulties in freeing his game. It turns out that none of this is of decisive consequence, because of the specific circum- stance that White is not only losing a tempo due to the attack on his knight, but that the knight apparently has nowhere to go that doesn't in- volve further loss of time (or positional conces- sions). As a result, while White is rearranging his pieces, Black has time to get his own forces out and shore up his centre. After 4 ... e4, White has many legitimate moves. I shall only look at them very briefly, but you might want to do your own investiga- tion, and compare the position to 2 ttJc3 d6 3 ttJf3 fS 4 d4 e4 from Chapter 3. 5 ttJg5 This leap forward is White's most popular response to the attack. Notice the difference be- tween this position and 2 ttJc3 d6 3 ttJf3 fS 4 d4 e4 S ttJgS. With the pawn on d6, Black can play ultra-flexibly with ... c6 and perhaps ... ttJa6-c7, as he did there. But in this line his knight on c6 gives the game a different character. It attacks d4 (in conjunction with ... .tg7 in some lines), and can go to the useful square eS if White at- tacks it by dS. Here are some pickings from other moves: a) One might think that White could profit- ably avoid loss of time by S dS exf3 6 dxc6 fxg2 7 cxd7 + ~xd7 (7 ... .txd7 8 .txg2 c6 9 "iVb3 is a little awkward for Black) 8 "iVxd7+ .txd7 9 .txg2, but what looks like a small pull turns out not to be even that after 9 ... O-O-O 10 .tf4 .tcS

11 e3 ttJf6, lakat-Knaak, Plauen 1980.

b) S ttJd2 ttJf6 6 e3 is a safe line. One stan- dard solution consists of 6 ... g6 with the idea ... .tg7, since then any advance by dS extends the range of Black's bishop. But perhaps White could stir the pot by 7 g4!?, intending 7 ... ttJxg4 8 ttJdxe4 fxe4 (8 ... ~h4 9 ttJg3) 9 "iVxg4 dS 10 ~g2 with superior central control. It's an idea, anyway. c) S ttJeS!? is one of those moves that mainly aims to escape the disadvantages of the alterna- tives! White retains options of bring his queen's bishop out quickly; for example, S ... ttJxeS!? (S ... ttJf6 is safe and sound) 6 dxeS ttJe7 7.tgS h6 8 .th4 c6 9 e3 ~aS 10 .tg3 g6 11 .te2 hS, Christiansen-Browne, Las Vegas 1989, and now 12 h4! .tg7 13 ~d6! .l:i.h6 14 O-O-O is extremely strong, in view of 14 ... gS? IS "iVd2 g416 ttJxe4. d) S .tgS develops a tempo. The idea is that after White plays e3, he will have rid himself of his bad dark-squared bishop. Everyone who loves chess traps should see the outrageous grandmaster miniature S ... ttJf6 6 dS (6 ttJd2 is better) 6 ... exf3 7 dxc6 fxg2 8 cxd7+?? ttJxd7! 0-1 Doroshkevich-Tukmakov, USSR Ch, Riga 1970!

8lbgl! (D)

White moves his knight four times only to return to its original square! In the meantime, Black is to move and has a lead in development. Nevertheless, White's apparently absurd ma- noeuvre is a lesson in the importance of struc- ture, because White can force a favourable transformation by playing h4 and winning ei- ther the f4-square or the h-file, when Black's king will be insecure. 8 ... .tg7 9 h4 'ii;f7? It turns out that Black won't be able to prevent the exposure of his kingside. The superior 9 ... g4 grants White f4 but temporarily clamps down on that side of the board.

1 c4 eS 2 lbc3lbc6 3 g3 g6 4 .tg2 .tg7 (D)

w As indicated at the beginning of the chapter, I have designated this as the starting point of the Closed English, one of the most popular of 1 c4 eS systems. It begs for comparison with the Closed Sicilian, which goes 1 e4 cS 2 lbc3 lbc6, and more often than not 3 g3 g6 (3 ... e6 is also a traditional move) 4 .tg2 .tg7. In the Closed English, White has a large number of Sth-move options, some of a similar nature and others varying radically in character. But each one of them defines a structure that Black can use against the corresponding Closed Sicilian lines (1 e4 cS 2lbc3 lbc6 3 g3 g6 4 .tg2 .tg7), and as in so many cases throughout this book, White's extra tempo is partially compensated for by Black's greater information about what his opponent is doing. Naturally, White stands better than Black does in the corresponding Closed Sicilian lines, but the play tends to be fluid and hard to assess, and the opposing forces frequently don't clash at an early stage. Thus both players have a wide variety of moves to choose from, and this variation covers an enormous amount of theoretical territory. I'll try to supply examples that overlap between as many lines as possible.

White prepares M-b5, an advance that works together with the bishop on g2 by controlling squares along its diagonal. He also removes the rook from aI, where it stands exposed to pro- spective attacks by the g7 -bishop.

8. .. O-O

This can be called the main position of the Closed English, and one of the most important for the English Opening with l...e5. It arises via a large number of move-orders beginning with either 1 c4 or 1 ttJf3; for example, 1 c4 e5 2 ttJc3 d6 3 g3 f5 4 .ltg2 ttJf6 5 d3 g6 6 ttJf3 .ltg7 7 O-O ttJc6. Or it might even transpose from a Lenin- grad Dutch Defence set-up: 1 c4 f5 2 ttJc3 ttJf6

8 J::!.bI ttJc6.

The strategic ideas are multifaceted, but more often than not Black works for a kingside attack. Typical moves are ... g5, .. .f4, ... ttJg6, ... ttJf5, ... .lte6 with ... 'it'd7 and ... ii.h3, and ... 'iWe8-h5. Black can also play for a central advance, usu- ally ... d5, by itself or in conjunction with ... e4. White's plans on the other side of the board include moves such as b4-b5 and c5 (with cxd6 or c6), a4-a5, 'iVb3, .lta3/b2, J::!.fc1 and ttJd2-c4. Alternatively, or additionally, White will play in the centre, usually with the pawn advance d4 or working to place a knight on d5. Turning to defensive strategies, Black often uses the move ... b6 to thwart White's pawn ad- vance c5, or he can play ... c6, perhaps with ... d5 in mind, which challenges White's efforts to lengthen the reach of his g2-bishop. White's main defensive idea on the kingside involves a timely f4, to prevent .. .f5, but there are ad hoc kingside moves that can also prove effective. Black's 8 ... O-O is a major decision. His alter- native is to insert 8 ... a5 9 a3, and then 9 ... O-O 10 M axM 11 axb4 (D).

We shall see this in the games below. This choice is very complicated, and in fact, it comes up often enough in various contexts that it might be compared to the 'which rook?' prob- lem that confronts chess-players in so many po- sitions. When he interpolates 8 ... a5 9 a3, Black removes his a-pawn as a potential target and opens the a-file for his rook; that comes in handy by preventing an early .lta3 and gener- ally keeping an eye on squares such as al and a2. On the other hand, after White gets orga- nized by, for example, ii.b2 and 'iVb3!iVc2, he

can win the a-file by means of l:tal, taking over the open line that he so much needs in order to make progress on the queenside. B

9 b4 h610 b5 0,e7 (D)

w 11 a4 On the face of it, White is preparing as, which might be followed by a6 or b6. That is in- deed the case, and if Black gets the blocking move ... b6 in, White would especially like to open the a-file by means of as. But equally im- portantly, he wants to play i.a3 without allow- ing Black to indirectly harass the bishop by ... a6 and ... axbS at some point. After the imme- diate 11 i.a3 i.e6, intending ... a6, he should therefore consider 12 cS!? 11 cS!? immediately is the most attractive al- ternative, because it cracks open the queenside before Black can set up defensively.

There's an- other standard tactic here to watch out for: l2 ... b6 13 0,xeS! with the idea l3 ... dxeS?

That will normally help White if Black has brought most of his pieces towards the kingside to pursue an attack. With fewer pieces, White has less to fear in that sec- tor and can increase his queenside advantage. On the other hand, if Black is playing in the centre when such exchanges occur, he has as many chances of success there as White has. In that case, simplification tends to be neutral, fa- vouring one side or another only because of particulars. 15 ... g5 Opting for the kingside plan.

Oddly enough, this can also transpose ex- actly to the main line (see the next game), but the move has its own complexities. A potential drawback to Sl:tbl is that 6 ... ttJf6 7 bS ttJe7!? leads to a situation in which ... dS is an issue: 8 ttJf3 (8 d3 dS) 8 ... e4 (8 ... d6 9 O-O O-O

10 a4 as! 11 bS ttJb4 12 .i.a3 cS!, the important

idea explained in the next note. Black has compensation for his pawn, based upon his two bishops as well as White's weak dark squares and a-pawn. The cS-square is es- pecially inviting for a minor piece; for example, 13 ttJh3 0-0140-0 ttJd7! IS d3 ttJcS, having in mind either simple development or the immedi- ate attack by ... gS.

8 b5 axb5 9 axb5 ttJe7 10 ~b3!?

This not only stops ... dS, but also tries to force Black to burn up a move for the purposes of pre- vention. That isn't a one-sided gain, but it gives White's new opportunities compared to the main line (i.e., the one with an early d3, ttJf3 and O-O).

Here Black would ordinarily play 12 ... h6. With the queen on b3 he can still do so, but has to be prepared for the standard advance 13 cS+ 'it>h7 14 b6!?, trying to demolish the pawn- chain. In that case, 14 ... c6! (14 ... dxcS IS tiJxeS) IS O-O tiJfdS intending to meet 16 tiJxdS with 16 ... i.e6! would be double-edged.

... l:tc8 Black's strategy is to play ... b6 and then switch his attention to the kingside. Alterna- tively, the unsophisticated 14 ... 'iVd7, which con- nects rooks so as not to cede the a-file, may be as good as any other move. At that point, Marin suggests that White shouldn't give up the fight for the a-line, to which end 15 'iib3 g5 16 !Ia4 intending 17 l:tfa1 is logical. The risk is that af- ter 16 ... l:txa4 17 'iVxa4 f4 18 'iVa7 b6, Black gains time for an intimidating attack. Even if that ought not to win out with accurate play (for one thing, White's queen will get to b7 and be a good defender of his kingside!), it is still dan- gerous.

White has no immediate threats, but he con- trols d5 and Black has a hard time finding a pos- itive plan. In most cases, ... g5 can be met quite effectively by f4. Given time, White can look to expand on the queenside and/or the centre. Of course, Black has no cause to panic, and should come out all right if he plays accurately. Such positions may appear dull, but they can liven up in a hurry if the players are up for a fight. 11 ~d2 lIb8 12 O-O b6 This seems rather negative. The idea is prob- ably to defend a5 after White plays lLld5 or d4- d5; nevertheless, there is no immediate prob- lem, and 12 ... ~e6 with the idea 13 d4 ~f7 looks better.

Then White has more options than Black in terms of central breaks, and the exchange exf5 should produce an ad- vantage, but it's hard to make progress. 16l:tb3 (D) Dvoretsky awards this move a '!!' because he says that it anticipates ... i.h6. But we've seen in other openings how the exchange of a defending bishop on h6 is often disadvantageous anyway, since the benefit of eliminating White's more ef- fective bishop is cancelled by the creation of kingside weaknesses. Furthermore, simplifica- tion favours the side with the space advantage in such positions, and strengthens White's direct attack on c7. 16 ••. i.h6?! Thus Black should consider 16 ... c5! 17 i.e3!

Black can also seek to punish 5 e3 directly by playing ... h5, intending simply ... h4, a strat- egy always to be aware of in a position with a fianchettoed king's bishop. I'm going to spend some time on this move, because it both typifies a flank attack that isn't represented elsewhere in this book and illustrates how someone using even the most conservative of set-ups (5 e3, 6 tbge2 and 7 d4 or 7 d3) must nevertheless con- tend with radical imbalances.

162 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

The justification for this move does not con- sist entirely in Black's attacking chances, but also in the fact that the h-pawn advance will take advantage of the light squares weakened by the conjunction of g3 and e3. As so often in chess, a flank advance serves to keep the centre under control, and has the side benefit of gain- ing space. From White's point of view, it is en- couraging to see Black using time that could be spent on development, and one should always be cognisant that pawn advances imply weak- nesses on the wing where the advance takes place. How both sides react to and resolve these conflicting factors is best seen by example. 7d4 Surely the most critical response to an ad- vance with ... h5 is a counter advance in the cen- tre. But White has alternatives: a) Both here and in several other variations (such as S e4 d6 6 ttJge2 hS!?), White can halt Black's advance by playing h4 in order to do away with the issue of dealing with Black open- ing lines on the kingside. However, you could make the case that Black gets more use out of the g4-square than White does from gs. As we shall see, that's initially so, but in the long run that depends very much upon the specific ways in which play develops.

As described elsewhere in this book, the for- mation c4/d3/e4 in conjunction with lbge2, g3 and .Bg2 is called the 'Botvinnik System', and it appears throughout the English Opening. We find it in the 3 g3 -Bb4 system of Chapter 4, for example, and on both sides of the Pure Sym- metrical variations in Chapter 7. Let's take a quick overview of the ideas. At first it may seem bizarre for White to close off

THREE KNIGHTS AND CLOSED ENGLISH 165

the long diagonal for his favourite piece in the English Opening, the bishop on g2. After all, that's the piece that works in conjunction with b4-b5 to put pressure on Black's queenside, and it is often the best replacement for a knight which is exchanged on d5. To add insult to in- jury, White creates a hole on d4, in fact, a won- derful outpost for his opponent's knight, which is already poised to occupy it! Black also has an easy time developing and castling, and can con- sider preparing the pawn-breaks ... b5 and .. .f5. Finally, it doesn't appear that White will achieve d4, his traditional central advance, for some time. As you might suspect, White has an answer to these objections. On the most basic but im- portant level, he stops Black's main freeing idea ... d5; White has five pieces controlling that square already! Then, when you examine the pawn-structure, you'll see that White has sev- eral attacking methods. He can use the pawn- lever f4, putting pressure on e5 and often threat- ening to play f5 followed by the traditional pawn-storm with g4-g5. Alternatively, White has available straightforward expansion on the queenside with moves such as b4-b5, c5 and a4-a5. Furthermore, Black's most natural at- tacking method involves .. .f5, but if in that case White can play exf5, his bishop on g2 comes to life again! In fact, the set-up with a pawn on e4 and bishop on g2 can be considered a prophy- lactic measure against Black's move .. .f5. The same situation arises with a pawn on e5 and bishop on g7 in the King's Indian Defence. As for that weakness on d4, I have men- tioned elsewhere a recurring theme in chess openings (particularly in modem ones) that giving the opponent outright control of a single central square early in the game is acceptable, provided that there are countervailing advan- tages. There are far too many examples to list, but you might think about, for example: a) the numerous variations in the Sicilian Defence in which Black surrenders the d5- square facing White's pieces on an open file; b) variations of the French Defence in which Black grants White an outpost on e5, also along an open file; c) variations of the Ruy Lopez in which Black plays ... c5 and gives up d5; d) variations of the King's Indian Defence in which White gives Black an outpost on d4; e) isolated queen' s pawn positions from any number of openings, with the outpost in front of the isolated pawn. One mitigating factor in the Botvinnik Sys- tem of the Closed English is that Black's out- post is not on an open file. So it's unlikely that we shall see rooks, for example, occupying d4; moreover, the bishop on g7 has a rather remote chance of getting there soon (although to be fair, White's break with f4 might be answered with ... exf4, changing that equation by freeing Black's g7-bishop). Just as importantly, the d4 outpost isn't as secure as it may look, and in- deed, White's third method of making progress is the advance d4 itself. That's because the move d4 is naturally assisted by the queen on dl, knight on e2, and potentially, a bishop on e3. This results in Black having to keep an eye on his d4 asset. Of course, there are other more concrete considerations, such as the nature of the struc- tural change that takes place when Black puts a piece on d4 and White exchanges it. Issues like these will hopefully be clarified in the exam- ples. P. Taylor - Gallagher British League (4NCL) 200213

These are typical developing moves for both sides. Now White is ready to advance on the queenside by b4-b5, perhaps in conjunction with llac1 and c5. The question is, what is Black to do? If he plays ... lbd4, White has the dual option of lbxd4 followed by .tg5, or .txd4 and placing a knight on f4; one of these two captures will generally yield an advantage. But a retreat by the c6-knight will encourage White to make the thematic break d4. So Black begins by picking the more aggressive course of dou- bling rooks. 11 •.• 1:[f7 12 f3 This modest nudge of the f-pawn is position- ally ideal, because it frustrates Black's main plans for counterplay. Another logical move is 12 .:tac1, to make c5 a possibility, perhaps af- ter b4-b5. The famous game Benko-Botvinnik, Monte Carlo 1968 illustrates play for both sides that radically differs from our main game: 12 ... l:taf8 13 f4!? (13 b4 f4!? 14 gxf4 .th3 gives Black some interesting counterplay) 13 ... fxe4 14 dxe4 lbc8! (D) (Dvoretsky proposes that 14 ... exf4 15 gxf4 .th3 is also satisfactory, be- cause 16 .txh3 'iVxh3 17 lbxc7lbe5! leads to eventual equality). We've seen this idea before: Black prevents White from simplifying by ttJxe7+, and he has in mind ... lbd8 and ... c6. He is also ready to play ... .th3, because c7 is now defended by the rook on f7. The game continued 15 c5 .th3 16 b4 .txg2 17 ~xg2 exf4 18 gxf4 .l:te8 19 lbg3 (Botvinnik gives 19lbec3) 19 ... h5!? (with the disappearance of the bishop on g2, White's e4- pawn is just enough of a sore spot that Black can scare up play to counter White's space advan- tage) 20 b5, and now Botvinnik suggests that 20 ... ttJd8 was a safe choice, whereas 20 ... h4!? 21 bxc6 bxc6 22lbc3 hxg3 23 hxg3 .txc3 24 'iVxc3 "V/iHe6 would have been about equal.

White has a near-winning advantage: space, open lines, and play against Black's weakened kingside. Black never had a chance to play ... f4; compare the game. 13 ••. 'Iti>h814 b3 tbg8 (D) It's hard to find a positive plan; Black may now be intending .. .fxe4 and ... ~h3, to probe the light squares. Again, the retreat 14 ... tbc8, intending perhaps ... tbd8 and ... c6, was better. w 15 exfS! This exchange has become more attractive You can see that White has hindered the mobility of Black's pawns. The move ... e4 will lose a pawn, of course, and ... exf4 is position- ally disastrous, bringing a knight to a wonder- ful outpost in front of an isolated pawn on an open file. But the real key to the position is Black's bishop on e6. Since there is no pros- pect of his f-pawn advancing, it remains cut off from White's kingside; yet that is where it belongs if Black is to have positive play in the position. The upshot is that White has a free hand to build up on the queenside and in the centre while Black lacks a useful strategy. Blocking moves by bishop's pawns often serve the function of limiting the effectiveness of op- posing bishops. For example, the move ... c5 in many variations of the Nimzo-Indian Defence helps to keep White's light-squared bishop in check. Similarly, in a main-line Griinfeld varia- tion with White's centre pawns on d4, e4 and f4, ... f5 limits the range of White's queen's bishop. 16•.• tbd4 (D) now that 15 ... tbxf5 is not a possible reply.

After both 19 ... tbg4 20 ~d4 and 19 ... tbc6 20 tbec3 (or even 20 .Bd4! tbxd4 21 tbxd4), White has more space and he can go to work down the e-file.

17 fxeS!? Not a bad move at all, but 17 tbxd4! exd4 18 B ~f2 (D) is the normal transformation of this structure, clearly favouring White, who still limits the bishop on e6.

d6 6 d3 (D) It can be argued that White's move is less ac- curate than 6 ttJge2 because of the line Black chooses in the game. Both moves have their positive and negative points, however, and of- ten the move d3 will already have been played before this point - on move S, for example. 6 ..• hS!? Black employs a dynamic move that will ap- peal to those who really want to unbalance the play and avoid slow positions. Attacking by means of ... hS has been a favourite at high lev- els of play, and runs counter to the notion that Black is stuck with purely technical approaches in these Closed English variations. Black's first idea is obvious: to play ... h4 and attack the kingside. Perhaps ... hxg3 or ... h3 might follow, but in any case White is discour- aged from castling and needs to think about the disposition of his kingside. One of the less ob- vious points about 6 ... hS can be seen by com- paring the following game: 6 ... ttJd4!? 7 ttJge2 .i.g4 8 h3! (this move isn't at White's disposal in our main game) 8 ... .i.f3! (not 8 ... ttJf3+?? 9 Wfl; and 8 ... .i.xe2 9 ttJxe2 ttJxe2 10 'iVxe2 gives up the bishop-pair in a position where pawn-breaks like f4 and b4/cS are likely to hap- pen; even the abject iO ... cS won't exempt Black from lengthy defence) 9 .i.xf3 ttJxf3+ 10 ~fl (White's king will be safe on g2, and Black's knight will get chased back) iO ... ttJe7 11 ~g2 ttJd4 12 ttJxd4 exd4 13 ttJdS (D). This is Kasparov-E.Plihtz, Munich (blitz) 2002; White has a modest advantage. When Black has this 'dead point' on d4, his bishop on g7 has few prospects, and White can usually get good play by working around the pawn by playing f4 and/or b4. Here 13 ... ttJxdS 14 cxdS may be best, but gives White some c- file pressure. 7h4 White can also try 7 h3!? h4 (7 ... ttJd4 8 ttJge2 ttJxe2 and 9 "iVxe2 .i.e6 or 9 ttJxe2 ttJf6

Black has a good alternative in 15 ... exf4, which opens up the centre at a time when White can't successfully advance his pawns, so that after 16 .Bxf4 (16 gxf4 ii.d4 17 ~f3 "iYb6) 16 ... ii.e6, Black can afford the time to expand upon the queenside, perhaps by 17 ~d2 a6 18 .l:!.acl b5. 16 gxf6 ~xf6 17 fxe5 ~xe5 18 ii.f4 'iVd4 The opening has turned out well for Black, and I'll leave the game at this point.

Black probes White's position in the manner of the previous game. An alternative strategy begins with an early ... a6 and ... b5, chipping away at White's centre. This can be played in conjunction with ... lbge7 or ... lbf6. 7h3

7 h4 has been met by 7 ... ii.e6 and 7 ... lbge7,

but the most independent idea is 7 ... lbh6!? 8 d3 O-O. The knight on the rim has some reach (g4 and f5), but it can also serve to defend g5 from f7. On a specific level, Black will be able to re- spond to lbd5 by moving his own knight to e7 and playing ... c6. The costs to Black are vari- ous, but an obvious general problem is that Black's knight on h6 isn't in contact with any central squares, particularly d4 and d5. Por- tisch-Gulko, Biel Interzonal 1976 went 9 f3 (this covers g4 and thus prepares ii.e3 and d4) 9 ... ii.e6 10 lbd5 (D). Here 10 ... lbe7! followed by ... c6 is the obvi- ous way to kick the knight out of d5, and should suffice to get Black out of the opening with minimal or no disadvantage. The most critical

line would be 11 d4 exd4 12 lbxd4 ii.xd5 13 cxd5 c5! 14 dxc6 lbxc6 15 lbxc6 bxc6 with enough pressure on the b-file and long diagonal to counter White's territorial superiority.

7 Pure Symmetrical Variation

lc4c5(D) w The move 1...c5 introduces the Symmetrical English, which some think is Black's safest way to counter 1 c4. Positions within the pur- view of Symmetrical Variation theory can arise by a whole array of move-orders extending out to seven or more moves. That is, ... c5 (or even c4) may not arise until after various other moves have been played, but the resulting posi- tion will be one or another variation of the Sym- metrical. Apart from the English Opening proper with 1 c4, it's important to realize that there are a number of ways to get to a Symmetrical Eng- lish via the move 1 tbf3. In that case, both sides jockey to get their preferred variation. For ex- ample, the following lines and sub-lines may arise: a) 1 tbf3 c5 (note that this move-order al- lows White to playa Sicilian Defence by 2 e4)

[diagram]
.Jib7 4 O-O tbf6 5 c4 can lead to systems with ei- ther ... e6 or ... g6) 3 .Jig2 (3 c4) 3 ... tbf6 4 c4 e6 5 tbc3 (5 d4 cxd4 6 tbxd4) 5 ... d5 6 cxd5 (6 d4) 6 ... tbxd5. b) 1 tbf3 tbf6 2 c4 (or 2 g3 g6 3 .Jig2 .Jig7 4 O-O O-O 5 d3 c5 6 c4) 2 ... e6 (or 2 ... c5; for exam- ple, 3 d4 cxd4 4 tbxd4; or 2 ... b6 3 tbc3 c5) 3 d4 c5 4 tbc3 cxd4 5 tbxd4, and so forth. In practice, symmetry in the opening can de- velop into almost any kind of situation, but on a fundamental level we shall want to know if the game will become simplified, perhaps even sterile, or whether breaking symmetry will pro- duce rich and complex positions. In the English Opening, this issue arises most often after the introductory moves to this chapter: 2 tbc3 tbc6 3 g3 g6 4 .Jig2 .Jig7 (D) w For better or worse, I long ago dubbed this position the 'Pure Symmetrical Variation', to distinguish it from lines in which White or Black breaks the symmetry within the first few moves. Before entering into games, ideas and analysis, let me make a few general remarks. As much or more so than in any other varia- tion in the English Opening, this one runs the risk of 'excessive' simplification, mainly from White's point of view, since he has to figure out what to do about copycat moves, whereas Black can almost always find a reasonable way to un- balance the position. For example, play will sometimes peter out in the line 5 e3 e6 6 tbge2 tbge7 7 O-O O-O, when a number of grandmaster draws have resulted from 8 d4 cxd4 9 tbxd4 tbxd4 10 exd4 d5 11 cxd5 tbxd5 12 tbxd5 exd5. As we shall see below, however, White has some refreshing ways to deviate. In the line beginning with 5 a3, the game sometimes

PURE SYMMETRICAL VARIATION 175

continues 5 ... a6 6 .l:tb 1 nb8 7 b4 cxb4 8 axb4 b5 9 cxb5 axb5, and while it is certainly still possi- ble to create an imbalance, quite a few top play- ers will stop the clocks at this point (or shortly thereafter). That may be a matter of prior inten- tion, however, and some grandmasters believe that if White enforces a well-timed break in symmetry, he can still get a promising game. At any rate, you will find that the databases are crammed full of games with 5 e3 and 5 a3. And of course Black needn't go along with any of this; in fact, he can break symmetry after any of White's 5th moves. Some simple examples out of many are 5 e3 e5, 5 e3 ttJf6, 5 a3 e6 and 5 a3 ttJf6 (see below). Nevertheless, this perceived difficulty has contributed to the popularity of 5 ttJf3, which, as we shall see, can't be effectively imitated in the main lines without penalty. On the other hand, 5 ttJf3 offers Black a range of dynamic possibilities based upon the fact that, as in some variations with 1 c4 e5, developing his knight to e7 keeps his bishop trained on d4, and can give him opportunities which White lacks; for ex- ample, the move .. .f5. Having said all that, let's move on to some actual variations and examples. Romanishin - Beliavsky USSR Ch, Leningrad 1974

[diagram]
b3!? This move is slow, and not especially dan- gerous, but it can lead into instructive posi- tions in which typical themes are thrown into relief. White has the simple idea of i.b2 and later moving his knight from c3 to exchange the important g7-bishop; then he may be able to exploit Black's resulting dark-square vul- nerabilities on the kingside. Often the move f4 will be used to reinforce pressure along the al-h8 diagonal. Naturally, it's not so easy, and Black has a number of common-sense rejoin- ders. Another modest move is 5 d3. White is waiting to see what Black plays, and will usu- ally respond by transposing into another sys- tem via e3, e4 or ttJf3. A unique plan is 5 ... e6 6 i.xc6!? (D), as in Larsen-Markeluk, Buenos Aires 1991.

Regardless of Black's recapture, the point is to immobilize Black's centre pawns (thus keep- ing the bishop on c8 inactive) and then exploit Black's dark-square weaknesses to prove that the knight-pair is superior to Black's bishops. Thus the battle revolves about a successful ... e5: a) Black can capture towards the centre with 6 ... bxc6, when 7 ttJf3 e5! is the structure that Black is after. Notice that in that case, White doesn't even get the d5-square for a knight, as he often does versus a ... c5/ ... d6/ ... e5 formation. So White has reason to play 7 f4!?, restraining Black's centre and targeting dark squares; for example, 7 ... ttJe7 8 ttJf3 O-O 9 O-O d6, when White's most ambitious plan begins with 10 e4, trying for a timely e5, or even d4. b) The game continued 6 ... dxc6 7 f4! (again, 7 ttJf3 e5! lets Black's bishop escape) 7 ... ttJe7 8 ttJf3 ttJf5 9 e4!? ttJd4 10 e5 O-O 11 ttJe4 f6 12 exf6 ttJxf3+ 13'ilVxf3 i.xf6 14 ttJxf6+ 'ilVxf6 15 'iVe2 (White tries to prevent ... e5, but it's not so easy) 15 .. Jld8 16 i.e3 b6 17 O-O-O (it might seem as though 17 i.f2 followed by 18 O-O-O was better, with an apparent bind on e5; how- ever, 17 ... e5! 18 fxe5 'ilVg5 keeps affairs bal- anced) 17 ... e5!. This frees Black's bishop and equalizes. Both sides have weaknesses, and in spite of the opposite-coloured bishops, neither player has the firepower to conduct a winning attack against proper defence. We now return to 5 b3 (D): 5 •.• ttJf6 The moves 5 ... d6 and 5 ... e5 are fully play- able, and even 5 ... i.xc3!? 6 dxc3 d6 has been played, for which you might compare Larsen- Markeluk from the last note; then White does well to continue by e4 and ttJge2. The most

interesting alternative is S ... e6, when White's strategy is illustrated by 6 iLb2 0,ge7 7 Wic1!? (7 h4 h6 8 ~1!? d6 9 0,e4 eS 10 'iWd3!?) 7 ... d6 8 0,dS !?, but Black can simply play 8 ... eS! 9 d3 O-O with no real problems. 6 iLb2 O-O 7 0,h3!? White would like to play 0,f4 and control the crucial dS-square, clamping down on dS. By contrast, 7 0,f3 dS! equalizes; for example, af- ter 8 0,xdS 0,xdS 9 iLxg7 ~xg7 10 cxdS ~xdS, Black has more space and prevents d4. This standard sequence arises on both sides of the board in an array of variations. 7 .•• e5 Black in tum prevents 0,f4. Actually, 7 ... dS! (D) can be played to good effect because it takes advantage of the knight's position on h3. This is a common theme in the Symmetrical English (and in the Reversed Sicilian, for that matter; see the 1 c4 eS 2 0,c3 d6 3 d4lines). w There can follow 8 0,xdS (8 cxdS 0,xdS 9 O-O iLg4) 8 ... 0,xdS 9 iLxg7 r:j;xg7 10 cxdS iLxh3! 11 iLxh3 'iixdS 120-0 %:.ad8 13 d3 b6 with a nice space advantage and central pres- sure to counter White's bishop-versus-knight edge.

This was originally the most popular version of the Pure Symmetrical variation. White's im- mediate intentions seem obvious: he wants to play d4, usually in conjunction with lL'lge2, es- tablishing control over more territory. The strat- egy of a3 and b4 arises from time to time, but less often than in other Symmetrical English lines because of White's emphasis on the d4 break. Sometimes, S e3 is used as an introduc- tion to systems with d3/e3, particularly if Black plays an early ... eS. Black can pursue differing strategies, so I'll try to describe his plans in the games and notes. Overall, even though S e3 can yield an unbal- anced game, it tends to be dryer than other vari- ations of the English Opening. The temptation for an author is to skip over such lines and con- centrate upon more exciting material, of which indeed there is plenty in this book. However, you should get an understanding of the Sym- metrical variations that develop more slowly, in order to decide whether this method of play ap- peals to you with either colour. 5 ••. e6 (D) w Benko - Geller Wijk aan Zee 1969 This symmetrical move limits Black's op- portunities to cause trouble for his opponent, but in turn offers less leeway for White to pull off surprises. In fact, S ... e6 is one of the main reasons that White hesitates to play S e3, espe- cially against a lower-rated player, because he feels that it runs the danger of wasting a game in which he has the advantage of the white pieces. But this fear is overrated, and White can still pose his opponent numerous difficulties. In addition, Black can break symmetry when he finds it attractive to do so. This variation is helpful to examine because it gives insight into the technical play that the English Opening can

lead to, and how careful we should be before we proclaim certain positions 'drawn'. 6 tLIge2 tLIge7 (D) w 70-0 a) A common way to try to keep some pieces on is 7tL1f4.

In Ivanchuk-Kramnik, Amber Rapid, Monte Carlo 1995, Ivanchuk posed a few apparently in- significant positional problems when he played simply 12 ~el!. It's a tribute to the game of chess that such a reserved move can cause real trouble! Indeed, White has the kind of position from which Kramnik himself squeezes out wins, although not without small mistakes by the op- ponent. The game went 12 ... iVb6!

... .Bxd4!? This should lead to an even game, but the passive-looking retreat 12 ... tt:Je7! provides an easier route, for the simple reason that the d- pawn is attacked, and ... tt:Jf5 or ... tt:Jc6 will re- inforce that attack.

Then he has poten- tial breaks with ... bS and ... dS, and the move .. .fS may become relevant.

9 .tb2l:tb810 d3 a611 'ifd2 bS (D) Quite a few games have arrived at this posi- tion.

This examination of S e3 should give you an insight into how apparently harmless moves can lead to mixed outcomes in the Symmetrical English Opening. Sometimes the play peters out to a dull equality; that won't happen, how- ever, unless both sides cooperate. In this last game with S. .. eS (and in the notes), you find the lack of direct engagement between opposing forces in the early part of the game; this ex- presses itself in the Pure Symmetrical English more so than in any other variation. Again, that doesn't preclude an imbalanced struggle if the players are so inclined. Flank Attack with 5 a3

Oddly enough, the little nudge is actually one of the most popular and effective continua- tions in the position. That may seem absurd, but

PURE SYMMETRICAL VARIATION 185

when you consider that White's strategy in the Pure Symmetrical lines almost always involves b4, it makes sense to playa move that you're going to include in your plans anyway. On top of that, there are several 'accidental' benefits to 5 a3. For instance, both 5 ... e5 and 5 ... e6, two mainstay defences versus almost any other of White's 5th moves, offer White the immediate chance to enter into surprisingly active gambit lines which are much more lively than, say, 5 e3 e6 or 5 e3 e5. Speaking more generally, we can say that any of White's other 5th moves such as 5 e3, 5liJf3 and 5 e4 tip his hand, so that Black can react accordingly. The move 5 a3 tries to reverse the situation: now it's Black who must respond. If you examine modem chess openings, you will find many cases where these 'little waiting moves' (especially a3 and ... a6) have become increasingly popular. How this works out can only be shown by examples: Kasparov - Karpov World Ch match (game 8), Seville 1987

e5 In fact, this game featured a completely dif- ferent move-order (1 c4 e5 2 liJc3 d6 3 g3 c5 4 ~g2 liJc6 5 a3 g6 6 b4 ~g7), but it soon merged with the standard one that I've pre- sented here. I can't cover all the details behind 5 a3, but we'll address 5 ... e6 in the next game, along with a brief look at 5 ... a6. Here are a few lines whose ideas cross over into other variations: a) 5 ... a5 stops b4, but grants White's knight access to b5. This is an important distinction. Then 6 liJf3 is an improved version of 5 liJf3 below. You should compare the lines directly, but a few ideas are that after 6 ... e6, the pawn sacrifice 7 d4! is stronger than after 5 liJf3 e6, and that 6 ... liJf6 7 d4 cxd4 8liJxd4 is much im- proved for White over the main line below with 5 liJf3 liJf6 because he has access to b5 and Black lacks his usual counterplay via ... a6. b) 5 ... d6 is a perfectly good move that opens up a large number of transpositional possibili- ties; for example, 6 .l:tbl a5 7 liJf3 e5 8 O-O liJge7 will enter into 5 liJf3 e5 territory, and an early e4 will be related to 5 e4 below. An independent line is 6 e3!?, and if 6 ... e5, then 7 b4, which is arguably more fun than 5 e3 e5. Apart from other 6th moves, Black could answer 6 e3 with 6 ... ~xc3!?, for which com- pare 5 d3 e6 6 ~xc6!? at the beginning ofthis chapter. Having the move a3 in does not signifi- cantly benefit White, if it does so at all (perhaps there are a couple of lines in which bringing a rook via l:ta2 to d2 or e2 or f2 might help, but that's reaching). In most lines, Black should play ... f5 in order to discourage e4. c) A difficulty with the move ... liJh6 in many English positions is that White's h-pawn ad- vance can't be blocked, and that applies here: 5 ... liJh6 6 M! liJf5 (the usual ... h5 or ... h6 isn't at Black's disposal) 7 h5 b6 8 d3 ~b7 9 h6! (D). Out of a calm beginning we are about to get a torrent of activity. Hodgson-Arkell, Isle of Man 1996 continued 9 ... ~f8 (Hodgson analyses 9 ... ~e5 10 g4! liJfd4 11 f4 ~c7 12 e3liJe6 13 liJd5 to a large advantage; still more convincing here is 13 g5) 10 b4!? (or 10 ~f4) 1O .. :~c8 11 liJe4!? cxM 12 axb4 liJxM 13 ~b2 f6?! (the best defence was 13 ... l:tg8! 14 'iNd2!? a5 with the idea 15 g4 d5!) 14 g4! liJxh615 g5 (White just keeps pounding away!) 15 ... liJg8 (15 ... liJg4 16 l:th4!), and here White should plunge into the line 16 'iVd2! a5 17liJf3! ~xe4 18 dxe4, offer- ing yet another pawn: 18 .. :~xc4 19 l:!.cl 'iff7 20 e5!, when the attack is crashing through. d) 5 ... b6 furnishes a good answer to 5 a3, because it goes about the business of challeng- ing White's bishop on g2 while shoring up c5.

Thus, 5 ... b6100ks like a good solution to 5 a3, and one which will very likely lead to a middle game full of content. 6 b4! (D)

This sacrifice characterizes many lines of the Symmetrical English. The idea is to break down Black's grip on the centre by inducing ... cxb4. Failing that, White gains space and retains the options of bxc5 and b5 for a while. 6 ••. d6 Black really shouldn't accept the pawn: 6 ... cxb47 axb4 4:Jxb4? 8 i.a3 i.f8 (8 ... 4:Jc6 9 4:Jb5 i.f8 10 i.d6! i.xd6 11 4:Jxd6+ 'it>f8 12 i.d5 4:Jh6 13 c5 with a huge bind) 9 ~a4. Then Black has dark-square weaknesses and no de- velopment to speak of: 9 ... a5 (9 ... 4:Jc6 10 4:Jb5 i.xa3 11 ~xa3) 10 4:Jf3 f6 11 0-04:Jh6 12 d4! and Black's position is collapsing. With the text-move, we have now transposed into the actual course of the Kasparov-Karpov game.

7.l:tbl

7 bxc5 dxc5 8 i.xc6+!? bxc6 9 l::tbl has ideas of d3, 4:Jf3 and i.e3, etc., attacking the weak c-pawns.

(intending ... e4) 12 i.g5 i.h3 13 4:Je4 .:tab8! with a complex, challenging game ahead. 7 ... 4:Jge7 It's simplistic to say that ... 4:Jf6 never goes with a ... c5/. .. d6/. .. e5 pawn-structure, but in this case 7 ... 4:Jf6?! allows White to exchange his queen's bishop for a knight after 8 d3 O-O 9 i.g5! (D).

To appreciate this, you should compare the main lines, which we shall see in a later section under 5 4:Jf3 e5. There Black has a knight on e7 and can answer i.g5 with .. .f6, to avoid an ex- change on e7. With the knight on f6, Kosten- Pira, Montpellier 1996 continued 9 ... h6 10 i.xf6 i.xf6114:Jf3 b6 12 4:Jd2! cxb413 axb4 i.b7 14 O-O ~d7 15 'iVa4! :tfc8 16 4:Jd5 with total con- trol of the light squares. Black's bad bishop is no match for a knight here. This is a particularly instructive example. 8e3!? Alternatively, White can work with the for- mation 8 d3 O-O 9 4:Jf3 (9 e3 would transpose to our main game).

We've arrived at a scene from the 5 e3 line, except that there Black prevented b4 by playing ... a5. The trade-off favours White, whose posi- tion is already somewhat preferable. 9 ... .l:!.b8 10 4:Jge2 i.e6 11 b5 4:Ja5 12 i.d2 b6 The logical 12 ... d5 leads to the forcing line 13 cxd5 4:Jxd5 14 4:Jxd5 i.xd5 15 i.xd5 'iUxd5 160-0, and now 16 ...

than Black's bishop, which is stuck behind its own pawns.

13 O-O tLlb7

Now Black is ready for ... dS. Rather than place his knight on dS, White decides to make the pawn-structure symmetrical and count upon his space. This is hardly inspiring, yet forces Black to find a few good ideas. 14 e4!? 'iii>h8 14 ... h6! was suggested, feinting on the king- side and preventing White's i.gS. Alternatively, 14 .. :~'d7 would prepare to bring the b7-knight back into the game via d8. 15 "i!kc1 f5!? Perhaps a slight misjudgement by Black. Again, lS ... ~d7 keeps ... f6 in reserve and chal- lenges White to make progress. 16 i.g5 ~e8 17 i.xe7! ~xe7 18 exf5 (D)

... i.xf5! This gives White control of e4 in addition to dS, but Black is staying active and trying to keep away from the standard structure that we have talked about after 18 ... gxfS 19 tLldS (19 f4 e4! would be interesting, freeing the bishops) 19 ... ~f7 (maybe 19 ... i.xdS!? 20 i.xdS tLld8 isn't so bad) 20 f4, when Black's bishops are re- stricted. 19 tLld5 ~d7 20 ~d2 tLla5?! It's strange that Black doesn't want to recen- tralize and perhaps exchange this piece. Thus 20 ... tLld8! 21 a4 tLlf7 22 as i.h6 was suggested, with the idea of ... tLlgS, hitting the light squares. Here 21...tLle6 is also acceptable. 21 tLlec3 l:tbe8 22 tLle4 White has developed an advantage, and even- tually broke through on the kingside. M. Domingo - Alekseev Berlin 2006

e6 This simple move is probably the most im- portant response to S a3. Black prepares ... tLlge7 and ... dS. I'm not going to go too deeply into S ... a6, which has loads of theory behind it, except to point to what I think are the main lines: 6 ~b1 .l:!.b8 7 b4 (7 ~a4 was long ago solved by 7 ... tLld4! with the idea ... bS, and the gambit 7 ... d6!? gives fair compensation) 7 ... cxb4 8 axb4 bS 9 cxbS (9 cS?! as is already awkward for White) 9 ... axbS 10 tLlf3 (D) (l0"tLlh3 eS! cuts off the knight from f4).

Quite a bit of recent analysis applies to this position. Here are some guideposts: a) 1O ... eS is an important line, when the analysis is only starting after 11 d4!? exd4 12 tLldS tLlf6 13 i.gS h6 14 tLlxf6+ i.xf6 IS i.f4 d6 16 i.xh6 i.fS 17 .l:!.c1 tLlxb4 18 tLlxd4 tLld3+ 19 exd3 i.xd4, which is absolutely unclear. Of course, there are numerous alternatives along the way, including 14 i.xf6. b) Not surprisingly, 10 ... tLlf6 is also play- able. Time put into studying these lines will pay off directly in practice. c) 1O ... dS 11 d4 e6 (imitation by 11...tLlf6 is also adequate after 12 i.f4 l:tb6, but it's complicated) 12 e4!?

188 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

i.xdS with equality, Hickl-Hulak, Pula Zonal 2000. As I say, that's only a skeleton that you can B fill in by research and serious analysis. Sadly, a lot of the play after S. .. a6 6 l':.bl 1:.b8 depends much more upon specifics than understanding. We now return to S. .. e6 (D): w 6 b4!? This rich and dynamic pawn sacrifice is the most popular move, in part because S a3 doesn't have enough effect on the game otherwise. This is not to say that White can't arrive at a normal game by 6 l'!bI, when after 6 ... aS, 7 e4 is a Botvinnik System, while he can also choose 7 tiJh3 or 7 h4!? 6 ... tiJge7!? can also be tried, when 7 b4 cxb4 8 axb4 dS looks logical. Black counters a flank attack with a central attack, al- though that's not always a trustworthy rule. There might follow 9 bS tiJaS 10 cxdS exdS 11 i.a3, which is unbalanced in an interesting way; for example, ll...d4 12 tiJe4 O-O 13 "iVa4. 6 ••• tiJxb4!? This pseudo-sacrifice actually ends up win- ning material. If Black grabs the b-pawn di- rectly, we see a type of position that applies to numerous lines of the Symmetrical English: 6 ... cxb4 7 axb4 tiJxb4 8 i.a3 (D). Now what? a) If Black simply retreats by 8. .. tiJc6?, White goes all-out on the dark squares by 9 tiJbS!, threatening 10 tiJd6+ followed by 11 tiJxb7+ (winning the queen), or 10 i.d6. Black has to play 9 ... i.f8, when White's simplest course is to gain a very large lead in active development by 10 tiJf3 i.xa3 11 .l:.xa3, perhaps piling up on the dark squares next by means of~al and cS; even h4-hS is an idea. This sort of thing tends to be disastrous for Black. b) 8 ... i.f8 saves the pawn, although any number of moves by White are good enough to compensate for it and then some; for example, 9 tiJf3 tiJf6 10 "iYb3 as 110-0 i.e7 12 e40-0 13 eS tiJhS 14 d4. 7 axb4 cxb4 8 d4! bxc3 9 e3 (D)

It's worth talking about some general fea- tures here. Black is two pawns ahead, soon to be one if the c3-pawn falls. His development matches White's and his weaknesses are fairly well covered. What is White's compensation? First, he will have a powerful bishop along the a3-f8 diago- nal, which either prevents or discourages cas- tling, and he possesses two open queenside files. The configuration of open a- and b-files versus the opponent's a- and b-pawns (with Black's c-pawn gone) is a common one in a breadth of openings. Such a configuration, as- suming that White can place rooks on the files,

PURE SYMMETRICAL VARIATION 189

generally favours him, even when both the a- and b-pawns are passed. A signal case would be the main-line ~bl Exchange Grtinfeld, in which pawns have been exchanged on d4 and Black has grabbed White's a-pawn by .. :~aS+ and .. :~xa2 (see Volume 2). In the position before us, Black's a- and b- pawns are flanked by White's c-pawn, making them difficult to advance. Another problem faces Black: his c8-bishop and a8-rook can be hard to activate. A similar situation arises, for example, in a typical Benko Gambit (disregard- ing move-order issues): 1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 cS 3 dS bS 4 cxbS a6 S bxa6 g6 6 ttJc3 ~xa6 7 ttJf3 ~g7

[diagram]
llbl .l:!.fb8 (D). w Ignoring concrete variations, Black's piece set-up is designed to prevent White's a- and b- pawns from advancing without creating weak- nesses, and to tie White's pieces to the defence of the pawns. The strategy is time-tested, so much so that in the Benko Gambit, Black often has compensation for a whole pawn. The same type of gambit structure arises in several varia- tions of the King's Indian Defence and the Eng- lish Opening, among others. But our English Opening position in the main game, in which Black has no pawn on d4 (as White does in the Benko Gambit, for example), is not as compel- ling as the gambiteer might like it to be. For ex- ample, the same 'c-pawn versus a- and b-pawn' structure arises in the French Wing Gambit via

[diagram]
~xa3 and in the Sicilian Wing Gambit via 1 e4 cS 2 b4 cxb4 3 a3 bxa3 4 ~xa3. Neither of these variations is terribly impressive on a theoretical level. Fortunately for White, the position in our game (after 9 e3, pictured in the diagram) also contains positive features related to White's mobile centre. Perhaps it all adds up to dynamic equality. 9 ••• ttJe7 9 ... ttJf6 10 ttJe2 O-O gets the king to safety, but reveals Black's difficulties on the dark squares; for example, 11 ~a3 d6 12 ttJxc3 a6 (versus ttJbS) 13 ~b3 l::tb8 14 O-O .l:te8 IS l::tfbl and White's bishops are impressively supported by his other pieces. 10 ttJe2 (D)

10 ... d5 Or 10 ... O-O 11 ttJxc3, and now we have these instructive examples: a) The counterthrust 11...dS is an attempt to reach rather dull equality, not necessarily achievable after 12 cxdS ttJxdS 13 ttJxdS exdS 14 ~b3, winning his pawn back. Now: al) Black can play the typical and ambitious 14 ... aS, to make space for his pieces and get his pawns moving. Then IS ~xdS?! has tactical problems after IS ... a4 followed by 16 ... 11aS with tempo, and then 17 ... ~e6!' A better move is IS 'iVxdS, when White's extra centre pawns are stronger in principle than Black's passed ones. Finally, White can leave things be and de- velop by IS O-O!, when Black is slightly at a loss for good moves. a2) Ptacnikova-S.Kasparov, Olomouc 2003 continued 14 ... ~e6 IS 'iVxb7 as 16 O-O ~e8 17 ~a3 .:!.b8 18 'ilia711a8 19 'ilib7 .:!.b8 20 'iVa6 with the idea of retreating to e2. Black's a-pawn is rel- atively weak, especially as he has to keep tabs on his d-pawn, so White stands somewhat better.

b) l1...d6 (going for the blocking method) 12 .1a3 (the nice thing for White is that he has a modest central preponderance to put on his list of minor advantages; whether this adds up to more than a pawn's worth isn't certain, but his play is free and easy; after 12 O-O instead, 12 ... eS! is worth thinking about) 12 .. :ii'c7 13 'lib3 (Kosten gives 13 lbbS 'ilVxc4 14 lbxd6 'lic3+ IS '.te2lbdS 16 'lic1!, when an endgame is promising for White in spite of his pawn mi- nus) 13 ... a6 14 O-O ~bS IS ~abl eS?, Thiede- Filippov, European Clubs Cup, Rethymnon 2003, and here White can achieve a substantial advantage with 16lbe4! in view of 16 ... .l:!.dS 17 'ilVb6!

O-O 13 .1a3 ~eS 14 'iWe2 (14 lbbS lbfS) 14 ... eS, when Black seems to be freeing his game, but of course there are many options. 11 •.• lbxdS12 .1a3 (D)

Domingo mentions that 13 'ii'b3, as in Del- chev-Tukmakov, Croatian Team Ch, Pula 2001, allows Black to play 13 ... 'ii'b6!, which might well give him the better game.

Whether or not S a3 e6 6 b4 produces a theo- retical advantage (which is unlikely), it leads to a fascinating variation that players of both sides are willing to contest. Symmetrical Botvinnik: 5 e4 Kosten - Bijaoui Montpellier 2006

[diagram]
(D)

White chooses the Botvinnik System, popu- lar among experienced players. The ideas are very similar to those in the Botvinnik System of the Closed English, which we saw in Chapter 6 (1 c4 eS 2 0,c3 0,c6 3 g3 g6 4 .tg2 .tg7 S e4). White cedes an outpost on d4 in order to pre- vent ... dS and 'work around' his own weakness by playing f4 or b4, in some cases preparing d4 by d3, 0,ge2 and .te3. For all his nefarious intentions, White's set- up is usually considered less dangerous versus the Symmetrical English than the Closed Eng- lish, and still less so than against certain varia- tions of the King's Indian (see Chapter 12). Primarily (although not entirely), that's because the idea off4-fS isn't very scary for Black when his pawn is on e7 and not eS. In the latter case, Black's position is vulnerable to the idea f4-fS followed by g4-gS and f6. 5 ••• 0,f6 I'll concentrate upon this reply for its the- matic value and because of its relevance to S 0,f3 eS. But Black has numerous options: a) S. .. e6 isn't really that different from the lines already covered with colours reversed via S e3 eS; Black sets up with ... 0,ge7, ... O-O, ... d6 and possibly ... b6, achieving equality. b) Alternatively, Black can play for an early ... bS by some combination of ... a6, ... lIb8 and, if needed, ... 0,d4. Even the immediate S. .. a6 6 0,ge2 bS!? is played; 6 a4 is a simple way to prevent this, but it's unclear which move, ... a6 or a4, is the more important concession! c) A particularly irritating line that Black can use is S ... eS (or S ... d6 6 0,ge2 eS), when White has to try to exploit his extra tempo to en- gineer a properly-timed f4 or b4. That's not so

192 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

easy, but fortunately for both sides, not many players of Black will want to limit their pros- pects in this way. d) Finally, direct expansion on the kingside by S. .. d6 6liJge2 hS has little theory behind it, and yet a few master games have seen 7 h3 (7 h4) 7 ... eS !? (other moves are 7 ... liJh6 and 7 ... a6)

6 liJge2 O-O 7 O-O d6 In the next game, Black plays 7 ... liJe8.1'1l be discussing other move-orders there, and in par- ticular 6 ... d6 (delaying ... O-O), which has its own special advantages. S d3 (D) S. •. a6 This flexible move gives away Black's inten- tions to play ... bS, but also ensures that White's liJbS won't be an issue. Black's most famous strategy involves the expedition ... liJe8-c7-e6, which we shall discuss in the next game. There are two other worthwhile tries: a) An oddly neglected move is 8 ... i.g4. Black emulates White's strategy in the position stemming from S liJf3 eS. If 9 h3, 9 ... i.xe2 looks good. In the reversed variation, when White plays i.gS, Black avoids the exchange by ... f6, which in this case would translate into 9 f3, when Black can reply 9 ... i.d7, or the more interesting 9 ... i.e6!? (versus d4) 10 b3liJd7 11 i.e3 liJd4 12 Itc1 ~aS and Black hasn't any worries, since he threatens to win a pawn by ... liJxe2+, and 13 1:1f2 is well met by 13 ... liJeS!, with both the ideas ... liJxe2+ and ... liJec6 with total control over d4. b) 8 ... i.d7 has intentions similar to 8 ... a6 and will sometimes transpose to the game. But White should be warned about the line 9 h3 l:Ib8 10 i.e3 a6, which sets a trap that many players have fallen into: 11 d4?!

This move is too slow now, for reasons we'll see. 10 ... i.d7 11 i.e3 gives Black two perfectly reasonable replies: a) 11... 'iNa5!? covers some important dark squares. Black's first point is 12 d4? cxd4 13 lLlxd4 'iWb4. Of course White doesn't have to pitch a pawn, but it's not clear what a positive strategy would be; perhaps a well-timed 'iVd2 and i.h6. Black has the same quandary; one idea for him is the somewhat risky ... :tfcS fol- lowed by ... lLleS and ... lLld4. b) ll...eS!? is also playable, with the idea 12 f4lLld4, and if 13 g4, then 13 ... exf4 14lLlxf4 bS. 11 i.e3! lLld412 .l:!.bl! (D)

White is already threatening b4, which will open the b-file to his considerable advantage. In fact, this standard plan has also succeeded for Black in the reversed position (as we shall see in the section on S lLlf3 eS). It turns out that White's extra tempo accentuates his queenside advantage. ...lLlc7 13 b4lLlce6 14 bxcSlLlxe2+ 14 ... dxcS secures d4 more tightly. Then White can either play ISlLldSlLlxe2+ 16 'iWxe2 (for example, 16 ... lLld4 17 'iVa2! e6 IS i.f4! eS 19 i.e3), or IS f4 lLlxe2+ (1S ... fS 16 eS) 16 lLlxe2 'iNaS 17 eS!, when the combination of more active bishops and space grants him the superior game.

Laylo - de Firmian Minneapolis 2005

lLlf6 6 lLlge2 O-O The slight change of move-order with 6 ... d6 makes a difference if White plays 7 O-O. In fact, castling might even be considered an in- accuracy! It gives Black an attractive resource, which if nothing else deserves attention be- cause we shall see White play the same idea in the reverse position via SlLlf3 eS. Specifically, Black can embark upon the line 7 ... lLld7!? S d3 lLlfS! (D). w The knight gets to its desired spot just in time after 9 i.e3 lLle6, controlling the d4-square and having in mind its occupation. In the main game, Black plays ... lLlf6-eS-c7-e6, and here ... lLlf6-d7-fS-e6. Where did he get the extra tempo? Simply by not castling. So it would seem that, instead of 7 O-O, White should simply play 7 d3 (or S d3lLlf6 6 e4), pre- cisely to avoid the ... lLld7-fS-e6 manoeuvre. In that case 7 ... lLld7?! S i.e3 lLlfS 9 d4 is another matter, because White takes charge of the centre. But 7 d3 has its own drawbacks, for one thing because it forfeits the chance to play d4 in one step and also opens up possibilities such as 7 ... i.d7 S O-O!? hS! with a flank attack. For ex- ample, play might continue 9 h4 :LbS 10 f3 (ver- sus ... lLlg4) 10 ... O-O 11 i.e3 a6 12 d4?! (12 a4 ~a5 is unclear) 12 ... cxd4 13lLlxd4lLleS! 14 b3

If White wishes to neutralize the manoeuvre that follows, he should play 7 d3 with the idea 7 ... ttJe8 (7 ... a6 is an alternative) 8 .i.e3 ttJc7 9 d4.

7 .•• ttJeS In the previous game, we saw Black play a combination of ... d6, ... a6 and ... .i.d7. Here he intends ... ttJc7-e6, to head off White's d4 push and perhaps occupy the d4-square himself. Instead, 7 ... d6 8 d3 ttJe8?! is poorly-timed, because in that case 9 .i.e3 ttJc7 (9 ... ttJd4 10 lIbl! with the idea of b4 gives White a strong queenside attack; compare the main game) 10 d4! cxd4 11 ttJxd4 takes over the centre. Then ll...ttJe6 can be met by 12 ttJde2! (D).

With this knight retreat, we've arrived at a position that has arisen scores of times and crops up in various forms in related variations such as 5 ttJf3 e5 below. White has a definite advantage, because Black has lost his grip on the centre and will find it very difficult to shake White's bind. Sd3 White could try to stop ... ttJc7-e6 by playing

8 f4 d6 (8 ... ttJc7 9 f5) 9 d3 ttJc7 10 f5. But this

gives up the e5-square, and 10 ... nb8 with the idea ... a6 and ... b5, and/or ... ttJe5 and ... .i.d7, should maintain the balance. S. .. ttJc7 9 .i.e3 ttJe6 10 f4 Since White can't play d4, he expands on the kingside. This is weakening, however, and perhaps now was the time to start thinking about equality; for example, 10 nbl d6 11 a3 a5 12 ttJb5 ttJcd4 13 a4.

PURE SYMMETRICAL VARIATION 195

Pure Symmetrical with 5 ltJf3: Introduction

[diagram]
(D)

Many of the leading players have always played the tLlf3 lines of the Pure Symmetrical Variation. I phrase it that way because this in- cludes not only those who arrive at the posi- tion by means of 1 c4 c5 2 tLlc3 tLlc6 3 g3 g6 4 i.g2 i.g7 5 tLlf3, but also the sizeable number who come to it by other means. The possible move-orders are too numerous to list, since both players can make the basic moves in al- most any sequence; but you can work out how easy it is for the relevant positions to arise from 1 ttJf3, 1 c4 c5 2 tLlf3 (or here 1...tLlf6 or

1...g6), 1 c4 c5 2 tLlc3 tLlc6 3 tLlf3, or any sys-

tem in which the moves g3 and i.g2 are played at an early stage. The benefit of playing tLlf3 before or by move 5 is that White can castle quickly and prepare to play d4. Black has to address that possibility so as not to lose ground in the centre. Let's first see what happens if he tries to maintain symmetry. Traditional Main Line with S. .. ltJfS

[diagram]
tLlf6 6 O-O Already we have an important juncture. As- suming that you're playing White and heading for the main lines with d4, I'd recommend 6 d4(!)(D).

This can, and usually does, enter the main line when Black plays 6 ... cxd4 7 tLlxd4 O-O 8 O-O (which is equivalent to 6 O-O O-O 7 d4 cxd4 8 tLlxd4). But this move-order is important, in my opinion, because it circumvents 6 O-O d5, a respectable equalizing variation which we shall see in the next note. Looking at the alternatives, we see that White benefits from 6 d4 in some other respects, whereas Black can exercise some new options: a) 6 ... d6 is shaky. By committing to ... d6 be- fore castling, Black gives White a chance to play 7 dxc5 (7 d5 tLla5 8 tLld2 transposes to a King's Indian Defence; see below; furthermore, 70-0 can return to our main line after 7 ... cxd4 8 tLlxd4 tLlxd4 9 ~xd4 O-O; if Black passes on 8 ... tLlxd4 and plays 8 ... i.d7 a good response is 9 tLlc2!, avoiding exchanges; then a number of games over the years have been played with 9 ... O-O 10 b3 ~a5 11 i.b2, when White gener- ally gets some advantage) 7 ... dxc5 8 Wixd8+

By exchanging queens at this point, White gets a superior version of the variation 6 O-O O-O

7 d4 d6 8 dxc5 dxc5. He seems to stand better;

for example, 8 ... tLlxd8 (8 ... <.t>xd8 9 i.f4 and 10 O-O-O+ wins too much time) 9 i.e3 tLle6 10 tLlg5 1? tLlxg5 (1O ... tLld4 110-O-O tLlg4 12 tLld5) 11 i.xg5 and Black has some troubles in the face of i.e3 followed by tLld5. b) Another way for Black to deviate (after 6 d4) is by 6 ... cxd4 7 tLlxd4 d5!? (7 ... O-O 8 O-O is the main line), but 8 O-O O-O 9 cxd5 tLlxd5 10 tLlxd5 tLlxd4 11 i.g5! is very uncomfortable for

196 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

him because of the threat 12 tDxe7+. The best response is 11...tDc6, when 12 'ilVa4!, intending .l:.fdl, gives White a strong initiative. c) Finally, 6 ... 'ilVaS!? (D) has some intrigu- ing nuances. w A surprisingly respectable line is 7 dS tDe4!? 8 dxc6 tDxc3 9 'ilVd2 'ilVb4! 10 O-O tDe4 11 'ilVd3 tDd6 12 .i.f4 dxc6 13 .i.xd6 exd6 14 ~xd6 'ilVxb2! IS l':!.adl 'iVf6 16 'ilVxcs 'ilVe7 17 :d6!, Akopian-Shulman, European Ch, Ohrid 200l. White manages to equalize just in time because of 17 ... O-O 181hc6!. White may do best to gambit a pawn by 7 O-O cxd4 8 tDxd4, allowing 8 ... 'ilVcS. This is Black's point: he forces White's knight to commit and simultaneously pesters the c4-pawn. On the other hand, he fails to develop. In the game Boger-Kumar/Samraoui, correspondence game 2002, White plunged ahead by 9 tDdbS! O-O (D) (9 ... 'it>d8 10 .i.f4!). Now he should have continued 10 tDc7! l:i.b8 11 tD7dS 'ilVxc4 (ll...tDxdS 12 cxdS tDd4 13 w .Be3) 12 .i.f4 l:.a8 (a nice trick is 12 ... eS? 13 .i.xeS! tDxeS 14 tDxf6+ .i.xf6 IS 'iV d6 !, forking rook and bishop) 13 b3 'iVcs 14 M! ~c4 IS bS!, and in most lines tDxe7+ will badly damage Black's pawn-structure.

6 ... O-O

Taking the initiative in the centre makes sense, before White does. Therefore Black should strongly consider 6 ... dS 7 cxdS (7 ~a4!? is an idea that might be worth a look) 7 ... tDxdS

This is an important position, both in this move-order and in other lines which may trans- pose (say, 1 c4 tDf6 2 tDc3 g6 3 tDf3 dS 4 cxdS tDxdS S g3 .i.g7 with ... cS soon to follow). I'm not going to cover this line in detail, but it's thought to be equal based upon long expe- rience. Black's light squares are a little weak on the hl-a8 diagonal, but White can only achieve so much by trying to exploit them. The best-known line goes 8 tDxdS (8 d3!? hopes to get more than enough compensation following

8 ... ltJxc3 9 bxc3 .lixc3 10 l:!.b1, but Black can simply decline the pawn by 8 ...

O-O 10 .lie3 (D).

1O ... .lid7! (according to theory, 1O ... .lixb2 11 !lb1 .lif6 is risky but also satisfactory) 11 ltJd4 ~d6 12 ltJxc6 .lixc6 13 .lixc6 'ii'xc6 14 l:!.c1 'iVe6 IS !lxcS 'iVxa2 16l:!.bS (the best try, which originally won several games, but Black seems to have solved his problems) 16 ... b6 17 ~a1 ~e6!

This line provides White an incentive to play

6 d4 rather than 6 O-O. Not surprisingly, there

are multiple options for both sides at every juncture from moves 10 to IS, so you may want to do your own investigation. 7 d4cxd4 Two points here: a) Trying to maintain symmetry with 7 ... dS (almost never played) leads to the better game for White after 8 dxcS (or 8 cxdS cxd4!? 9 ltJxd4ltJxdS 10 ltJxdSltJxd4 11 .ligS!) 8 ... dxc4 9 'iYa4. b) Since the main line with 7 ... cxd4 isn't easy for Black to play, he may want to look into 7 ... d6 (D), which is a Fianchetto Variation of the King's Indian Defence. w White can play ambitiously by entering the fascinating main line 8 dS ltJaS 9 ltJd2 (which requires study for both sides) or simplify by 8 dxcS dxcS and then 9 .lie3 or 9 .lif4. The 8 dxcS line has generally been considered satisfactory for Black, although his winning chances are se- riously reduced in some variations. White may also be discontent, because his abstract advan- tage will often dissipate within a few moves. You'll have to refer to King's Indian theory to sort this out. SltJxd4 (D)

We've reached what used to be considered the main line of the entire Symmetrical Eng- lish. Because White seems to retain a nagging

198 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

edge with best play, it no longer has that ele- vated a status. Still, new ideas appear on a regu- lar basis, and grandmasters haven't abandoned the variation as Black. I'll discuss the basic ideas in the following games. Metal - Hogye Correspondence game 1994

[diagram]
liJf3liJf6 6 O-O O-O 7 d4 cxd4 8 liJxd4liJg4!? Black has various minor alternatives to 8 ... liJxd4 (see the next game) and 8 ... liJg4, but none are held to equalize; for example, 8 ... a6?! allows White to play 9 c5!, attacking b6 and discouraging ... d6. Quite a few contests have featured the gam- bit 8 ... d6 9 liJxc6 bxc6 10 Ji.xc6, but Black probably lacks enough compensation: 1O ... l::i.b8 (White stands better after 1O ... Ji.h3 11 Ji.xa8 "iVxa8 12 f3 Ji.xfl 13 'it>xfl 1:tc8 14 ~d3) 11 Ji.g2 "iVa5 12 ~c2. Skipping over most of the theory, one example is Lukov-Y.lvanov, Varna 1995: 12 ... Ji.f5 (12 ... Ji.e6?! 13 Ji.d2 with the idea 13 ... Ji.xc4 14liJd5) 13 e4 Ji.e6 14 b3! (or

14 Ji.d2) 14 ... liJxe4 15liJxe4 Ji.xal 16 Ji.g5 f6?

(Cummings suggests 16 ... Ji.f6 17 liJxf6+ exf6

18 Ji.xf6 "iVf5, although White has the bishop-

pair, a pawn, and an attack for the exchange af- ter 19 't!Vc3!) 17 Ji.e3! ~e5 18 f4 't!Vb2 19 't!Vbl!, winning a piece. So we now return to 8 ... liJg4!? (D): w This popular non-developing move is an at- tempt to transform the pawn-structure, which currently favours White due to his greater con- trol of the centre. Black attacks d4, forcing White to make a decision. But why put the knight on this odd square? First and non-trivi- ally, it discourages White from the useful move

9 Ji.e3. In addition, since it turns out that 9 e3 is

White's best move (refusing to lose time by re- treating), Black aims for a specific idea: he in- tends to play a combination of ... liJxd4 and ... liJh6-f5, working on White's dark squares, in particular attacking the pawn on d4. Of course, 8 ... liJg4 doesn't do anything for Black's queen- side development and completely cedes control of e4 and d5 to the white knight. Therefore White has some time to reorganize, as best ex- plained by example.

9 e3 (D)

The critical move. White supports his centre, attacks the knight on g4, and prepares for slow expansion after developing by b3 and Ji.b2. In addition, the move liJd5 can be useful. Instead, 9 liJc2 Ji.xc3! 10 bxc3 ~a5 is at least equal for Black; even his knight on g4 can contribute to the queenside attack via ... liJe5.

9 .•• liJxd4 This exchange is considered somewhat inac- curate, but it leads to an extremely instructive game containing most of the main themes of the variation. Black usually waits another move by 9 ... d6 10 b3 (10 liJxc6 bxc6 11 Ji.xc6 nb8 compares well for Black with the similar sacri- fice with 8 ... d6 above, because the knight on g4 will come to e5 and put pressure on c4; 10 liJde2 is logical and has usually yielded some advantage - White intends to build up slowly, usually by b3 and Ji.b2, and later placing a knight on d5), when Black's normal continua- tion is 1O ... liJxd4 11 exd4liJh6 (D).

PURE SYMMETRICAL VARIATION 199

w Then 12 .tb2 is of course playable, but gives Black what he wants after 12 ... liJfS. White has two more interesting approaches: a) 12 .txh6!? (this popular capture directly eliminates ... liJfS and gives White time to se- cure his centre while attacking down the e-file; in addition, Black's bishop on h6 will be mis- placed and will generally waste a tempo retreat- ing to g7) 12 ... .txh6 13 ~e2 .tg7 14 ~fd1. Here White takes advantage of the fact that Black's c8-bishop can't abandon his b7-pawn. While Black is getting organized, White intends to advance his pawns and create a favourable pawn-structure: 14 ... l::te8 IS lIac1 lIb8 16 cS! i.d7 17 b4, Mikhalchishin-Sale, Nova Gorica

1999. White's majority is on the march; Hansen

gives 17 ... aS 18 a3 eS!? 19 dS e4, but the pawns are so dominant that even 20 liJxe4 with the idea 20 .. .f5? 21 c6 is good; or, if Black plays 20 ... .ta4, the sacrifice 21 'iVc4! .txdl 22.l:txdl leaves White in command. b) The simple 12 .td2, as in the main game, also has its appeal; for example, 12 ... .iIb8 13 d5 a6 14 a4liJg4!? 15 h3liJf6 16 l::tell:!.e8 17 as! b6 18 axb6 ~xb6 19 na3liJd7 20 liJe4! liJe5 21 i.a5 ~a7 22 .tc3 .tf5 23 '¥Val! with pressure all over the board, Antonenko-Bazhenov, e- mail (ICCF) 2004. 10 exd4liJh611.td2!

200 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

strategy will be to break down White's grip on the centre, which means directly attacking the c4-pawn and/or chipping away at it with the move ... b5. 10 "iWd3 The queen retreats from any potential at- tacks along the al-h8 diagonal, but stays in touch with the centre and keeps the c-pawn de- fended. Two alternatives are instructive, and show what Black is up to: a) 10 b3 isn't vulnerable to any discovered attacks, nor even to 1O ... .Bf5 11 .Bb2 ttJe4 12 'iVe3, but 1O ... d5! exploits the open diagonal and equalizes: 11 cxd5 ttJxd5 (even 1l....Be6!? 12 'ilke3 ttJxd5 13 .Bxd5 .Bxd5 14 l:ldl e6 is OK) 12 'iUxd5 .Bxc3 13 .Bh6 'iUxd5 14.Bxd5 l:ld8 15 :adl .Bh3 16 .Bg2 .Bxg2 17 ~xg2 1/2-1/2 Spas sky-Tal, Moscow 1967. b) 10 l:f.dl.Be6! 11 .Bxb7 ttJg4!? attacks the queen (Black can also play Il..J;Ib8 first): 12 "iWf4 %;Ib8 13 .Bg2 'iUc8! ? (or 13 ... .Bh6, probably leading to a repetition of moves) 14 ttJd5 .l:.e8 15 h3?! ttJe5 16 "iWh4 'iUxc4 17 ttJxe7+ ~h8, and Black will win his pawn back, Larsen-Tal, Candidates match (game 9), Bled 1965. After the text-move, 10 'iVd3 (D), we see that White has more space and greater control of the central squares.

Notice that with this structure, Black has a more active king's bishop than he does in the Hedgehog Variation (see Chapter 10), where he has the structure ... d6/ ... e6 and the bishop is on e7. But the cost is a dear one: Black's other bishop on c8 has trouble developing and no ideal square to go to. In the meantime, the de- sirable central move ... e6, preventing a knight from coming to d5, would seriously weaken Black's d-pawn. Black's counterplay will cus- tomarily involve ... a6 and ... b5 (usually sup- ported by ... :b8 and sometimes by ... 'ii'a5). Or he can directly attack White's c-pawn by moves such as ... .Be6 and ... ttJd7-e5; if needed, the move ... b5 might come later, with additional force. Because of the influence of the g2-bishop, Black will sometimes try to compel White to adopt a Maroczy Bind structure (e4/c4) by playing ... .Bf5 and provoking e4 in return. This happens in the next note, although probably prematurely. In terms of specifics, White may not always object to ... b5 because it can loosen Black's queenside and give White play down the c-file with his rooks; the worth of ... b5 has to be as- sessed by both parties on a case-by-case basis. In many positions, White will play ttJd5, chang- ing the pawn-structure in his favour if Black has to capture. He also has the simple development l:ldl (as above) which might prepare pawn- breaks with c5 or e5; the move .Be3 can have a similar function. 10 ... a6 For many years, this flexible pawn advance has been the main line. Black reasons that he will probably play ... a6 anyway, and he wants to prepare for an eventual ... b5 advance without committing his other pieces and pawns. The most interesting alternative is probably 1O ... .Bf5 (D), which tempts White to play e4 and close off the diagonal of his g2-bishop. w But it costs a tempo, and Black got in trouble quickly in the nice example Smyslov-Timman, Moscow 1981: 11 e4.Be6 12 b3 (12 .Bd2 can

11 Ji.d2!?

There are several other possibilities here, in- cluding the old main line with 11 Ji.e3 ttJg4 12 .Bd4 ttJe5 13 ~d1. I think a particularly promising continuation is 11 lIdl, directly exploiting the d-file. White's immediate idea is 12 c5. This is not so easy to meet; for example: a) 11...Ji.f5?! 12 'it'f3! (threatening both 'iWxb7 and c5). Now in Gay-Campbell, corre- spondence game 1985, Black played the clever 12 .. .'tlfc7 13 ~xb7 lIa7! 14 ~xc7 lIxc7 15 e4 Ji.e6, and it looks as though the c-pawn is about to fall; nevertheless, 16 e5! dxe5 17 b3 leaves White with two active bishops and a passed c- pawn. After the more natural 12 .. J:tb8, White plays 13 c5! and gains the upper hand, because the black d-pawn is about to become fatally weak. Teboul-Mason, e-mail (IECG) 2002 con- tinued dynamically with 13 ... b5!, but Black still got a losing position after 14 a3! ttJg4 15 Ji.g5 ttJe5 16 "iVf4 ttJc4 17 cxd6 f6 18 dxe7 ~xe7 19 ttJd5 'iWa7 20 Ji.h6 ttJxb2 21 Ji.xg7 r:Jitxg7 22 l:tdcl. b) Black does better with 1l...'it'a5!. How- ever, 12 Ji.e3 centralizes all of White's pieces; for example, 12 ... Ji.f5 13 ~d2 (attacking b7, and considering ttJd5) 13. .. ~b4 14 l:tac1 lHc8

202 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

12 ... ..te6 The bold sacrifice 12 ... bS!? has been tried in a few games: 13 cxbS axbS 14lbxbS (14 b4!?) 14 ... ..tfS (or 14 ... ..ta6 IS a4lbd7 16 b4!) IS e4 lbxe4 16 ..txe4 ..txe4 17 ~xe4 .l:.xbS 18 b4 dS 19 ~d3 (D).

A funny position: mobile centre pawns are usually more powerful than connected passed queenside pawns, but White's control of the c- file changes matters: 19 ... ~d7 (19 ... .l:.b7 20 a4 eS, Damljanovic-Macieja, European Team Ch, Plovdiv 2003, and now 21 bS! e4 22 ~b3 d4 23 as is strong) 20 a4 l:i.bb8 21 bS eS 22 :!.c6, Ki.Georgiev-Gufeld, Calcutta 1992. With the cooperation of his rooks, White's advanced queenside pawns are difficult to cope with. 13 b3lbd714 e4 (D)

White has achieved a firm grip on the centre. In this sort of Maroczy Bind structure, Black needs to get in either ... dS or ... bS. There's not a lot of choice here. 14 ... bS! 14 ... lbcs IS ~e2 leaves Black without a plan. White can play lbdS, launch an attack by f4-fS, or build up with .l:.fdl, preparing b4 and possibly cS. IS cxbS axbSl6lbdS! lbcs 17 ~e2 (D)

Now White's extra territory is supplemented by his very useful open c-file. From the stand- point of opening theory, White has won the bat- tle. 17 .. :iid7 17 ... ..td7? allowed 18 eS! .l:.e8 (or 18 ... ..txeS 19 ':xcS) 19 ..te3 in Uhlmann-H.Griinberg, East German Ch, Stralsund 1975.

e5 (D) The Botvinnik structure again, but this time Black is employing it. This defence is very im- portant, not only because those who play slZ'lf3 will often have to play against it, but because it can arise by many different move-orders that involve an early ... cS and ... eS. A common one, for example, is 1 c4 cS 2 lZ'lf3 lZ'lc6 3 lZ'lc3 eS 4 g3 g6 S j.g2 j.g7, and anyone playing 1 c4 cS 2 lZ'lc3 g6 3 lZ'lf3 j.g7 who doesn't want to ven- ture into 4 d4 cxd4 S lZ'lxd4 lZ'lc6 will probably accede to 4 g3 eS. You should definitely compare S e4 lZ'lf6 in the 'Symmetrical Botvinnik: S e4' section to see an explanation of the themes and ideas that follow. Here I'll try to expand upon those con- cepts on a case-to-case basis. 60-0 Unfortunately, it's not feasible to cover the multitude of possible move-orders. Here's a couple of deviations that might be enlightening: a) A fascinating sideline goes 6 d3 lZ'lge7 7 lZ'ld2!? (D) with the idea lZ'lfl-e3. As explained in the reversed position (after the moves S e4 lZ'lf6 6 lZ'lge2 d6 7 O-O lZ'ld7! ?), White is planning three knight moves to get to e3 (lZ'ld2-fl-e3), just as the knight moves three times following O-O and then lZ'le1-c2-e3. The difference is that he has saved the move 6 O-O, and is thus able to stop Black from playing ... dS in the critical line 7 ... d6 8 lZ'lfl j.e6 (8 ... lZ'lfS 9 lZ'le3 lZ'lxe3 10 j.xe3 j.e6 appears slightly better for White; 8 ... a6 with the idea ... bS is another op- tion) 9lZ'le3 iVd7 10 lZ'ledS. White has gained his dS outpost without suffering any punishment. Compare the next game, where he doesn't do so well. After 10 lZ'ledS, a plausible continuation is 10 ... O-O (after 1O .. J::tb8?, 11 j.gS! attacking f6 was very awkward for Black in L.B.Hansen- J.Polgar, Abenra (rapid) 1989) 11 j.gS (also in- teresting is 11 h4!? hS 12 ~a4, or just 11 i:tb1 with the idea a3 and b4) 11 .. .f6 12 j.d2 j.f7 13 O-O lZ'lxdS 14 lZ'lxdS lZ'le7 IS lZ'lxe7+ 'WIxe7 16 i:tb1 with a small but annoying advantage. b) 6 a3lZ'lge7 7 b4!? intends 7 ... cxb4 8 axb4 lZ'lxb4 9 j.a3 with more than enough compensa- tion because of Black's weak d6-square. How- ever, 7 ... dS! is a well-established solution that seems satisfactory for Black: 8 cxdS (the win of a pawn by 8 bxcS O-O 9 cxdS lZ'lxdS is only tem- porary) 8 ... lZ'lxdS 9lZ'lxdS 'WIxdS 10 j.b2 O-O 11 O-O e4! 12 j.xg7 ~xg7 13lZ'lel cxb4 14 d3 j.fS IS lZ'lc2, Beliavsky-Oral, European Team Ch, Leon 2001.

Now: a) Black can play 1O ... i.e6 and allow 11 b4, but then 11...e4?! looks too greedy after 12 4:Jxe4 i.xal 13 4:Jxal, a standard exchange sac- rifice. The verdict can vary from position to po- sition, but here the ability to put a bishop on b2 is a good sign; for example, 13 ... cxb4 14 axb4 dS IS 4:Jf6+! r:t;g7 16 i.b2 d4 17 4:Je4! with the idea of 4:Jc2 (or 4:Jb3) and e3, removing the d- pawn and breaking down Black's defences. b) So Black generally responds with 10 ... as, when one example is 11 i.gS f6 12 i.d2 i.e6 13 4:Je3 4:Jd4!? 14 4:JedS 4:JxdS IS 4:JxdS, Kos- ten-Chabanon, French Team Ch, Cannes 2004. White's outpost is unchallenged and he has a pleasant advantage.

7 ... O-O

Black, too, can try to save time by not cas- tling. A line that has arisen by varying move- orders is 7 ... d6 8 a3 as 9 4:Jel i.e6 10 4:Jc2 dS 11 cxdS 4:JxdS 12 4:Je3 4:Jde7! 13 4:Jc4 (D).

At this point, White might try to break down Black's centre by 17 f4!. Since 17 ... exf4? 18 i.xf4 gives White too many squares and tactical

opportunities, Black could play 17 .. J:tab8, when after 18 fxeS 4:JxeS 19 4:JxeS fxeS, 20 g4!? is a clever move designed to prevent Black's most active plan of ... 4:JfS-d4. Then Black's poor pawn-structure (with the isolated e-pawn) lets him in for a lasting disadvantage, but he proba- bly shouldn't lose with accurate defence.

10• •• f6 Black is generally not advised to play 1O ... h6? due to 11 .i.xe7! 0,xe7 12 0,d2. It may seem strange for White to give up the bishop-pair, but look at the scope of White's remaining bishop and the pressure on Black's b-pawn that will follow the advance b4. Furthermore, Black doesn't want to get stuck with his bad bishop on g7 versus a strong white knight. These factors are not decisive but make Black's life difficult; for example, 12 ... 0,c6 (12 ... .l:tb8 is met by 13 'iYc2! .i.e6 14 b4, not 13 b4?! axb4 14 axb4 e4! with the point 15 0,cxe4? f5 ) 13 0,d5 .i.e6 14 0,e4.l::i.b8 15 0,ec3 f5 16 b4 with a promising queenside attack. ll.i.d2 l::tb8 This is the traditional move, but if Black can play 11.. .. i.e6! first, he should strongly con- sider it, in order to get ... d5 in as quickly as pos- sible. I'm not going to go into the details here, but in that case 12 'iVa4 is White's most promis- ing option. We saw this move with reversed colours after 5 e4 0,f6. 12 0,el has been played repeatedly over the years. Unfortunately, the benefit of inserting 10 .i.g5 doesn't necessarily show itself after 12 ... d5! 13 cxd5 0,xd5: a) In fact White's apparent purpose - to ex- ploit the a2-g8 diagonal by 14 ~b3?! - comes up short after 14 ... a4! with the idea 15 'iVxb7 0,a5 16 ~b5 ctJb3; for example, one game went 17 ~c6 ctJd4 18 "iVxc5?? .l:ta5. Instead, 17 .i.e3 0,xe3 18 fxe3 .l:tb8 19 ~xa4 0,d2 wins the ex- change for Black, Matamoros-Bellon, Havana 2001; White has two pawns for it, but Black has space and the bishop-pair. b) White's best continuation is 14 ctJc2! a4 15 ctJe3 ctJxe3 16 .i.xe3 'iVa5 17 .l:tc1, when he has achieved a kind of balance. If you want to play for or against 5 ... e5, you really should have a grip on these ideas. 12 0,el.i.e613 0,e2 dS14 exdS 0,xdS (D) w We've seen this type of position. Black has space and central control, so White needs to get queenside play or he will actually stand worse. 15 ctJe3 The conventional move. However, others are probably more effective: a) 15 b4! axb4 16 0,xd5 .i.xd5 17 axb4 has been suggested, when White might still hold a very slight edge after 17 ... .i.xg2 18 'it>xg2 'iVd5+ 19 f3!. b) Vasiliev-Emelin, Paide 1999 saw 15 ctJxd5 .i.xd5 16 .i.xd5+ 'iVxd5 17 b4 cxb4 18 axb4 b6! 19 0,e3 'iVe6 20 bxa5 bxa5 21 .l:txb8 ~xb8 22 ctJc41:ta8 23 .i.e3 f5 24 'iVa4 lh-1h. All very log- ical.

... ctJde7! This move works well because the white knights are ineffective now that they can't go to d5. Furthermore, Black threatens to place a knight on d4, attacking the squares b3 and e2. Having said that, 15 ... 0,xe3 16 .i.xe3 (16 fxe3! may well be better) 16 ... 0,d4 has a good reputa- tion; for example, 17 b4 cxb4 18 axb4 b5! 19 bxa5 b4 20 0,e4 'iVxa5, Zifroni-J.Polgar, Fond du Lac 1990.

Over the years this has been Black's most popular defence to 5 ttJf3. With 5 ... e6, he endeavours to create an immediate imbalance by placing his king's knight on e7, in contrast to White's on f3. Furthermore, he will usually play ... d5, strongly influencing the centre, whereas White will apparently have to be content with the less formidable d3. Why would White agree to this? First, be- cause 5 ... e6 creates a few sore points on Black's dark squares d6 and f6; perhaps he can exploit those with the right strategy. In addition, White is able to bring his pieces out just a tad more quickly than Black; not dramatically so, but just enough to prepare expansion on the queenside via b4 before his opponent is fully ready to meet it.

208 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

In objective terms, Black should be able to gain approximate equality. However, he must be ready to handle both tactical and positional strategies from his opponent, who controls the fundamental direction of play. 60-0 If White wants to employ a set-up with d3, he probably does best to play it now, because 6 d3 0,ge7 allows for a quick and useful 7 .tg5!; we shall see why that is so in the next game. Here are two among several alternatives: a) You should note the fact that 6 e3 nor- mally transposes to the 5 e3 lines, because 6 ... 0,ge77 d4 cxd4 8 0,xd4 follows - see 5 e3 e6 above. b) 6 h4!? (D) is a thought-provoking move.

White hopes that after 6 ... h5, Black's weak- nesses may count for something. Then the reader might want to analyse 7 d4!? and com- pare it to 5 0,f3 e6 6 d4 below; it doesn't hurt that White can play 0,g5 without getting chased away by ... h6. Apart from 6 ... h5, Black some- times permits White to advance the h-pawn; for example, 6 ... 0,ge7 7 h5 or 6 ... d5 7 h5, both of which are double-edged. Finally, the most com- mon move, 6 ... h6, might be compared with 6 d3 0,ge7 7 .tg5 h6 8 .td2 of our next game; here, too, White will try to gain a tempo by 'fIVc 1 at the right moment. c) 6 a3 is fairly popular due to 6 ... 0,ge7 7 b4!? (D). But this has several reasonable replies: c1) 7 .. .lDxb4!? 8 axb4 cxb4 90,b5 (9 0,e4 .txal 10 d4 .tc3+ 11 <t>f1 O-O 12 .tg5 is a fan- tastically complex line) 9 ... iLxal 10 'fIVa4 .tf6 11 'i¥xb4. This position has been said to provide

White with enough compensation, but that as- sessment may be optimistic. c2) 7 ... cxb4 8 axb4 0,xb4 9 .ta3 offers White some compensation for a pawn, although 9 ... 0,ec6! with the idea 10 ~a4 a5 11 Itbl O-O! should be fine for Black; instead, 100-00-0 11 d4 could be tried. c3) The safe 7 ... b6 8 Itbl 0-090-0 has been played a few times, although then 9 ... d5?! may not be best, because 10 bxc5 bxc5 11 0,a4 gives White some pull. Another issue about this move-order with 6 a3 concerns 6 ... d5 (instead of 6 ... 0,ge7). Then

7 O-O 0,ge7 (7 ... dxc4 8 'iVa4) 8 d3 resembles

our main line. You could argue that the move a3 has been played rather early, although I see no obvious way for Black to exploit that. 6 ... 0,ge7 7 d3 O-O 8 .td2 The sort of position that Black would like to head for is illustrated by 8 a3 d5 9 cxd5!?

This is Csom-Smejkal, Kiel1978. White has adequate play, but his position is difficult to handle. The d4-pawn is a troublesome intruder, whereas White's cxd5 has freed Black's queen's bishop. In fact, Black's bishop tends to stand better when nicely centralized on e6 than on b7. For the next few moves, the same consider- ations apply to the option of playing cxd5. 8 ••• dS 9 a3 b6 10 1:[bl i.b7 11 b4 This game has influenced how White's set- up is viewed, in part because Fischer called Petrosian's move 11 b4 a mistake; and others append '?!' to it and speak of Petrosian's bad judgement. In fact, other moves are passive, and White has his share of the play. 11 ... cxb4 12 axb4 dxc4 13 dxc4 (D)

A fundamental imbalance has arisen that we see in some of the most important variations of 5liJf3 e6 (and 5 e3liJf6). White has a structure with hanging pawns, in which the one on c4 can be a target on the open c-file. However, he has the idea of creating a passed pawn by c5, which can highlight Black's weakness on d6 and work in conjunction with a rook on dl.

9 a3 O-O 10 O-O b6 11 .l:!.bl J.b7

The immediate 1l...d4 12liJa4 allows White to play b4 after which, because of the knight's attack on cS, Black is forced to exchange his pawn there; once freed, White's queenside pawns can cause all sorts of mischief. For ex- ample, look at a position such as that after 12 ... J.d7 13 b4 (D). White's simple idea is that Black will have to B kick the bishop out at some point by ... h6, which will lead to a small weakness. More sig- nificantly, the already desirable move ~c1 will come with a gain of tempo in the most impor- tant variations. 7 .•. h6 Black can wait, for example by 7 ... O-O 8 O-O dS, but then 9 .l:!.bl will probably transpose any- way after a likely ... h6, and he also has to con- sider 9 ~cl, stopping ... h6, or 9 ~a4.1t doesn't seem worth it for Black to allow White extra possibilities. S J.d2 (D) S. .. dS This aggressive central advance has been al- most automatic with most masters who use S ... e6. Instead, Black can legitimately play more slowly, combining ... d6 with ... b6 and ... J.b7, or even try for ... a6 and ... bS. Of course, you can argue that he might then have been just as well off to play S ... d6 rather than S ... e6. It's also not clear whether 8 ... O-O makes any difference. 9 'iVc1 !? is a possible reply, and the White has achieved the b4 advance more rapidly than he might have, but the point is a general one. You should compare this type of position with a typical one from the Panno Vari- ation of the King's Indian Defence (see dia- gram on following page). Here White has defended c4 by liJf3-d2. In our English Opening position, Black's knight on e7 is three moves away from a square from which it could defend cS. That fact provides some of the motivation for b4 (and ... bS) in the Symmetrical English: once the move is achieved,

PURE SYMMETRICAL VARIATION 211

there is a good chance that it will compel the breakdown of the central support on cS (or c4). Finally, White will make the b4 pawn-break even if Black plays ... as; this results in pressure on Black's weak b6-pawn. 12 ~c1! A major point of 7 .i.gS!. Black's king will gain nothing by being on h7 rather than g8, so White has gained a full tempo over the previous game, which he uses to clear the d-file and sup- port his queenside advance.

But in this case White has gained the extra move ~c1, which not only gives him time to create a passed pawn on the queenside by cS, having in mind lbbS-d6 or lbe4-d6, but clears the way for .l:tdl. Black is already hard-pressed for a solu- tion to this strategy. IS. • :ili'c8!? This has been the normal move, as in the re- versed position. Black's situation is more criti- cal than it may seem at first: a) The thematic and innocent-looking move IS ... .l':tc8?

b) 15 ... tDf5 is more aggressive and logical, and yet it doesn't really address White's posi- tional threat; moreover, putting a knight on d4 may not mean much for Black: 16 c5! bxc5 (af- ter 16 ... tDe5, White can grab a loose pawn by 17 tDxe5 .Bxg2 18 ~xg2 .Bxe5 19 e4 tDd4 20 .Bxh6) 17 bxc5 .Ba6!

tDf3 e6 6 d4 (D)

For many years this radical pawn offer was not taken seriously, partly because the expendi- ture of two tempi to place a bishop on g2 would not generally fit into a sacrificial scheme. So, what is going on? Above all, White is trying to exploit the weak dark squares created by the move 5 ... e6, in particular d6 and f6. In what fol- lows he will play either tDb5 or tDe4, attacking d6. In addition, 6 d4 frees his dark-squared bishop to rush into play by .Bf4 or i.g5, hitting

PURE SYMMETRICAL VARIATION 213

one of those weaknesses. Since Black's c-pawn will end up on d4 (or gone), the potential ma- noeuvre b3 and i.a3 will strike at the d6-square and sometimes prevent castling (even i.b2 at- tacks down the long diagonal), and the advance cS might add to White's grip on d6. Finally, the move e3 can be relevant, adding to the attack on d4 and potentially opening White's f-file (if ... dxe3 is answered by fxe3). So we can see the contours of what White is aiming for. That's all well and fine, but Black has his own set of advantages, not least of which is that he will win a pawn; in many cases, the time that White has to expend recov- ering it will give Black the chance to develop rapidly. Furthermore, he gains a central major- ity, which enables him to play either an ag- gressive ... dS, breaking up White's centre, or ... eS, securing the d4 point. The centre pawns are by themselves a barrier against White's plans to infiltrate into the dark squares. Further- more, although White is about to make a very useful move with his knight, it is his second move with the same piece, and a third will usu- ally come shortly. 6 ••• tLJxd4 In the next game I address the alternative 6 ... cxd4. 7 tLJxd4 cxd4 (D) w 8 tLJe4 White sets up for cS, i.gS and/or tLJd6+.

As always, those conclusions lack the support of irrefutable evidence, but 8 tLJe4 definitely appears more promising.

White's pawn sacrifice is a superb example of the use of threats and tactics to achieve posi- tional goals. Let's go back and look at capturing on d4 with the pawn instead of the knight: Sulava - Hauchard Gonfreville 1999

The position of White's bishop on c4 varies from that of its English Opening counterpart on g2, but the goal of exploiting weaknesses on the dark squares d6 and f6 is the same. Instead of 6 ... cxd4, 6 ... ttJxd4 7 ttJxd4 cxd4 (7 ... i.xd4? 8 ttJbS i.eS 9 f4) 8 ttJbS is also similar our Eng- lish Opening line. In that case, White antici- pates 8 ...

In any case, playing 12 cxb7 first prevents this if White so desires. 15 i.xb7 nbS (D) w 16b3 What is happening in this position? White has regained his pawn, and can boast of the bishop-pair and queenside majority, whereas Black has a lead in development, two mobile centre pawns and b-file pressure. As we'll see, everything comes down to specifics. Before going on with the game, I'll address a neglected issue that has some practical im- pact. After IS ... .l:tb8, White is supposed to be able to force a draw with 16 .l:f.c1 'iVa2 17 l:!.a1 ~xb2 18l:!.b1, etc. But there's much more to it. First, Black is able to keep things alive with 18 ... 'it'xb7!? 19 ':xb7 ::'xb7. This seems ac- ceptable as a winning try, since Black needn't trade either of his rooks after 20 O-O O-O 21 'i¥c2 :tfb8. Going back to the position after 16l:!.c1 'it'a2, then, White can bypass the above ifhe in- terposes 17 i.a6, having in mind 18 i.bS+. Following 17 ... O-O 18 b4, White threatens 19 i.c4, trapping the queen. Then Black can still secure a likely draw by playing 18 ... 'it'a3 (threat- ening 19 ... lDdS to his apparent advantage), af- ter which 19 i.c4 allows Black to sacrifice the exchange productively by 19 ... .l:txb4! 20 i.xb4 'iVxb4+, so White presumably repeats by 19 l:!.a1'iVb2 20 l:tbl, etc. In this line, Black's only try for a win would be 18 ... 'it'dS!? 190-0 'iVd6, but if nothing else, White can play it safe with 20 i.c41DdS 21 i.xdS'it'xdS 22 .l:tc7 followed by 'it'c2 and .l:tfc 1. Finally, after 17 i.a6, Black can try to sacri- fice the exchange for two pawns by 17 ... 'it'xb2?! 18 i.bS+ .l:txbS 19 axbS 'it'xbS.

Introduction to 2 ttJf3

1 c4 c5 2lZ'lf3 (D)

The move 2lZ'lf3 with the idea of an early d4 appeals to players who want to stake out space in classical fashion. It is particularly important because so many English Opening adherents prefer to start with the move 1 lZ'lf3 (preventing ... eS) and then 2 c4. Thousands of games have seen 1 lZ'lf3 cS 2 c4 and 1 lZ'lf3 lZ'lf6 2 c4 cS. In fact, many more top-level games are played in the lZ'lf3 lines than in the Pure Symmetrical variations of Chapter 7. I shall therefore be giv- ing a more detailed and theoretical look at the material in this chapter than in most others. The main lines are replete with examples of funda- mental themes, especially those relating to space and centre. 2 lZ'lf3 gives the game a fundamentally dif- ferent character than 2 lZ'lc3. White's knight covers the central dark squares, for the moment preventing ... eS. He prepares to play d4 on one of the next two or three moves, an advance that rarely happens so early in the lines stemming from 2lZ'lc3. As a consequence, White will rule over more territory, and his queen and queen's bishop will usually have open lines and influ- ence in the initial stages of the game. Again, with a few exceptions, we didn't see this in the Pure Symmetrical variations of Chapter 7. Of course, every move gives up something, and the most obvious consideration when look- ing at 2lZ'lf3 is that White won't be able to place a knight on e2 in conjunction with e3 or e4, as in the previous chapter. Also, in lines in which White plays d4 and Black replies ... cxd4, White's pieces are more exposed to attack than in variations with g3 and .i.g2. Finally, because White's set-ups are relatively limited, Black has more leeway than his opponent in choosing a pawn-structure and piece formation. You can view this as being advantageous, in that Black has the flexibility to react to circumstances; on the other hand, you might argue that White's control of space reduces Black to a defensive posture, regardless of what he does. Right away, the material divides into two main paths. Variations with 2 ... ttJc6

1 c4 c5 2lZ'lf3lZ'lc6 (D)

Black's main reply to 2lZ'lf3 has traditionally been 2 ... lZ'lf6. More and more often, however, leading players have turned to 2 ... lZ'lc6 in an MAIN LINES WITH 2 ttJj3 AND d4 219 attempt to guide the game into channels of their choosing. Black's general wish is to bypass certain cramped positions that he suffers in the main lines stemming from 2 l2Jf3 l2Jf6. One of the important thoughts behind 2 ... l2Jc6 is to play 3 ... e5, usually followed by ... g6 and ... i.g7, establishing the Botvinnik formation that we are familiar with from Chapters 6 and 7. If White plays 3 d4 to prevent that, Black can transpose to main lines after 3 ... cxd4 4 l2Jxd4 by 4 ... l2Jf6 or 4 ... e6, but he can also play inde- pendently with moves such as 4 ... ~b6. Alter- natively, White can commit to 3 g3 or shift the decision back to Black by 3 l2Jc3. Naturally, there are trade-offs in each situation, and both sides can play independently if they want to. With that in mind, let's tum to games and see if we can understand the subtleties from exam- ples and analysis. Because of the diversity of move-orders and independent strategies stem- ming from 2 ... l2Jc6, the notes will require some patience to sort out. Kramnik - Navara Wijk aan Zee 2007

[diagram]
I'm not going to focus heavily on the conse- quences of irregular second moves, because they are of such diffuse character at this point. Nevertheless, to get you started, here are some bare comments: a) 2 ... g6 is an elastic move that can go sev- eral directions including, crucially, 3 d4. Then upon the normal 3 ... cxd4 4 l2Jxd4, Black has difficulty preventing the move e4; for exam- ple, 4 ... i.g7 5 e4l2Jc6 6 i.e3 (or 6l2Jc2), when we have a version of a Sicilian Defence, Mar- oczy Bind variation. Of course, 5 e4 isn't nec- essary, but the alternative 5 g3 l2Jc6 6 l2Jc2 agrees to 6 .. :iVa5+ 7 i.d2 'iVc5 or 7 .. :~'b6, both described under the move-order 2 l2Jf3 l2Jc6 3 g3 below. Returning to 2 ... g6 3 d4 cxd4 4 l2Jxd4, the only normal-looking, non-transpositional op- tion from Black's point of view is 4 ... l2Jf6 5 l2Jc3 d5?! (else 6 e4), when 6 i.g5 dxc4 7 e3 has a good reputation, but 6 i.f4! with the idea l2Jdb5 is even more awkward to counter. Finally, 2 ... g6 can be answered by 3 l2Jc3, when an independent line is 3 ... i.g7 4 e3. Then the conventional response is 4 ... l2Jf6 5 d4 cxd4 6 exd4 d5, which is actually a line of the Caro- Kann Defence, Panov Attack (1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 c4 l2Jf6 5 l2Jc3 g6 6 l2Jf3 i.g7). Black might also consider 4 ... i.xc3!?, with a philosophy similar to that in the 1 c4 e5 lines in- volving ... i.b4 and ... i.xc3. Remember that those positions are always easier to play if White has committed to the move e3, which ob- structs his bishop on c 1. b) With the other fianchetto, 2 ... b6, Black hopes to enter some sort of Hedgehog position following 3 g3 i.b7 4 i.g2. This is rather com- mittal, however, because White can play 3 l2Jc3 (or even 3 e3) 3 ... i.b7 (the similar 3 ... e6 4 e3! l2Jf6 5 d4 is examined via the sequence 2 l2Jf3 l2Jf6 3l2Jc3 b6 4 e3 in the next chapter; it has the same ideas) 4 e3! (D).

Now Black must give ground in order to prevent White's d4-d5 advance: 4 ... l2Jf6 5 d4 cxd4 6 exd4 dS? (6 ... e6 is better, though 7 i.d3 preserves a nice spatial plus) 7 cxdS l2JxdS 8 l2JeS! l2Jxc3 9 bxc3 a6 (versus 10 i.bS+), and a surprisingly powerful move is 10 .l:i.bl!, when it's hard to prevent 11 ~a4+; for example, 10 ... bS? l1.l:i.xbS!, or 1O ... e611 'iVa4+l2Jd712 ':xb6!. 3l2Jc3 I'll use this move to illustrate some unique lines that Black uses as alternatives to main-line Four Knights theory. We shall see 3 d4 in the next game. The alternative 3 g3 (D) is important and complex. It requires an understanding of move- orders and the resulting transpositions. Rather than memorize what follows, you can use it as a

reference while becoming comfortable with playing the 2 tLlf3 tLlc6 lines.

White's fianchetto can be answered with an assortment of moves, but it is played with par- ticular regard for Black's attempts to play an early ... tLlf6 and ... dS. There can follow: a) 3 ... eS 4 tLlc3 g6 (4 ... tLlf6 S i.g2 dS? falls for the familiar trick 6 cxdS tLlxdS 7 tLlxeS! tLlxc3 8 tLlxc6 tLlxd 1 9 tLlxd8 tLlxf2 10 tLlxf7 tLld3+ - the only chance - 11 exd3 r:J;;xf7 12 O-O+ 'lite8 13 b3!, and Black is thoroughly bound up) S i.g2 i.g7 and we have arrived at a reversed Botvinnik System of the Pure Sym- metrical Variation - see Chapter 7; whether someone wants to contest either side of this po- sition is a matter of taste. b) 3 ... g64 i.g2 i.g7 S O-O (or S tLlc3) will usually bring us back to a Pure Symmetrical Variation; for example, if Black plays S. .. eS, S. .. e6 or S. .. tLlf6, then 6 tLlc3 transposes to Chapter 7. Instead, 4 d4 cxd4 S tLlxd4 i.g7 (D) is one of the least inspiring times for White to play into a d4 system. For example, 6 tLlc2 (6 tLlxc6 dxc6!? 7 ~xd8+ 'it>xd8 already gives Black a favourable pawn-structure, since the c6-pawn limits the g2-bishop, while White's move c4 makes the bishop on g7 more effective - only because White is ahead on time can we evaluate this po- sition as level; furthermore, 6 tLlb3 as! with ... a4 to follow wins time for Black, because 7 a4?! would weaken b4 too seriously) 6 ... ~a5+!?

'ilVxc3) 9 ... 'litd8 10 i.g2 e6. Here Black seems to escape in reasonably good shape. In return for serious pressure from the white forces, Black is a pawn to the good, and his central majority helps greatly in the de- fence. Of course, his king will remain in the centre for a while and this may not appeal to ev- eryone. This whole line is unexplored and up in the air. c) 3 ... tLlf6 (D) is highly transpositional, but can also produce distinct lines: w c1) 4 i.g2 dS S cxdS tLlxdSleads to standard 'Asymmetrical' variations of Chapter 9 follow- ing 6 tLlc3 tLlc7 or here 6 ... e6. Instead of 6 tLlc3,

6 d4 isn't too dangerous if Black knows what

he's doing. Black has at least three reasonable moves. Play often goes 6 ... cxd4!? 7 tLlxd4 tLldM 8 tLlxc6 'iVxdl + 9 'it>xdl tLlxc6. While this should probably be equal, White can create an imbalance by 10 i.xc6+!? bxc6 11 i.e3,

MAIN LINES WITH 2 0,13 AND d4 221

when ROder-Gupta, Sort 2006 went 11...g6 12 lbd2 il.g7 13lbc4 0-014 ttc1 il.e6 and Black's bishops compensated for his weak c-pawn. This type of position is thought-provoking enough to reward some study and practice. White can also play simply 10 lbc3, when the best-known ex- ample is Kramnik-Kasparov, Frankfurt (rapid) 2000: 1O ... il.d7!? 11 il.e3 O-O-012 WeI eS 13 l:!.c 1 'iitb8 14 f4 with a little pull. Instead of all this, Black can get a perfectly good game by an- swering 6 d4 with either 6 ... il.fS!, intending 7 O-O lbdb4, or 6 ... lbb6 7 dxcS 'iVxdl + 8 'iitxdl lba4 9lbc3lbxc3+! 10 bxc3 il.fS 11 il.e3 il.e4, Andersson-Timman, Tilburg 1991. c2) After 4lbc3 dS, the ordinary-looking S cxdS lbxdS 6 il.g2 g6 7 O-O il.g7 is a Pure Sym- metrical Variation from Chapter 7. However, S d4 transposes directly to our main game Kram- nik-Navara (for which I've used the more com- mon move-order 2 ... lbc6 3 lbc3 lbf6 4 g3 dS S d4). This is one of the primary motivations for White to play 3 g3. c3) Finally, we might see 4 d4 cxd4 Slbxd4

Unless Black wants to go for a Pure Sym- metrical Variation by S. .. g6 6 il.g2 il.g7, etc., he will usually play S. .. e6. Then 6lbc3 is the main Four Knights line. However, the unique move 6 il.g2 opens the door to many deviations from the norm. Among these are 6 ... ~b6, 6 ... il.b4+ and 6 .. :iVaS+, the last often leading to 7 il.d2 'iVb6 8 lbb3, when 8 ... d6, 8 ... aS and even 8 ... hS!? are options! Lastly, Black can play 6 ... "iic7; for example, 7 O-O a6. Unfortu- nately, the English Opening has hundreds of these lesser-played alternatives throughout, so I'll opt out and leave it up to readers to investi- gate any in which they have an interest. After that lengthy digression about 3 g3, let's return to 3 lbc3 (D) and our main game Kramnik-Navara: 3 .•. lbf6 In the next game but one we'll see the impor- tant move 3 ... eS. a) Black also has the rather bizarre-looking 3 ... lbd4, a popular move which tries to prevent an effective d4 on White's part. Black justifies moving a knight twice by the threat of ... lbxf3+. I'll have to forego an analysis of the broader theory here, but will comment on two varia- tions: al) I like White better than most analysts seem to in the line 4 g3 lbxf3+ S exf3 lbf6 6 d4! cxd4 7 ~xd4 g6 8 il.g2 il.g7 9 O-O O-O 10 f4

White has two open central files and control of every central square other than d4. Of course,

222 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

the doubled f-pawns are immobile and Black's pieces have good scope. Vander Sterren-Tim- man, Rotterdam 1998 continued 1O ... d6 11 B ..td2!? a6!? 12 l:lac1 l:lb8, and Timman sug- gests that White only equalizes with 13 ~d3, but this may well favour White because of his extra space; for example, 13 ... ..tfS 14 ~e2 ..tg4 IS 'iWe3 ~d7 16 b3 bS?! 17 tZJdS!. a2) A more significant variation, and what is currently the main line, goes 4 e3 tZJxf3+ S 'iVxf3 g6 6 b3 ..tg7 7 ..tb2 d6 8 g4!? (D).

This is a fun move to play, and I think a good one. White grabs space, prepares ..tg2, and wants to cramp Black's game with gS and/or h4-hS. The most popular solution has been 8 ... l:lb8 (after 8 ... tZJf6, 9 gS!? tZJd7!? 10 h4 tZJeS 11 'iVg2 ..tg4 12 ..te2 ..txe2 13 ~xe2 with the idea hS and/or f4 was very comfortable for White in Van Wely-Akopian, Enghien-les- Bains 2001; 9 h3 is a solid alternative) 9..tg2 ..td7 (with the idea ... ..tc6) 10 'iWe2 a6 (after 1O ... tZJf6 11..tf3!? ..tc6, 120-O-O prepares d4- don't forget the centre! The logical alternative 1O ... 'iVc8 11 gS ..tc6 is proposed by Krasenkow, but similarly, 12 ..txc6+ 'ili'xc6 13 O-O-O with the idea 14 d4 gives White the advantage, as does 12 f4 h6 13 O-O-O!) 11 gS bS 12 d3 'ili'aS 13 l:lcl!? (D) (13 ~d2 is a good alternative). This fascinating position has been reached a few times. In A.Petrosian-Skripchenko, Dort- mund 2000, White stood better after 13 ... h6 14 h4 hxgS IS hxgS l:lxhl + 16 ..txhl eS 17 ~d2 tZJe7 18 tZJe4!? 'ili'b6 19 f4. Instead of this, Palliser approves of 13 .. .fS, as played in Pigu- sov-Alekseev, Russian Team Ch, Tomsk 2001. That game continued 14 ~fl?! ~f7 IS h4 hS! with equality. The king is oddly placed on fl, however; White should prefer 14 h4 hS IS O-O!, with what seems a traditional English Opening advantage. He has strong bishops, central pros- pects and the safer king. For example, IS ... ~f7 (IS ... e6? 16 tZJe4!; IS ... eS 16 tZJdS; IS ... b4? 16 tZJdS'iWxa2 17l:lc2) 16 d4!? (or 16 tZJdS!, with the point 16 ... ~xa2 17 l:lc2 ~xb3 18 ..txg7 ~xg7 19l:lb2 ~a4 20 l:lfbl! ~aS 21l:la2, etc.) 16 ... cxd4 17 exd4 bxc4 18 tZJdS! e6 19 tZJf4! with the idea 19 ... cxb3? 20 ..tc6! ..tc8 21 ..tdS! exdS 22 l:!.xc8, etc. That's only analysis, of course, but I think Black must seriously im- prove upon his basic set-up here. b) A fairly common alternative is 3 ... g6. It can lead to 4 g3 ..tg7, with a Pure Symmetrical variation, or to these: bI) 4 d4 cxd4 S tZJxd4 ..tg7 is generally re- garded as satisfactory for Black. One interest- ing variation is 6 tZJc2!? ..txc3+ 7 bxc3 ~aS. Oddly enough, this is a reversed position of the Rubinstein Variation of Chapter 9, but the tempi are the same! This comes from the fact that in the reversed position, White moves his queen twice to arrive at 1 c4 cS 2 tZJc3 lLlf6 3 g3 dS 4 cxdS lLlxdS S ..tg2 lLlc7 6 'iWb3!? lLlc6 7 ..txc6+ bxc6 8 'iVa4. See that chapter for de- tails. b2) 4 e3!? can be a little awkward for Black: 4 ... lLlf6 (4 ... ..tg7 S d4 has a poor reputation for Black; although S ... d6 is playable, with the idea of ... ..tg4 in some lines, he has to be willing to play against dS and e4 at some point; tradition- ally, White begins with 6 ..te2) S d4 cxd4 6 exd4 dS. Now we have a kind of reversed Tarrasch Queen's Gambit. White can develop normally by, for example, 7 ..te2 ..tg7 8 0-00-0 MAIN LINES WITH 2 tDf3 AND d4 223 9l:te 1 or try a unique line such as 7 .i.gS .i.e6!? Most dangerous for Black is 7 cxdS lLlxdS 8 'ilib3!, when one curious possibility is 8 ... lLlxc3 9 .i.c4!. Now: b21) 9 ... e6 10 bxc3 .i.g7!? (lO ... lLlaS? 11 .i.bS+ i.d7 12 'iia4 lLlc6 is met by 13 dS! exdS

14 O-O with an attack) 11 .i.a3 .i.f8 was Bot-

vinnik-Petrosian, World Ch match (game 8), Moscow 1963. Botvinnik played 12 .i.c1 .i.g7 13 .i.bS, but Tal later demonstrated 12 O-O! i.xa3 13 'iixa3 'iie7 14 ~c I! with a nice edge. b22) Black's other defence is 9 ... lLldS!? 10 .i.xdS e6 11 .i.xc6+ bxc6, when theory favours White's prospects, but the position isn't clear. If you're interested in lines that are slightly off the beaten track, these might be for you. 4g3 The actual move-order used in this game, by the way, was 1 lLlf3 lLlf6 2 c4 cS 3 g3 lLlc6 4 lLlc3. I have chosen to begin with 1 c4 in order to show other lines from the English Opening along the way. 4 ... d5 (D)

This position can also arise from 2 lLlf3 lLlf6 3 lLlc3 lLlc6 4 g3 dS. 5 d4!? A surprise. Black was probably aiming to get to a conventional variation stemming from S cxdS lLlxdS 6 .i.g2; for example, 6 ... eS (or 6 ... lLlc7) 7 O-O lLlc7, with a Rubinstein Varia- tion (see Chapter 9); or 6 ... g6 7 O-O .i.g7, which we've looked at via the Pure Symmetri- cal with S lLlf3 lLlf6 6 O-O dS 7 cxdS lLlxdS. 5 ... cxd4 The ubiquitous Tarrasch Queen's Gambit pops up again after S ... e6 6 cxdS exdS. Here 6 ... lLlxdS is the Keres-Parma Variation (Chap- ter 9), and should be considered for someone who wants a more active game than he gets here. The alternatives are quite complex: a) S ... .i.g4(D) .

This resembles White's play in the Griinfeld and might be profitably compared with it: al) 6 cxdS lLlxdS (6 ... .i.xf3?! 7 exf3 lLlxdS 8 ~b3 lLlxc3 9 bxc3 cxd4 10 .i.c4! e6 11 'iNxb7 with the idea 1l...'iic8? 12 .i.a6!) 7 .i.g2 cxd4!? 8 lLlxd4 lLldM! with approximate equality, in- tending 9 a3 eS!. This ... lLldM manoeuvre crops up repeatedly in the Symmetrical English. a2) 6 .i.g2 .i.xf3 7 .i.xf3 seems to offer White only a very small advantage, if that. Black probably won't equalize after 7 ... dxc4 8 dS! lLld4 9 .i.g2 lli'aS 10 .i.d2 O-O-O 11 e3 lLlfS 120-0 lli'a6 13 b3! with queenside attacking chances. However, Black has two better meth- ods. First, 7 ... lLlxd4 8 .i.g2! (8 .i.xdS lLlxdS 9 cxdS g6 10 O-O .i.g7 is fine for Black) 8 ... dxc4 9 .i.xb7 J:i.b8 10 .i.g2 lli'd7 11 O-O e6 confers only a modest edge on White. In addition, the modest 7 ... e6!? is surprisingly tough. White's bishops don't seem to mean a lot; for example, 8 cxdS lLlxd4 9 .i.g2 lLlxdS 10 lLlxdS exdS 11 O-O .i.e7 12 e3 lLlc6 13 .i.xdS O-O. This proba- bly favours White, but not by much, since Black's queenside majority (barring .i.xc6, which is fairly harmless) counts for as much as White's own majority in the centrelkingside, because White has difficulty mobilizing his pawns. b) After the natural S ... dxc4!?, White can reply with the equally obvious 6 dS!, although this entails a sacrifice. Then Black has two

224 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

serious replies, both involving entertaining tac- tical play: bl) Tal-Timman, Match (game S), Hilver- sum 1988 saw 6 ... tbaS 7 e4! bS 8 tbxbS tbxe4 9 tbeS! (with the idea 10 ~a4) 9 ... i.d7 10 tbxd7 ~xd7 11 ~a4! l:tb8 12 tbc7+ <;;t>d8 13 tbe6+! fxe6 14 ~xaS+ WIIc7 IS WIIxc7+ ~xc7 16 i.f4+ tbd6 17 O-O-O g6!? 18 i.eS :g8 19 dxe6 i.g7

20 f4 gS!, and now 21 :dS! would have estab-

lished a definite superiority. b2) Ftacnik-Lesiege, Montreal 2002 tested the highly tacticaI6 ... tbb4: 7 e4! i.g4 8 i.xc4! (falling in with Black's materialistic wishes) 8 ... i.xf3 9 ~xf3 tbc2+ 10 <;;t>f1! (D).

1O ... a6! (this prevents i.bS+ and tbbS; upon 10 ... tbxal, 11 eS! storms through - if the knight retreats by 11...tbd7, 12 e6 wins because of i.bS+, so in Wojtkiewicz-Yudasin, New York 1991, Black tried ll...a6 12 exf6 tbc2, losing to 13 d6! e6 14 ~xb7 ~b8 IS ~c6+ <;;t>d8 16 i.xe6!, with the point 16 ... fxe6? 17 i.gS) 11 eS! tbd4 12 ~dl bS (l2 ... tbd7 13 f4! with a dominant pawn-mass) 13 exf6 bxc4 14 .i.e3 gxf6 IS i.xd4 cxd4 16 ~xd4l:tc8 17 ~g2 .i.g7 18 l:thel O-O 19 'iVg4 .tIc7 20 l:.adl. White's beautifully centralized pieces combine with Black's weaknesses to grant White a comfort- able advantage. Finally we return to Kramnik-Navara: 6 tbxd4 dxc4 Since White now gets an edge in a dry posi- tion, I'll claim author's indulgence to specu- late that the more dynamic reversed Grtinfeld Defence position initiated by 6 ... eS 7 tbxc6 bxc6 (D) is playable, and close to equal for Black. w This is another one of those paradoxical po- sitions in which an extra white move, in this case tbc3, can be a liability as well as an asset, because it exposes White to a timely ... d4. Com- pare the Grtinfeld Proper main line with 1 d4 tbf6 2 c4 g6 3 tbc3 dS 4 cxdS tbxdS S e4 tbxc3 6 bxc3 i.g7 7 tbf3 cS 8 i.e2 tbc6?! (8 ... O-O! is the usual move, steering clear of dS). Now White can play 9 dS! i.xc3+ 10 i.d2 .i.xal 11 'iVxal tbd4 12 tbxd4 cxd4 13 ~xd4 with a strong attack. In our English Opening version, from the dia- gram after 7 ... bxc6, 8 i.gS d4 isn't what White wants, and he doesn't get anything meaningful by exchanging: 8 cxdS cxdS 9 i.g2 i.e6 10 O-O (10 i.gS d4!) 1O ... l:tc8. Now Black wants to play ... d4. White's natural response would be 11 ~a4+ (D).

11..:~'d7 (ll....i.d7?! 12 'Wixa7 d4 13 tbe4

tbxe4 14 i.xe4 i.cs IS ~a6! limits Black's compensation) 12 "iVxd7+ <;;t>xd7 13 IIdl .i.cS! 14 tbxdS tbxdS IS .i.xdS (or IS e4 i.d4!) MAIN LINES WITH 2 ti:Jf3 AND d4 225 IS ... i.xdS 16 .l:txdS+ 'it'e6 gives Black enough compensation for the pawn after 17 l:td2 (17 e4 i.d4! ties White to defence, and 17 l:td3 l:.hd8 18 l:txd8 l:txd8 leaves Black at least equal) 17 ... i.b4! (or even 17 ... l:thd8 18 'it'g2 i.b6) 18 l:tdll:tc2 19 a3 i.aS, etc. So the critical variation would seem to be 8 i.g2. The only book I've found that addresses 6 ... eS gives 8 ... i.e6 9 i.gS! here, when Black is already in poor shape. But knowing the reversed position, you can guess that Black should play 8 ... d4! (D).

Then White's only try for an advantage is 9 i.xc6+ i.d7 10 i.xa8 (10 i.xd7+ 'iYxd7 11 ttJbl 'iYc6) 1O ... 'iYxa8 11 ttJdS ttJxdS 12 cxdS 'iYxdS. Black's f8-bishop is undeveloped, while it would be on e2 in the reversed line. That is a pure tempo-loss, and not some trade-off of time for information. Nevertheless, it doesn't seem serious enough to deny him counterplay: 13 f3 (130-0 i.h3 14 'iYa4+ 'it'e7 ISli'xa7+ 'it'e6 16 f3 i.xfl 17 'it'xfl i.d6 18 li'a6 fS is fine for Black) 13 ... i.d6 (or 13 ... i.cS 141i'b3 'iYd6) 14 '*lVb3 'iVc6 (or 14 .. :iVa8), intending some com- bination of ... O-O, ... l:tb8, .. :iVdS and ... i.bS. Of course there are plenty of other options. In any event, you could do worse than to study this variation, both for fun and in order to improve your understanding. The situation in- volving the bishop-pair as compensation for the exchange is ubiquitous in modem chess, and the English Opening player will always benefit from thinking about reversed positions. 7 ttJxc6 'iYxd1 + Black gets to simplify and force one of White's pieces back. Weaker is 7 ... bxc6 8 'iYa4 i.d7 9 i.g2 with O-O and '*lVxc4 to follow, be- cause White's queen is an annoyance.

8 ttJxdl! This knight will be excellently placed on e3. 8 ... bxc6 9 i.g2 (D) The queen exchange has resulted in a tech- nical position that may not rivet the average player's attention. White's strategy is to squeeze a win out of his pressure against Black's pawns on the open c-file. After one of those pawns falls, White hopes that the remaining isolated pawn will prove a weakness; remember that the squares in front of it can be safely occupied by a piece. One factor in Black's favour is that he will develop quickly and be in a better position to neutralize that advantage. After many years of experience, I think it's fair to say that the po- sition is objectively drawn, but that in practice, White will periodically eke out a win, espe- cially against someone who is not well pre- pared. What follows is not high theory, but hopefully represents the main ideas. 9 ... ttJdS! After 9 ... i.d7, 10 ..td2 l:tb8 11 .l:!.c1 and l:txc4 maintains the upper hand. 10 ttJe3 (D) 10•.• e6 A more active and perhaps satisfactory alter- native is 1O ... ..ta6 11 ttJxdS cxdS 12 i.xdS ':'c8; for example, 13 i.d2 e6 14 i.f3 i.cs IS i.c3 f6! (it's important to keep the king centralized)

seems to equalize, intending 21 iLe2 iLd5. Con- sidering the elite players who use this line as White, however, it's probably not so easy. 11 lLlxe4 iLa6 (D) w 12lLla5 This move was given a firm '!' and enthusi- astic approval when it replaced years of prac- tice with 12 b3 and won a series of nice games for Kramnik, among others. Now some players, including Kramnik himself, are returning to 12 b3. The situation described above applies after that move as well: with careful play, Black's position is considered adequate to draw, but he has to work a bit. White had a slight but hardly decisive advantage after 12 ... iLb4+ 13 iLd2 iLxd2+ 14lLlxd2lLlb4 151it>dl O-O-O 16 a3lLld5 17 ~el ~b7 18 ~el e5 19 e3 in Kramnik- Leko, Misko1c 2007, and at this point Black can consider 19 ... lLle7, clearing d3 or 19 ... :the8 with the idea 20 iLfl?! iLxfl 21 ':!'xfl e4. Instead of all this, 12 ... l:i.c8! is a safe and constructive move, which both guards c6 and prepares the useful advance ... c5; for example, 13 iLd2 iLe7 14 iLaS 0-015 l::td1 iLd8 16 iLxd8 l::tfxd8 17 l::tel c5 (getting this move in usually solves most of Black's problems) 18 iLe4 iLxc4 19 bxc4lLlf6 20 iLd3 l::tb8 21 l::tc3 l::tb2 22 l::ta3 e5 23 f3 e4 24 fxe4 lLlg4 25 l::txa7 lLle5 26 O-O f6. Black has an immovable knight outpost ver- sus White's tragically placed bishop, Sebenik- Kreisl, Szeged 2007.

With this advance, White sidesteps the 'Bot- vinnik' line 3 ... e5, but Black's knight on c6 opens up some interesting possibilities. 3 ••• exd4 4lLlxd4 (D) 4 ... WVb6 This is one of Black's most important ways to bypass the main Four Knights lines which would follow the 'normal' continuation 4 ... lLlf6 5 lLlc3. If Black can get an acceptable game from the position after 4 .. :iVb6, it allows him to use 2 ... lLlc6 to avoid a few of the tougher lines that can arise if he plays 2 ... lLlf6, as described in the next section. One positive feature is that 4 .. :iVb6 forces an immediate response. I'm not going to cover this move in great detail but will show some general contours of the play. As always, Black has alternatives: MAIN LINES WITH 2 tDf3 AND d4 227

a) 4 ... e6 tends to transpose to other lines, but can produce unique play, such as after S ttJc3 ~b4!? (S ... ttJf6 is the Four Knights) or S g3 ~b4+!? 6 ttJc3 ~aS. Neither of these lines is a frequent choice of masters yet. A third an- swer to 4 ... e6 is S ttJbS; for example, S. .. d6 (or S ... ttJf6 6 ~f4 eS 7 ~gS 'iVaS+) 6 ~f4 (6 e4 transposes to the Taimanov Sicilian with S ttJbS d6 6 c4 - see Volume 1) 6 ... eS 7 ~g3lLlf6 8 ~h4!? (that's three moves for this one piece) 8 ... a6!? 9lLlSc3 (and four moves with this one! Surely Black cannot stand worse) 9 ... ~e7 10 e3, Bu Xiangzhi-Alekseev, China-Russia match, Nizhny Novgorod 2007. Here Bu Xiangzhi suggests 1O ... ~b6! 11 ~xf6 ~xf6 12 lLldS ~xb2 13lLlbc3 ~g4 14 ~bl ~xbl + IS .l:!.xbl

O-O-O.

b) 4 ... g6 is seldom an independent continu- ation, and it permits White to play S e4, which is a Maroczy Bind Variation of the Sicilian and not to the taste of every defender. SlLlb3 a) S lLlc2 e6 6 g3 is slow. In cases where White's knight is on c2 instead of b3, the cus- tomary move is 6 ... ~cS !, with the idea of forc- ing light-square weaknesses upon White. Black will answer 7 e3 with 7 ... dS 8 cxdS exdS 9 ~g2 lLlf6. b) SlLlbS!? (D) expresses the idea that put- ting a knight on c3 will truly control dS and make the queen look a little funny out there on b6. bI) Now S. .. a6 6lLlSc3 e6 7 g3!? ~cS de- velops logically. Then 8 e3 ~c7 9 ~g2lLlf6 10 O-O O-O 11 b3 is strategically correct, but slow. For example, 11....l:!.d8 12 ~b2 dS! 13 cxdS exdS threatens ... d4, and if White sacrifices the

Therefore White might want to look into 8lLle4 lLlf6 9lLlxcs ~xcS instead, although he'll have to sacrifice a pawn, perhaps along the lines of 10 lLlc3 'iVxc4 11 ~g2. Then White has an at- tack based upon his bishop-pair and dark- square prospects, but Black has an impressive centre and, of course, an extra pawn. b2) Black usually chooses S ... lLlf6.

The po- sition is still unclear (after all, White's king has nowhere to go), but this 1:!.gl idea (supporting g4-gS) has been a successful technique in simi- lar variations.

228 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

This is an extremely significant juncture. I apologize in advance for the following explana- tion, which is obscure-sounding but important to understand. In the position after 6 ... ltJf6, 7 g3 transposes to the Four Knights main line which goes 2ltJf3 ltJf6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ltJxd4ltJc6 5 ltJc3 e6 6 g3 'iWb6 7 ltJb3. If White chooses 7 a3 in- stead, that transposes to the other Four Knights variation with the same first five moves and then 6 a3 'ti'b6 7 ltJb3. With such options for White, it makes you wonder how 4 ... ~b6 could be an improvement over 4 ... ltJf6 5 ltJc3 e6 at all. The answer to that largely lies with your at- titude towards the independent and important option that White has in the main-line Four Knights that goes 2 ltJf3 ltJf6 3 ltJc3 ltJc6 4 d4 cxd4 5 ltJxd4 e6 6 g3 'iWb6, namely, 7 ltJdb5; see that section for the details. If you're happy meeting that move as Black, then you have less incentive to go with the 2 ... ltJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ltJxd4 'iWb6 move-order (which avoids it). This all sounds complicated until you put it on a board and see how easy the transpositions really are. Finally, after 4 ... ~b6 5 ltJb3 e6 6ltJc3 ltJf6, White also has the independent line played in this game: 7 e4!? .Bb4 8 .Be3!? There are plenty of options. 8 ••• .Bxc3+! 9 bxc3 'ti'c710 f3 d6 (D) w We shall see this structure in the main Four Knights lines. Black can target White's weak doubled c-pawns, as in the Nimzo-Indian De- fence and other openings. He has the right pieces to do it: a knight can go to e5, a bishop to a6, a rook to c8, and so forth. White, on the other hand, has the bishop-pair, space, and two potential structural ideas: c5, which activates his pieces, and g4-g5. llltJd4!? a6 Versus 12ltJb5, but now Black no longer has the idea of ... b6 with ... .Ba6.

Black seeks to set up a reversed Botvinnik structure, one of the main points of 2 ... ltJc6.

4 e3 (D)

This modest nudge of a pawn is the most se- rious independent challenge White can put to 3 ... e5, and it's the preference of many grand- masters. The fact that White hasn't played g3 MAIN LINES WITH 2 lDf3 AND d4 229 makes e3 followed by d4 a realistic plan. In- stead, 4 g3 g6 S .i.g2 .i.g7 would transpose to the normal Pure Symmetrical English variation B wi th S lL'lf3 eS.

4 ••• lL'lf6 This is the most effective way in which Black can contest the centre. a) 4 ... g6? S d4 cxd4 6 exd4 exd4 7lL'lxd4 al- ready puts Black in trouble due to his isolated d-pawn and weakness on d6. He can hardly play 7 ... .i.g7? because of 8lL'ldbS, but 7 ... lL'lf6 8 lL'ldbS .i.b4 9 'iVe2+ 'i?o>f8 10 .i.h6+ 'it>g8 11 O-O-O is also horrible. b) 4 .. .fS risks the consequences of a delay in Black's development; for example, S d4 cxd4 (5 ... e4 also has multiple answers, but 6 dS! is the easiest; after 6 ... exf3 7 dxc6 fxg2 8 cxd7+ 'iVxd7 9 .i.xg2 'iVxd 1+ 10 ~xd 1 lL'lf6, as in Marin-Ardeleanu, Romanian Ch, Iasi 1999, Black is not only underdeveloped, but both of his bishops are cut off by the bishops' pawns; then 11 lL'ldS! would have guaranteed the ad- vantage) 6 exd4 e4 7 dS! exf3 8 dxc6 and either 8 ... dxc6 9 'iVxf3 or 8 .. .fxg2 9 cxd7+ ~xd7 10 .i.xg2! 'iVxd1+ 11 'i?o>xd1 (D) leaves Black in a positional mess. White has a development lead and terrific squares for his pieces while Black has multiple internal weaknesses caused by the early ad- vance .. .fS. 5 d4 Or: a) Sometimes S a3 is played, as a sort of semi-waiting move, when White anticipates S. .. dS (I should point out that S ... .i.e7 is play- able, especially if 6 d4 cxd4 7 exd4 exd4 8 lL'lxd4 can be answered by 8 ... dS!, a move which has been neglected but seems all right; for ex- ample, 9 cxdS lL'lxdS 10 i.bS lL'lxc3 11 bxc3 .i.d7) 6 cxdSlL'lxdS (D).

Then White has two main moves: a1) 7 ~c2 is another reversed Taimanov Si- cilian position: all) If nothing else it permits the modest 7 ... lL'lxc3. Then 8 bxc3 (8 dxc3 .i.d6 is solid) 8 ... i.d6 can't be too bad for Black, because the move a3 is a bit wasted. On the other hand, for- mal advantage or not, White has some interest- ing possibilities. Apart from constructing a d3/c4 set-up, he can have some fun with a combination of i.d3, c4, l:'Lbl and i.e4 as ap- propriate, while an attack against the black king by h4 is not unthinkable. a12) More ambitious is 7 ... .i.e6!? 8 i.bS (again, 8 i.d3!? is an intriguing idea) 8 ... lL'lxc3 9 'iVxc3 f6, when 10 d3 is apparently better than

SLb8 14 .tc5. 5 ... cxd4 5 ... e4 will usually transpose; for example, after 6lbg5 or 6lbe5, Black can play 6 ... cxd4. White's attempt to get more by 6 d5 accom- plishes nothing after 6 ... exf3 7 dxc6 fxg2 8 cxd7+ .txd7 9 SLxg2 Wilc7 with the ideas ... SLc6 and ... O-O-O, Suba-Wedberg, Dortmund 1983.

White has two bishops and Black has space. This position has been contested many times: a) 14 i.d2!? (White logically tries to move his bishop from c3, where it is blocked by the d4-pawn, to a diagonal upon which it can exert influence) 14 ... ~g6 15 i.f4 i.h3 (15 ... h5 is a good alternative) 16 i.g3 i.g4! 17 i.xg4ltJxg4 18 l:Iel l:Iad8 with approximate equality, Khar- lov-Yakovenko, Russian Team Ch, Sochi 2005. b) I won't go deeply into 14 ~c1 'ii'g6, but one theme to mention comes up after 15 'iVe3 (15 Wif4 h5 is standard) 15 ... i.g4 16l:tfe1 b5!? (D), played in Pachman-Ksieski, 2nd Bundes- liga 1994/5. This method of trying to eliminate White's c-pawn and win the d5-square is a recurring one in what I would call 'light-square' openings. For example, it happens in at least two varia- tions of the Slav Defence and in the main line (4 ... i.f5) of the Caro-Kann Defence, as well as in the Chigorin Defence to the Queen's Gam- bit, and lesser lines of the Queen's Gambit and the Nimzo-Indian Defence. In fact, most open- ings in which White plays d4 and c4 have at least one serious line in which Black's pawn advances to ... b5, especially if White has cas- tled queenside, in which case its effect is natu- rally multiplied. Although ... b5 is sometimes played as a pawn sacrifice (because possession of d5 is so important), here 17 cxb5 ltJd5 18 'iVd2 i.xe2 recovers the pawn with a great posi- tion in view of 19 'iVxe2ltJf4 20 'iVn cxb5. 7 ... i.h4 (D) This is precisely the position that arises from

6 cxd5 exd5 7 e5 ltJg4 8 i.b5, with colours re- versed but the same tempi. In fact, the analysis that follows will borrow from examples played with that move-order. Furthermore, it some- times arises from a Sicilian Defence: 1 e4 c5 2 ltJf3 e6 (or 2 ... ltJc6 3 c4, etc.) 3 c4ltJc6 4ltJc3 ltJf6 5 i.e2 d5, etc. These are sidelines, to be sure, but useful ones to be familiar with!

S• •• ltJe5 This variation as a whole is fascinating. 8 ... i.xc3+ 9 bxc3 ltJa5! is an important alter- native connected with some crazy and little- investigated tactics. White's natural response is 10 i.a3 (10 Wid4 has also been played), but

232 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

after 10 ... d6 (D), White needs to justify the slightly odd positions of his bishop on a3 and knight on g5. B w Black intends l1...h6 12 ttJh3 .i.xh3, or per- haps 11.. .e3!? followed by ... ttJg4. Therefore White needs to move quickly: 11 c5!? (with the idea 12 .i.b5+; 11 ~a4+?! .i.d7 12 'ii'b4 0-013 'iVxd6l::te8 gives Black more than enough play)

(18 ~f2 .i.xd5 19 iVd4 is also unclear) 18 ... .i.g4 19 ~d4 .i.xdl 20 ~xdl ~d7, and because of his bishop-pair and Black's lack of kings ide de- fenders, White can venture a kingside attack by

21 h5 h6 22 g4 b5 23 g5!, which is still unclear

after 23 ... ~f5 (not 23 ... b4? 24 .i.d3!) 24 gxh6. This line with 8 ... .i.xc3+ 9 bxc3 ttJa5 should attract attacking types. As mentioned, it has special importance, since it also applies to other lines from the English, as well as to the Sicilian Defence. Let's return to the better-travelled paths of 8 ... ttJe5: 9 iVd4 (D)

Having seen the important move 2 ... tbc6 and associated variations, we'll tum our attention to one of the grand old lines of the Symmetrical English, the Four Knights Variation with

development of his king's knight implies a fun- damental change of philosophy from 2 ... tbc6. This time the light squares d5 and e4 are his

234 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

focus, and a wide array of the variations follow- ing 2 ... ttJf6 involve the move ... d5, as early as move 3. The move ... e5, so often associated with 2 ... ttJc6, becomes a rare occurrence. 3 ttJc3 If you're following the multitudinous trans- positions in these chapters, it won't surprise you that 3 d4 cxd4 4 ttJxd4 can go various ways, including of course our main line with 4 ... ttJc6 5 ttJc3. I'll look at some independent alternatives in the Anti-Benoni section below. 3 ••• ttJc6 After 3 ... b6 4 e3!?, 4 ... ii.b7 5 d4 transposes to note 'b' on page 219, and 4 ... e6 is line 'b' of this note; both are pleasant for White. Now let's take a look at some move-orders after the much more important 3 ... e6 (D): w The lines that follow are of particular signifi- cance, because the choices made at this point can determine the underlying nature of the opening and middlegame. Both players need to know how to steer the game into the fundamen- tal variations that they wish to play: a) 4 g3 ttJc6 (Black has a certain control over his own destiny; for example, 4 ... b6 5 ii.g2 Jtb7 is a Hedgehog Variation of Chapter 10; and 4 ... d5 5 cxd5 exd5 6 d4 is a Queen's Gam- bit Declined, Tarrasch Variation; in this last line, 5 ... ttJxd5 6 d4 or 6 ii.g2 ttJc6 will usually transpose into the Keres-Parma Variation in Chapter 9) 5 ii.g2 (5 d4 cxd4 6 ttJxd4 is the main Four Knights line again) 5 ... d5 6 d4!? (once again, 6 cxd5 exd5 7 d4 is a Tarrasch De- fence, and 6 ... ttJxd5 a Keres-Parma Variation) 6 ... dxc4 7 'iVa4 cxd4!? (or 7 ... ~b6!?) 8 ttJxd4 ~xd4 9 ii.xc6+ ii.d7 (D). w Compare the Griinfeld Defence variation 1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 g6 3 ttJc3 d5 4 ttJf3 ii.g7 5 e3 c5 6 dxc5 ~a5 7 cxd5 ttJxd5 8 ~xd5 ii.xc3+ 9 ii.d2. In our analogous situation (see the above dia- gram), Black's position is fine after 10 ii.xd7+ ~xd7 11 ~xc4 ':c8. O'Kelly de Galway-Mas- carifias, Jakarta 1978 continued 12 ~b3, and now 12 ... ii.e7 was adequate, but a more inter- esting continuation might be 12 .. . ii.c5!? 13 O-O O-O with the idea 14 ii.g5 ttJg4!? (or 14 ... ~c6 15 ii.xf6 gxf6 16 .:tacl ~b6 with equality) 15 lIadl ~c6 16 h3 h6!, preserving a lively imbal- ance. b) 4 e3 can be dull, but has a few subtleties. Usually the game goes 4 ... d5 5 d4 or 4 ... ttJc6 5 d4 d5, when we've arrived at the Symmetrical Tarrasch Queen's Gambit. To avoid this, Black sometimes risks 4 ... b6 5 d4 cxd4 (5 ... ii.b7?! 6 d5 blocks off the bishop on b7 and grabs space) 6 exd4 d5?! (D) (following the exchange on d4, 6 ... ii.b7 is now viable; although White still en- joys more space after a move like 7 ii.d3, he cannot easily execute the d5 advance). w MAIN LINES WITH 2 tDf3 AND d4 235 This can also come about by 1 c4 cS 2 liJf3 liJf6 3liJc3 b6 4 e3 e6 S d4 cxd4 6 exd4 dS. In conventional theory, it is 'officially' a Caro- Kann Defence, Panov Attack due to the order 1 e4 c6 2 d4 dS 3 exdS cxdS 4 c4liJf6 S liJc3 e6 6 liJf3 b6?!. However, it probably arises most of- ten from our move-order, and still more from a Queen's Gambit Semi-Tarrasch. So it's worth knowing that Black's position is terrible! A strong solution is 7liJeS! i.e7 (7 ... liJbd7 8 "iVa4 i.b7 9 cxdS exdS 10 i.d3 a6 11 O-O with a clearly superior game; 7 ... a6 8 cxdS liJxdS 9 "iVa4+ i.d7 10 liJxd7 liJxd7 11 liJxdS exdS 12 i.xa6!, Kharitonov-Ballo, Stockholm 1998, and Black can't exploit the bishop's position; for example, l2. . :iVc7 13 'ikbS!

236 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Finally, we've arrived at the Four Knights Symmetrical Variation, the traditional main line arising from 2liJf3 with an early d4. A warning: the subject-matter of this chapter can be sophisticated in terms of theory and analysis at some points. When the material be- comes too dense, the less advanced reader may wish to follow the general ideas and enjoy the games rather than get tangled up in specifics. S•.• e6 (D) This is by far the most frequently chosen move. There are some irregular possibilities such as S .. :iVb6 which I won't give details about, but see the section above about 2 ... liJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4liJxd4 'iiVb6 for some possible transpo- sitions. Finally, I should mention that S. .. eS!? (which is very rarely played) could be a better option than thought, because 6liJdbS d6 7 .ligS transposes to S ... e6 6liJdbS d6 7 .lif4 eS 8.ligS below. Of course, White can look into other 7th moves, including 7 e4, which is a Kalashnikov Sicilian. In general, the Four Knights Variation embraces such disparate types of positions that the best way to describe it is by showing games. w Four Knights with 6 a3 Yakovenko - Moiseenko European Ch, Dresden 2007

1 c4 cS 2 liJf3liJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 liJxd4liJf6 S

liJc3 e6 6 a3 (D) This odd-looking move, which was essen- tially ignored for most of the rich history of this variation, has grown in importance. Much of this has to do with White's frustrations in the old main line after 6 g3 ~6 7 liJb3 .lib4, al- though it must be said that players are still will- ing to contest that position and it has its own unexplored paths, as we shall see below.

In modem chess, there has been an increased use of the 'little moves' a3 and ... a6 (as well as h3 and ... h6) in many contexts; a common theme is that they serve as 'useful' semi-waiting moves. The utility of 6 a3 is largely preventa- tive, in that 6 ... .lib4 is averted, but there are a few other ideas associated with it. For example, you will see that a standard pawn-structure for Black involves ... d6 and ... b6 (the 'hedgehog' formation), against which White will set up a large centre with c4 and e4. A standard theme in such positions, and in fact the primary way for White to make progress, is to advance on the queenside with b4, for which 6 a3 is useful. The good news from Black's point of view is that 6 a3 is a slow move that does nothing for White's development. Furthermore, it creates a hole on b3. In general, White's c-pawn, which tends to be an important target in the Four Knights, will be more easily attackable. That is certainly the case if White plays b4, leaving it with no pawn defenders. 6 ••• liJxd4 6 ... dS!? 7 cxdS exdS 8 .ligS (D) gives White a nice isolated queen's pawn formation in which his knight blockades the d-pawn and he reaches the favourable set-up with .ligS and e3. The only problem is that a3 is almost a waste of a move here, so Black can play unusually ag- gressively by 8 ... .licS (a routine demonstration of White superiority was 8 ... .lie7 9 e3 O-O 10 MAIN LINES WITH 2 C{jf3 AND d4 237 ~bS! ttJeS 11 O-O a6 12 ~e2 ~e6 13 ~3 bS 14 l:;ladl with great piece coordination, Kra- senkow-Mamedyarov, European Ch, Antalya 2004) 9 e3 O-O. In Van Wely-Ivanchuk, Foros 2007, White continued 10 ~e2 ~xd4 11 exd4 h6 12 ~h4 'ii'd6 13 ~g3 'ii'e7 140-0 ttJe4 IS l:;lc1 (or IS .l:i.el ttJxg3 16 hxg3 followed by ~f3, which leaves White with some pressure on dS) IS ... ttJxc3 16 .l:i.xc3 ~f6, and here Van Wely suggests 17 ~f3 with some advantage due to his relatively active bishop-pair. 7 ~xd4 b6 (D) w What do we think of Black's exchange on move 6? On the positive side, Black gets rid of White's knight on d4, a centralized piece that has moved twice, while bringing White's queen onto a square on which it will probably be at- tacked. The move ... b6 can also serve to prepare ... ~cS as well as to discourage g3. But from White's point of view, the exchange has not been a bad thing. First, it brought the queen out for free, so that if it has to move again, that's no real loss of tempo, especially if White can choose the square it goes to. More generally, in a hedgehog position in which White has more space (for example, with c4 and e4), exchanges tend to favour him. Specifically, when Black swaps pieces the possibility of dynamic coun- terattacks based upon ... dS and ... bS breaks is reduced, because their success often depends upon attack by a maximum number of Black's forces. You will find that, contrary to the old saw about exchanges favouring the side with less space, they favour the side with more space quite as often. 8 iYf4! In view of the above, we shouldn't be too surprised by this move, which anticipates the attack by ... ~cS and prepares e4. 8 iVd3 is sometimes played with the same idea, but the queen has less influence from that spot. What about 8 e4? The move is hardly a blunder, yet it encourages Black to take the initiative, and White's queen will end up on a passive square.

1.Horvath-Kosten, Reims 2002 was a pretty and

thematic example: 8 ... ~cS 9 ~dl (this is aimed against ... ttJg4 and ... iYf6 or ... ~h4, attacking the f-pawn; unfortunately, it's an undeveloping move) 9 ... 'iVc7!?

238 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Black wants to control as many dark squares as possible, and ... ttJh5-f4 becomes a theme (af- ter preparation). White on the other hand has caught up in development and is well central- ized, with prospects of a timely b4 or simplify- ing by SLe3. Play continued 13 b4? (Kosten suggests 13 ttJb5!

White is not really expecting Black to miss 12 fixg7#, or to lose material after ll...g6 12 i.xf8. He wants to put his light-squared bishop on d3 in order to defend the e-pawn, aim at the kingside, and discourage ... d5. But if he plays 11 i.d3 first, Black can reply ll...ttJd7!, with the idea of jumping to e5, to harass White's bishop and c4-pawn, or transferring to c5 as ap- propriate. So White forces Black's knight to the inferior square e8 before he continues his de- velopment. 11".ttJe812 SLd2 (D)

b) With the conventional 6 a3 'iVb6 move- order, it seems to me that 7 tDdbS (D) may be stronger than in the main lines following 6 g3 'iVb6.

For some reason, this isn't played; perhaps it should be? A couple of ideas: bl) 7 ... tDeS 8 ..te3! is the reason that 6 a3 is so handy. Black can't like 8 ... 'fiaS 9 M, 8 ...

w This position can evolve into a hedgehog pawn-structure after ... d6; because of the slow a3, however, White has to take care to prevent ...dS. 8 tDf3! a) Korchnoi gives 8 tDxc6 dxc6 9 ..tf4 tDd7 with equality.

'iVc7. There followed 9 ..tgS b6 10 ..td3 (10 .i.h4 was suggested) 1O ... h6!? 11 .th4 tDhS!. Black eyes the f4-square, and exchanges the bishop that covers it. Since retreating gives up the bishop-pair for no reason, White chose 12 ..txe7 tDxe7 13 O-O with equal chances in a complex game. 9 ..te2 b6 10 O-O ..tb7 11 ..tf4 (D)

Black would like to maximize his pieces' in- fluence and then break with ... bS or ... dS. White, as usual, will look to central play and queenside expansion. Since only the latter looks available, MAIN LINES WITH 2 tDf3 AND d4 241 the plan will be to play b4, supporting the moves cS and/or a4-aS with rooks and pieces. 1l. .. l:!.e8 ... lZ'leS-d7 is a standard reorganization in the hedgehog formation (whether a Sicilian De- fence or English Opening) and is available here because of the tactical fact that White's e-pawn is loose.

White moves his knight a second time in or- der to target d6 and c7. He intends to follow that up with 7 iLf4, increasing the pressure on those squares. 6 lZ'ldbS isn't as popular among lead- ing grandmasters as other moves, but in part that's due to the relatively uncharted complexi- ties of 6 a3 and a couple of the newer lines stemming from 6 g3. 6 lZ'ldbS should attract positionally-minded players who are comfort- able with slowly-developing play, and/or those of a less theoretical bent. Black, of course, needs to know this line: first, to survive early threats, and then, to avoid being squeezed to death. Ki. Georgiev - Topalov Sarajevo 2000 6 ... dS (D) This is the most established move, but the al- ternatives in the next game are important and inviting, because they avoid the endgame that almost always arises after 6 ... d5.

242 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

w In view of the threat of 7 ... d4, White forces the pace. The first thing that an experienced player will see is that he can win a pawn with the familiar trick 7 cxdS liJxdS (7 ... exd5? 8 iLf4) 8 liJxdS exdS 9 'iVxdS, intending 9 ... 'iixdS 10 liJc7+ and liJxdS. However, as in many openings in which this trick is possible, the purported victim of the trick is actually sacrificing a pawn for activity and attack. After 9 ... iLb4+ 10 iLd2 Black gets full compensation in two ways: a) With 10 ... O-O, Black can whip up an at- tack in the queenless middlegame following 11 'iixd8 .ti.xd8 12 O-O-O!? iLe6! 13 a3? iLb3! 14 axb4, and now 14 ... a5! is a killing shot, tak- ing over the a-file, but Black also won with 14 ... liJxM 15liJc3 .ti.ac8 16 .ti.elliJc2 17l:!.dl liJb4 181:tel ':c5! 0-1 in Nyback-Lehikoinen, Stockholm 2003; in the final position .. .lIa5 and mate is threatened, and White will have to give up massive material to prevent it. b) 1O .. :~e7 11liJc3?!

It turns out that other counterattacking options simply don't suffice. Scxd5 w 8 iLg5 is slow, especially because of the trick 8 ... d4 9liJd5? liJxd5! 10 iLxd8iLb4+; then 11 ~d2 is forced, in view of llliJc3? dxc3 12 a3 c2+. S. •. exf4 9 dxc6 bxc610 'iixdS+ 'iii>xdS (D) w This queenless middlegame has been con- tested over many years. Sometimes it's called 'drawish', but this only means that at the very top levels, grandmasters on either side of the board find it hard to get as many winning chances as they'd like, in particular compared with the moves 6 a3 and 6 g3. That's not really saying much, and the average player will have plenty of chances to win with either colour. Right off we have the radical difference in pawn-structures, with Black's isolated c- and a-pawns, and his funny pawn on f4 that can be either weak or strong. Then there is the issue of whether White's quick development by O-O-O+ or .l::!.dl + is enough to disrupt his opponent's game. Black's play stems from the fact that if White's knight on b5 retreats, he gets to keep MAIN LINES WITH 2 tDf3 AND d4 243 the bishop-pair; or, if White puts the knight on d6, Black will gain time by exchanging it and playing on the open files by ... J:Ib8 and ... .l:!.e8. Under some circumstances, the move ... liJg4 will be relevant, especially if White castles queenside.

liJxd4 e6 6 liJdb5 d6 (D) In my opinion, this is an underestimated move. As far as I can tell from previous prac- tice, White has yet to find a reliable path to ad- vantage. 7 i.f4

244 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

w Attacking d6 is the only independent attempt to punish Black's move-order, since 7 .i.g5 a6 8 .i.xf6 gxf6 is a standard position in which Black stands no worse. However, 7 e4 is a Taimanov Sicilian Defence, a possibility which should be taken into account by both players. 7 ••• e5 8 .i.g5 (D)

This .i.f4-g5 manoeuvre is a standard tech- nique in several modem opening lines, most fa- mously the Sveshnikov Variation of the Sicilian Defence (if reached via the sequence 1 e4 c5 2 tiJf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tiJxd4 tiJf6 5 tiJc3 tiJc6 6 tiJdb5 d6 7 .i.f4 e5 8 i..g5). White controls the d5-square. However, many of today's openings exploit the fact that a single outpost, however strong, doesn't necessarily produce a superior game, even in the absence of a similar weak- ness on the other side. There are multiple rea- sons for this, the most common one being that the opponent can work around the centre to un- dermine the pawn-supports for that outpost (this is best shown by example). Furthermore, the exchange of a piece occupying an outpost sometimes forces a pawn recapture, filling the hole there. Thus the very threat of exchange can force one's opponent to retreat. The classic ex- amples of this situation arise in the Sicilian De- fence and English Opening (see the various Botvinnik-structure lines in this book), but you will also run into it in other e- and d-pawn openings. After 8 .i.g5, in face of the positional threat of 9 tiJd5 followed by 10 tiJbc3, Black should kick the knight. 8 ••• a69.i.xf6 As in the Sveshnikov, White can maintain the tension by 9 tiJa3 (D).

Black has a choice of ways to divert White from his positional goals; for example: a) S.Emst-Leenhouts, Dutch Team Ch 2007/8 continued 9 ... .i.e6 10 'iVd2 (or 10 e3) 1O ... .i.e7

MAIN LINES WITH 2 lDf3 AND d4 245 You can see how varied both sides' strategies and timing are, which suggests that there's sub- stance enough in this line to satisfy anyone. 9 •.. gxf6 10 ltJa3 f5 (D)

This advance is seen in the main lines of the Sveshnikov Sicilian, but in our game White has played c4 instead of e4, so there are very differ- ent methods of play. It's worth noting that, by having played c4, White has stopped the move ... bS, crucial in the Sveshnikov, and made the manoeuvre ltJc2-e3 easier. However, he's also given Black squares on b4 and d4 to play around with and most importantly, a target on c4. 11 g3 White increases his control over dS and se- cures a good square for his bishop. This is dou- ble-edged, since it removes a defender from c4 and takes two moves to implement. Some ex- amples will give a feel for the play: a) 11 e3 iLe6 12 ~d2 iLg7! 13 O-O-O "iVaS prevents 14 ~xd6?? due to 14 ... .l:.d8, and 14 ltJdsllVxd2+ IS1:!.xd2 O-O-O was equal in V.Zil- berstein-Lein, USSR Ch, Baku 1972. b) I1ltJc2 is a productive-looking strategy, intending ltJe3-dS with a dominant outpost; for example, ll...iLg7 12 ltJe3 O-O 13 ltJed5 iLe6 14 e3. However, as I pointed out above, this is by no means a guarantee of having the better game. Here Black got sufficient counterplay in A.N.Panchenko-Z.Almasi, Budapest 1991 by means of the characteristic ... bS break: 14 ... l:!.c8 IS iLe2 e4! 16 O-O !

(D)

A thematic advance. At what point Black should play ... e4, if at all, constitutes one of the most important decisions in this variation. For one thing, Black thereby gives up the f4- square to a knight or another piece, as well as making d4 available for occupation. He fur- ther weakens his pawn on fS, in that it can't ad- vance and will therefore become more of a target. Finally, Black potentially allows White the option of f3, which may favourably change the pawn-structure for White. On the positive side, Black's g7-bishop gains tremendously in scope, and can also come to eS to defend the d6-pawn. Black's knight gains access to that same new square eS from which to attack c4 and oversee the critical d3- and

246 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

f3-squares. Lastly, his e4-pawn disables White's g2-bishop.It's remarkable that the positive and negative features of the e-pawn advance are so delicately balanced; in fact, the overall evalua- tion of the position before and after 14 ... e4 tends to be the same! 15 ~fdl 'tWa5 16 lbd5 White goes for the ending. Again, this seems to be a value-neutral transformation: each side's positional advantages persist as though noth- ing has happened. An obvious alternative is 16 ~ac1, when 16 ... ~ac8 17 ~h3?! (17 'iie3) 17 ... lbd4 18 ~f1? f4! 19 ~xe6 fxe6 20 gxf4 'iih5 gave Black a winning position in Goren- shtein-Stoliarov, Dnepropetrovsk 1966. 16• •• ~fd8 17 J::tac1 'i!Vxd2 18 .u.xd2 (D)

Black simply develops and to some extent ig- nores his dark-square problems. When he plays ... i.cs, it's not clear whether the game will simplify or turn exciting; as you'll see, that's quickly decided over the next few moves.

A neglected move that David Cummings has tried to revive with some fascinating analysis. I'm not sure that it results in equality, yet it's a weapon for those willing to speculate. I won't examine more than a fraction of the theoretical detail associated with the traditional move 7 ... O-O (D).

This will often lead to positions with the queens off the board. At first, it may seem that the game becomes insufficiently difficult to offer substantial winning chances. However, players below grandmaster level will still be rewarded for outplaying their opponents. The larger issue is whether you have a taste for the slow nature of the line: a) 8 4.Jc7?? eS! 9 4.Jxa8 exf4 will not only win two pieces for a rook for Black (after the knight on a8 falls), but do so in a position where Black comes out with better development and the initiative. b) 8 i.c7 is the 'drawish' move: 8 ... ~e7 9 i.d6 i.xd6 10 'iVxd6 'iVd8! (D). White's position initially makes a strong im- pression due to his dark-square control. As it happens, Black will soon drive the queen away by ... 4.Je8, which will allow him to set up the well-known hedgehog formation with ... a6, ... d6 and ... b6: 11 e4 b612 i.e2 a6 13 4.Ja3 4.Je8 14 'iVd2 i.b7 ISl:!dl d6 160-0 'iVc7 17 f4.l:td8

(D) When I first saw this position recommended for Black, I was incredulous. It's precisely the one arising from 1 c4 c5 2 ttJf3 ttJf6 3 ttJc3 d5 4 cxd5 ttJxd5 (this is an Asymmetrical Variation from Chapter 9) 5 e4 ttJb4 6 ii.c4 ii.e6!? (an older move; the well-known one is 6 ... ttJd3+) 7 ii.xe6 ttJd3+ 8 'it>fl fxe6 9 ttJg5, with colours reversed, but White is a tempo ahead! We've seen that in many reversed positions in chess, the 'extra' move for one side is passive or overcommittal in the context of the larger vari- ation, but in this particular line (with 6 ttJdb5 .i.c5 7 ii.f4 e5 8 ii.e3), the extra move is ttJc3 (i.e., ... ttJc6 is missing in the Asymmetrical line). You could hardly have a more perfect move for a bonus: it eyes the forward outpost on d5, can come to the defence of the vulnera- ble point at f2, and prepares for O-O-O. Defying logic, however, Black's position has its own resiliency. By analogy with the reversed-colour situation, the move ... Wif6 is Black's key to counterplay, but here it does nothing useful after ttJce4. So he resorts to the moves .. :it'g5 and ... h5. Naturally, those moves reflect the new reality that Black is to some extent defending instead of attacking, and that the move ... h5 is associated with ... .l:i.h6 and ... .l:!.xd6, ridding Black of his most deadly enemy at the cost of the exchange. Very likely White can come out with some advan- tage here, but it's still surprising that such a line isn't refutable and has in fact scored well for Black. 11 ~d2 By way of illustration, one of Black's moves with a tempo less is 9 ... ~b6, but after the analo- gous 11 ~b3 in our position, the 'bonus' knight MAIN LINES WITH 2 CiJf3 AND d4 249 on c3 gets in the way of the white queen's protection of e3, so Black can capture the pawn by 11...tZJxe3, and if 12 c5, 12 ... 'iYM+ 13 g3 'iYhS handily protects f7. However, 11 cS is a good try. For example, l1...tZJxe3 (11...b6!?) 12 'iid2 'iiM+ (12 ... tZJd4 13 l:tcl 'iigS 14 g3) 13 g3 'iYd4 14 tZJcbS! 'iixd2+ IS ~xd2 tZJxfl+ 16 l:thxfl f6. Then White's pieces look dominant, but Black can play for a speedy ... b6, so perhaps it's not so bad for him. 1l ...

In many ways, this time-honoured move is more logical than 6 a3 or 6 tZJdbS, because

250 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

White gets on with his development and places the bishop in its customary place in the English Opening, along the long diagonal. Of course, the bishop takes two moves to get to g2, so the dynamic idea of ... d5 must be taken into ac- count. In reality, since that problem proves manageable, White's most serious difficulty is with his c-pawn, which becomes vulnerable to attack. 6 ••• .lic5 When examining any of the Four Knights lines, one of the first things to check is whether Black can successfully free his game by means of ... d5. An initially popular way of doing so was 6 ... .lib4 7 .lig2 O-O 8 O-O d5, when the best line is 9 cxd5 exd5 10 .lie3 hte8 (this is tradi- tionally queried, with 10 ... .lixc3 11 bxc3 given and agreed to yield White an edge; then moves like ~bl, 'ilVa4 and htfdl would be part of an ef- fective strategy) 11 .l:tc1 .i.g4!? (D). w We are following Portisch-Donner, Santa Monica 1966, the game that more or less laid this line to rest. It continued 12 'ilVb3!?, a clever pawn sacrifice which has variously been given one or two exclamation marks. The game con- tinued 12 ... .lixc3 13 lIxc3liJxd4 14 .lixd4 .lixe2 15 .l::!.fcl and White had a harmonious position with multiple threats for a mere pawn. After 15 ... liJe4 16 'fJ.c7? .lia6? 17 "iWf3! liJg5 18 'ilVf5 .lic4 191Ixb7, Black was positionally lost. But trust the computers to spoil another classic. Mine instantly finds 16 ... .lic4!, refuting the line, based upon 17 "iVxb7liJd6 18 'iVc6liJb5 or 17 .l:tlxc4liJd2! and wins. Instead of 16 .u.c7, 16 'fJ.e3 .lia6 17 f3 would have given White com- pensation for his pawn, but no more than that. But surely White had a favourable isolated queen's pawn position at move 12? I think so; after 12 h3! .lih5 (12 ... .lixc3 13 ~xc3liJxd414 hxg4! liJc6 15 .lig5 and White will safely win the d-pawn) 13 g4.lig6, 14 ~b3! (this version of Portisch's idea seems to work) 14 ... .lixc3 15 ~xc3 liJxd4 16 .lixd4 ~xe2 17 ~dl really is difficult for Black; for example, 17 ... liJe4 (not 17 ... .lie4? 18 .lin) 18 ~e3 ~xe3 19 .lixe3 and after winning the d-pawn White will retain his bishops and initiative. 7 liJb3 .lie7 (D) w Black embarks upon a strategy that applies to a variety of positions, including the Sicilian De- fence. He first drives the knight from the centre and then puts the bishop where he wants it any- way, on e7. The issue, obviously, is whether White's knight is better placed on d4 or b3. There's no easy answer. On d4 the knight is better centralized and looks into key points in Black's position such as c6 and e6. It works with the bishop on g2 to prevent ... d6, a key part of Black's intended set-up. On the other hand, you could also argue that because of Black's pawn-structure, the knight on d4 was restricted from all potential entry points (especially since ... a6 is generally played at the first moment when liJdb5 could become relevant). It might be compared with a knight on d4 in a Taimanov or Kan Variation of the Sicilian Defence. Thus a case can be made for the decentralized and su- perficially less influential knight on b3. One non-trivial consideration concerns Black's own freeing moves, namely, that ... d5 is now pre- vented and that ... e5 won't come with tempo. The knight on b3 may also come in handy MAIN LINES WITH 2 tiJj3 AND d4 251 supporting the move c5, although that is not a vital argument in its favour.

There are several alter- natives, but it might be that exploiting the pin to return to the centre by 10 lbd4 is worthwhile, with the idea 1O ... i.b7 11 lbdb5 d6 12 i.g5 a6 13 i.xf6, etc.

90-0 d6 Black sidesteps the positional error 9 ... a6?, when White plays 10 c5!. 10 i.f4lbh5!? With 'iid2 (or 'i1rVc2) and ':fdl in the air, Black goes after the bishop. Two other ideas are 1O ... lbg4!? with the idea ... lbge5, and 1O ... h6!?, thinking about ... e5 and ... i.e6 (without having to face i.g5). 11 e3! The voluntary acceptance of doubled f-pawns has popped up from time to time throughout this book. Of course, 11 i.e3 can't be bad. With the pressure off d6, Black might play 11 ... i.d7 with the idea 12lbb5 'iib8. 11 ... lbxf412 exf4 (D) An aesthetically appealing picture. White's two forward bishops' pawns contest the same squares as Black's centre pawns and, at least

temporarily, his bishop on g2 and rooks coming to the centre files will be superior to their coun- terparts. Black will have a hard time achieving freeing breaks, and ... d5 appears particularly hopeless. Nevertheless, he can (and does) pre- pare ... b5, if only to force White to make the weakening move a4. His other natural idea would be to occupy the c-file and target the c- pawn. What are White's plans? It will be difficult to put pressure on d6 with his dark-squared bishop gone, but an attack by f5 is the logical way to make progress. If Black responds by ... e5, he gives White an outpost on d5, but oth- erwise White will play fxe6 and either win the d5-square (if Black captures with his bishop) or create a weak pawn on e6 on an open central file if Black plays ... fxe6. That pawn on e6 is easily attacked by a rook on el, knight on d4 and bishop on h3. Naturally this strategy won't be implemented so easily, but the idea of allow- ing the bishop to be captured on f4 has become standard in similar positions. In lines of the Queen's Indian Defence which involve ... i.xf3 and exf3, for example, f4-f5 is played for the same reasons. 12• •• i.d7 13 ~d2 'iVb8 141::[fel g6 For the reasons given above, Black wants to stop f5. But this move is quite weakening. 15h4! With Black's queen off-centre on b8, White feels justified in attacking the king. 15••• a6 16 h5 b5 17 hxg6 hxg6 18 lbc5! dxc5 The first point is 18 ... i.e8? 19lbxe6!?

lbxd4 e6 6 g3 'ilVb6 (D) This has been the main line of the Four Knights Symmetrical Variation for at least 50 years. Black brings out the queen, which may very well be attacked later, in order to force White's knight back. 6 ... "iWb6 really has no log- ical superiority over other moves, but there is a concrete one, namely, that the move ... lbe5, w played with tempo against the c-pawn, will now clear a square on c6 for the queen, from where it hits hI and c4. That seldom happens, of course; nevertheless, White will have to make compromises in order to prevent it. At this point, White plays either 7lbb3 or 7lbdb5 in a vast majority of games. Let's discuss the ideas as we travel through them. Filippov - Khalifman Linares 1997

In the last game, we discussed the pros and cons of having the knight on b3. The ideas in this position are much the same, but you could argue that its support for the move c5 gains in importance with the black queen's presence on b6. At any rate, the game is soon ruled by spe- cifics. 7 •.• lbe5 MAIN LINES WITH 2 tDj3 AND d4 253 Over the years, this has always been the main move, because it forces a favourable change of structure. To understand why practice has grav- itated in this direction, a cursory examination of the two very natural alternatives won't hurt: a) 7 ... dS is no longer popular, but has been used in the World Championship and other ma- jor contests. The resulting play illustrates a simplified isolated queen's pawn position: 8 cxdS lLlxdS 9 lLlxdS exdS 10 .i.g2 (D) (10 ~xdS?! .i.e6 is way too risky for White).

a1) Karpov-Korchnoi, Brussels 1988 shows what happens when the side with the isolated pawn can't disturb the equilibrium: 1O ... .i.e6 11 0-01!d8 12 .i.gS! f6 13 .i.d2 .i.e7 14 .i.c3! O-O lslLld4lLlxd4 16 ~xd4 .i.cs 17 "iVd2 WHd6

254 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

w For some reason 14 O-O has been neglected here. Perhaps White has been afraid of 14 ... lbg4, but IS .i.c1 preserves the bishop, which might even come out to a3 after Black's knight is driven away. I think that this deserves close consideration and may be White's best route to advantage. Instead, practice has seen: a) 14 cS dxcS IS i.xcS can be countered by IS ... i.g4, when Smejkal-Gdanski, Polanica Zdroj 1991 continued 16 ~e3 b617 i.a3 O-O-O with full equality.

Returning to the main move 13 ... O-O (D), White must now make a fundamental decision: whether to open up the game or keep it closed. 14c5 In the next game we see 14 O-O.

Now this bishop is restricted by its own cen- tre pawns. 22 •• :iVd7 You can already envision a formation with Black's bishop on e4, his queen on h3 or f5, and ... h5-h4, with the rooks to follow. 230-0 .l:tac8 (D) 24l:tf2 i-e4 251i'e2 .l:tc6! 261'kb5 Ribli makes the excellent suggestion that White flee back to the centre by ~fl-e1-d2, al- though it wouldn't be perfectly secure there.

Castling is more flexible than 14 cS. In re- cent years, White hasn't entered into this posi- tion much, in spite of decades of practice at the highest levels. That may be a function of the relative difficulty of attack and defence. Theory cites games suggesting that Black stands better; objectively, however, I think that White has im- provements and a definitive assessment is prac- tically impossible to arrive at. 14• •• b6 This variation can be productively compared to the Samisch Variation of the Nimzo-Indian Defence (1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 e6 3 ttJc3 .Bb4 4 a3 .Bxc3+ S bxc3, in Volume 2), and other branches of that opening. As in the Nimzo-Indian, White has two bishops and kingside prospects (g4- gS), but his doubled c-pawns are targets and Black is able to train several pieces on the c-file and eventually wins at least one pawn ( ... .Ba6, ... ttJaS, .. :ikc7 and .. Jbc8). White will try to mix things up in both the centre and kingside. As so often when one side has two bishops and weaknesses, he is willing to jettison a pawn in exchange for extra time to pursue his attack . The blocking move 14 ... eS seems premature after IS fS, although that's not entirely clear. Moutousis-Wojtkiewicz, Athens 1992 was a di- saster for Black following IS ... b6 16 g4 .Ba6 17 gS ttJe8? (Anand gives 17 ... ttJd7) 18:f3 ttJaS?

(it seems contradictory to straighten out White's pawns, even should Black manage to win the pawn on c4) 16 cxd4 .Ba6 (D). w Now Black threatens not only the c-pawn, but ... dS. We saw in the Samisch Variation of the Nimzo-Indian how Black could straighten out White's c-pawns by ... cxd4, and after cxd4, play ... dS. Carlsen-Volokitin, Biel 2006 continued 17 :tac1?!

15 •.. .Bb7 This is the accepted solution, resisting ... .Ba6 for a few moves so as to keep an attack on White's centre, which in tum helps Black de- fend against the kingside attack. lS ... .Ba6 has a mediocre reputation. Black may be able to hold his own in that line as well, but he has to be very careful; for example, 16 gS tDd7 17 1:1f3 l:!.fe8 18 l:!.h3 tDf8, and here Lobron-Hulak, Erevan Olympiad 1996 saw 19 fS! tDeS 20 ~hS 'lWxc4. At this point, instead of 21 .Bd4? ~e2! 22 'ifh4 "iVg4!, when White's attack dissipated, the stan- dard attack by 21 f6! is promising, because 2l...~e2 22 fxg7 ~xg7 23 ~h6+ ~g8 24 .Bd4 or even 24 g6!? gives White positive chances, the latter line proceeding 24 ... fxg6 2S .ifl ~g4+ 26 l:tg3 .ixfl! 27 kIxg4 tDxg4 28 ~f4 tDxe3 29 ~xe3 .Ba6 30 ~d4.

White is playing for a brute-force attack by .l:r.h3, ~hS and fS. The question is whether that abandons the rest of the board too quickly. 17 ... .l:r.fe8! Black's idea is to bring a knight to f8 in order to defend h7. The rook goes to e8 so that after

White's fS, Black will answer ... exfS and have another piece in play. Two other moves are supposed to be good for Black, but that's not at all clear: a) 17 ... tDe7 has been praised on the basis of Lobron-Kramnik, Dortmund 1995: 18 .ti.h3 l:tfc8 19 'lWhS tDf8 20 tDd2 dS. But here White had 21 fS!, which is quite dangerous in compar- ison with White's attack in the main line. b) Illescas-Leko, Leon 1996 went 17 ... .l:r.ac8 18l:!.h3 .ti.fe8! 19 ~hS?! tDf8 20 lUI!? .Ba6!, and Black got the better of it. However, 19 l:td1 ! is an improvement, when things are by no means clear. White should hang around in the centre for a while in these positions, taking advantage of the weakness on d6 and holding c4 for a while. There is time for fS later. 18 .l:i.h3 tDf8 (D)

19 Itfl?!

For the last time, White should act in the cen- tre until Black shifts either his bishop to a6 or knight to as, which both make fS more effective;

White embarks upon a completely different plan: to keep his pawn-structure intact and cas- tle queenside, with the idea of simplifying and putting pressure on Black's d-pawn. The dan- ger is that his king will become exposed on the queenside.

Black sacrifices a piece and the play enters into a forced phase. The alternative 14 ... .Bxc3 IS i.xc3 dxeS 16 .ixeS may be playable, but has generally given White the advantage in practice.

MAIN LINES WITH 2 tiJj3 AND d4 259 20 ~d8+ .ne8 21 'ifd3 would draw, but White decides to go for more. 20 ••• .nd7 21 ttJa3! .i:i.xdl+ 22 Itxdl (D) Here is White's point: he will have a piece and rook for a queen and pawn, but Black's queen will be stuck for an indefinite time on a2. On the other hand, White needs a long time to organize an attack on it. This position has been reached several times. Rather than pile up more theory, let's have fun watching the game. 22 ••. h5!? 23 .lif3 .nxd3+ 24 ~xd3ltJd7 Black wants to rescue the queen by ... ltJb6- a4. 25 e5! ~f8 26 ~e4!

Then 30 exf5 exf5 31 'ita4 .lie6 32 .lixe5 keeps the queen safe, but still gives Black a lot to worry about in the form of the passed queenside pawns.

For some reason, it took a long time for this dynamic move to catch on; presumably there was a fear that the knight had no plausible re- treat-square, or simply that the tactics were un- favourable. At any rate, White has a few simple ideas: .lif4, ltJd6+, or some combination of .lie3 and ltJa4 to drive the queen back. Black can take comfort in the fact that 7 ltJdb5 takes a tempo from White's development, and that un- like 7ltJb3, it lets a bishop settle in on c5, when White's f2-pawn is more of a target. 7 ..• ltJe5!? This has always been the most important re- ply, covering d6 and creating the immediate threat of ... ltJxc4. In addition, the c6-square is cleared, potentially for the queen. On the other hand, ... ltJe5 moves a piece for the second time while exposing it to the very dangerous move .lif4.

It's dif- ficult to justify 7 ... ~cS without accepting the sacrifice; for example, 8 ... dS 9 O-O dxc4 10 ctJd6+ ~xd6 11 "i!Vxd6, as in Rustemov-Karia- kin, Dos Hermanas 2003, gives White control of the dark squares; and 8 ... ctJeS is well met by 9 ~f4. However, 8 ... ~xf2+ is extremely risky: 9 'it>f1 ctJg4 (otherwise 10 ctJa4 wins some- thing) 10 ~d6! (D).

The dark squares are Black's Achilles' Heel in the Symmetrical Four Knights. He has to re- spond to the threat of ctJc7+: 1O ...

Here are some other moves that illustrate White's compensation for the pawn: a) 1l...h6 12 .i.xf6 gxf6 13 O-O Itb8 (Gel- fand-Van Wely, Bled Olympiad 2002) is slow because of Pritchett's suggestion 14 tbe4!. b) ll...'iVcS!? attacks gS and, indirectly, c3: 12 .i.xf6 gxf6 13 O-O!?

Here Kosten suggests the three-pawn sacri- fice 14 fxe3 'iVxe3+ IS 'it>h1 ~xc3 16l;Ic1, but it's probably not enough if Black rejects the last pawn and plays 16 ... 'iVeS!.

[diagram]
This is a radical and aggressive approach that is normally associated with a pawn sacri- fice. A pair of other moves can go in the Anti- Benoni category: a) The infrequently-played 4 ... a6!? (D) has the idea of either S ... eS, now that ttJbS isn't pos- sible, or S ... dS. w It is not easy for White to get an edge, but a good try is S ttJc3 dS (S ... eS 6 ttJc2 ttJc6 7 g3 i.cs 8 i.g2 O-O 9 O-O gives White the upper hand because control of dS hasn't cost him any- thing in the way of positional concessions) 6 ttJf3! dxc4 (6 ... e6 7 cxdS exdS 8 i.gS i.e6 9 e4!? dxe4 10 'tlVxd8+ ~xd8 11 ttJd4100ks good for White) 7 'ikxd8+ ~xd8 8 e4! e69 ttJeS ~e8 10 ttJxc4 with the advantage (and incidentally exploiting the hole on b6 created by 4 ... a6), Olafsson-Miles, Teesside 1975. b) 4 ... e6 S ttJc3 (D) is highly transposi- tional, with some unique possibilities.

I'm not going to investigate these in depth, but here are some guideposts: bl) S. .. i.b4 6 g3 is a Nimzo-Indian Defence. For reasons of space, I'll have to refer you to the theory and practice of that line. At present, Black seems to be holding his own. White has other moves such as 6 e3, 6 ttJc2 and 6 i.d2 which are passive or unimportant. Somewhat more challenging is 6 ttJbS, although there is more than one good reply. One is 6 ... dS!, which forces White to react; for example, 7 i.f4 (7 cxdS exdS 8 i.f4 O-O has the idea 9 ttJc7? ttJhS) 7 ... O-O 8 e3 ttJc6 (or 8 ... a6 9 a3 i.aS 10 ttJd6 i.c7!?) 9 a3 i.aS 10 b4 a6 11 cxdS exdS 12 bxaS axbS 13 i.xbS ~xaS with equality, Olafs- son-Gipslis, Reykjavik 19S7. b2) Black can also play S. .. a6, after which 6 e4 is a Sicilian Defence, Kan Variation, and 6 g3 can lead to unique positions; for example, after 6 ... 'tlVc7, White often gambits his c-pawn by 7 i.gS 'iixc4 8 .l::tc 1. I'll leave that for you to study. b3) That leaves S ... dS 6 cxdS, when Black should shun 6 ... exdS, because 7 i.gS is a good version for White of the Queen's Gambit De- clined. However, 6 ... ttJxdS may be satisfactory, when Hansen thinks Black stands all right after 7 ttJdbS a6 or 7 i.d2 i.e7 (or here 7 ... i.cS). c) Black can aim for an Accelerated Fian- chetto Maroczy Bind by 4 ... g6, to which White MAIN LINES WITH 2 ti:Jj3 AND d4 265 can acquiesce by 5 ttJc3 .Bg7 6 e4 ttJc6. But you should note that 7 ttJc2 denies Black the popular lines which involve ... ttJxd4, so he may B lack motivation to play this move-order. Other- wise, 5 g3 (or 5 ttJc3 ttJc6 6 g3) 5 ... .Bg7 6.Bg2 ttJc6 7 ttJc3 transposes to the Pure Symmetrical line of Chapter 7, which goes 1 c4 c5 2 ttJc3 ttJc6 3 g3 g64 .Bg2 .Bg7 5 ttJf3 ttJf6 6 d4 cxd4 7 ttJxd4. 5 ttJb5 (D)

White plays the most consistent and ambi- tious move, trying to exploit Black's weakness on d6. Against other moves Black can develop rapidly and easily. Nevertheless, White must now deal with a fairly effective pawn sacrifice: 5 •.. d5!? Actually, the very rare 5 ... d6 could use some tests, with the idea 6 .Bg5 .Be6. 6 cxd5 .Bc5 Not 6 ... ttJxd5?? 7 ~xd5 'iUxd5 S ttJc7+. 7 ttJ5c3 7 d6?! is too ambitious: 7 ... O-O! S ttJc7 ttJe4!

8. .. e4 (D)

What does Black have for a pawn? In the first place, his pawn on e4 is a wedge that cramps White's pieces. Because of the territory that it stakes out, White will always have to accept some risks if he castles. That is, Black has a va- riety of ways to attack a castled king in these kinds of positions; for example, ... l;I.eS, ... ~e5 intending ... .Bd6 or ... ~g5, ... .Bf5 followed by ... ttJbd7-e5, attacks with ... h5, and so forth . Which is not to say that the counterattacking moves a3, M, .Bb2 and ttJd2-c4 won't elimi- nate that attack before it gets going, merely that many players of White have been blown away without making obvious mistakes. Thus we'll usually see White making at least some of his

266 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

queenside moves before castling. Another fac- tor here is that White's d-pawn is vulnerable to various attacks, including ... ttJbd7-b6 and/or ... "fife7 with ... l:td8. White's first goal is to hang on to his d5- pawn, of course, which he can sometimes do by a combination of attack on the e4-pawn and the sort of quick development on the queenside that we just referred to. Sometimes he can trade the pawn for positional gains. In our main game, he takes a different approach. 9 iLe2 (D) 9 ttJd2 has been the choice in the majority of games. Without going over the extensive theory, it seems as though Black is holding his own. Mikhalchishin-Kasparov, USSR Ch, Moscow 1981 was an early game that brought 4 ... e5 to general attention: 9 ... "fife7 10 iLe2 l:!.d8 11 a3 ttJxd5 (today, 11...a5 12 "fifc2 iLf5 13 O-O ttJbd7 is a more conventional approach, with compen- sation for the pawn) 12 ttJxd5!? .l:!.xd5 13 "fifc2 iLf5 14 b4 iLb6 15 iLb2 ttJc6 16 O-O ~g5! 17 'it>h 1 (Kasparov assesses 17 ttJc4 iLg4 18 iLxg4 ~xg4 as equal), and although 17 ... .l:td6?! 18 ttJxe4! iLxe4 19 'iVxe4l:td2 could have been an- swered by 20 iLa6! with the better game, Black can improve by Kasparov's 17 ... .l:tc8!, which should equalize. He gives 18 l:!.ac1 :dd8, but we know that this is pre-computer era analysis, since 18 ... ttJxb4! 19 'iVxc8+ iLxc8 20 ':xc8+ iLd8 gives Black a much superior game.

11 g4 can be defended on multiple grounds:

a) it threatens to play an early g5, driving Black's knight away from the e-pawn, which can be attacked by ttJd2 and'iVc2; b) White directly prevents the standard move ... iLf5; c) White's king wasn't likely to castle any- way, for the reasons given in the note to 8 ... e4. 11 ... h6 (D) This doesn't work out well, but 11...l:td8 12 g5 ttJe8 13 ttJd2 iLf5 14 ttJb3 or 14 i.g4 gives White some advantage. 12 ttJd2!?

Black aims for a hedgehog pawn-structure, as described in Chapter 10, but stops White from playing g3 and makes e4 more difficult for White to accomplish. 5 lDc3 .ltb7 6 f3 White wants to enforce e4 and establish a Maroczy Bind structure. Since the moves g3 and e4 aren't immediately playable, the most interesting alternative is 6 .ltg5, which is now infrequently seen in master practice. For one thing, .ltxf6 isn't much to be feared so that, for example, 6 ... d6 7 .ltxf6 gxf6 gives Black the two bishops and open g-file. Even 6 ... e6 7lDdb5 d6100ks all right, because 8 'iVa4 .ltc6 9 'iVc2 a6 10 lDd4 i..b7 results in an acceptable type of hedgehog position. 6 ••• e6 Notice how White wins the centre following 6 ... d5 7 cxd5 lDxd5 8 lDxd5 "iUxd5 9 e4. Then the possibilities of .ltb5+ and 'iVa4+ create dif- ficulties for Black.

Some very important points about move- order come up on this and the next two moves. 9 ... lDbd7?! is apparently a positional mistake, because White can play 10 O-O (or 10 a4!) 1O ... .lte711 a4! (D).

Now there isn't all that much to do about the move a5, since 11...a5 would permit ttJb5 and expose d6; furthermore, any counterplay by ... b5 would be permanently forfeited.

~hl i.xh2 (19 ... l:tfe8 20 liJc4!) 20 liJc6! i.xc6 10•.• O-O (D) 21 dxc6 would have been very strong. In view of this and the following note, the rarely-played 9 ... 'iJlc7 may deserve further con- sideration, although it commits the queen rather w early and exposes it to l:tc1/liJd5 tricks. 100-0 Has Black's move-order with 9 ... i.e7 com- pletely solved his problems? Because of the de- lay in ... liJbd7, White can play 10 'iJla4+ (D).

Now 1O ... 'lilVd7 looks innocent enough but White doesn't need to play 11 'iJlxd7+, which has been automatic. In fact, I don't see a truly ad- equate answer to llliJb3! i.d8 (forced, to save the b-pawn) 12 .l:i.dlliJc6 13 'iJla3! i.c7 14 cS!. And if Black plays 1O ... liJbd7, White at least temporarily wins the bishop-pair by 11 liJc6 i.xc6 12 ~xc6, when Black's best move is 12 ... O-O!, in order to cut off the white queen's es- cape-squares with ... liJcS. Still, White can annoy Black with 13 !tdlliJcS (what else?) 14 i.xcs bxcS IS eS ~e8! 16 'lilVxe8 liJxe8 17 f4!, and while Black is far from lost, the pawn-structure is not friendly to his dark-squared bishop. Perhaps with that in mind, Black has an- swered 10 ~a4+ by 1O ... liJfd7!? 11 0-00-0 in a couple of games. Then, because of Black's ret- rograde development, White has the unusual possibility of gaining space by 12 f4!?; for ex- ample, 12 ... 'iJlc7 13 fS liJcs 14 'ilVc2 liJc6 IS liJxc6 'iJlxc6 (1S ... i.xc6? 16 b4 liJd7 17 fxe6 fxe6 18 i.g4) 16 i.f3 with some advantage. You can understand that Black might prefer not to be forced into the lines just examined. He may want to look into earlier move-orders (9 ... 'lilVc7! ?), hoping to circumvent this issue. 11 ~d2 a) Now if White plays 11 a4, ll...liJc6 stops 12 as; that is why Black waited on ... liJbd7. Nevertheless, since the e4-pawn isn't directly attacked in that case, White should consider 12 f4! with the idea 12 ... liJxd4?! (12 ... ~c7 13 ~c1 liJxd4 14 'iJlxd41eaves White with more space) 13 'iJlxd4liJd7 14 ~adl, intending eS. b) You could argue that the move 11 ~hl will be necessary in most lines of this variation anyway, so playing it now has a certain logic. Some subtleties arose in Agrest-Kohlweyer, Bajada de la Virgen 200S: ll...liJbd7?! (it looks as though 11...'iJlc7 is the right move-order, when 12 .l:i.c1liJbd7 13 'iJlel ~ac8 14 ~f2 ~fe8 IS b4 is a standard line whose verdict is still un- clear) 12 a4! .ne8 13 as! (D).

White gets nowhere if he doesn't challenge the enemy pawns, and a direct queenside as- sault is the only way to do so. 15 ..• J::!.feSI6 b4 (D)

Many games have arrived at this traditional main line. Black's next is a popular option, al- though he hasn't done badly with the older 16 ... .1f8. 16 ... .1dS!? Black wants to play ... .1c7 and aim at White's king. We saw this precise idea in the Taimanov Sicilian in Volume 1. 17 tbb3 tbe5!? This looks like an obvious move, but it does sacrifice a pawn. The immediate 17 ... .1c7 can be met by 18 .1f4 tbe5 19 .1g3, when White's bishop protects the kingside against ... d5. IS WIIxd6?! (D) Objectively, White is better off going for the vulnerable b-pawn by 18 tba4 d5! 19 exd5 exd5 20 c5, and a fairly random line is 20 ... tbc4 21 .1xc4 dxc4 22 .1f4 WIIa7 23 cxb6 .1xb6+ 24 tbbc5! with the better chances for White.

':'cd8 22 ~e2, when 22 ... .1xg3? 23 hxg3 WIIxg3+ fails to 24 .1g2, while 22 ... tbxe3 23 ~xe3 bxc5 24 tbxc5 .1b6 25 tb3a4 .1a7 26 <3dg2 leaves White with space and the key queenside squares.

I should emphasize that the lines in the notes to White's moves 10 and 11 could provide a disincentive to 4 ... b6 as a whole.

9 Asymmetrical Variations

In a number of Symmetrical English variations, Black tries to break the symmetry at an early stage by playing ... dS. After the usual pawn ex- change on dS and recapture with the knight, he wants to control as much central terrain as possi- ble, even to the possible detriment of his devel- opment. These variations are hard to describe with overarching general themes, because they go off on their own at such an early stage. Therefore I'll discuss them individually. Nimzowitsch's 5 e4 and Grunfeld Relatives

w This move-order might appeal to you as Black, because it opens up many ways to work your way into systems that you might not oth- erwise be able to reach. For example, S g3 l2Jc6 6 .1i.g2 gives you the choice of 6 ... l2Jc7 (a Rubinstein Variation, analysed in this chapter), or 6 ... e6 (a Keres-Parma Variation, also dis- cussed below), or 6 ... g6 7 O-O .1i.g7, which is one of the better forms for Black of the Pure Symmetrical lines with S l2Jf3 l2Jf6 from Chap- ter 7. 5 e4 With this move, first brought to general atten- tion by Nimzowitsch, White's advance cedes d4 to his opponent along the lines of modem Si- cilian Defences such as the Najdorf and Svesh- nikov. The important alternative S d4 (D) can lead in a variety of transpositional and independent directions:

a) S ... e6 6 e4 (6 g3l2Jc6 is the Keres-Parma Variation below) 6 ... l2Jxc3 7 bxc3 arrives at a Queen's Gambit, Serni-Tarrasch Variation. This is generally considered somewhat favourable for White due to his big centre, yet it is defi- nitely playable and Black might want to con- sider its use for practical play. b) S ... cxd4 6 'iVxd4 is well-known at the master level. Play usually continues 6 .. .lLlxc3 (6 ... e6 7 e4 and now 7 ... l2Jc6 8 .1i.bS l2Jxc3 9 'iUxc3 transposes to 6 ... l2Jxc3 7 'ilVxc3l2Jc6 8 e4 e6 9 .1i.bS, and thus emphasizes the importance of the move 9 .1i.bS in our main line; also possi- ble is 7 ... l2Jxc3 8 'ilVxc3 .1i.d7, to forestall.1i.bS; then Polugaevsky-Keres, Tallinn 1973 went 9 .1i.e2 l2Ja6!? 10 O-O nc8 11 'iVb3 l2Jcs 12 'ilVe3 .1i.e7 13l2JeS 0-014 b3 'ilVb6 lSl2Jc4 and White stood somewhat better) 7 'ilVxc3 (D). White's slight lead in development is a plus, but even more so his prevention of ... eS. What is arguably the main line goes 7 ... l2Jc6 8 e4 (the

ASYMMETRICAL VARIATIONS 271

most effective move, establishing a central pres- ence; others are relatively passive, but perhaps 8 i.g5!? is worth a look) 8 ... e6 (now Black threatens 9 ... i.b4) 9 i.b5 (9 a3 and 9 i.d2 are also played) 9 ... i.d7 10 O-O ~6 11 a4 ~c5 12 'iVd3 ~d6 13 ~e2!. In most games from this position, White has established some advan- tage. One basic idea is to capture more space by e5, setting up a standard position in which White can play i.f4 and l:tac1, of course, but also put pressure on a castled king via i.d3, 'ilVe4, h4 and the like. c) 5 ... tiJxc3 6 bxc3 g6 invites the Exchange Griinfeld main lines, which would arise after 7 e4. White can also play 7 i.g5 i.g7 8 ~d2. However, his most popular alternative to the Griinfeld Defence has been 7 e3. A famous ex- ample went 7 ... i.g7 8 i.d3 (8 i.b5+ is the most common alternative, while 8 i.c4 and 8 i.e2 are also played upon occasion; these are techni- cal lines that I won't go into) 8 ... 0-09 O-O ~c7 10 l:rbl b6 (as you might expect, there are plenty of alternatives on all of these moves, such as 1O ... l:rd8 and 1O ... tiJd7) 11 ~e2l:td8 12 i.e4 and now: cl) 12 ... i.a6 (this move has generally been praised in spite of leading to an inferior posi- tion) 13 c4 tiJc6 14 d5 f5 15 i.d3 e5! 16 e4! tiJd4 17 tiJxd4 cxd4 18 i.g5 l:rf8 19l:!.fc1 .l:tac8 20 i.d2 l:rf7 21 a4 and White launched a pro- ductive queenside attack in Karpov-Kasparov, World Ch match (game 23), Seville 1987. c2) Black might try to improve by 12 ... i.b7 13 i.xb7 'ilVxb7 14 dxc5, and now, instead of 14 ... .txc3 15 ~c2 i.g7 16 i.b2 with an edge for White, play 14 ... 'ilVc7!? 15 cxb6!? axb6, with the kind of Griinfeld pawn sacrifice that we have seen before. Then he has two open files facing isolated pawns, and excellent spots for his knight such as c5, a4 and c4. Similarly complex is 14 ... tiJd7 15 i.a3! ~c7 16 cxb6 tiJxb6. Let's return to 5 e4 and look at some practi- cal examples. The Knight Tour S. .. ltJb4 Lalic - Klasan Zagreb 2007

e4 tiJb4!? (D) The alternative 5 ... tiJxc3 is featured in the next section. w Black's ambitious knight move concedes to White a considerable lead in high-quality piece development, but in return he gets positional compensation. Specifically, Black's knights can land on the enemy weaknesses at d4 and d3, and can be readily supported by queen and rooks on the d-file. The 5 e4 tiJb4 variation is initially a battle of positional ideas in their starkest form, but in the end the contest will usually tum dynamic and depend upon details as each player tries to impose his will on the po- sition. 6i.c4 The most interesting move. White goes for classic development. At the same time, he agrees to give up the castling privilege in order to fight for every central square. For 6 i.b5+, see the next game.

White needs to counter that plan immediately. 9b4! White decides that Black's grip on d4 needs to be broken, even at the cost of a pawn. The same principle applies to 9 d4!?

This has taken over as Black's main move. The fianchetto has an unquestionable positional basis, in that 1O ... .i.g7 will reinforce the d4- square.

Then 11 .i.b2 e6 12 ttJxd4 ttJxd4 13 ~g4!?, preventing ... .i.xcs or here simply 13 ttJa4 with the idea h4-hS gives White some advantage. Of course, the capture on b4 is also critical. Over the years White has done very well in both theory and practice following 9 ... cxb4 10 ttJe2 (D) (10 ttJdS was the original idea; it remains unclear).

Rather than describe the nuances of move- order, I'll show a couple of the many examples that have accumulated: a) 1O ... ttJcS (this is the knight's seventh move out of the ten that Black has made, and soon it will have to move again! The idea is to attack e4, lure White's queen to the c-file and then attack it; maybe this is going too far, al- though it has been played by at least two grand- masters) 11 ~c2 e6 (1l...ttJc6 12 d4 ttJd7 13 .i.f4 takes charge of the centre) 12 d4 ttJcd7 (this is not a tremendous square for the knight; another move is 12 ... ttJca6, but White's pres- sure grows following 13 .i.b2 or 13 .i.gS .i.e7 14 h4) 13 .i.gS! .i.e7 (13 .. .f6 is met by 14 .i.xe6! fxgS?!

b) 1O .. .'~Jc7 11 d4 e6 12 h4! (D).

From the time that 9 b4 hit the scene, the h- pawn advance has been part-and-parcel of White's strategy. It wins space, prepares a rook- lift from hI, discourages ... g6 due tohS, and po- tentially attacks Black's kingside; for example, 12 ... ttJd7 13 hS (Kasparov demonstrated a fur- ther role for 12 h4: 13 .ligS! iL.e7 14:tel ttJb6 IS .lid3 f6 16 .lif4 ttJa6 17 hS with a powerful attack looming, Kasparov-R.Griinberg, Ham- burg (simul) 1985) 13 ... h6 14 .lif4 (or 14 .lib2 with command of the game) 14 ... ttJb6 IS .lid3 .lid7 16 ttJeS!? .lia4 17 ~d2 .lie7 1811h3 ttJbS 19 .l:.g3! ttJxd4 (l9 ...

A strange-looking option, untried as far as I know, would be 11 .lidS!? ttJc6 12l1bl. 1l• .• .i.xe6 12 d4 .lic4+ Many of the ideas are similar after 12 ... ttJc6 13 .lie3 (D).

A standard device. As mentioned above, this advance is associated with attack and the

8 .•. ~d7!? This less-frequently played move provides a smooth way to steer clear of the worst compli- cations, and may be one reason that White doesn't play 6 ~b5+ at the top levels any more. The main line for years has been 8 ... dxc3 9 ~xd8+ ~xd8 10 axb4 cxb2 11 ~xb2. White obviously has a lot of pieces in play, and the open a-, c- and d-files to attack along. However, Black has an extra pawn, and no weaknesses as yet. That said, Black needs to know what he's doing. The main line goes l1...e6 (l1...f6 12 e5! is irritating for Black; 11...~d7!? is like the game but slightly worse due to 12 ~xc6 ~xc6 13 tDe5 'it>e8 14 tDxc6 bxc6 15 'it>e2 and White properly keeps his king in the centre, although Black was fine anyway in Piket-Shirov, Wijk aan Zee 1999 following 15 ... f6 16 lla6 e5 17 ~c3 ~d7) 12 O-O ~d7 13 ~xc6 ~xc6 14 tDe5 '>te8 15 tDxc6 bxc6 (D). w The key to this position is that by the time White wins the a- or c-pawn, Black will have his pieces out; for example, 16 lla4 f6 17 llc1 (or 17 ~fa1 'i;f7 18 llxa7+ .llxa7 19 llxa7+ ~e7, Lautier-Kasparov, Tilburg 1997; a draw was im- mediately agreed after White carelessly played 20 1J.c7?, and the World Champion missed 20 ... c5!, which would have won a pawn be- cause of 21 bxc5? 1J.b8 or 21 b5 llb8) 17 ...

Someone who plays 5 ... lLlxc3 will probably be disappointed to see this move, since now he essentially has to enter a queenless middlegame that can be annoying to defend. Black probably chose this move-order with the intent of trans- posing to the main-line Grtinfeld Defence fol- lowing 6 bxc3 g6 (6 ... e6 7 d4 is a Semi-Tarrasch) 7 d4, which is at any rate a much more exciting variation. 6 •.. ~xdl+ Anything else lets White play ~f4 and i.c4 with a traditional lead in space and development. 7 <3;;xdl (D) White now has a modest advantage based upon the fact that his pieces will find better squares than his opponent's. His king has a nice

ASYMMETRICAL VARIATIONS 277

square on c2 (the same one used in many queenless middlegames), and Black has issues with his own c-pawn, in that protecting it (af- ter i.e3) requires some loosening of the posi- tion, and its presence restricts his dark-squared bishop. To be clear, if Black is well-prepared and ready to defend a somewhat worse posi- tion, he should achieve a draw; however, the lack of winning chances and passive posture will not appeal to most players below the very highest levels. Fortunately for us, the resulting positions are highly instructive. 7 ../iJc6 a) Griinfeld players (presumably the clear majority of those who play S. .. ltJxc3) may want to play 7 ... g6, a position which has occurred fairly often at the top levels, in part because it can also arise when Black plays an early ... g6 and then transposes to this position. The good side of ... g6 is that by not touching his e-pawn, Black doesn't create a weakness on d6, nor block off his queen's bishop. The bad news is that it takes two moves to get the bishop to g7, and in that position its scope is limited by White's pawn on c3. The most natural continu- ation is 8 i.e3 b6. White has two extra pieces out and Black's queenside is very slightly weak- ened. The famous game Anders son-Tempone, Buenos Aires 1979 went 9 a4 ltJc6 10 i.bS i.d7 11 ~c2 i.g7 12l:thdl a6 13 i.c4 i.g4 14 h3! i.xf3 IS gxf3 (White's bishop-pair will be very powerful in the open board, and his dou- bled pawns don't prevent him from expanding in the centre) IS ...

Then 8 'It>c2 is White's most flexible move; he doesn't fear ... i.xf3 because his bishops will have free rein thereafter; for example, 8 ... ltJd7 (8 ... ltJc6 9 .i.e3 e6 10 i.bS creates the usual problems for Black: his f8-bishop has no scope and d6 is weak) 9 i.f4 (Carsten Hansen's suggestion) 9 ... .i.xf3!? 10 gxf3 eS 11 i.e3. White has a nice position, especially with his control of dS. 8 'It>c2 The king takes up safe residence and pro- tects the weak point d3 against any future incur- sions. White can also play 8 .i.f4, for which you should compare what follows, or 8 i.e3. In the latter case, 8 ... e6 is solid, even if it creates that situation mentioned above with Black's bish- ops restricted by their own pawns. In Cvet- kovic-Palatnik, USSR-Yugoslavia, Krk 1976, White played modestly: 9 'It>c2 i.d7 10 i.e2 .i.e7 11 l:thdl O-O-O 12 J::!.d2!? (12 a4! intending as is a more typical plan) 12 ... f6 l3lIadlltJaS 14 eS!? At this point, Black hasn't any special worries if he plays 14 ... i.c6.

8. .. e6 9 i.f4!

Compare this with the previous note. White didn't have to provoke ... e6 by i.e3, and so he can put the bishop on its more active square straightaway. 9 ... f6 (D) 10 ltJd2! Now White intends to combine moves like a4, i.bS and ltJc4, while a background theme is ltJc4-d6+.

l:thd1 ~hd8 (D) w Depending upon your experience and tastes, you may consider this position fairly harmless or a real bother for Black. In either case it's good to get used to the basic ideas because such end- games are not uncommon (the central pawn- structure can arise from several openings). White's advantages of good-versus-bad bishop and the d5 outpost are fine, but neither de- scribes a winning plan. For his part, Black has little to do, since White covers all the d-file squares to which Black could infiltrate, or upon which Black could put a piece. This gives White some time to work with. 17 .l:txd8 .l:[xd818 g4!

This is in the genre of semi-waiting moves, primarily designed to be useful against most logical replies while improving conditions should the opponent do nothing committal. In this instance, one obvious point is that if Black plays ... lbxc3, then bxc3 opens the b-file.

tDc7 (D) Incidentally, 5 ... e6?! is considered an error because of 6 tDxd5 exd5 7 iVb3 and a pawn falls. This was confirmed in Gelfand-Kramnik, FIDE Candidates match (game 8), Sanghi Nagar 1994: 7 ... tDc6 (7 ... i.e6 8 ~xb7 tDd7 doesn't threaten anything) 8 ~xd5 ~xd5 9 i.xd5 tDb4 10 i.e4 f5 11 i.bl and Black had insufficient compensation. The approach with ... tDc7 is called the Rubin- stein System. Black's idea now is to play ... e5 and set up a sort of Maroczy Bind Sicilian in re- verse - more about which in a moment. The main positions of the Rubinstein very often arise after White has played tDf3 on an early move; for example, 2 tDf3 tDf6 3 tDc3 d5 4 cxd5 tDxd5 5 g3 tDc6 6 i.g2 tDc7. With any such move-order, Black needn't deal with various early options that White has in the next few moves below. However, you may note that this sequence allows 5 e4, as analysed above. Finally, I should say that Black can combine the move ... tDc7 with ... g6 and ... i.g7, which is much rarer and a bit suspect. I won't be cover- ing that. The Rubinstein Variation is a long-estab- lished and respected line. When you notice that in so many games Black will get the better position versus just slightly inaccurate or pas- sive play, you begin to understand why leading players have traditionally had so much respect for the Sicilian Maroczy Bind, which is the same opening with an extra tempo: 1 e4 c5 2 tDf3 tDc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tDxd4 g6 5 c4. Indeed, it's worth taking a look at this Sicilian line with 5 ... i.g7 6 tDc2 tDf6 7 tDc3, when we have a reversed version of the main line of the Rubinstein that comes from 5 ... tDc7 6 tDf3 tDc6 7 O-O e5; White's extra move in the Rubinstein is O-O. As we know, the study of re- versed positions often shows that things are not so simple, in that an extra move can impart information to the opponent. Nevertheless, the basic Maroczy structure should not be under- estimated. After 5 ... tDc7, White's main move is 6 tDf3. In the next game, we'll see the important 6 ~b3. Before turning to those, however, let's look at the slightly controversial forcing move 6 ~a4+ (D). This is important to know about, because it either forces Black into a passive position or wins a pawn: 6 ... i.d7 (6 ... tDd7 7 tDf3 followed by d4 is good for White; 6 ... iVd7 is playable but slightly depressing after simply 7 ~xd7+ tDxd7

.i.g2 ttJc7 6 ~b3!? By an attack on the b7-pawn, White compels Black's response. 6 ••• ttJc6 7 ii.xc6+ bxc6 (D) w The structure has stabilized and we have the familiar sight of doubled c-pawns on an open file, as in several English Opening lines and in the archetypal Nimzo-Indian Defence. In com- mon with those cases, Black has the bishop- pair and will soon gain space via ... eS to com- pensate for his weaknesses. He can also operate down an open d-file and manoeuvre a knight to d4. On the other hand, by contrast with the Nimzo-Indian, his doubled, isolated c-pawns already stand on an open file and are therefore easily attacked. The dynamics of this trade-off are remarkable, and I'll address the fundamen- tal positional factors again over the next few moves. As an aside, I should say that the sequence 1 c4 cS 2 ttJc3 ttJc6 3 ttJf3 g6 4 d4?! (White should prefer 4 e3!, as described in Chapter 8, which is why Black tends to forego 3 ... g6) 4 ... cxd4 S ttJxd4 ii.g7 6 ttJc2 ii.xc3+ 7 bxc3 'tliaS is exactly the same as our line with 6 ~b3 ttJc6 7 ii.xc6+ bxc6 8 'iVa4, because White has taken an extra tempo with 'iVb3-a4 in the latter case. S'iYa4 This is the more forcing move-order, assum- ing that you want to play 'iVa4 at all, because it bypasses some irregular but dangerous gambits which can occur if you tarry on b3.

His first move might be 14 i..d2, with the idea liJe3-c4 and l:tel, or perhaps 14 b3 intend- ing i..b2 and e3. Black has more space and pro- spective attacks on both wings. He can play for .. JS-f4 with a knight on d4, and include an at- tack by ... ~e8-hS; whether that's realistic is an- other matter. All this should be looked at more closely; it may well be a productive way for White to im- prove upon the main lines, or at least try some- thing different. Apart from 7 O-O and 7 d3, White has these moves worth noting: a) 7 a3, preparing b4, is a standard anti- Maroczy Bind strategy. As it turns out, this plan is fairly useless after 7 ... g6!, since 8 b4?! i..g7! 9 bxcS liJe6 10 i..b2 liJxcs (with the idea ... i..e6) is effective; for example, 11 liJa4 i..xb2 12 liJxb2 i..e6 13 0-00-0 14 l:tel WiaS and Black stands somewhat better because of his supe- rior pawn-structure, Andersson-Portisch, Biel Interzonal 1976. b) The generally accepted solution to 7 Wia4 (threatening liJeS) is 7 ... i..d7 8 Wie4 g6! 9 liJeS i..g7 10 liJxd7 'ir'xd7 11 0-00-0 (D). Black is ready to play ... liJe6-d4. So White's main plan is to expand on the queenside by 12 a3 intending b4; for example, 12 ... l:tac8 13 l:tb1 (Black's main point is shown by 13 b4?! cxb414 axb4 liJbS!) 13 ... liJe6 14 b4 b6!? (or 14 ... cxb4 IS axb4 ~fd8! 16 bS liJaS) IS bS liJcd4 16 e3 liJfS 17 Wia4, Pigusov-Estremera Panos, Las Palmas 1996, and here 17 ... c4! captures the d3-square. Then best play is probably 18 i.c6! 'iVd3 19 1:!b4! liJgS! (with the idea 20 :!.xc4? liJf3+) 20 i.g2 i.xc3 21 dxc3 liJe4 22 i..xe4 ~xe4 23 Wixa7, when, if he feels he must, Black can take the draw with 23 ... liJh4 24 gxh4 ~g4+. 7 ... e5 (D) w 8d3 White has various alternatives which the reader may wish to investigate; for example: a) One significant variation, which also can be introduced on moves 6 and 7, begins with 8 b3. After i..b2, White wants to play ltel and ei- ther liJe4 or liJa4, attacking both cS and eS; he may also play liJe1-d3. a1) A respected solution is 8 ... i.g4 9 i..b2 ~d7; for example, 10 ltel f6 (or 1O ... liJe6) 11 liJe4 liJa6. Black's knight goes to a6 fairly often in the Rubinstein, usually in order to protect the

292 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

cS-pawn. He might choose that square for it, in- stead of e6, so as to deter the move b4, or sim- ply because a knight on a6 stays out of the way of other pieces. This is a complex position with mutual chances. One possibility is 12 tbel (heading for d3) 12 ... Ji.e7 13 f3 (not 13 tbd3? ~xd3) 13 ... Ji.hS 14 tbd3 Ii.d8, and the game is roughly level. White should probably pass on IS tbexcS?! tbxcs 16 tbxcs 'iYxd2 17 ~xd2 .l:i.xd2 18 tbxb7 .l:txb2 19 .l:i.xc6 O-O!. a2) Black can also play more convention- ally by means of 8 ... Ji.e7 9 Ji.b2 O-O 10 ZIc1 f6 with an interesting game. After 11 tba4 b6, 12 tbxeS? fails because the a8-rook is defended; this idea crops up in several openings. b) 8 tbel (D) has the idea of .i.xc6+, 'iVa4 and tbd3, when the enemy centre becomes vul- nerable.

Theory has never quite settled down in this popular line. Black has many solutions, none terribly clear: bl) 8 ...

Until you've studied this variation for some time (preferably in conjunction with the re- versed set-up in the Maroczy Bind Sicilian), you may wonder how White can possibly ne- glect his development in a position where he has already given up space and the centre. In fact, he will even move the knight a third time next move (to c4)! The first part of White's jus- tification is the easiest: he threatens 10 Ji.xc6+, after which his knight will be perfectly placed

ASYMMETRICAL VARIATIONS 293

on c4, and Black's pawns will be too weak. Thus Black must defend with a passive move. 9 .•. i.d7 10 ttJc4 Now White gains another tempo with the threat of 11 i.xc6 and 12 ttJxe5. 10 ... f6 Black protects the e-pawn, albeit at the seem- ingly modest cost of loosening the light squares along the a2-g8 diagonal. With 1O ... f6, Black has agreed to contest the most popular line of the Rubinstein Variation, from which the top grandmasters have begun countless battles. I'm going to provide very selective analysis about the ingenious pawn sacrifice 1O ... O-O!? 11 i.xc6 i.xc6 12 ttJxe5 i.e8 (D), although it may deserve more. White has won a centre pawn and has no weaknesses! What is Black up to? It turns out that this position has its own idiosyncratic char- acter. He has two bishops, to be sure, but these are only truly effective in combination with the position of White's knight, which has no good retreat-square when attacked; for example, on c4 it can be pushed back by ... b5, and on f3, the al- ready dangerous move ... i.c6 gains in strength. When you add to that the fact that White has weak light squares around his king (with no light-squared bishop) and that his e-pawn can't move without creating a weakness on d3, you can see how Black dares to sacrifice the pawn. From White's point of view, he can take comfort in the fact that he has captured one of the most important pawns on the board. More- over, his remaining bishop is his 'good' one (unobstructed by his centre pawns), and for a move or two, Black's pieces will be passively placed. In the chess of the past few years, Black has been foregoing 10 ... O-O in favour of 1O ... f6; that may be a sort of conservatism, or it may re- flect some difficulties with 10 ... O-O. Here are two lines that might be considered problematic for Black: a) 13 e4 has been underrated, in my opinion. White develops his bishop at the cost of ceding the d4-square: 13 ... i.f6 14 ttJg4 i.d4 15 ttJe3 i.c6 16 ttJf5 ttJe6 (D). w 17 ii.e3!? (17 ttJxd4 ttJxd4 18 i.e3 looks smarter; Schussler-Donaldson, Malmo 1985 went 18 .. .f5 19 ii.xd4 ~xd4 20 ~b3+ 'it'h8 21 ttJe2 ~d7 22 f3 ii.b5 23 ttJf4 with a clear ad- vantage for White) 17 ... g6 18 ttJh6+!? (or 18 ttJh4) 18 ... 'it'h8?! (18 ... 'it'g7 appears better) 19 ~b3! ii.xe3 20 fxe3 'i!Vxd3 21 ttJg4 with the idea of J:1adl, Granda-de la Villa, Leon 1997. White has the upper hand in all lines; the game went 2l...'i!Vd8 22 ttJd5'i!VaS (versus ~c3+) 23 ttJe5! with a definite advantage. b) 13 'i!Vb3 is more abstract than 13 e4, in that the move is an annoyance as much as it is a plan. White peeks at b7, pins the f7-pawn and discourages ... ttJe6 in some lines because he can reply with either ttJd5 or ~d5. He is ready to develop his queen's bishop, and waits to see how his opponent will proceed. In Piket-Kaspa- rov, Internet 2000, Black attacked by 13 ... ii.f6 14 ttJg4 i.d4 (various analysts give 14 ... i.c6 15 ttJxf6+ 'i!Vxf6 16 i.e3 ttJe6 17 ttJe4 ~f5 18 f3 when White, still a pawn up, obviously has the better of it) 15 e3 (Franco says that 15 ~xb7 lIb8 16 ~xa7 is worthy of attention - then Black has serious attacking chances based upon the moves ... c4, ... i.c6 and .. .f5-f4, which is

I would hate to have to assess this posi- tion after, say, 16 ... ttJe6; at any rate, I doubt that White stands worse) 15 ... i.xc3 16 ~xc3 b6 17 f3!? i.b5 (D). w 18 ttJf2?!

Here White is still a pawn up and Black doesn't appear to have enough compensation after 22 I!.fel, since 22 .. .f5 can be answered by 23 f4!. Naturally, these lines remain wide open to improvement.

11 f4 (D)

White seizes his chance to attack the keyeS point. I won't be looking at the preventive 11 a4; according to theory, Black holds the bal- ance.

Out of the many factors to con- W sider, Black's strong central position carries a lot of weight, and should guarantee at least equality. 13a4 White initiates the standard break on the queenside: not only does it prepare the follow- ing intrusion into Black's position, but it also clears c4 for a knight. If White wants to conquer more territory on the kingside and secure the attractive e4-square for his other knight, he can advance his f-pawn. However, by so doing he permanently gives up any challenge to what is after all the bastion of Black's position, the pawn on eS. The game Smejkal-Suetin, Novi Sad 1982 saw Black equalize after 13 fS O-O 14 .Bd2 ttJd4 IS J::tc1 .Be8 (or IS ...

The resulting position is as murky as any- thing else in this line. It appears to me that White's exchange won't mean much with his king potentially exposed and Black having ex- tra pawns.

w 19 f5?! This radical decision prevents Black from playing ... fS or putting a piece on that square; it also introduces the notion of a kingside attack by a rook-lift and 'iUf1-h3.

10 The Hedgehog Variation

This chapter deals with a system sporting the odd name 'Hedgehog'. For those of you won- dering, the hedgehog is an animal covered by needle-like spines. In order to defend itself, the hedgehog curls into a ball, so that when an en- emy comes too close, it gets pricked by the spines. In chess, a similar concept is expressed by a position in which a player has little space to work with, but which is difficult for an oppo- nent to breach without encountering a sudden and sharp counterattack. Although the word 'hedgehog' had been floating around for years to describe various structures characterized by only second- and third-rank pawns, the name 'Hedgehog Variation' first came into widespread use (in several languages!) to describe specifi- cally the English Opening variation after 1 c4 c5 2 ttJf3 ttJf6 3 ttJc3 e64 g3 b6 5 iog2 i.b7 6 O-O i.e7 (or 6 ... a6 or 6 ... d6), usually with 7 d4 cxd4 8 'iVxd4 or 7 l:i.el followed by e4 and d4, with Black putting pawns on d6, b6 and a6. The diagram shows one of the main positions stem- ming from this move-order. w I use the name Hedgehog with a capital 'H' to refer to this English Opening variation, and the adjective hedgehog with a small 'h' to refer to black pawn-structures involving ... a6, ... b6, ... d6 and ... e6 that crop up in several other open- ings. In most hedgehog variations that we care about, Black's c-pawn has been exchanged, or is about to be. White's pawns can be on c4 and/or e4, as we have seen in the English Open- ing. That also occurs in many variations of the Sicilian Defence. In practice, the official Hedge- hog Variation of this chapter differs from oth- ers, in that White's bishop is always situated on g2. In most other English Opening variations and in the Sicilian Defence, it tends to be on e2, d3 or even c2. In Chapter 8, we see such a hedgehog formation in the Anti-Benoni system with 4 ... b6. The Hedgehog has been played a lot on the international circuit and at the grandmaster level of play, but not as much at lower levels. In the past 20 years it has gone from a rather eclec- tic set-up to a highly theoretical one, in the sense that top players engage in lines extending past move 20. Of course, this is hardly a unique situation in modern chess. Not only do grand- masters play lengthy theoretical lines in open- ings such as the Sicilian Najdorf, Botvinnik Semi-Slav, and main-line King's Indian, but we also see 'ordinary' players doing so in tour- naments and on the online playing sites. The difference is that the Hedgehog developed as an opening that primarily involved positional themes and not overtly forcing lines. The clar- ity of those themes has made it one of the most written-about variations in the English Open- ing. If you like positional manoeuvring, and are willing to put some time into learning a few tac- tical lines, the Hedgehog remains a fun and in- structive option from both sides of the board.

[diagram]
The question is: how does one get to the English Opening Hedgehog Variation? It's im- portant to realize that Black can't always play the Hedgehog, and see in what ways White can aim for or steer clear of it. Here are some major move-order possibilities: a) 2 ttJc3 ttJf6 (after 2 ... b6 3 ttJf3 i.b7, White can play 4 e3! and 5 d4 to claim a pleas- ant game) 3 g3. Now Black's best shot at a

298 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Hedgehog Variation is to play 3 ... e6 4 lbf3 (with the idea 4 ... d5 5 cxd5 exd5 6 d4; White doesn't usually want to permit 4 .i.g2 d5) 4 ... b6 5 .i.g2 .i.b7, etc., which is our main line. b) 2 lbc3 lbf6 3 lbf3 b6 (3 ... e6 4 d4 cxd4 5 lbxd4 is a standard position in which Black generally plays 5 ... lbc6, 5 ... .i.b4 or 5 ... a6, none of them leading to positions from this chapter)

4 d4 (4 g3 .i.b7 5 .i.g2 e6 is a Hedgehog Varia-

tion; White can also play 4 e4 .i.b7 5 e5, or here 5 .i.d3 with the idea .i.c2 and d4) 4 ... cxd4 5 lbxd4 .i.b7 (5 ... e6 6 e4) 6 f3 followed by e4 transposes to an Anti-Benoni hedgehog forma- tion from Chapter 8 (beginning with 4 ... b6). This differs greatly from the variation we are discussing in this chapter, because White's bishop will go to e2 instead of g2. 2 ••• lbf6 (D) Once again, Black can play 2 ... b6 3 d4 (3 g3 .i.b74 .i.g2 lbf6 5 lbc3 e6 brings us back to the main line) 3 ... cxd4 4 lbxd4 .i.b7 5 lbc3 lbf6 6 f3 d6 7 e4 e6 and we have transposed to the Anti-Benoni from Chapter 8. w 3 lbc3 This is equivalent to 2 lbc3 lbf6 3 lbf3. Here, too, 3 d4 cxd4 4 lbxd4 prevents the Hedgehog proper. What this means, in conjunction with the last few notes, is that most of the time after I c4, it's White's choice whether to enter into the Hedgehog, and in reality, most players don't choose to do so. But that isn't the whole story. In fact, the popularity of the Hedgehog at the top levels comes primarily from games that begin with 1 lbf3. Then, as you can work out for yourself, the number of ways that Black has of getting to a Hedgehog becomes higher. For example, one common sequence is 1 lbf3 lbf6 2 c4 b6 3 g3 .i.b7 4 .i.g2 e6 5 O-O .i.e7 6 lbc3 c5. If you look at the entire set of lnfonnators, which are domi- nated by grandmaster play and have over 600 true Hedgehog games, you find that, depending upon the subvariation, from 60% to 90% of those games begin with 1 lbf3, often 80% or more. This strange situation goes back to the fact that a significant minority of leading play- ers don't want to play on the white side of 1 c4 e5, although they otherwise like playing the English Opening. So they play 1 lbf3 followed by 2 c4. Whether that is strictly logical or merely understandable depends upon your interpreta- tion of the first section of this book. It's true that a very large number of players answer 1 c4 with 1...e5, so from that point of view White might want to avoid it. If nothing else, bypass- ing 1...e5 cuts down on one's preparation time. On the other hand, playing against 1. .. e5 can be a lot of fun and give the kind of complex game that most players want. Finally, having pointed out that 1 c4 allows Black to dictate matters with 1...e5, I should say that 1 lbf3 also cuts down on your flexibility in crucial ways. To cite one example of many, White has to deal with 1...d5, when an English Opening is no lon- ger on the cards. In that situation we have possi- bilities including the Queen's Gambit and the Reti Opening, the latter to be discussed in the next volume. Having said all that, let's return to the Hedge- hog itself.

[diagram]
Again, 3 ... b6 can be used by those who don't mind playing against 4 d4 cxd4 5 lZJxd4 or 4 e4. This book won't deal with the Double Fianchetto line that combines ... g6 and ... b6.

4 g3 b6 5 .i.g2 .i.b7 6 O-O (D)

White can accelerate his Hedgehog set-up by 6 d4 cxd4 7 'ii'xd4, but this has the drawback that 7 ... lbc6 is better than similar lines below, because 8 ~f4 .i.b4 develops apace. Then the threat of ... .i.xc3+ and subsequent pressure along the c-file (already well underway) usu- ally leads to 9 .i.d2 O-O 10 O-O, and now the move 1O ... .i.e7! sets up a standard position in which White's bishop is quite misplaced on d2. In fact, it would be better off on c 1; for one thing, variations with ~f4 tend to go well with

b3 and i.b2. Don't worry if you find this con- fusing; as you might guess, it's a practical sum- mary which you might want to investigate by B studying the specifics.

So 6 ... d6 has a few unique problems in- volving b3; a careful examination will reveal other issues. b) 6 ... a6 (D) used to be more popular. w Again, White sometimes plays b3, .tb2, e3 and an early d4, when ... a6 may not be so use- ful. But a more interesting line is 7 d4 (as men- tioned above, 7 l:!.el achieves 8 e4 more easily than after 6 ... .te7, that is, ... a6 would be virtu- ally a tempo-loss in lines where ... dS or ... ttJe4 might be contemplated) 7 ... cxd4 8 'iVxd4 d6 9 b3 (on the positive side, Black's choice of6 ... a6 rather than 6 ... .te7 means that after the popular idea 9 .tgS, 9 ... ttJbd7 prepares for ... ttJxf6 to be the answer to .txf6; compare the games below) 9 ... ttJbd7 (after 9 ... .te7 10 .ta3, Black already has problems with his d-pawn) 10 ttJgS (D).

This move pops up again and again, al- though it usually achieves nothing special ver- sus accurate play.

You might wonder why Black wouldn't be thrilled to win an immediate tempo via S".ttJc6

The basic problem with the move is rather technical. It stems from the fact that in hedge- hog formations, including ones in the Sicilian Defence, this knight has the most influence from a more flexible post on d7; in fact, Black will sometimes move a knight from c6 by means of ".ttJeS-d7, even at the cost of some time. In part this is because Black wants his bishop on b7 to have an unobstructed view; then, for ex- ample, it can attack a white pawn on e4, which can be further bothered by ".ttJcS. This ma- noeuvre ".ttJc6-eS-d7 arises in the Taimanov Sicilian when White plays ttJbS and c4, but in that variation White wastes a lot of time to get one knight to the mediocre a3-square, whereas in our current Hedgehog position, White doesn't commit to e4 until he sees where Black's pieces are going. That said, ".ttJc6 has some easily compre- hensible advantages: it gains a tempo, no small matter, and it contests the d4-square, denying White's minor pieces access to it without the possibility of exchange. Usually White is will- ing to exchange queens following 9 'iVf4 (9 'iVd3 is also played) 9".'iVbS (a standard idea, to contest d6; Black understands that in the static position after 9".d6, the knight will be some- what misplaced on c6, as just described) 10 ttJbS!?

iLb7 6 O-O iLe7 7 d4 cxd4 8 'ilVxd4 d6 (D) w Here's one of the key Hedgehog positions, and the starting point for the great majority of Hedgehog battles until about a decade ago. It is still the main line, followed closely by 7 .l:!.el. I want to show a few classic and modem games with 7 d4 containing the kind of ideas common to the Hedgehog. First, after 8 'ilVxd4 d6 what's going on? For one thing, White has more com- mand of space (all the more so after Black plays ... tiJbd7). He has potential pressure against Black's weak pawn on d6; this can be devel- oped via l:Idl, b3/iLa3, and tiJbS, tiJe4 or tiJg5- e4. White is also weakness-free. His plans are varied and fundamentally different: he can play for space with a 'Maroczy Bind' pair of pawns on c4 and e4, or he can stick to piece-play, with some combination of .l:tdl, iLgS, b3/iLb2, and tiJd4 (along with a variety of other piece de- ployments). For a while, the latter idea discour- aged Black, in the sense that it seemed difficult to scare up counterpJay when White didn't com- mit his e-pawn. Just to make it worse, White has long-term prospects of a kingside pawn ad- vance (f4/fS/g4/gS in some mix) or a queenside advance (a4/aS/b4/CS). The Hedgehog has been championed by nu- merous great players, so naturally Black's posi- tion can't be all that bad. It has, I think, fewer positive aspects than White's position, but more powerful ones. As in the Sicilian Defence (with the same weak d-pawn on an open d-file), Black has that most underrated of all advan- tages: the central pawn-majority. A central ma- jority not only has the potential to expand, but it covers more key squares than a single-pawn centre does. Here, for example, the hedgehog centre controls not only eS and dS, but also cS and fS. This makes it difficult for White to ad- vance in the centre, and even more difficult to plant a piece there. Also, notice Black's minor- ity attack with ... a6 and ... bS. "Wait a minute," you might say, "Why would achieving ... b5 mean anything? White can simply capture on bS and he has even gained the chance to cre- ate a passed pawn immediately with b3 and a4." There are two separate considerations here. First, a passed a-pawn in the opening or middle- game tends to be as much a liability as an asset; it will often become a target before it ever be- comes a threat. But in any event, what does the disappearance of White's c-pawn signify? That Black's central majority has a much better chance of advancing, creating positive oppor- tunities in all stages of the game. Black has other things going for him. Since his centre gives him a certain invulnerability, Black has a lot of time to get his pieces out and use them in both active and reactive ways. For

THE HEDGEHOG VARIATION 303

example, knights on cS and f6 in conjunction with a bishop on b7 exert pressure on e4, and rooks on squares like c8, d8 and e8 can assist in making central defence and offence more ef- fective. Last, but by no means least, experience has shown that Black's particular structure and piece placement have a surprising elasticity. With only three ranks to work with, they have as many or more options as do White's pieces with five ranks to operate on. This is best shown by example. 9b3 As suggested above, White has numerous moves here, such as 9 e4, 9 :dl and 9 ..tgS. In this game he sets up a c4/e4 pawn-structure.

9. .. O-O

Practice has shown that 9 ... ttJbd7?! 10 ttJbS! is very dangerous for Black, the tactical point being 1O ... ttJcS (lO ... dS 11 cxdS ..txdS 12 'iYf4 O-O 13 ..tb2 gives White good play down the d- file and/or c-file) 11l:!.d1 ttJfe4 12 ~xg7!?

10 e4 ttJbd7 (D)

w 11 ~e3 (D) White reorganizes his pieces in order to cen- tralize his knight on d4. The queen isn't doing much good on d4 at this stage, but it will remain in a position from where it can enforce the move eS as a response to dS. For example, 11 ... dS 12 cxdS exdS 13 eS, a sequence which is normally enough to establish a central superiority, and therefore to be remembered (if you're White, you always have to be ready to answer ... dS). Once White plays b3, with or without e4, the move ..ta3 in conjunction with :d1 can be a problem, because Black needs to shore up his vulnerable d6-pawn without making conces- sions. His move-order here with 1O ... ttJbd7 is specifically designed to meet that threat, since 11 ..ta3 ttJcS is very solid. In general, Black would like to answer the move ..ta3 in this way rather than by ... dS, which tends to be too loos- ening, or by a passive move such as ... ttJe8 (af- ter ... O-O).

11 ..• a6 12 ttJd4 In the contests with 7 .lIel below, White plays e4 and d4, and when Black plays ... cxd4, White recaptures with the knight. That makes White's variation in this game seem inferior, because here his queen has to make two extra moves, to d4 and then e3 before the knight gets to d4. In addition, it can be argued that White's bishop stands better when centralized on e3 than on b2. That holds true in related openings, such as the Fianchetto Variation of the King's Indian Defence, where White operates with the same pawn-structure. Nevertheless, White might say that the tempo doesn't matter so much as long as Black can't enforce a freeing move; and in the meantime, White has avoided lines such as 7 .l:te1 dS and 7 lIel ttJe4. We'll talk more about these trade- offs in the next games. ... ~c713 ..tb2 lUeS! (D)

304 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

w Over the years this has become widely ac- cepted as the best square for Black's rook, for a variety of reasons. It increases Black's chance of playing ... d5 successfully, because after any exchange of pawns he will have an open e-file (vis-iI-vis the queen in the precise situation be- fore us). The rook is also well-placed to meet the idea f4-f5, attacking e6. White may even be able to reinforce that attack by .th3 at some point, so having the rook on e8 can be invalu- able. Finally, we already know that Black's pawn-breaks ... b5 and ... d5 are important, but the move ... e5 can be equally or more impor- tant. For example, a simple idea is ... e5, kicking White's knight off d4 and then playing ... b5. Also, in the many positions where White has a pawn on f4, ... e5 can lead to the opening of the e-file by Black's ... exf4, or by Black's recapture with a piece when White plays fxe5. In that case the rook on e8 exerts pressure down the e- file. All of which is not to say that White can't profit from the transaction as well, since he both gains access to d5 and f5, and opens the f- file for his rooks. Incidentally, ... lUe8 is also the most respected rook placement in the Scheveningen Sicilian, another variation with a hedgehog pawn-struc- ture, for many of the same reasons. 14h3!? This is a double-edged move. It stops ... ttJg4, which together with ... d5 and ... .ltc5 can cause trouble for White. However, although it's a rather obscure point at the moment, sometimes when White plays f4, the move h3 turns out to have weakened the g3-square, and by exten- sion, f4 itself. Thus the moves ... h5-h4 and ... ttJh5 are seen in games with this variation, and even ... d5, opening up the queen's view of f4 and g3 from its post on c7, followed by ... .td6. Karpov-Adams, Wijk aan Zee 1998 wasn't different in terms of structure but ended up with a different resolution of the tension: 14 l:!.ac1 l:tad8 15 .l:tfel 'iWb8 16 .l:te2 .tf8 (Black's last three moves have been played in many games: he gets the queen off the c-file, with .. :~a8 a possibility, and he prepares to give the bishop a more active role on g7) 17 h3 (notice that White is still able to answer 17 ... d5 with 18 e5, and Black's other potential break with ... b5 is under control for the moment) 17 ... g618l:!.cel!?(D).

A funny-looking position, but the tripling is a standard idea originally played by Uhlmann a few decades before. Karpov says that the func- tion of the rooks is "purely prophylactic ... to make the freeing advance ... d5 difficult for Black", that is, ... d5 will be answered by e5.

Often in this sort of position the players sim- ply shuffle back and forth for 20 moves or so until something appears (or doesn't).

Naturally Black didn't win all the games in the systems with e4 and c4, but White began to look for lines based upon piece-play and offering fewer targets.

White plays a straightforward and flexible move that aims at the d6-pawn and coordinates well with an attack by pieces. White retains op- tions of ..Itg5, tbg5, b3 with either ..Itb2 or ..Ita3, and even e4. In general he wants to see which way Black plays next ( ... a6, ... O-O, ... tbbd7 or ... tbc6) before he commits to a formation. 9 ... a610 tbg5 This is one of the 'piece-play' approaches. White's first goal with this move, which is played in several related positions (see the note about 6 ... a6 in the chapter introduction), is to exchange off the light-squared bishops. This may seem odd, because White played 8 'iVxd4 in large part to avoid this exchange. However, because of the particular move-order that both sides have chosen, White wants to win the e4square in or- der to bring a knight there and exploit Black's lightly-protected d6-pawn in some lines. .... .Itxg211 ~xg2 tbc6 a) Timing is very delicate in the Hedgehog; for example, 11 ... l:ta7? is a good idea in general (see the next note), but very badly timed here, due to another combination of White's moves: 12 ..Ite3! tbbd7 (the threat on b6 compels Black to occupy the d7-square that his rook was sup- posed to use; as a result, the d-pawn can't be defended) 13 tbge4 O-O 14 tbxd6 'iVa8+ 15 f3 .l:!.d8 16 tbde4 and White keeps his extra pawn, Wojtkiewicz-Jurek, Bern 1993. b) Another strategy for Black is to fight back with ... d5; for example, 11...O-O 12 tbce4 d5, but White can put pressure on Black's d-pawn by the sharp 13 tbxf6+ ..Itxf6 14 'iVg4!, when 14 ... l:ta7 is met by 15 e4! l:td7 16 exd5 exd5 17 cxd5 .l:txd5?? 18 'iVe4. 12 'ilVf4 (D)

Another line that has been played a fair amount is 10 .l:.fdl lLlbd7 11 ~d2, the main idea of which is to retreat White's bishop from gS to f4, undertaking to force a concession on Black's part: either ... eS or ... lLle8, in the latter case agreeing to White's expansion by e4. Theory holds that Black can level the play.

11 ~f4 Thus we have the main starting position of the i.gS system. The play is highly technical and theoretical, but I'll try to show the basic ideas for both sides. 11 ~d3 also targets d6, but strangely, isn't used much any more. In Sulava-Pelletier, French Team Ch, Evry 2004, Black used the idea of the rook transfer we saw above: Il..J:ta7 12 l:tadl i.e7 13lLld4 i.xg2 14 ~xg2 'ii'c8 IS f4!

Black used to play 11 ... i.xf3 12 'ii'xf3 .J:!.a7 more often, with the idea ... .J:!.d7. Then White has a small edge because of his greater com- mand of territory and targets in the enemy camp.

In addition, before White doubles rooks, he wants to protect his back rank, again in anticipation of ... dS or even a timely ... bS.

Normally 7 ... d6 will transpose after 8 e4 a6 9 d4 cxd4, etc. Black has two conventional ways to avoid the hedgehog structure: a) 7 ... d5 was one ofthe main reasons why 7 .l:tel didn't catch on for so many years. Indeed, the rook move seems to have little role in this position. On the other hand, it can be argued that ... .i.b7 and ... d5 often don't go that well to- gether throughout the Queen's Indian/Bogo- IndianlNimzo-Indian complex, so that White can hope for a pull by playing normal moves. At any rate, here are two high-level recent ex- amples: al) Topalov-Carlsen, MorelialLinares 2007 saw 8 d4!? dxc4 9 dxc5 i.xc5 10 'iVa4+ ttJbd7 11 ~xc4 O-O 12 .l:tdl l:tc8 13 'iVh4 i.e7, and here White found the creative idea 14 'iVh3!

You might want to look at Queen's Indian De- fence theory, including lines beginning with I d4 ttJf6 2 c4 e6 3 ttJf3 b6 4 a3 i.b7 5 ttJc3 d5 6 cxd5 exd5 7 g3, etc. The main line there reaches this position, but with White's pawn on a3 and no rook on el. a22) 8 ... ttJxd5 9 d4 (D) (9 e4 can be an- swered by 9 ... ttJxc3 10 bxc3, with a big centre for White, or by 9 ... ttJb4 10 d4 cxd4 11 ttJxd4 ttJ8c6 12 ttJxc6 'iVxdl 13 l:f.xdl i.xc6 with rough equality, though this last position takes accurate play and may not thrill Black; 9 ttJxd5 exd5 10 d4 O-O with ideas of ... ttJa6 and ... .l:te8 is equal and leads to a more exciting game).

Thirdly, the move ... h4 can create some weak- nesses in White's camp. As always, there are disadvantages to 13 ... hS. It uses a tempo (which might have been devoted to a move like .. J~.fe8), the h-pawn itself may

312 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

become a target, and Black's kingside defences are theoretically weakened. 14h3 Black can feel good about having provoked this move because now .Bh3 can't assist in an attack on e6, and White has to defend the h2-b8 diagonal in some lines after ... h4. White can try to avoid these problems by two means: a) 14 ~hl makes room at gl for the bishop if Black persists in ... tbg4. A sample line is 14 ... tbc5 15 .igl h416 b4 (16 g4?! h3 17.Bf3 allows the typical Sicilian-like dark-square grab with 17 ... g5! 18 fxg5!? tbh7 19 b4 tbd7 20 g6 tbg5! 21 gxf7+ ~xf7 and White has too many weaknesses) 16 ... h3! 17 .Bf3 tbcd7 (17 ... .l:.ad8, to answer 18 bxc5 with 18 ... dxc5, is dubious because of 18 ~e2 tbcd7 19 tbd5! exd5 20 cxd5 tbc5 21 bxc5 and White plays Win and Wixh3 next) 18 g4!? with an unclear attack. White has to be wary because the area around his king is loose, but g5 and tbd5 can create de- fensive problems for Black. b) By keeping h3 free for the bishop, White makes 14 f5!? an important candidate, even if it means giving up his dark-squared bishop; for example, 14 ... tbg4 (14 ... e5? 15 tbd5) 15 Wie2!? (15 fxe6 tbxe3 16 .l:txe3 .Bg5) 15 ... tbxe3 16 ~xe3 ~c5 (16 ... tbe5 17 fxe6 tbg4 18 tbd5!) 17 b4! (17 fxe6?? .Bg5 18 ~f2 fxe6) 17 ... Wie5 18 .Bh3, which is utterly unclear. 14• • JUe81S .Bf2 (D) White can argue that 15 g4 hxg4 16 hxg4 weakens Black's kingside as much as his own, but then 16 ... tbc5 17 .Bf2 d5 18 e5 tbfe4 gives Black a nice outpost, and White won't like 18 exd5 ~xf4 either. This is an example of how the trade-off ... h5/h3 can benefit Black.

IS ••• .Bf8! 15 ... g6 was played in the game LJohannes- sen-Schmaltz, Athens 2003. It supports h5 but is rather loosening; the game saw the standard sacrifice 16 tbd5!? exd5 17 cxd5 tbc5 (Franco gives 17 ... ~d8 18 tbc6 .Bxc6 19 dxc6 tbc5 20 b4 tbe6 21 f5!? as unclear, but this will be diffi- cult for Black after 2l...tbc7 22 i.xb6) 18 b4 .l:.ad8, and now 19 f5! looks strong, as fxg6 next threatens to win e6 and denude Black's king; at the same time, 19 ... g5 20 bxc5 bxc5 21 tbc6! i.xc6 22 dxc6 is clearly good for White. 16 tbdS!? (D) Again this thematic sacrifice. White almost always gets his piece back, yet the assessment depends upon how Black can reorganize in the meantime. Upon 16 ~e2, threatening e5, Black has 16 ... e5 (remember that if this is played when White has a pawn on f4 and knight on d4, it at least grants Black open lines, because ... exf4 can follow a knight move) 17 tbd5 'iVd8 18 fxe5 tbxe5.

11 Mikenas Attack and

Nimzo-Engl ish

1 c4 ttJf6 (D)

w Black uses 1... ttJf6 if he intends to playa so- called 'Indian System', that is, one with the moves ... g6 or ... e6, in this case omitting or de- laying ... c5 and ... e5. By doing so, he keeps the possibility of a mainstream d4 opening alive. That is, if White plays 2 d4, Black may play 2 ... g6 and transpose into a King's Indian De- fence with 3 ... j.g7 or into a Griinfeld Defence after 3 ... d5. Or he might choose to answer 2 d4 with 2 ... e6 and transpose to one of several open- ings such as a Nimzo-Indian Defence (3 ttJc3 j.b4), or a Queen's Indian Defence (3 ttJf3 b6), or a Queen's Gambit Declined (3 ... d5). In this book I'm concerned with positions that belong to the English Opening proper, that is, not involving transpositions to a 1 d4 open- ing. In particular, White can go his own way versus standard Indian Defence set-ups. After 1 c4 ttJf6 2 ttJc3 g6 3 g3 j.g7 4 j.g2, for example, White may choose to forego d4 by an early e4, or by a combination of ttJf3 and d3. Those op- tions are discussed in Chapter 12. Following the moves 1 c4 ttJf6 2 ttJc3 e6, White can abstain from d4 by playing 3 e4, when Black's natural replies are 3 ... d5 or 3 ... c5. He can also play 3 ttJf3, when Black's most in- dependent move is 3 ... j.b4. Those are the varia- tions under consideration in this chapter. Other lines can arise when Black sets up with ... e6, but I've limited myself to these as the most common and, I think, the most instructive in a broader sense. Before moving on to specific positions, I need to make a few points regarding transpositions into other variations or openings. For example, after 1 c4 ttJf6, both 2 ttJc3 and 2 ttJf3 have their advantages and drawbacks. Both allow 2 ... c5, of course, with a Symmetrical English. 2 ttJc3 gives Black the extra choice of 2 ... e5, transpos- ing to a normal 1 c4 e5 English. But if Black an- swers 2 ttJc3 with 2 ... e6, White can control the direction of the play himself by using 3 e4 (dis- cussed in this chapter), whereas after 3 ttJf3, Black has the choices; for example, 3 ... j.b4, 3 ... c5, or 3 ... d5 (the latter provoking 4 d4 with a Queen's Gambit Declined). If White wants to eliminate that possibility of 2 ... e5, he can play 2 ttJf3; then, however, Black may be more inclined to respond with 2 ... e6 and 3 ... d5, because many players prefer to defend the Queen's Gambit Declined only when White is already committed to the move ttJf3. Finally, I should mention that White's third most natural response to 1...ttJf6 (apart from 2 d4), which is 2 g3. Then 2 ... e5 is possible, transposing to Chapter 4, but the sequence 2 ... e6 and 3 ... d5 will probably lead to a Cata- lan (for example, after 3 ttJf3 d5 4 d4), and the move 2 ... c5 enters a line of the Symmetrical English in which White is committed to g3. You mayor may not be happy with these pos- sibilities; it's mostly a matter of taste. There are more such issues, but I find the above the most meaningful points for the 1 c4 player.

314 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Mikenas Attack: Introduction

1 c4 tZ:lf6 2 tZ:lc3 e6 3 e4 (D)

As indicated above, when Black plays 2 ... e6, he shows his willingness to transpose to one of several queen' s pawn openings in the event of 3 d4. For example, 3 ... d5 is a Queen's Gambit Declined, 3 ... ~b4 is a Nimzo-Indian Defence, and 3 ... cS often turns into a Benoni after 4 dS. The only effective way that White can guar- antee that the game continues in English Open- ing channels is 3 e4, an aggressive move called the Mikenas Attack.

Thus we can appreciate the appeal of 3 e4 in a purely practical sense: White makes the ini- tial choice as to the course of the game, and in so doing he limits the theory he needs to mas- ter. In addition, White usually gets to play the aggressor in what are inherently double-edged positions. Right away, he has a threat of 4 eS followed by S d4, and it turns out that Black's reasonable defences all admit of exciting play.

3 e4 also comes with disadvantages, of course,

which become evident as we focus on Black's counter-strategies. Central Challenge with 3 ... d5 3 ... d5 Ivanchuk - P.H. Nielsen Skanderborg 2003 Black directly challenges the centre in classi- cal fashion. Let's walk through the early moves of this line and discuss the reasoning behind them. First, why doesn't Black choose moves other than 3 ... dS and 3 ... cS (analysed in the next sec- tion)? Here are two others: a) 3 ... ~b4? lets White play 4 eS, which is obviously advantageous after the more-or-Iess forced reply 4 ... tZ:lg8; for example, S 'iWg4 (or S d4, or S tZ:lf3) S. .. 'it>f8 (after S. .. g6 6 tZ:lf3, Black has major problems on the dark squares) 6 tZ:lf3 tZ:lc67 d4. Black can't even castle. b) 3 ... eS!? 4 tZ:lf3 tZ:lc6 (D) (3 ... tZ:lc6 4 tZ:lf3 eS transposes). w A funny situation, in which Black wastes a move with ... e6-eS, but contends that c4 is not a desirable move for White in this position. Remarkably, he is willing to enter into the Nimzowitsch Four Knights line (I c4 eS 2 tZ:lc3 tZ:lf6 3 tZ:lf3 tZ:lc6 4 e4) with an extra tempo for White. White has several possible answers: bl) S d4 exd4 6 tZ:lxd4 ~b4 has done accept- ably for Black in several games, even though it may objectively favour White somewhat. b2) After S ~e2!?, S ... ~cS?! 6 tZ:lxeS! is strong, so S ... ~b4 6 d3 d6 7 O-O O-O 8 tZ:ldS might follow. This option could be slightly an- noying to Black. b3) S a3!? is a good choice, preventing ... ~b4 and anticipating S ... ~cS?! (S ... d6 is prob- ably best, when White grabs some central terri- tory with 6 d4) 6 tZ:lxeS! tZ:lxeS 7 d4; here Black would normally play ... ~b4, but White's extra move a3 stops him from doing that. We now return to 3 ... dS (D):

MIKENAS ArrACK AND NIMZO-ENGLISH 315

w 4 e5 White has to respond to the threats of ... dxe4 and ... d4. a) As a rule, he doesn't want to free Black's c8-bishop without gaining some compensating advantage, so 4 exd5 exd5 isn't seen that much. In fact, 5 d4 transposes into a rarely-played French Defence position, i.e., 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 exd5 4 c4 ttJf6 5 ttJc3, in which Black has few difficulties. White can also head for unique positions via 5 cxd5 ttJxd5. Then 6 d4 .1i.M! is attractive because White has to take an extra move to defend c3. Instead, 6 ttJf3 is a possible way to escape theory; we're getting rather far afield, but an intriguing continuation would be 6 ... ttJb4 (6 ... ttJc6 7 .1i.b5) 7 d4 .1i.f5 8 .1i.b5+ c6 9 i.a4 ttJd3+ 10 ~f1. b) 4 cxd5 exd5 5 e5 is quite rare these days, although it provides White some new ideas and isn't yet completely worked out. The main line is 5 ... ttJe4! 6 ttJf3 (White shouldn't accept the pawn sacrifice: 6 ttJxe4 dxe4 7 'iVa4+ ttJc6 8 ~xe4 'ilkd4! 9 ~xd4 ttJxd4 10 ~dl .1i.f5 11 d3 O-O-O with a substantial advantage for Black) 6 ... ttJc67 i.b5 .1i.e7 8 'ilka4 (8 .1i.xc6+!? bxc6 9 'ilka4 wins a pawn, although 9 .. :iVd7! 10 ttJxe4 dxe4 11 'ilkxe40-0 12 d4 .1i.a6 gives Black good compensation) 8 ... .1i.d7 9 ttJxe4 a6! 10 ttJf6+?!

It used to be played and ana- lysed a fair amount, but the influential game Smyslov-I.Farago, Hastings 197617 discouraged further research: 5 cxd5 exd5 6 d4 c5!? 7 ttJf3 ttJc6 (perhaps 7 ... cxd4 8 ~xd4 ttJb6 is better, but either 9 .1i.b5+ or 9 .1i.g5! keeps an advan- tage) 8 .1i.b5!

(D) has been the most popular choice at the top levels for at least IS years (we'll see 7 ... c5 in the next game). w Black reasons that any time he can establish a central presence and simultaneously open a diagonal for his queen's bishop, he should do so. Now 8 liJf3 transposes to our main game. Instead, 8 ~e2?! wins a pawn, but 8 ... 1i.e7! 9 ~xeS (9 dxe5 'ii'c6 gives Black at least enough for a pawn; White has the weak c-pawns and will have to untangle his pieces to get castled) 9 .. :iVxe5+ 10 dxe5 liJc6 11 f4 f6! opens the position to White's great detriment. Notice White's bishops, blocked by their own pawns; and once the centre is demolished, he will have horrible internal weaknesses on e3 and d3. Although I won't go into detail, I should also say that 7 d4 has a special advantage over 7 liJf3, in that it allows White to answer 7 ... b6 with 8 1i.e2 1i.b7 9 1i.f3, which is probably somewhat favourable for him. Of course, 8liJf3 is also possible, transposing to the next note. 7 ... eS A reasonable alternative is 7 ... b6!? 8 d41i.b7, when 9 1i.e2 1i.d6 10 O-O O-O gives Black fair prospects. White can play more ambitiously by 91i.d3!? (D).

Here's a trick that you may have seen in other openings: 9 ... 1i.d6? 10 1i.g5! 1i.xf3 11 ~d2!, trapping Black's queen! Then 1l...1l.f4! 121i.xf4 threatens 1i.g5 again, so 12 ... 1i.xg2 13 l:!gl1i.b7 is practically forced, when 14l:tg3 re- news the threat with 1i.e5. This trap reappears below. So the main line is 9 ... 1i.xf3 10 gxf3, when White has two sets of doubled pawns and a total of four isolated pawns, but he also has two bishops and a potential attack on Black's light squares, beginning with the move 1i.e4. We now return to 7 ... e5 (D): 8d4 For some time, 8 1i.d3 was popular, with the idea O-O, 1i.e4/c2 and d4. Since solutions have been found, I'll skip over this option, except to show one fun game that is typical of the Mike- nas, in that White gets the bishop-pair and an attack, while at the same time he takes on

For the cost of a mere pawn, he has control of the dark squares, Black's pieces are stuck on the first rank, and d6 and b6 are ideal spots upon which to place pieces. In addition, he's gaining more time by attacking the knight on eS.

Black hasn't captured just any pawn, how- ever. It's a centre pawn, and we know how strong a central majority can be in defence, be- cause centre pawns potentially defend the most important attacking squares.

w When played against 1 d4, 2 c4 and 3 liJc3, the combination of moves 1...liJf6, 2 ... e6 and 3 ... .tb4 is called the Nimzo-Indian. Hence,

MIKENAS ATTACK AND NIMZO-ENGLISH 325

when played against the English Opening, it may be called the Nimzo-English (well, that was my excuse for inventing the name some decades ago). A fundamental difference be- tween the two is that in our line, Black cannot freely occupy e4 without taking White's move d3 into account. Beyond that, Black isn't so much trying to pin the knight, but either to ex- change it or threaten to exchange it. Why would he want to? Because 3 ... .i.b4 allows him to get his pieces out and castle rapidly, while ex- changing on c3 rids White of a valuable piece that is fighting for the crucial dS- and e4- squares. Furthermore, if White doesn't play ei- ther Wic2 or Wib3, the exchange ... .i.xc3 dou- bles his pawns, which can greatly affect their mobility. In fact, Black will seldom exchange without being forced to do so, so White must normally spend a tempo if he wants to compel that exchange, usually by using the non-devel- oping move a3. By the time White gets orga- nized, it's possible to have a situation in which Black has already castled and played ... b6 (or ... cS or ... dS), before White has developed any other piece besides his queen on c3 and knight on f3, and before he has moved a central pawn! For all that, the notion that White simply must have a small advantage in the Nirnzo-English persisted for years. It wasn't until the 1970s that 3 ... .i.b4 well and truly became mainstream, and even then the early theoreticians spoke cau- tiously about it, showing variations largely in fa- vour of White. After all, the reasoning goes, White is normally pleased to reach a position in which he has two bishops, no weaknesses, and no targets of attack for his opponent. What's more, he has the flexibility to play d4 whenever it seems appropriate, or to hold back while pur- suing other aims. In fact, the ultimate assess- ment of a slight advantage for White may still have validity. But to whatever extent that may be true, if any, it is not enough to deter the world's best players from adopting the black pieces, some using 3 ... .i.b4 as their main weapon and others reserving it for occasional use. Backing off for a moment, why is White play- ing some sequence of the moves c4, ttJc3 and ttJf3 in the first place? Unfortunately, that brings us back to the land of move-orders. First, it turns out that a high percentage of Nimzo-English games arise after 1 ttJf3 and 2 c4. In those cases, there are a couple of other options that make sense after, say 1 ttJf3 ttJf6 2 c4 e6. One is 3 g3, if one wants to allow a Catalan Opening follow- ing 3 ... d5 4 d4, or permit a Symmetrical English (with White committed to g3) after 3 ... cS, or of course head towards a Queen's Indian-like posi- tion following 3 ... b6. All of these are avoidable if one plays 3 ttJc3. White can of course revert to

3 d4 and play versus a Queen's Gambit, Queen's

Indian Defence or Nimzo-Indian Defence, but those aren't to everyone's taste. Turning to a player who uses the English Opening move-order 1 c4 ttJf6 2 ttJc3 e6, 3 ttJf3 is first of all a way of avoiding the Nimzo- Indian proper (3 d4 .i.b4).1t may also be based upon a distrust or aversion to 3 e4, which we ex- amined above. The move 3 g3, seldom played, transposes after 3 ... dS 4 d4 to a Catalan where White's queen's knight has been committed rather early to c3, normally an undesirable situ- ation. Looking at move-orders from the other side of the board, we can surmise that Black is probably a Nimzo-Indian player; after all, he is allowing White to play 4 d4, which trans- poses to a main line of that opening. At any rate, having committed to 1...ttJf6 and 2 ... e6, he prefers 3 ... .i.b4 to the Queen's Gambit that might arise after 3 ... dS 4 d4, or the Symmetri- cal English that results from 3 ... cS. Finally, Black can choose 3 ... b6, a relatively rare move which I won't be examining. The most interesting non-transpositional line is 4 e4 (4 d4 is a Queen's Indian Defence, and 4 g3 .i.b7 S .i.g2 will either head that way or into a Hedgehog, if Black plays ... cS) 4 ... .i.b7 S .i.d3! d6 (S ... cS 6 O-O ttJc6 7 eS! ttJg4 8 .i.e4 gives White a small advantage) 6 .i.c2 cS 7 d4 cxd4 8 ttJxd4, when White has a Maroczy Bind set-up that promises some advantage.

The 4 g4 Flank Attack Ilbf3lbf6 2 e4 e6 3lbc3.lib4 4 g4!? (D) This a fascinating move that attempts quite simply to attack on the flank without any prepa- ratory development, and in particular to drive Black's knight from the centre. The flank- before-centre strategy is a ubiquitous facet of modem chess that I haven't dealt with at length in these volumes, in part because the chosen variations are meant to be accessible to a general audience and tend to have a classical bent. Early flank moves are seen in almost every opening now, notably g4, h4, ... gS, ... hS and ... b5, but also in a two-step process such as a3 & b4, ... a6 & ... bS, h3 & g4, and ... h6 & ... gS. 4 g4 in the Nimzo-English has had a remarkably successful stretch from its introduction in the second half of the 1990s up to the present; it is the most important line for those who like orig- inal positions.

4 g4 is clearly an aggressive move, but its po-

sitional aspects also contribute to its viability. While a lot of the action will initially take place on the kingside, the centre becomes key in most variations. Inherent in the ... lbf6/ ... e6/ ... .lib4 set-up is Black's temporary abandonment of dark squares, notably d4 (as in the Nimzo-In- dian and Queen's Indian), all the more so when ... b6 and ... .lib7 are played. Since White has opened with the central move c4, he need only successfully dispute the e4-square in order to have a preponderance of the centre. That is nor- mally difficult in Nimzo/QID-style positions, but part of the strategy of driving off the f6- knight (or pinning it) is precisely to enhance White's control of e4. Also, to prevent ... .lixc3 from being effective, White's queen will very often be placed on c2. To quote Krasenkow, the most dedicated exponent of this system: "Gen- erally, the classical approach of the old theory is that flank attacks are only possible when the situation in the centre is stable (the centre is closed or seized by the attacker). That is not quite correct. Yes, a counterattack in the centre is the most effective reaction to the flank attack - but then everything depends on the steadiness of the centre. According to Nimzowitsch, even

330 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

a small but solid centre justifies a flank attack ... A battle of these two concepts (a flank attack vs a central counterattack) forms the strategic con- tents of a wide range of opening systems." In specific terms, 4 g4 targets Black's king- side dark squares, namely, the points f6 and g7. Therefore in many lines White will play b3 and .Bb2; in other positions, if ... h6 has been played, White will sometimes effect the advance gS anyway. Given time, he can combine further ideas such as tbe4 and h4-hS-h6. Black has a few ideas of his own to counter this complex of White's intentions. He can ex- pand in the centre, and it's amazing how many of Black's wins (and draws) include ... dS-d4. That not only interferes with White's pieces (especially if he places a bishop on b2), but it also increases the influence of Black's own pieces in the centre, typically a bishop on b7, a knight on c6, or a rook on d8. Achieving ... O-O-O is more difficult than might be imagined, but castling away from White's attack will often render it less effective. Black can also exploit the looseness of White's kingside position by aiming his pieces in that direction. A bishop on b7 can probe squares along the hl-a8 diagonal, especially f3, a queen on c7 and knight on g4 can target f4 and h2, and if Black plays ... h6 be- fore gS comes, his rook will often sit on an open h-file. Let's tum to a few games (with key examples in their notes) to see how this plays out. Krasenkow - Spoelman Wijk aan Zee 2007 1 tbf3 tbf6 2 c4 e6 3 tbc3 .Bb4 4 g4 This common move-order is equivalent to I c4 tbf6 2 tbc3 e6 3 tbf3 .Bb4 4 g4. 4 ... h6 A very popular move. Black prepares to meet gS on any of the next few moves with ... hxgS, when his h-file control will be a valuable asset. Furthermore, White's h4 and gS combination (so as to recapture with a pawn on gS) takes one more move to prepare (usually l:!.gl) because of the pin along the h-file. Here are some important alternatives to in- troduce you to the ideas: a) 4 ... tbxg4?! is almost never seen, because after Sl:!.gl, White's rook gets to g7 and severely weakens Black's kingside (for example, S. .. tbh6 6l:.i.xg7 tbfS 7 l:.i.gl or S. . .fS 6 h3 tbf6 7 l:.i.xg7). b) To my mind, the sign that 4 g4 is a play- able and logical move stems from the fact that the wholly natural response 4 ... dS, themati- cally answering a flank advance with a central one, isn't very effective; in fact, leading grand- masters seem to have given up on it entirely. After S gS (D), Black has two main continua- tions.

bl) S. .. .Bxc3 6 bxc3 (Krasenkow feels that 6 dxc3 tbe4 7 .Bg2 is also better for White; this looks clear enough, with bishops, space and easy development) 6 ... tbe4. Now White can en- ter the forcing sequence 7 d3! tbxc3 8 'ifb3! d4 9 tbxd4 ~xd4 10 .Bb2 ~f4 11 ~xc3 ~xgS 12 h4 ~h6, and while 13 ~xg7 ~xg7 14 .Bxg7 l:!.g8 IS J::tgl! gave White a positional advantage in Popov-Orlov, St Petersburg 1999, 13l:.i.gl! is better still; for example, 13 ... ng8 14 .iel!? ~xh4 ISl:hg7. b2) S. .. tbe4 6 h4 (6 ~a4+ tbc6 7 tbeS is also bothersome) 6 ... tbc6 7 ~c2 fS 8 gxf6!? (8 d3! tbxc3 9 bxc3 .Bd6 10 cxdS exdS 11 ~b3! eyes dS and b7, when after 11...~e7, both 12 .i.g2 .i.d7 13 l:.i.bl and 12 hS are better for White, and easier for him to play) 8. .. tbxf6 9 a3 .i.xc3 10 dxc3 "fiIe7 (White has an unobstructed bishop-pair after 1O ... dxc4 11 e4) 11 .igS .Bd7 (l1...dxc4!? 120-O-O eS may be best, when 13 hS!? is an aggressive alternative to 13 "fiIa4) and here instead of 12 O-O-O dxc4! (Zviagintsev- Piket, Tilburg 1998), White has 12 cxdS! exdS

13 O-O-O, reducing his opponent's counterplay.

Very likely the options on moves 6 and 8 are the main reasons why Black has given up on 4 ... dS.

At this point Black's pawn-structure is arguably superior; however, he still has a problem with his retarded develop- ment.

After all these fine examples, we return to 4 ... h6 and the main game: 5 ~c2 (D) White's primary idea here is to cover the e4- square, both as a matter of general principle and in order to discourage a knight from landing there. In fact, S 1.tg 1 is more common, because White doesn't fear S. .. .Jixc3 6 dxc3. 5 ••. b6 Now S. .. dS!? doesn't work well due to 6 a3 .JiLf8 (6 ... .Jie7 7 d4 is a Queen's Gambit with accelerated kingside play for White) 7 d4liJxg4 8 .l:.g 1 liJf6 9 e4 with superb compensation in the form of space, superior development, and greater possession of the centre. 6a3 Mamedyarov-Naiditsch, Lausanne 2003 con- tinued 6 .l:tgl .Jib7 7 a3 i.f8 8 d4 d6 9 e4liJbd7 10 i.e3 a6 11 O-O-O (the big centre must give White the advantage) ll...cS 12 dS eS 13 h4 g6 14 gS! hxgS IS hxgS liJhS 16 .Jih3! i.g7 17 tlhl and White has the upper hand; one of Black's difficulties is that he can be attacked on the queenside if he goes that way. 6 ... i.e7 7 e4 i.b7 8 d4 It's true that Black's knight still watches over e4, but his bishop is no longer on b4 to help contest that square.

This is Black's most fundamental response: bring the pieces out, castle, create no weakness, and let White's gS-pawn sit out there looking lonely. Nevertheless, it cooperates with White's basic idea when playing g4-gS, which is to chase the knight from control of central squares in order to gain time to pursue his flank attack with pawns.

White has carried out his strategy of opening the g-file and aiming his bishops at the enemy king, whereas Black has managed to advance his c- and d-pawns and has the superior centre.

12 King's Indian Variations

The majority of grandmasters who open the game with I c4 or 1 lLlf3 are happy to transpose into the 1 d4 version of the King's Indian De- fence if their opponents play the King's Indian moves ... lLlf6, ... g6, ... i..g7, ... d6 and ... O-O. Why? I) There are a wealth of interesting systems to play against the King's Indian Defence. 2) There is no Reti Opening set-up (lLlf3, c4 and double fianchetto) that promises a seri- ous advantage versus the King's Indian. Nevertheless, not everyone wants to face the preparation of a dedicated King's Indian player, and I want to address two versions of the King's Indian Defence that remain in the domain of the English Opening. One is the Botvinnik System versus the King's Indian, consisting of c4, lLlc3, g3, i..g2 and e4 in some sequence. This admit- tedly won't be available to White after I lLlf3, but is used by various players via the English Opening proper. For example, I mentioned 1 c4 eS 2 lLlc3 lLlc6 3 g3 g6 4 i..g2 i..g7 S e4 lLlf6 in the chapter on the Closed English and shall look at it here. Moreover, opening sequences like 1 c4 g6 2 lLlc3 i..g7 3 g3 eS 4 i..g2 d6 might encourage White to play S e4 and face S. .. lLlf6, or S. .. lLlc6 6 lLlge2 lLlf6. Another anti-King's Indian variation is espe- cially relevant to those who employ I lLlf3 with an early c4; for example, 1 lLlf3 lLlf6 2 c4 g6 3 lLlc3 i..g7 4 g3 d6 S i..g2 O-O 6 O-O eS. Now White holds back from d4 by using the modest 7 d3. Whether or not this achieves an advan- tage, it has been played and analysed for many years and is useful for both sides to understand. Botvinnik Variation vs the King's Indian The majority of English Opening players who like the Botvinnik set-up would rather use it against a King's Indian Defence than any other. That arises naturally after 1 c4 lLlf6 2 lLlc3 g6 3 g3 i..g7 4 i..g2 O-O S e4 d6 6 lLlge2 (D):

Here 6 ... eS completes the King's Indian structure that we'll be looking at in this chapter, but take a look at the first note in the following game to clarify what the move-order issues are. Petrosian - Bertok Zagreb 1965

[diagram]
e5 This game actually began with 1 c4 eS, but I've adjusted the move-order to make an impor- tant point. Regardless of which sequence of moves White picks, it's difficult for him to avoid a Symmetrical English should his oppo- nent so choose; that is, Black can abstain from playing ... eS until White has already committed to e4 and a Botvinnik formation. Then, once e4 is played, Black can set up with ... cS instead of ... eS. For example, at this point in our game, the sequence S ... cS 6 lLlge2 lLlc6 enters the Sym- metrical Botvinnik lines (see Chapter 7). Simi- larly, with the conventional move-order' 1 c4 lLlf6 2 lLlc3 g6 3 g3 i..g7 4 .i.g2 O-O S e4, Black can play S ... cS. White needs to take this into ac- count because he either has to have a system

336 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

prepared versus ... cS variations, or he has to limit himself to playing the Botvinnik System only when Black has committed to an early B ... eS. Of course, that covers a lot of territory. Finally, Black can play ... c6 without ... eS, but these lines are less well-defined and for rea- sons of space I've concentrated upon ones that overlap with l...eS variations. 6lbge2lbc6 This is arguably the most important move, because it can occur via a number of move- orders. Instead, 6 ... O-O 7 O-O lbbd7 (or 7 ... c6 8 d3 lbbd7) places Black's knight more flexibly in return for reduced control over d4. One of his most common ideas is to play for ... bS; for ex- ample, 8 d3 (8 f4 c6 9 h3 bS! 10 cxbS cxbS has ideas of ... b4, ... Jlb7 and/or ... dS) 8 ... c6 9 h3 (9 f4 bS! gains a tempo for attack due to the b- pawn defence by .. .'iVb6+) 9 ... a6 (9 ... aS!? 10 Jle3l:tb8 has a similar look: 11 f4 bS 12 fS bxc4 13 dxc4 lbb6 14 b3 gxfS IS .i.gS dS 16 exdS cxdS 17 cxdS ~d6 18 ~h2 Jld7 19 "iVd2 a4 20 bxa4 lIa8 21 l:.abl lbxa4 22 lbxa4 .l:i.xa4 with chances for both sides, Kotov-Geller, Lenin- grad 19S6) 10 Jle3 (10 a4, to prevent ... bS, has the drawback that 1O ... aS! secures cS as an outpost for Black's knight) 1O ... bS 11 ~d2 .i.b7 12 f4 exf4 13 gxf4 .l:.e8 14lbg3 lbb6 IS a4 b4 16lbce2 as 17 b3 cS 18l:tadl 'fie7 with dynamic equality, Lein-Vasiukov, USSR Ch, Tbilisi 196617. These lines with ... c6 are impos- sible to reduce to general ideas, and most games stemming from them will take on a unique char- acter. 7 d3

7 O-O O-O 8 f4 (D) is a common way to try to

get fS in before Black has time to block the f- pawn by moving his knight from f6 and playing .. .fS. Black has to act quickly: a) He can try to compromise White's big centre by 8 ... exf4 9 gxf4 Jlg4 10 d4 lbhS, but after 11 Jle3, he can't quite seem to break it down, because 11...fS 12 eS dxeS leaves White with a clear positional plus following 13 dxeS!

7 ••• i.e6 This is a flexible move that doesn't commit the queen's knight, which can still come to c6, d7 or a6. In the last two cases the move ... c6 will be available. The main point is that by attacking c4, he forces a reaction and has time to prevent h3 by getting .. .'.\~'d7 in. Without the move h3, it's more difficult for White to play i.e3 due to ... tDg4. In addition, Black's defensive move ... i.g4 can come in handy. Not surprisingly, White has his own advan- tages in this formation. If he gets either d4 or f4 in and Black captures the pawn, then tDxd4 or tDxf4 will attack Black's bishop on e6. Also, if White plays f4, he can play fS with a gain of time, even as a pawn sacrifice. Finally, the move tDdS can sometimes be answered by ... tDxdS, but that will now come with loss of tempo due to the attack on e6. Black can play the same idea with his knight already committed to c6 (for example, from a Closed English move-order), but this doesn't seem as effective: 7 ... tDc6 8 d3 (or 8 f4; com- pare the notes in the previous game) 8 ... i.e6 (instead of 8 ... tDe8 and ... fS) 9 h3 tDe8 (9 .. :~d7 10 'iii>h2 tDhS 11 tDdS tDd8?!, Averbakh-Traj- kovic, Dresden 19S6, and now Marin suggests 12 g4! tDf613 f4) 10 lIbl as 11 a3 ~d7 12 'iii>h2 fS 13 exfS gxfS 14 f4 (D). This is Bilek-G.Horvath, Hungarian Ch, Bu- dapest 1973. Here White has constructed the

standard blockade of Black's f-pawn, which re- stricts the mobility of his pieces. We've seen versions of this position in many variations. The exchange ... exf4 would isolate Black's f- pawn after White recaptures with a piece, and ... e4 will lose material. So Black is best off maintaining the status quo in the centre and looking to improve the position of his pieces. White stands better, but his advantage is lim- ited. 8d3

8 b3 is another possibility, when White's new

idea is to prepare d4. One solution is 8 ... liJc6 9 d3 liJd7!? 10 .i.e3, and now 1O ... f5 11 exf5 .i.xf5 is only slightly better for White.

8 e4 is mentioned in the next game.

This position has been the starting point for a remarkable number of master games over the years. White sets up as he often does in the Closed English (Chapter 6). He has in mind b4-bS, in a sense 'extending' the effective reach of his favourite bishop on g2 by controlling squares along that diagonal. 8l:tbl has the addi- tional advantage of removing the rook from po- tential attacks by the g7-bishop. We looked at this type of position in the Closed English chapter at some length, but with Black's pawn on fS. I think it's fair to say that, although there are always trade-offs, the position with ... fS in is more difficult for White to fight against be- cause Black's pawn attack is well underway. One way of looking at it is that, in our variation, Black will move his knight from f6 and play .. .fS, which raises the question of whether he has not somehow lost a tempo in doing so. Naturally it's not so easy. It's true that there are many variations in which Black moves his knight and plays ... fS, but doesn't mean that those are the best variations, or that ... fS can't sometimes be a weakening move. Indeed, over the years, leading players have turned towards defending Black's queenside with pieces, and in the main lines he plays ... ltJf6-d7. Then it can be argued that Black has saved a tempo by not playing .. .fS! Which way is better? It all de- pends upon which plan you think is appropri- ate, and which you feel more comfortable with. Finally, I should note that I haven't allocated space to variations with an early ... c6; for exam- ple, 1 c4 ltJf6 2 ltJc3 g6 3 g3 i..g7 4 i..g2 d6 S ltJf3 O-O 6 O-O eS 7 d3 c6, or here 7 ... l:te8, or 7 ... h6 8l:tbl as 9 a3 .l:Ie8. In each case, Black's first, direct idea is simply ... c6 and ... dS, which is usually prefaced by protecting the e-pawn. Such lines are extremely difficult to analyse precisely, but they are respectable and involve less theory, which is perhaps an advantage in some players' minds. S• •• i..d7!? This old move is hardly used any more, al- though it really hasn't been refuted. Black wants to play .. :~c8 and ... i..h3, exchanging White's bishop on g2 and initiating an attack on the kingside. With 8 ... i..d7, he wants to save the time spent on ... h6, as in the main lines 8 ... h6 9 b4 i..e6 and 8 ... aS 9 a3 h6. Without ... h6, a bishop on e6 can be harassed by ltJgS. Of course, 8 ... i..d7 is rather passive, and a queen on c8 is less effectively placed than on d7. If Black inserts the moves 8 ... aS 9 a3 before playing 9 ... i..d7, his queen on c8 makes it diffi- cult to contest the a-file after 10 b4 axb4 11 axb4 'iUc8 12 bS ltJe7 13 i..b2 i..h3 14l:tal.

9 b4 'iVcs 10 b5ltJe7 lll:tel (D)

This classic game illustrates some fundamen- tal themes. First, we see in its most direct form the plan with ~bl and b4-bS that typifies so many variations in the English Opening. Then we see White trying to save his bishop from ex- change by playing l1l:tel, so that when Black plays ... i..h3, White can retreat his bishop to hI without losing the exchange to ... i..xfl. This costs a tempo and weakens f2, so Black's usual response will be to launch a kingside attack.

340 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

1l• •• il.h3 12 il.hlttJg4? A mistake, although it doesn't change the natural course of the game because White fails to seize upon its tactical shortcoming. The ac- curate move is 12 ... h6, when 13 ~c2 ttJg4 transposes to the game. Whether ... ttJg4 is su- perior to other plans is another matter; one drawback is that it reduces control of the centre. 13 'ii'c2? A sound move, but missing the tactic 13 ttJgS!, which attacks the bishop on h3. Then 13 ... ttJf6 14 il.xb7! 'ii'xb7 lSttJxh3 isn't a very effective gambit for Black. Apart from this technicality, White's choice of c2 for the queen is noteworthy. It would seem that b3 is a better square, guarding dS and sup- porting the potential attack by cS and b6. In fact, that's where the queen usually goes in the games below. 13•.• h614ttJd5! ttJxd515 cxd5 (D)

This is the point. Black's only weakness is at c7, and now White's queen faces it directly. 15••. f5 lS ... ttJf6 16 ~c4 .:te8, with the idea ... .:te7 and if necessary ... ttJe8, would be an admission that his kingside action was premature. Still, it would be interesting to see how White would make progress in that case. 16 il.d2 f4 Black is hoping that something will happen on that weak f2-square.

17 J:1ec1 .:tf7 18 .:tb4!

The star move. This rook not only prepares to go to c4 and further pile up on the weak pawn, but it also plays a role in defending the kingside along the 4th rank. 18••• ttJf6! Black retreats in order to attack dS, but the more so to defend c7 with his next move. 19l:tc4 (D)

A classical picture of the English Opening queenside assault. White has tripled on the c- file, and an advance by a4-aS and b6 is on the cards. Black's plan is less obvious, because af- ter his next move he has only a couple of pieces in the attack. 19••• ttJe8 Not 19 ... ttJxdS? 20 ttJxeS!, and either dS or f7 falls.

20 a4 g5 21 il.el

White's pieces coordinate well. His bishop move protects the kingside (especially the sen- sitive f2), and prepares ttJd2-e4. Nevertheless, he needs a concrete way to proceed, and his pieces are mostly cut off from the kingside. Since Black's bishop on h3 has turned into a monster, 21 il.g2 was a sensible option. 21 ••• il.f6?!

2l...'iVg4! 22 liJd2 'iVh5 looks satisfactory, with enough danger to White's king that he has to pay attention. 22 liJd2 i.d8?

8 e4 is usually frowned upon with this dispo-

sition of pieces. White has constructed a Bot- vinnik System pawn-structure, but his knight on f3 blocks his f-pawn (as opposed to having it on the normal e2-square). That really isn't such an awful circumstance, but since Black can move his knight and be ready to play .. .f5 him- self, he can equalize rather easily. Giinthner- Uhlmann, German Ch, Bad Wildbad 1993 pro- ceeded 8 ... liJh5 9 i.g5! f6 (9 ... i.f6 is a sound alternative) 10 i.e3 i.e6 11 h3 liJe7 (reintro- ducing the idea of ... c6 and ... d5) 12liJd5 c6 13 liJxe7+ 'iVxe7 14liJel 'iVf7 with a level game. In this line, 8 ... a6 with the idea ... b5 is also attractive, because White's usual counterbreak with f4 isn't on hand.

[diagram]
Black plays this move far more often than not, and it goes well with the defensive system that he chooses for this game. 9a3 White naturally tries to enforce b4. 9 ..• liJd4 (D) 9 ... h6 is the focus of the next game. Throughout the years, this knight incursion has proven frustrating to White. It eliminates some of the force of White's queenside attack and prepares central expansion with ... c6 and ... d5. The possibility of ... c6 is also useful in preventing White's knight from becoming set- tled on d5. Finally, if White exchanges the knight on d4, Black hopes to use his open e-file in conjunction with ... i.g4 to cause White some problems. As for White, he can take some comfort in the fact that the attack by ... f5 is put on hold, which means that he can shift his forces to the queenside and centre without fear. Black has expended a tempo on ... liJd4, so that gives White some extra time to expand on the queenside. Be- cause of the simplification that ... liJd4 promises, he can also play i.g5 followed by i.xf6, hoping to simplify the game and reduce Black's control over the crucial e4- and d5-squares. This makes the assumption that his knights will be better than Black's passive dark-squared bishop. How- ever, that kind of imbalance tends to be only a temporary advantage. 10b4 a) It might seem natural to kick the black knight by 10 e3 liJxf3+ 11 i.xf3, but after

11...c6, there's no stopping ... d5 without con-

cessions; for example, 12 b4 (12 e4 i.e6 13 b4 axb4 14 axb4 d5) 12 ... axb4 13 axb4 d5 14 b5 i.e6 15 'iVe2 ~d7 16 i.b2l:.fe8 and, because of her greater central control, Black was slightly better in Schoenberger-Dworakowska, Krynica 1995. b) 10 liJxd4 has proven harmless; for exam- ple, 1O ... exd4 11 liJb5 (White doesn't achieve anything by llliJd5 c6 {11.. .a4!? has also been played, to hold up White on the queenside} 12 liJxf6+ i.xf6 13 e4 dxe3 14 fxe3 a4 with a dull equality, Norwood-Iten, Zug 1987) ll...liJg4 (or ll...liJe8 with the idea ... c6) 12 h3 c6 13 hxg4 i.xg4 14liJxd4 i.xd4 15 'iVd2 ~d7 16 b4 axb4 17 l:txb4 l:tfe8 18 e3 i.g7 19 i.b2 and nothing special was going on in Christiansen- Smyslov, Lone Pine 1976. c) 10 i.g5 (D) is the most important alterna- tive.

342 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Black's advantage of two bishops will be set against White's attack on the queenside. Razu- vaev-Ikonnikov, Geneva 1994 continued 1O ... h6 (10 ... liJe6 11 .i.xf6 i.xf6 is also possible) 11 i.xf6 i.xf6 12 b4 axb4 13 axb4 i.g7 (there doesn't seem to be any hurry about this, be- cause ... fS isn't in Black's plans for a while, so 13 ..

The course of the game demonstrates how the timing of this move is slightly flawed. But Black has probably already equalized. There are two main options: a) 13 bxc6 bxc6 and now 14 liJxd4?! still doesn't inspire following 14 ... exd4 IS liJe4 liJxe4 16 i.xe4 'iVd7 with the idea ... dS, as in Anikaev-Tal, Minsk 1979. 14l:!.el and 14 e3 would be better tries. b) A particularly interesting variation from a positional point of view comes from the game that initially made the i.gS plan popu- lar: 13 i.gS i.xf3 14 i.xf3 h6!? (not bad, but 14 .. J~.a3! would equalize after IS ~c1 ~aS16 :tal .l:ta8, and here ISliJe4liJxf3+ 16 exf3 dS gives Black the larger share of the centre) IS i.xf6 liJxf3+ 16 exf3 i.xf6 17 bxc6 bxc6 18 lIb7 (D).

This is White's idea: light-square control combined with possession of open queenside files, with a good knight versus a (tempo- rarily) bad bishop. Still, Black's mobile centre is a countervailing factor and White has long- term weaknesses. Andersson-Nunn, Johannes- burg 1981 continued 18 ..

Here are two of the several alternatives: a) 13 ... c6 14 i.a3l:te8. Black removes him- self from the potential pin from the bishop on a3, in part because he would like to play ... dS in certain lines; if he can do so and White is un- able to break down the centre, there's no reason to think Black hasn't equalized. Black also has the idea of ... lDfS and perhaps ... lDd4. Bareev- Bacrot, Sarajevo 2000 continued ISlIfc1! (the natural IS lDd2 allows IS ... dS!, because eS is no longer attacked) IS ... gS?!

White's system with c4, lDc3, lDf3, g3, i.g2 and d3 provides a way to avoid the King's In- dian Defence proper (that is, lines which nor- mally arise from 1 d4), and it can be played against the Closed English as well. If White hasn't committed to lDf3, then the Botvinnik System is a worthwhile alternative. Index of Variations A: I c4e5 B: I c4 c5 C: I c4 lLlf6 D: Other openings referred to in the text

INTRODUCTION 11

'universal' systems associated with 1...d6 and 1...tDc6, to which considerable attention has been devoted in recent years. The ideas expressed are also 'universal', in the sense that both the struc- tures and strategies strongly overlap with those of mainstream openings. In the first two volumes of this series, my general approach was to give broad and instructive ex- amples without becoming too entwined in details. For many of the currently contested English Opening systems in Volume 3, however, I made extensive theoretical investigations, and was able to contribute much that was new. In this volume, I find that the existing theory on many of the lesser-played variations is strange and limited, so it has been easy add my own suggestions, correc- tions and analysis throughout. The reader can do the same, that is, expand upon theory and find new paths through these little-explored regions. That's where the fun comes in. As in previous volumes, I've focused upon move-order issues to a greater extent than most open- ing book authors do. In my own and my students' playing experience, their neglect has caused a lot offrustration and sometimes inferior results. You're probably familiar with the experience of head- ing for your favourite opening, when suddenly your opponent exploits a tricky move-order and di- verts you into a line with which you're unfamiliar and/or uncomfortable. I'd rather bore the reader with tiresome details than allow those moments to occur too frequently. At some point, you actually have to decide which openings to choose, and what to do with them. I've devoted a lengthy chapter to opening selection, preparation and study, with concrete methods of improving your opening play. In my experience, how to go about these things depends upon your playing level, something that isn't always taken into account. Hopefully my many years as a chess teacher will be helpful in that regard. I've tried to reach a very broad audience, from the developing student to the relatively sophisti- cated and experienced player looking for new ideas and analysis. I hope there is enough of value here to assist both of them in becoming better players.

1 Reti: Open and Closed Variations

tlbf3(D)

We begin this last volume by exploring the move I lbf3 and the Reti Opening. Right off, I lbf3 develops a piece towards the centre and prevents 1.. .eS. It resembles I c4 in that it leaves open major decisions about what kind of centre White wants to build; for example, he can still play c4, d4 and e4 in any combination. This gives him the choice of transposing into other openings depending upon what Black does. For instance, by playing I lbf3 White may simply be side-stepping I c4 eS while heading for an English Opening via 1 lbf3 cS 2 c4. In other cases, he may be preparing to enter

[diagram]
lbf3 lbf6 2 d4, leading to a number of other d4 openings. 1 lbf3 cS 2 e4 is a Sicilian Defence, and you will also find 1 lbf3 as the introduction to the King's Indian Attack, which consists of the additional moves g3, .Bg2, O-O and d3 (see Chapter 6). The name 'Reti Opening' is used to describe different variations depending upon which book you're reading. As I define it, the Reti Opening arises after 1 lbf3 dS 2 c4, although those moves don't have to be played immedi- ately. That is, in order for the opening to be a Reti, White has to play lbf3 and c4, and Black ... dS. To distinguish the Reti further from other openings, I'll stipulate that White doesn't play d4 at an early stage (that is, not before White completes most of his development). In the vast majority of cases, he fianchettoes one or both of his bishops. In fact, some books examine only variations with the double fianchetto, as prac- tised by the opening's most famous advocate, Richard Reti himself. I'll include positions with a single fianchetto or no fianchetto at all if they are relevant to specific move-orders. t ... dS This is Black's normal path to the Reti Open- ing. After 1 lbf3, the players can also arrive at variations of the Reti by 1...e6 2 c4 dS or 1...c6

2 c4 dS. Of course, Black has many other possi-

bilities' such as 1... lbf6, when 2 g3 bS!? is an example of the kind of leeway that Black is given by the non-committal 1 lbf3. Black fre- quently plays 1...cS, when he is probably hop- ing for 2 e4 (a Sicilian Defence) or 2 c4 (a Symmetrical English Opening). If White re- plies to 1. .. cS with 2 g3, the game might con- tinue in any number of directions; for example, a King's Indian Attack (after .Bg2, O-O and d3), a Symmetrical English Opening (after c4), or, less frequently, a Closed Reti Variation (with ... cS, ... e6 and ... dS in response to White's c4 and a fianchetto on either wing; see below). Other nuances are best shown by example.

2 c4 (D)

RETI: OPEN AND CLOSED VARIATIONS 13

White attacks the centre. As described above, he will fianchetto one or both bishops, with g3 & .tg2 and b3 & .tb2 in the majority of varia- tions. Most openings, even those of a largely positional nature, contain several major lines that are unavoidably tactical. The Reti Opening is an exception, in that almost all its set-ups in- volve long-term manoeuvring. Because White avoids moving a centre pawn, there tends to be little early contact between the opposing forces. White fails to provide Black a target, and with some exceptions Black will also avoid too ag- gressive a commitment of his pieces. In most important variations, Black does establish a sig- nificant pawn presence in the centre. White's strategy is to snipe at his opponent from the wings, and eventually to expand on the queen- side or in the centre. In broader terms, this is the 'hypermodern' strategy, a name which proba- bly needs updating, since it came into general usage in the 1920s! After 2 c4, the game can still transpose into other openings, of course, notably if White plays d4. Since each variation leads to distinct positional themes, I'll discuss them as we go along. The 2 ... d4 Advance w Khuzman - A. Mikhalevski Beersheba 1993 Ilbf3 d5 2 c4 d4 (D) This aggressive push is one of the traditional and most important replies to the Reti Opening, and has always had a good reputation. In fact, some players prefer to make the Reti move c4 only after Ilbf3 d5 2 g3 e6 3 c4 or, say, Ilbf3 d5 2 g3 c6 3 c4 (or, if he doesn't want to gambit his c-pawn, he will wait with c4 for a few moves), or after an early b3 and .tb2. Black's motivation with 2 ... d4 is territorial gain. You may recognize that this position bears a close resemblance, with colours reversed, to the Modem Benoni (1 d4 lbf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5) should Black play ... c5 next; and to the Schmid Benoni (1 d4lbf6 2lbf3 c5 3 d5 and 4lbc3) if Black plays ... lbc6 (without ... c5). In several variations we shall see illustrations of reversed positions in which White's extra tempo gives Black the information that he needs to adjust strategies and maintain equality. That trade-off has been a theme throughout these volumes, and is explicitly featured in Chapter 6. 3g3 An obvious alternative is 3 e3 (D), introduc- ing one of the very few Reti Opening lines in which White will not normally fianchetto a bishop as part of his strategy.

This e-pawn advance isn't seen as much as 3 g3 in grandmaster play because Black is thought to gain an uncontroversial equality. On the other hand, the resulting play has enough substance to keep good players interested: a) 3 ... c5 4 exd4 cxd4 5 d3 is a reversed Benoni, intending g3 and .tg2. That opening boasts of dynamic options versus almost any set-up, so it's probably best for Black to avoid it when he is a tempo behind. b) 3 ... dxe3 has been a bit underrated. To be sure, after 4 fxe3 Black has surrendered the

14 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

centre to White (who has a 2-1 majority), but a d3/e3 pawn-formation isn't terribly impressive unless the pawns can both advance. The stan- dard line is 4 ... g6 S d4 i..g7 6 lDc3, and now 6 ... lDh6!? has the idea of ... lDfS, so Gausel- Mortensen, Copenhagen 1996 continued 7 e4!?

After 7 ... O-O!? (7 ... cS would attack the vul- nerable d4-square at the cost of a cramped game following 8 dS) 8 i..e2!? (8 i..f4) 8 ... i..g4 9 i..e3 (9 dS) 9 ... i..xf3? (9 ... fS is best) 10 gxf3 White threatened 11 1i'd2, winning the knight. Then Dunnington suggests 1O ... eS 11 dS fS, but 12 h4 looks extremely strong, with space, two bish- ops and an attack. Obviously, both sides have many options in such flexible positions. c) The simplest course is 3 ... lDc6 4 exd4 lDxd4 SlDxd4 'ii'xd4 6lDc3 (D).

White has failed to get an advantage here for many years, although there is plenty of content in the position, and play for both sides. I'll just show an excerpt from the most popular modern main line: 6 ... c6 (preventing lDbS or lDdS; 6 ... eS

7 d3 lDe7 has been played for at least 70 years

without being completely resolved; it's fair to say that the game is unbalanced but equal) 7 d3 lDh6!? (headed for fS) 8 i..e3 (after 8 i..e2, 8 ... lDfS 9 g4lDh4 10 l::tgi is a known line; then 1O .. :i!t'd6 11 l::tg3 eS 12 lDe4 1i'd8 is unclear; Black has also played 8 ... g6) 8 ... 1i'd8 9 i..xh6!? gxh6 10 d4 i..g7 11 dS, Zviagintsev-Granda, Pamplona 1995/6. Here Black's bishop on g7 compensates for his weaknesses; he can play, for example, Il...1i'd6 or Il...1i'b6. We now return to 3 g3 (D):

3 ... lDc6 This is easily Black's most popular move, but not his only one. a) 3 ... cS is playable, giving White an inter- esting decision. He can play 4 b4, with a re- versed, tempo-up Benko Gambit. This is an appealing practical choice, because the tempo is definitely helpful in most, if not all, lines. Moreover, the variation is more difficult for Black to play than White. It would be a useful exercise for the reader to compare the position after 4 b4 with the Benko Gambit itself, which is dealt with in Chapter S. White's other main option is 4 i..g2 lDc6 S O-O eS 6 d3. Then he usually plays the moves e3, lDa3-c2, l::teI, a3 and l::tbi in some order, in order to chip away at Black's centre by b4 and a timely exd4. Black can counter with any of several formations, but one consistent feature of the position is that exd4 gives Black the option of ... exd4, which tends to be safer than the Benoni-style recap- ture with ... cxd4. You will see a true reversed Rffm: OPEN AND CLOSED VARIATIONS 15 Benoni with ... cS in our section on 1 liJf3 dS 2 c4 e6 below, when Black follows a main line and plays ... cS and ... d4. b) Grandmasters have shown some liking for the move 3 ... g6. Then Larsen-Chandler, Hastings 1987/8 provides a good example of the play: 4 i..g2 i..g7 S d3 eS 60-0 liJe7 7 b4! O-O 8liJbd2 (or 8liJa3, with the idea liJc2 and either queenside expansion or a central break by e3; this leads to original positions) 8 ... aS 9 bS cS! (Black shouldn't cede too much ground) 10 bxc6liJexc6! (the idea is that the knight on e7 has few prospects, whereas the knight on b8 can watch over cS from a6 or d7) 11 i..a3 (D) (11 l:!.b1 is the obvious alternative; Black has satisfactory play in this kind of position be- cause of his ability to put knights on b4 and/or cS as needed).

ll...liJb4 (or 11...l:!.e8, introducing the idea of ... i..f8; then White might try to target squares like d6 and b6 by 12 cS, having in mind liJe4 and 'Yi'b3) 12 Wib3 liJ8a6 (a good alternative is 12 .. :iVe7 with the idea ... liJ8a6 or ... liJ8c6) 13 i..xb4 axb4?! (13 ... liJxb4 is better) 14 a3! bxa3 IS "iVxa3l:!.e8 16l:!.fb1 and White had a pleasant advantage, very much in the style of a Benko Gambit, and not even a pawn down! 4 i..g2 e5 (D) 50-0 In the reversed position (picture Black's knight already developed on f6), d3 is usually met by ... i..b4+, to force a piece to d2. That strat- egy is also a sensible one here; for example, S d3 i..b4+ 6 i..d2 (the idea is that after 6liJbd2 i..d6, White can no longer play liJa3-c2, but 6 liJfd2 would certainly be possible, retaining the w option of liJa3-c2) 6 ... aS; Black might play ... liJf6-d7-cS later. Naturally, there are trade- offs. For one thing, White is developing rapidly and getting castled ahead of time. It's an open question whether he can break with e3 or b4, and what advantage that might bring. 5 •.• liJf6 There's an interesting parallel here with the Schmid Benoni line 1 d4liJf6 2liJf3 cS 3 dS g6 4liJc3 i..g7 S e4 (a position also important to the Sicilian Hyper-Accelerated Dragon: 1 e4 cS 2liJf3 g6 3 d4 i..g7 4 dSliJf6 SliJc3) S ... O-O (as opposed to S ... d6) 6 eS liJe8. If you've played that line with either colour, you might well think that S. .. e4 6liJe 1 (D) would favour White in our game because of the vulnerability and likely decimation of Black's centre.

But that's not necessarily the case. Black has two possibilities: a) 6 ... liJf67 d3 i..fS 8 i..gS (perhaps White should settle for 8liJd2, when Black has a slight positional disadvantage after 8. .. 'iVe7 9 dxe4

tLlxe4 or 8 ... exd3 9 tLlxd3 iLe7 10 tLlb3 O-O 11 iLf4) 8 ... exd3 9 tLlxd3 iLe7. At this point, in- creasing the light-square pressure by 10 tLld2 is not terribly impressive following 10 ... O-O, when 11 iLxf6 iLxf6 12 tLle4 l:tb8! anticipates White's tLlecS, and 11 ~a4 tLlg4 12 iLxe7 ~xe7 is about equal. Therefore the recommended move is 10 b4!? (D).

This position is said to be clearly better for White, and it certainly looks promising with the cooperation of a queenside advance and the bishop on g2. However, Black's centralized pieces provide a counterweight. Here are some options: a1) 1O ... iLxd3? 11 exd3 iLxb4 12 iLxf6! gxf6 (after 12 ... ~xf6? 13 ~b3! White either wins a piece or exposes the black king) 13 'iVhS with a large positional superiority and attacking possibilities. a2) 1O ... tLle4 illustrates Black's central pres- ence: 11 iLxe7 ~xe7 12 iLxe4 iLxe4 (D), and then: w a21) 13 bS and now 13 ... tLlaS!? 14 tLld2 O-O IS tLlxe4 ~xe4 intending ... l:.fe8 and ... b6 is dynamically balanced. Black can also sacrifice a pawn for activity by 13 ... tLleS 14 tLld2 tLld7 IS tLlb3 O-O-O 16 tLlxd4 hS!. a22) 13 tLld2 O-O (13 ... iLfS 14 bS and here 14 ... tLlaS IS ~a4 b6 is unclear, while 14 ... tLld8 is safer) 14 tLlxe4 'iixe4 IS bS tLleS (or lS ... tLlaS) 16 tLlcs 'iig417 tLlxb7 l:tfe8 with compensation. a3) Kovacevic-Ree, Karlovac 1977 contin- ued 1O ... a6 11 tLld2 O-O 12 iLxf6 (12 a3 ':e8!) 12 ... iLxf6 13 tLle4 'iie7 (or 13 ... l:te8) 14 tLlxf6+ 'iixf6 IS a3 (D).

Here Black has several moves (such as the ambitious continuation lS ... hS), but lS ... l:tfe8 is the most consistent; for example, 16 l:te1 .l:!.e7 17 tLlcs l:tae8!, with the idea 18 tLlxb7? (18 iLxc6 bxc6) 18 ... d3 19 e3 tLld4 20 .l:!.a2 tLlc2 21 l:tn ~c3. b) Strange to say, even after 6 ... fS!? (D), a seeming overextension of forces, Black's posi- tion isn't necessarily inferior. w

RF:I'I: OPEN AND CLOSED VARIATIONS 17

Theory gives this fifth pawn move a '?' with the follow-up 7 d3liJf6 8 i.gS, but then 8 ... i.e7! 9 i.xf6 i.xf6 10 dxe4 fxe4 11 i.xe4 i.h3 gives Black compensation for the pawn after 12 i.g2 .txg2 13 'iitxg2 (13liJxg2 gS! 14liJd2 'fie7 and ... O-O-O, intending ... hS) and now 13 ... hS! 14 liJd3 h4 or 13 .. :~d7 14liJd2 hS. White can play 12 liJg2 instead, after which Black might try 12 .. :ii'd7!? 13liJd2 O-O-O with the idea 14 'iWa4 l:.he8! IS i.xc6 'it'xc6. The point of all this is that White's capture of the e-pawn takes valu- able time while Black has the extra space to jus- tify ... O-O-O and ... hS-h4.

Let's return to S ... liJf6:

6 d3 (D)

6 ... i.e7 Generally, this move has been criticized be- cause of White's response. There are other moves, such as 6 ... i.d6, but the most important is 6 ... aS, when 7liJa3 is sometimes played with the idea of liJc2, l:.bl, a3 and M. Such positions are fascinating from a strategic point of view, and may appeal to those who want to play chess without immediate confrontations. However, the main line is 7 e3, attacking the centre. Then Black can try: a) 7 ... i.e7 8 exd4 exd4 9liJa3 (D). al) Now 9 ... i.xa3 10 bxa3 is a kind of trade that we've seen in several openings, sometimes when White captures a knight on a6. In con- junction with a fianchettoed bishop on g2, a rook on the b-file will generally more than compensate for the doubled a-pawns, which tend not to be a weakness until the endgame in any case. When White also gains the bishop- pair without giving Black's knights a major

outpost, the overall assessment will normally be in favour of White. a2) Black played 9 ... O-O in Speelman-Humpy Koneru, British Ch, Torquay 2002, which con- tinued 10 liJbS liJe8 11 l:.el i.e6 12 b3 i.f6 13 i.b2 (now Black is tied to the pawn on d4, so she can't move her c6-knight and play ... c6) 13 ... g6 14 'it'd2 i.fS IS h3 hS 16 i.a3?! (the su- perior 16 h4! plans liJgS, to clear the long diag- onal for White's g2-bishop, and in some cases to settle in on the strong e4-square; for exam- ple, 16 ... 'it'd7 17 liJgS a4 18 i.a3 liJd6 19 'iWf4; 16 'it'f4!? is another idea) 16 ... liJM! 17liJbxd4!

The Open Reti w Danailov - Bernard Warsaw 1990 1liJf3 d5 2 c4 dxc4 (D) Capturing on c4 opens the position, hence the name 'Open Reti', also called the 'Reti Ac- cepted'. By this means Black resolves the prob- lem of having to defend a structure with ... e6 and ... dS, or ... c6 and ... dS, which he may feel is a cramped one. His d-file is open, and there's a good chance of establishing a healthy restraint of White's d-pawn via ... cS or ... eS. 3liJa3 For White, 3 liJa3 is arguably the course tru- est to the spirit of the opening, since fianchettoes will follow. This development of the knight to the rim is also seen in the Catalan Opening and a couple of other Reti variations, with similar trade-offs. Of course, this is not the only way to recover the pawn; let's look briefly at alterna- tives: a) 3 e3 will usually transpose to a Queen's Gambit Accepted after 3 ... liJf6 4 .lixc4 cS S d4.

b) 3 'it'a4+ can lead down independent paths or in some cases transpose to a Catalan Open- ing.

Two alternatives for White are 8 .i.gS and 8 .i.f4liJg6 9 .i.e3. Both sides have a lot of leeway in interpret- ing this variation.

w Reti, White often doesn't move his e-pawn anyway. S••. i.b7 6 g3 tbd7 A natural and good move. At first, 6 ... i.xf3 7 exf3 (D) looks tempting, because Black will put a piece on d4 in front of the isolated d- pawn.

But the combination of White's better de- velopment (notice Black's kingside pieces), the strength of his bishop coming to g2 and his attack on Black's weakened queenside prove more important than his weaknesses.

White has played in true Reti style. The nc2 and li'al manoeuvre goes way back to the open- ing's creator and namesake. White's pieces all have good range, but Black has pawn control of the centre. Neither side can claim an advantage yet.

The Closed Reti ItDf3 d5 2 c4 e6 (D) w This is the Closed Reti Opening, the most consistently played variation of the Reti over the first few decades of its development, and

24 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

still very popular. This is due in part to the fact that English Opening players, when faced with

1 c4 e6, frequently want to avoid a transposi-

tion into the Queen's Gambit Declined by 2 d4 d5 or 2 ltJc3 d5 3 d4. Thus, after 1 c4 e6, they play 2 ltJf3 d5 and go into a Reti Opening via 3 g3 or 3 b3. Still another possible move-order is 1 c4ltJf62ltJf3 e63 g3 (or 3 b3) 3 ... d5. Not sur- prisingly, the Closed Reti is characterized by slow manoeuvring. Both sides tend to develop their pieces conventionally, with White fian- chettoing both his bishops and Black playing ... ltJf6, ... i.e7, ... O-O, ... b6 and ... i.b7 and usu- ally setting up a moderate-sized centre with ... c5. You will see that, barring the exchange cxd5, both sides' rooks can stay uninvolved in the fray for a long time, and their optimal place- ment is difficult to determine until the early middle game or later. 3b3 The main line that we're heading for can be reached if White begins with either fianchetto; for example, 3 g3 ltJf6 4 i.g2 i.e7 5 O-O O-O 6 b3 c5, etc. Black has unique options, however, after 3 g3 ltJf6 (or immediately 3 ... dxc4) 4 i.g2 dxc4 (D) (4 ... i.e7 5 b3 transposes to the main Reti lines). w I can't do justice to the large and disparate body of theory and practice here, but both sides should look out for these possibilities: a) 5 'it'c2 (the similar 5 'it'a4+ is less flexible because after 5 ... ltJbd7 6 'i!kxc4 {or 6 ltJa3} 6 ... c5, the queen will have to move again; the- ory indicates an equal outcome) 5 ... ltJbd7 (not the only move, of course) 6 ltJa3 c5 (6 ... i.xa3 7 bxa3 ltJb6 8 ltJe5 O-O 9 i.b2 may give White a small edge because of his bishop-pair) 7 O-O (or 7 ltJxc4 b5 8 ltJce5 ltJd5 9 ltJxd7 i.xd7 10 b3 i.e7 11 i.b2 O-O 12 O-O, Polugaevsky-Serper, Tilburg 1992, and now 12 ... f6 followed by ..

Strategically, Black either plays for a queenside attack via ... as-a4 and ... ltJd7-cS, or, if White plays d4, he will ideally get in the free- ing move ... cS. For his part, White will try to use his greater mobility and the slight weaknesses in Black's camp. The classic example is Botvinnik-Bis- guier, Hastings 1961/2: S d3 (since S cxbS or S

Now it looks as though Black has achieved all of his goals and will free his game, but White has pre- pared a trick: 14 b4! (D).

Whatever Black does, White will be able to close the position temporarily and then make use of his space advantage: 14 ... cxb4 (14 ... dxc4? is a bad error due to IS dxcS 'iVc7 16 a4! a6 17 axbS axbS 18 :ta7, when along with ideas such as ttJd4, White threatens 19 ':'xb7!

Very nice.

7.i.b2

Delaying i.b2 with 7 e3 has good and bad points; the idea is that in Benoni-like positions with ... d4, White's bishop is often better-placed on c1 than b2. For one thing the bishop on b2 blocks White's support of a b4 advance by a rook on b1; furthermore, a bishop on c1 might find an influential post on f4 or even support the move f4 if Black plays ... eS. After 7 e3 ttJc6 8 iile2, Kourkounakis-Botsari, Aegina 1995 pro- ceeded 8 ... d4 ?! 9 exd4 cxd4 10 ttJeS !? ttJxeS 11 iilxeS ttJd7! 12 ~e2. Now Black should proba- bly play 12 ... eS 13 d3 l:.e8 14 ttJd2 ttJcS, con- ceding White just a small edge after IS ttJe4 due to his mobile queenside majority and a powerful bishop on g2. Unfortunately for White, the absence of a bishop on b2 allows Black to contest eS by 8 ... dxc4 9 bxc4 eS!, with the idea 10 ~b2 ~fS!, If that's satisfactory for Black, then the text-move is preferable. Thus we return to 7 i.b2 (D):

This is the traditional main line of the Closed Reti, and arguably of the Reti Opening as a whole. Black now decides where to put his queen's knight, what to do with his bishop, and whether to play for ... d4. Let's see some games.

RETI: OPEN AND CLOSED VARIATIONS 27

The Reti Benoni McNab - A. Norris Scottish Ch, Aberdeen 2001

O-O 6 O-O c5 7 iLb2 ttJc6 I haven't used the exact move-order of the game because I want to mention a frequently- used move-order, 7 ... b6 8 e3 iLb7. This will transpose to one of our main lines if Black plays 9 ... ttJc6 or 9 ... ttJbd7 (after 9 'iVe2, for example); see the following game. In this case, however, Black can't play the ... d4 variation that he does here.

8 e3 (D)

Over the years, White has settled upon this move as the main line. 8 cxd5 comes too early to cause Black real problems: 8 ... exd5 (or S. .. ttJxd5 9 ttJc3, when 9 ... iLf6 10 'iVc1 ttJxc3 11 iLxc3 e5 was Reti-Griinfeld, Teplitz-Schonau 1928, while 9 ... b6 with the idea ... iLa6 is also fine) 9 d4 ':'eS 10 ttJc3 iLg4 11 dxc5 iLxc5. Here Black has the kind of active play he doesn't get in the main lines, when his bishop is on b7 in- stead of g4.

[diagram]
In the next game we'll see the safer 8 ... b6. Other moves are seen much less often, although several are playable. Generally, if left to his own resources White can play 'iVe2 and an early d4 (often after cxd5), or in some cases d3 and e4, with some pull. It's worth mentioning that S. .. dxc4 9 bxc4 'iVd3 can be met by 10 'iVb3 with a superior position should Black exchange queens. 9 exd4 cxd4 (D) w Initially only a small minority of players were willing to test this position as Black, since it looked too much like a Modem Benoni with colours reversed in which Black wouldn't be able to play ... e5 successfully. 10 ':'el ttJe8! This retreat became the main line after some bad experiences with slower moves. Tal-Zhur- avliov, USSR Ch, Kharkov 1967 continued 1O ... lIeS 11 a3 a5 (12 b4 must be prevented) 12 d3 iLfS (12 ...

White's pres- sure on the queenside and superior develop- ment (all but one of Black's pieces are on the first rank) guarantee him the advantage. Notice that in this line White doesn't solve Black's problems for him by 16 iLxb7?! iLxb7 17 ':'xb7 ttJc5 IS :b5 :b8!.

28 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

By contrast, 1O ... tiJe8 prepares to support d4 by ... f6 and ... eS while covering vulnerable squares inside Black's camp. 11 d3 White can play more ambitiously by 11 tiJeS tiJxeS 121:.xeS f6 131:.el eS (or 13 ... tiJc7 14 f4 nb8 with the idea ... bS, which is hard to assess) 14 f4!

2004. White has sacrificed a pawn for excellent

piece pressure. 18 ... SLd6!? looks best, when Kosten suggests 19 SLxd4 tiJc7 20 SLf3 SLxg3

21 SLf2!. Then if 21 ... SLxf2+ 22 ~xf2, White's

central pawns, combined with the e-file and temporary pressure on b7, are at least the equiv- alent of Black's three passed pawns. Similarly,

21.. .SLf4 22 d4 gives White good chances, es-

pecially in view of 22 ... tiJe6 23 SLxb7! SLxb7 241:.xe6. Overall, this line looks like a promis- ing way for White to go. 11 ... f612 tiJa3 (D)

12• •• e5 13 tiJc2 Although ... tiJbd7 is common in the Modem Benoni, here we see White playing the alternate Benoni plan tiJa3-c2 in almost every line, be- cause b4 (or at least the threat of b4) is neces- sary in order to keep Black on the defensive and counteract his space advantage.

13. .. tiJc7 14 'i'd2

White supports the move b4 and clears his back rank. This does use up the d2-square for a knight redeployment, but tiJd2 isn't necessarily a good idea anyway. Instead, 14 tiJh4! ? (D) is a strange-looking but promising move that tries to provoke Black into weakening his kingside with ... gS, and then attacking it with h4.

This is an idea that appears in the King's In- dian Defence as well as the Modem Main Line of the Benoni. Since f4 is a positional threat, Black 'cooperates': 14 ... gS IS tiJG. Now White is ready to play h4; apparently, he needn't be in a hurry to make progress in such positions since he faces few threats. Here are two examples: a) IS ... SLe6?! 16 tiJfxd4 (this seems a good spot for 16 h4! g4 17 tiJh2 'i'd7 18 'iVd2 as 19 'iVh6) 16 ... exd4 (16 ... tiJxd4 17 SLxd4 exd4 18 :xe6 tiJxe6 19 SLdS 'iVb6! 20 'iVe2 ~h8 21 'iVxe6!

SLfS seems more accurate: 16 'i'e2 SLg4 (16 ... 1:.f7! covers the second rank to quash any tactics; then 17 h4 g4 18 tiJd2 is hard to as- sess) 17 h3 SLhS?! (17 ... SLe6) 18 g4 SLg6 19 tiJfxd4! tiJxd4. Now the safest move is 20 SLxd4 !le8! 21 SLb2 SLxd3 22 'iVd2; then Black has his share of the centre, but White has the threat of SLxb7 and moves like tiJe3 and 1:.adl in store. In- stead, Kosarev-Bets, Peterhof 2006 continued 20 tiJxd4!? SLb4 21 tiJfS SLxel 221:.xel SLxfS?! (22 ... 1:.b8 23 SLe4) 23 gxfS l::.b8, when White should have opened lines for his rook by 24 h4! gxh4 2S f4! exf4 26 'iVg4+ Rh8 27 'i'xf4 with two bishops, an attack and d4-dS-d6 in reserve. Sometimes White plays 14 a3 as, when IS 'iVd2 transposes to the game, while IS1:.bl has also led to many tough battles.

w This kind of pawn-structure, common to this variation and the Modem Benoni, would be fine for White if he didn't have his dark-squared bishop, because he could challenge for the a- file.

Since there are as yet no open lines, the question of how to activate rooks becomes of interest. Black tends to centralize with .. J:td8, opening the d-file by ... dxc4 when the timing is right; his other rook might go to b8 to support ... a6 and ... b5. White sometimes beats him to the punch with cxd5 and then places rooks on el and dl, hoping for an effective d4. Another

An excellent game for the student to play through. 10 bxc4lbc6111i'e2 (D) This has been the starting point for hundreds of games. White is reserving the right to play d3 or d4. He can put his rooks on cl and dl, or dl and bl (leaving the queen's rook on the queen- side to restrain ... bS) or he can leave the king's

rook on f1 to support a kingside pawn-storm. In fact, much of the time that White succeeds di- rectly out of the opening, he does so with some version of f4-fS or g4-gS and transferring his pieces towards the black king. Conversely, having played ... dxc4, Black doesn't have to worry about cxdS diverting his pieces and can get to work in the centre and queenside. It's generally important to exchange off White's light-squared bishop, which other- wise might participate in a central or kingside attack. Generally, ... a6 and ... bS are key moves for Black's counterplay, opening lines on the queenside or driving White's pieces away. 11,..l::tc8 The most common move is 11...~c7.

2 Reti: Slav Variations

Ilbf3 d5 2 c4 c6 (D) w A broad complex of positions can arise from ... c6/ ... d5 structures in the Reti Opening. Right away, I should put them in context. In playing

2. .. c6, Black indicates that he is happy to con-

test a Slav Defence, which White can immedi- ately enter into by 3 d4. The most common alternatives to that move are 3 g3 and 3 b3. White sometimes plays a combination of e3, ~c2, lbc3, b3 and Si.b2, but the 'purest' Reti set-up is the one followed by Reti himself: a double fianchetto. How White can achieve that and whether Black permits him to are the first questions both sides must consider, because there are so many early changes of direction that might spoil their respective plans. The question of how to react to a Slav move- order also arises in the English Opening, and it's worth a digression to talk about how White should respond after 1 c4 c6. Again, he can play

lbf3 d5, transposing to this chapter. I should mention a third option, 2 e4 (equivalent to the Caro-Kann line 1 e4 c6 2 c4), when after 2 ... d5 3 exdS cxd5, 4 d4 is a Caro-Kann Panov Attack. He can also play 4 cxd5, which can reach typical isolated queen's pawn positions after 4 ... lbf6 and 5 ... lbxd5, though White has independent options such as 5 ~a4+!? and 5 Si.b5+. If Black wants to avoid all this, he can also try 1 c4 c6 2 e4 e5, but that has its own set of prob- lems after 3 lbf3, and is quite rare. The inter- ested reader will have to dig around in books and databases. Sticking with the 1 c4 c6 English Opening for a moment, Tony Kosten points out that the move-order 2 g3 d5 3 Si.g2 (D) has some posi- tive features.

First, this move frustrates Black's desire to play ... Si.g4 without committing his knights: 3 ... Si.g4? 4 cxd5 cxd5 5 "i/Vb3 attacks d5 and b7, and 5 ... "i/Vc8 (threatening the bishop on cl) only staves off material loss for one more move, 6 lbc3, because 6 ... e6?? loses to 7 "i/Va4+! and 8 ~xg4 (keep your eye out for this trick, which occurs in several openings). Therefore, after 1 c4 c6 2 g3 d5 3 Si.g2, Black might want to try 3 ... lbf6 4lbf3 Si.g4, but this transposes into a version of the Reti main line below (llbf3 d5 2 c4 c6 3 g3lbf6 4 Si.g2 Si.g4) in which White can play the effective move 5 lbe5. Contrast this with the sequence Ilbf3 d5

2 c4 c6 3 g3 Si.g4 4 Si.g2, when Black can

choose 4 ... lbd7, preventing lbe5. So by playing 1 c4 and 2 g3, White has reached a Reti System and bypassed the popu- lar set-up with both ... Si.g4 and ... lbd7. Of course, there are always trade-offs. After 1 c4

Following 9 ... e5 10 a3 b5 11 axb4 bxc4, he recommends 12 ~e3!, attacking e5 and a7 while in some cases playing an effective :ta5. So far, so good, but a possible problem is that Black can play 9 ... e6 instead, which sets up a nice restraint pawn-structure that goes well with the good bishop on f8. 9 ... e6 also works tactically in the line 10 a3 b5 11 axb4 bxc4 12 'iVc3liJf6 with the idea 13 J:.a5 c5. This last position is hard to assess, but at any it's not a clear improvement for White over the lines beginning with 2liJf3. Instead of Kosten's 4liJa3, McDonald likes 4liJf3, giving the gambit line 4 ... b5 5 a4 ii.b7 6 b3! cxb3 7 'iVxb3 (actually, 7 axb5 cxb5 8 'iVxb3 seems to favour White slightly as well) 7 ... a6 8 ii.a3 with strong play. One issue in that case is whether other fourth moves like 4 .. . ii.e6 and 4 ... liJf6 are better. For example, after 4 ... liJf6, we've transposed to 3 g3 liJf64 ii.g2 dxc4 be- low. I have gone somewhat far afield to describe these ramifications of 1 c4 c6 2 g3, but they could be of considerable interest to English Opening players as well as those who prefer the Reti Opening. Let's return to lliJf3 d5 2 c4 c6. The mate- rial expands quickly, as White has multiple moves at every juncture and Black several re- plies to each. With the warning that I shall only The System with ... i..g4 Miroshnichenko - Mammadov Baku 2006 lliJf3 d5 2 c4 c6 3 g3 (D) We are used to weighing the differences be- tween 3 g3 and 3 b3 when White is planning to fianchetto both bishops. But his intention in this game is to forego b3 with other ideas in mind. A drawback to doing so is that he allows ... dxc4 without being able to recapture with the b-pawn, but a significant benefit is that his queen is free to come to b3 or a4, something that happens consistently in the variations of this game and the next. White will also delay liJc3 for some time so as to steer clear of attack by ... d4, as well as to reserve to right to play liJbd2 or liJa3.

3 ••• liJf6 Black doesn't commit his queen's bishop, which can go to f5 or g4.

36 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

w As you can quickly work out, this basic and popular position can arise via other move- orders. Having played ... i..g4, Black is free to follow up by ... e6 without shutting in his bishop, something he is forced to do in many 1...dS openings. While he has several ways to proceed, Black's most common and in many ways ideal set-up is ... liJbd7, ... e6, ... i..d6 and ... O-O, with ... eS to follow at some point. Occasionally, he is more ambitious and plays ... liJbd7, ... i..xf3 and ... eS straightaway, which saves a tempo, but is riskier because it cedes the bishop-pair and leaves his d-pawn only loosely defended. The move ... i..xf3 fits in well with this general idea of central expansion, particularly if White uses the extra tempo h3 to encourage it. That said, h3 can also be answered by ... i..hS. You can see why many players like the flexibility and im- balance that the ... c6/. .. dS systems can provide. White has his own opportunities, of course. A significant drawback to 4 ... i..g4 is that it takes a defender away from Black's queenside. White will very often try to exploit its absence by playing ~b3, hitting the dS- and b7-pawns, or ~a4, tying up Black's pieces on that side of the board. Another issue is that White can play liJeS, attacking Black's bishop on g4. Note that liJeS, c4, liJc3 and i..g2 all either directly or indi- rectly attack Black's central and queenside light squares, which means that Black can easily lose material if he isn't careful. What's more, a fur- ther pawn-break by e4 can cause additional damage. SliJeS This leap of the knight disturbs the balance by attacking the bishop on g4; White also steers clear of ... i..xf3. Obviously, this needs to be done before S ... liJbd7 is played. On the other hand, Black allows this move for a reason: the knight on eS isn't defended and can be swapped off by ... liJbd7 with a gain of time. A little sim- plification won't hurt Black, who temporarily controls more space. Of course, White can still go into the double fianchetto lines by S b3 (which has its own sec- tion below; see, for example, the game Pod- zielny-Dautov), but other slow moves have generally been unimpressive because they don't do enough about Black's basic plan. For one thing, Black threatens S ... i..xf3 6 i..xf3 dxc4, winning a pawn that is not easy to recover. If White plays S cxdS, Black often responds with S ... i..xf3 6 i..xf3 cxdS, on the grounds that he now has the ideal square for his knight on c6; here S ... cxdS 6liJc3liJc6 is another respectable option. So we can see the reasoning behind S liJeS, which is the critical move. Thus we return to SliJeS (D):

S••• i..hS?! Since White intends to play liJxg4 followed by e4, Black removes his bishop from capture. a) The retreat by S ... i..fS occurs less often, but it's a legitimate continuation. Then 6 cxdS cxdS 7liJc3 (7 ~a4+!?) can be met by 7 ... liJc6 with the idea 8 liJxc6 bxc6 9 ~a4 i..d7, or 9 .. :ii'd7. Otherwise, 7 ... e6 8 ~a4+ liJbd7 9 g4 i..g6 transposes to a position from this game. b) The most important alternative is S ... i..e6 (D), which may well be the best defence. Black threatens ... dxc4, in some cases fol- lowed by ... i..dS or ... ~d4. As one might expect, White has many ways to react. Unfortunately, they aren't related thematically, so if you are

w interested in this line for either colour you'll want to do some work. Here are a few ideas: bl) 6 'iVb3 'iVc7 is easy for Black because White is so far from getting his pieces out that he can't exploit the queen's placement along the c-file.

Apparently Black can't equalize against 7 "iVb3, indicating in tum that S. .. .i.hS is slightly suspect. Black's bishop on hS or g6 is cut off from the rest of the action, as often happens in the Slav Defence. 7 "iVa4+! 7 ttJc3 isn't quite as forcing, but tends to lead to some advantage. A good example is 7 ... ttJc6 (7 ... e6 8 g4 .i.g6?1 9 h4 .i.d6 10 d4 is very awk- ward for Black) 8 ~a4 ~d6 9 d4 ~b4 10 ttJxc6 "iVxa4 11 ttJxa4 bxc6, Kosten-Shirazi, Sautron 200S, and here 12 .i.f41 e6 13l:!.c1 with the idea of ttJcS must be good, especially in view of 13 ... .i.b4+ 14 .i.d21 .i.xd2+ IS ~xd2, when White doubles by l:!.c3 and ::'fc1, and can play e3 and i.f1, if needed, to win material on the queenside. 7 ..• ttJbd7 8 ttJc3 e6 9 g4 .i.g6 10 h4 (D)

We've seen this advance in many openings; the basic idea is that Black can't provide an es- cape-square for his bishop by moving his h- pawn, because ttJxg6 would be positionally di- sastrous for him. 10 •. :i!i'c7?

Let me just pres- ent some of the more dynamic ideas: 3 e3lbf6 4 lbc3 (4 ~c2 e6 S b3 lbbd7 6 .i.b2 .i.d6 7 lbc3 transposes; naturally, there are alternatives) 4 ... e6 (among many options, Black has 4 ... .i.g4, 4 ... .i.fS and 4 ... a6; the last is a modern way to treat many Slav Variations; for one thing, it means that lines with "iVb3, hitting the b-pawn, can be answered by ... bS or even ... lla7) 5 b3 lbbd7 6 .i.b2 .i.d6 (6 ... .i.e7 7 g4!? is promising, since 7 ... lbxg4 8 J::i.g1 followed by llxg7 recov- ers the pawn, and incidentally weakens Black on the a1-h8 diagonal) 7 'iic2 O-O 8 .i.e2 (D).

We have arrived at a system that Black plays versus the Colle Attack, but with colours re- versed and White having an extra tempo. At this point things can get surprisingly tactical: a) 8 ... eS?! is slightly premature because of another typical idea from the Semi-Slav: 9 cxd5 and after 9 ... cxdS 10 lbbS .i.b8 11 llc1 White

has the dual ideas of iLa3 and liJc7. Instead, 9 ... liJxdS 10 liJe4 i.c7 allows White to play the fun and dangerous attack 11 liJegS g6 12 h4!. b) 8 ... dxc4 9 bxc4 eS and now 10 O-O favours White slightly because of his centre pawns, but the sacrifice 10 g4!? is more fun: 1O ... liJxg4!? (lO ... liJcs 11 gS liJfd7 12 h4 is double-edged) 11liJe4 i.c7 12l:tgl fS 13liJegS, and instead of 13 ...

(this is a popular pawn sacrifice in similar positions; White's first idea is gS, driving the knight from the centre, fol- lowed by O-O-O and a kingside pawn-storm) 9 ... liJxg4 10 l:tglliJgeS llliJxeSliJxeS (Wojta- szek-Cichocki, Dzwirzyno 2004) and here Kos- ten suggests 12 O-O-O!, giving the sample line 12 ... dxc4 13 f4! cxb3 14 'iVxb3 liJg6 IS liJe4 with a powerful attack; for example, IS ... i.b4

Obviously, White won't always get such dy- namic play from the slow build-up with e3, 'iVc2, b3 and liJc3, but in any case the game is unbalanced and both sides should know some- thing about it. d) 8 ... a6 9 ':'gl!? bS 10 g4 b4 (after lO ... bxc4, Gurevich suggests 11 gS! cxb3 12 axb3 liJe8 13 i.d3 with threats) 11 gS! liJe8 12liJa4 'VJIJe7 13 h4, M.Gurevich-Kallai, Bundesliga 200112. White has a dangerous attack, but the position is obscure. 3 ••• liJf64 i.g2 i.f5 (D) w Black develops his bishop before cutting it off by ... e6. As always, the players can arrive at this basic position via different move-orders, and this game in fact began 1 liJf3 liJf6 2 g3 dS 3 i.g2 i.fS 4 c4 c6. By putting the bishop on the active square fS, Black avoids getting hit by liJeS, as in the last game, but also loses the op- tion of ... i.xf3, which makes a successful ... eS less likely. Since Black's queenside is defended by one less piece, White will bring his queen to b3 and try to combine pressure on dS with that on b7. 5 cxd5 This is the most popular choice, although there are two major alternatives. One is to play into a traditional Reti set-up by S b3 e6 6 O-O liJbd7 7 i.b2; compare the double fianchetto game below. The other is S O-O, when S. .. dxc4 is a respectable move that transposes to 4 ... dxc4 S O-O i.fS. Instead, if Black plays S ... e6, 6 d3 has a bit more to it than may first appear: 6 ... i.e7 (the structure after 6 ... dxc4 7 dxc4 'ili'xdl 8 ':'xdl liJbd7 9 liJc3 favours White slightly; he wants to gain the bishop-pair by liJh4, and 9 ... i.b4 lO i.d2 renews that idea, intending to answer 1O ... h6?! with 11 liJbS! cxbS 12 i.xb4 as 13 i.d6, after which the bishops rule) 7 i.e3!? (D).

Quite a few games have arrived at this posi- tion. White is playing one of Black's favourite set-ups with colours reversed (that is, in the London System with 2 liJf3 and 3 iLf4 versus the King's Indian Defence). White's idea is that after 'ili'b3, Black won't be able to reply with ... 'iVb6, and if Black's queen moves to the c-file, a speedy cxdS, liJc3 and l:tel will create strong pressure down that file. With care, Black should be able to keep his disadvantage to a minimum, but the game stays

One possible reply is 6 O-O e6 7 d4 with a supe- rior central position. Then Black cannot pre- vent e4 forever; for example, 7 ... iLe7 (7 ... ttJd7 8 ttJbd2!? ttJ7f6 9 ttJe5 iLb4? 10 e4! iLxd2 11 exd5 iLxc1 12 dxc6!, etc.) 8 ttJe5 iLg6 9 e4 ttJb6 (9 ... ttJf6 10 ttJc3) 10 ttJc3 O-O 11 h4!, and h5 can only be stopped by a compromising se- quence such as ll...iLf6 12 ttJxg6 hxg6 13 e5 iLe7 14 h5! gxh5 15 "fixh5, with White threat- ening iLe4, 'iti>g2, .l:.hl, and also simply ttJe4. Returning to the game (after 5 cxd5 cxd5), we see that the position has a similar structure to the Exchange Slav. However, the placement of White's bishop on g2 in the Reti gives the po- sition a different character. Although White has taken an extra tempo to develop it, the bishop won't normally be exchanged, as it is after iLb5 or iLd3 in the Slav.

In Vilela-Alarcon, Ha- vana 2007, White responded with the direct 12 liJb5 (after 12 a3 a6, the standard idea 13 e4! gives White the upper hand, especially after 13 ... liJc5 14 'l'c2 iL.g6 15 b4) 12 ... liJc5 13 'l'dl 'l'd7 14 liJbd4 liJxd4 15 liJxd4 iL.g6 16 b4 liJa6 17 a3, and the a6-knight is restricted by White's queenside pawns, so he has something to play for. 12 liJe5!? The pawn sacrifice 12 e4 also leads to the better game. Black should accept the pawn, al- though it comes at the cost of exposing his pieces and ceding the bishop-pair: 12 ... dxe4 (12 ... iL.g6 13 exd5 exd5 14 d4 favours White) 13 dxe4 liJxe4 14 liJxe4 iL.xe4 15 liJe5 liJxe5 16 iL.xe4 liJc6 17 .l:.fdl 'l'c8 18 'i'a4.l:.d8 1911xd8+ 'l'xd8 20 iL.xc6 bxc6 21 'iWxc6 with an edge for White, Barcza-Smyslov, Moscow Olympiad 1956. 12• •. liJxe513 iL.xe5 iL.g614 e4 (D) A much later game, Pigusov-Lin Weiguo, Beijing 1996, saw the seemingly slow 14 h3, to prevent ... liJg4. There followed 14 ... .l:.fc8 15 e4 dxe4 16 dxe4 with a central superiority for White. A prophylactic move such as 14 h3 is possible since Black has no way to create threats or change the pawn-structure in one move.

After the text-move (14 e4), White has the initiative and Black's bishop on g6 is shut out of the game. 14•.• .l:.adS The situation becomes tactical after 14 ... liJg4 15 iL.f4 dxe4 16 dxe4 e5 17 liJd5! .l:.fc8 (or 17 ... exf4 18 l:tc7) 18 iL.h3! iL.d6?

Unfortunately, the material is lim- ited on the latter move, but clearly S ttJxc4 (again, S ttJxeS?? loses to S ... i.xa3) S ... e4 6 ttJgl ttJf6 can't please White, so S ~c2 should be examined. 4 i.g2 dxc4 (D) w Accepting the gambit. This main line is very important if we are going to assess the Reti Slav as a whole. White is a pawn down, and if he can't recover it or has to make concessions in doing so, this whole move-order becomes suspect. As we shall see in the next game, it's also not easy to bypass this position via earlier deviations. 5~c2 Over the years, this move has probably had the most success and is recommended in two English Opening repertoire books. Not only does White target the pawn on c4, but he stops ... i.fS and stays flexible in terms of playing ttJa3, O-O and/or a4. However, White has run into quite a few difficulties, so finding an alternative could be important. Fortunately, there are at least three candidates. They have a good deal of theory behind them, so I'll try to indicate the outlines and trust you to look into the material more deeply: a) S O-O (D) is fascinating, because White gives Black extra time to consolidate his pawn. The consequences are still unresolved.

Black has an array of options, each unique, with few unifying themes among them: al) S ... i.fS 6 ttJa3 eS!? 7 ttJxc4 (7 ttJxeS?? i.xa3 8 bxa3 'iVd4) 7 ... e4 8 ttJgS!? (or 8 ttJfeS) 8 ... h6 9 ttJxf7! 'iii>xf7 10 'iib3 'iii>e8 11 ~xb7 ttJbd7 12 'iYxc6 :c8 13 ~a4! i.e6 (13 ... 'iii>f7)

14 b3 i.xc4 IS bxc4 ~b6 with no clear resolu-

tion in sight, Salov-Piket, Amsterdam 1996. a2) After S ... i.e6, the forcing sequence 6 ttJgS i.dS 7 e4 h6 8 exdS hxgS 9 dxc6 ttJxc6 10 ttJa3 has been assessed as unclear. Instead, 6 'i!Vc2 ~dS !?, with the idea 7 ttJc3 "ii'hS, resem- bles other lines with ... 'iYdS; it should be fine for Black. a3) S ... bS 6 a4! (D) is risky for Black.

With 3 b3, White makes sure that ... dxc4 doesn't win a pawn. For our purposes, this will introduce a plan with .Jtb2, g3 and .Jtg2. Depending upon what you think of Black's alternatives in the next two notes, you may prefer other ways to get to the starting point of this system. Our move-order from the previous games is 3 g3 tLlf6 4 .Jtg2 (or 4 b3, but this still allows the trick 4 ... dxc4 S bxc4 eS!?; compare the next note) 4 ... .Jtg4 (or4. .. .JtfS) S b3.

(D). w The idea is 5 ttJxe5?? 'it'd4. By this means, Black achieves a central pawn presence that White lacks. The idea invites comparison with 1 ttJf3 d5 2 c4 e6 3 b3 dxc4 4 bxc4 e5!, in which Black is a move short from our current position, but that extra move ... c6 prevents Black from playing ... ttJc6. Both positions are playable. At any rate, White has to develop quickly; for example, 5 ttJc3 (5 ~b2!?) 5 ... ttJd7 (D), and now: w a) 6 d3 ttJgf6 7 ~b2 ~d6 8 g3 gives Black easy play after 8 ... ttJc5 9 ~g2 O-O 10 O-O ~f5. b) 6 e3 is sound, although d4 is hard to enforce without concessions; e.g., 6 ... ttJgf6 (D) (the alternative 6 ... ~b4 7 'it'c2 'it'e7 8 ~b2 ttJh6!? 9 ~e2 ttJf6 10 O-O ~f5 would be an in- teresting sequence, with an eye on d3, but also to a kingside attack via ... e4). w 7 d4!?

That's a lot of analysis, but taken as a whole, 3 ... dxc4 4 bxc4 e5! presents White with prob- lems to solve, enough to call into question his ability to gain an advantage. Remarkably, this little two-step manoeuvre hasn't been given se- rious consideration in the extensive literature on 3 b3. What's more, the same idea a move later might be even more challenging in this re- spect, since White's options are more limited. 4i.b2 The most frequently played move by a con- siderable margin is 4 g3, because White likes to stay flexible about the placement of his queen's bishop, but then he again has to deal with 4 ... dxc45 bxc4 e5!

In a majority of games involving the double fianchetto and ... J..g4, White plays e4 at some moment and this pawn-structure results. The combination of e4 and c4 has a mixed effect. From White's point of view, the gaping hole on d4 is clearly a negative, although in practice it proves difficult for Black to occupy. Further- more, his king's bishop is restricted by his own centre pawn on e4. On the positive side, that same pawn supports a knight on f5, which will be very powerfully placed. Black's problem is that if he exchanges the knight by ... J..xf5 (often necessary), then exf5 reopens the g2- bishop's diagonal and White's e-file, while clearing what is effectively an outpost square for White's pieces on e4. In fact, that's what happened in the game after 14 ... :fd8?! (Vagan- ian prefers 14 ...

3 Modern Kingside Fianchetto

The fianchetto is used in three general types of central environment. Thus far in this series, we have seen it in a variety of well-established openings of two of these types. In the first case, a central presence is employed in conjunction with a fianchetto. For instance, in the Griinfeld Defence Black plays 1 d4 liJf6 2 c4 g6 along with a central break C3 ... dS), whereas in the Modem Benoni, Black's ... g6 is joined with ... cS. In the English and Reti Openings, White's g3 fianchetto combines with a pawn on c4, whereas in most major d-pawn openings, White can merge the same g3 with the central move d4. In a second set of mainstream openings, there is no central pawn presence, that is, no early break or pawn on the fourth rank. Some examples are the King's Indian Defence and Pirc Defence, in which Black plays ... d6. It's true that he often follows this with a central ad- vance by ... eS or ... cS, but not within the first few moves. This also applies to the Queen's In- dian Defence with ... b6, where the moves ... dS and ... c5 are usually delayed. However, notice that in most lines of these openings, Black de- velops quickly; in particular, his king's knight is developed to f6, controlling e4 and dS and making kingside castling more convenient. This adds an element of safety and contests the cen- tre of the board. In a third class of fianchetto defences, still looked at askance by some masters, Black fore- goes commitment to either a central break or a strong central presence, often playing without a knight on f6 or c6. The most prominent exam- ples begin with l...g6 and l...b6, which can both be played versus any first move by White and may therefore be considered 'universal' openings. In most variations with these moves, Black allows White to choose from a wide vari- ety of central formations. Thus l...g6 and l...b6 grant Black flexibility, but do the same for White. The defences initiated by l...g6 and l...b6 appeared sporadically in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, but by and large leading players disapproved of them. After all, why should Black want to give White space and an ideal centre without a fight? The 'Hyper- modems', beginning in the 1910s, proposed that targeting the centre from afar by means of a fianchetto was a legitimate alternative to set- ting up a traditional centre. But even they usu- ally included a pawn on the 4th rank in their plans, or at least quick development. See, for example, the Reti Opening from the previous chapters. Then, in the latter part of the 20th cen- tury, many players discovered that they were comfortable operating with less space, particu- larly if there were opportunities to extend the range of their fianchettoed bishops by eventual pawn-breaks, or to exploit concessions that White might make to prevent that from happen- ing. Thus 1.. .g6 in particular was elevated into the mainstream, and 1...b6, while not wildly popular among high-level players, has attracted the attention of a number of grandmasters. The overriding issue in both cases is whether White can use his greater territorial control to clamp down on Black's game. For the developing player, there is a lot to be learned by playing such positions from both sides and watching these conflicting goals play out. Before plunging into l...g6, I should note that White can himself pursue such a strategy by means of 1 g3 or 1 b3, allowing Black to set up a large centre, when the tempo derived from moving first gives him some extra ways to de- velop. In practice, 1 g3 often transposes to other openings. For example, it can lead to the Reti Opening if White follows with liJf3 and c4, to the King's Indian Attack if White plays liJf3 and d3, or to various d-pawn openings if White plays an early d4. At a grandmaster level, how- ever, White plays 1 g3 infrequently, because Black is able set up conservatively if he wishes, without a big centre, and establish equality relatively easily. 1 b3 can run into the same problem, but it has a more defined history of

MODERN KINGSIDE FIANCHETTO 57

independent theory which I'll be examining in the following chapter. The Modern Defence

1 e4 g6 is called variously the Modem Defence,

the King's Fianchetto Defence, the Rat, the Robatsch, and the Utjelky. Perhaps that's a re- flection of its multi-faceted nature; in fact, the move 1...g6 tells us little about the kind of the game that will follow. Both White and Black can deploy their forces in a wide array of for- mations that bear little relation to one another, and the play can go in almost any direction. Thus, in what follows, I'll concentrate upon a selection of the most popular responses to 1. .. g6, with an emphasis on black pawn-structures that haven't been well represented in the rest of this series. From White's point of view, the normal cen- tral set-ups apply, but we'll begin with what is arguably the most important one, involving the centre d4, e4 and f4. This is a direct threat to the playability of 1...g6, more so than the other broad centres that we have examined, for exam- ple, in the King's Indian Defence, the Pirc De- fence, or the Samisch Variation of the Nimzo- Indian. Let's step through some themes that arise from early moves, and then take a look at the problems arising from that central structure.

[diagram]
Obviously 1 d4 g6 2 e4 i.g7 leads to the same position. Curiously, Black has often played 2 ... d6 at this point, because there are lines in which he'd rather get on with a queenside at- tack instead of putting a bishop on g7 yet. Since White plays i.e3, 'iVd2 and i.h6 in many lines, Black may even save a tempo by not playing ... i.g7. That's rather abstract, but he might also be motivated by a specific sequence, that is, 2 ... d63 tLIc3 c6 4 f4 (D), the set-up White uses in the first three games. Then 4 ... i.g7 transposes to the main games, and Black also has these options: a) 4 ... 'iVb6 prevents S i.e3 and puts pressure on the d4-pawn, but Black must be careful in the face of White's attack; for example, S i.c4 i.g7 6 tLIf3 tLIh6 (6 ... i.g4? 7 i.xf7+) 7 i.b3 i.g4 S i.e3 dS, Bologan-Azmaiparashvili, Eu- ropean Clubs Cup, Panormo 2001, and here

White can play simply 9 'iWd2! dxe4 10 tLIgS! O-O 11 h3 i.cs 12 g4 and O-O-O with the centre, development and much better placed pieces. b) The most subtle move is 4 ... d5! with the idea S eS hS!?, intending to develop his pieces on kingside light squares, a typical sequence being 6 tLIf3 tLIh67 i.e3 i.g4 S i.e2 tLIfS 9 i.f2 e6 (D). w This is precisely the position arising from the game Hector-Hei below, which begins 1 e4 g6 2 d4 i.g7 3 tLIc3 c6 4 f4 dS S eS hS, etc. In that game, however, Black is a tempo 'ahead', in that he has played ... dS in one jump rather than via ... d6-dS. Ironically, however, Black's extra tempo there is ... i.g7, which is an unde- sirable move! This bishop actually belongs on fS, from where it supports the move ... cS and can go to its best position on e7. Indeed, the move ... i.fS occurs in Hector-Hei. So, by play- ing 2 ... d6 and deferring ... i.g7, Black has man- aged to save two moves ( ... i.g7-fS) in return for his loss of only one tempo ( ... d6-dS). It's

58 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

silly things like this that make a positional player's life more gratifying! Of course, 2 ... d6 in conjunction with 3 ... c6 is itself committal, and some players may not prefer this pawn- formation if White refrains from (or delays) f4 and plays, say, lbf3 or i.e3 instead. We now return to 2 ... i.g7 (D): w 3lbc3 I'm going to focus on this straightforward knight development, which is basic to the tradi- tional main lines of the Modem Defence, and easily the most popular at every level. It also makes possible a hypermodern interpretation of the opening by Black. For example, the move ... a6 with the idea ... bS is highly relevant in lines with lbc3, and not so much so otherwise. It would be impossible to address the enormous range of possibilities that 1...g6 opens up with- out sacrificing my emphasis upon ideas and themes, but I'll give games with the moves 3 c3 and 3 c4 below. 3 ... d6 Black can also play the subtle and very popu- lar 3 ... c6; see below for illustrative games. If he wants to challenge the centre, the most the- matic move is 3 ... cS, perhaps aiming for a Sicil- ian Defence after 4 lbf3 cxd4 S lbxd4. This is infrequently played as White has two good al- ternatives: a) One is 4 dS, when after 4 ... d6 it is harder for Black to find counterplay than in the Mod- em Benoni (1 d4lbf6 2 c4 cS 3 dS e6 4lbc3 exdS S cxdS d6 6 e4 g6 and ... i.g7), because the knight on c3 is well placed to meet Black's nat- ural pawn-breaks. I won't go into the details, but the most natural continuation is S lbf3 lbf6 (D) (upon S ... eS? or S. .. e6? there follows 6 dxe6 i.xe6 7lbbS; instead, S. .. a6 is logical, but does weaken the b6-square on the queenside, and White can play the standard manoeuvre lbd2-c4; for example, 6 a4 lbf6 7 i.e2 O-O 8 lbd2 e6 9 lbc4 exdS 10 exdS l:te8 11 O-O). w The variation after S. .. lbf6 has transposed to a line of the Schmid Benoni, an opening that can arise from a wide variety of move-orders. A sample line goes 6 i.bS+!? (6 i.e2 is equally common) 6 ... i.d7 (6 ... lbbd7 7 a4 a6 8 i.e2 brings Black's queen's knight to d7, a square from which it can't do much; 6 ... lbfd7 has been played in high-level games, but White has done well, for example in the main line 7 a4 O-O 8 O-O lba6 9 l:tel lbc7 10 i.fl) 7 a4 O-O 8 O-O and White intends to play i.f4 and/or lbd2-c4 with an edge. Hundreds of games have been played with the Schmid Benoni, however, and as you might suspect, both sides have lots of ways to set up their forces. b) 4 dxcS (D) voluntarily breaks up White's centre, with the idea that Black will either lose time recovering his pawn or make concessions. This capture has been played quite a bit and there is plenty to explore. One line is 4 .. :ilVaS S i.d2 'iVxcs, when a challenging move is 6 lbdS!?, threatening 7 i.b4 'iVc6 8 i.bS!. Then there can follow 6 ... lba6 (6 ... b6 is also played, although it's riskier) 7 lbf3 (or 7 i.e3 'iVc6 8 i.d4) 7 ... e6 (7 ... i.xb2?! 8 l:tbl i.g7 9 i.xa6 bxa6 10 O-O ties Black down due to i.b4, when 1O ... aS 11 l:tbS 'iVc6 12 i.xaS works out tacti- cally in White's favour) 8 i.c3 'it>f8 9 i.xg7+ 'it>xg7 10 lbc3 and Black has weaknesses to worry about. Still, this whole line is playable.

MODERN KINGSIDE FIANCHETTO 59

4 ... i.xc3+!? S bxc3 'iVaS constitutes another trade-off: attack on White's vulnerable pawns versus dark-square weaknesses around Black's king. White can develop nonnally, but he can also temporarily hold on to his pawn with the ambitious 6 'iVd4lbf6 7 'iVM, when 7 .. :iVxM 8 cxb4 lbxe4 9 i.b2 is an ideal position for White's bishop-pair, so 7 ... 'iVc7! 8lbf3 lbc6 9 'iVa4 might follow. These lines after 4 ... i.xc3+ are particularly interesting and unresolved.

4 f4 (D)

Here we have White's most direct challenge to Black's entire system. The intent is to domi- nate the centre and limit Black's pieces. Still, playing with a large centre exposes White to more counterattacking possibilities, so things are by no means clear. One advantage of 4 f4 is that it restricts the opponent's reasonable re- sponses in a way that 4 i.e3 or 4lbf3 doesn't. 4 ••• c6 We shall see 4 ... a6 in the next section, with a note on 4 ... lbc6. Note that 4 ... ttJf6 transposes to a Pirc Defence, and indeed, a Pirc player may wish to use a l...g6 move-order to get to some of his favourite lines. However, when Black plays 1.. .g6, he has to deal with a number of ad- ditional early options by White, whereas I e4 d6 2 d4lbf6 (the Pirc) compels the defence of e4 on the second move and so limits White's choices. Most notably, the Pirc move-order 1 e4 d6 2 d4 ttJf6 3 lbc3 g6 bypasses any lines with c4 for White. After 4 ... c6 Black intends to answer ttJf3 with ... i.g4, when by the further .. :iVb6, he can put pressure upon d4, White's most vulnerable point in the centre. The attack on White's centre by ... i.g7, ... i.g4 and ... 'iVb6 is aggressive and pointed, but it carries the risks that an early queen move typically entails. If Black doesn't want to go this way, he can play for queenside expansion by ... bS, as in the note to S. .. i.g4 be- low. Slbf3 S i.e3 is also played, and worth knowing if you play either side of the popular move-order 4 i.e3 c6, because at that point S f4 transposes. A seeming drawback to S i.e3 is S. . :iVb6, be- cause b2 is attacked and the move ... eS will ex- ploit the pin on d4. But White can still try for advantage after 6 l:.b 1 (protecting b2) 6 ... eS!?

In spite of the tempo consumed by ltbl (which also precludes O-O-O), White's centre and development pose serious problems for Black:

Black's basic idea, to attack White's centre, is shown in the line 6 ..te2 'ilVb6 7 eS 4:Jh6! 8 4:Je4 O-O 9 c3.

MODERN KINGSIDE FIANCHEITO 61

l:tg5 (or 12 f5) 12 ... ~c7 13 d5, as in 1. Polgar- Crouch, Hastings 1992/3. w After the text-move (l0 ... b5), we have a bat- tle between a centralized position and a flank attack. White has no immediate threats, and Black is counting upon the lack of weaknesses in his pawn-structure (typical of positions with few pawns past the 3rd rank); ideally, his solid position will render White's advances harmless until he can himself make progress. This strat- egy runs up against the Classical school of thought, which says that the modem fianchetto defences (l...g6 and 1...b6) are simply insuffi- cient if White plays in a principled manner by constructing a broad centre, developing quickly and suffocating Black. Experience shows that Black will have many tricky ideas, mostly due to the fact that White's centre is exposed. But the true classicist trusts that these are tempo- rary problems that can be neutralized, after which his pawns and pieces will roll forward. As it happens, the outcome of the particular variation before us (with 4 ... c6 5 lbf3 i..g4) seems to support his point of view. Even if that proves the case, of course, the modernist will point to other variations in which his philoso- phy wins the day. And so it goes. Let's see how the opposing strategies play out in two illustrative games that begin with 1O ... b5. llh4 Bologan - Todor~evic Las Palmas 1993 Trusting in his broad centre and space, White launches a straightforward flank attack. 11 ••• lbb6 Black's idea is to play ... lbc4, either before or after ... b4, or perhaps ... lba4. a) It's still too early for Black to develop by ll...lbgf6?, because of 12 e5 lbd5 (12 ... lbh5 13 d5!) 13 lbxd5 ~xd2 14 i..xd2 cxd5 15 i..xb5. b) Instead, the d7 -knight can also be used to support ... c5, one example going 11...b4 12 lbe2 lbgf6 13 lbg3!? (13 .l:.gl and 13 f5 with the idea 13 ... gxf5 14l:tgl are good alternatives) 13 ... l:tb8?!

The bishop on d4 opposes Black's bishop on g7 and thereby interferes with his most promis- ing attacking possibilities on the queenside. You might want to compare openings such as the Sicilian Dragon and King's Indian Defence. Lanka-Todorcevic, Rome 1990 went 17 .. J:tg8 18 i..c4 (or 18 lbxh5!) 18 ...

12 h5 b413lbe2lbc414 'it'd3lbxe3

Black's last few moves seem to be the most logical ones, and at this point he can only main- tain his knight on the strong square c4 by allow- ing White to keep his dark-squared bishop and pursue further attacking ideas: 14 ... d5 15 i..c1 l:tb8 16 hxg6 hxg6 17 ':xh8 i..xh8 18 f5! gxf5 and while 19 lbg3 was quite effective in Kor- neev-Movsziszian, Berga 1996, even better is 19 exd5! cxd5 20 'it'xf5, threatening ~h7. 15 "'xe3 (D)

62 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

An interesting situation has arisen. At first sight, Black's position seems compact and rel- atively safe from direct attack. However, he finds it hard to develop his pieces or castle, so he has difficulty working up counterplay. This gives White time to get organized. He has vari- ous ways of improving his position such as tiJg3, f5, d5 and e5, and his bishop can go to h3 or c4. In general, the opposite-coloured bishops favour White's attack. In view of all this, Black will have trouble defending. 15••• tiJf6 Black's king is also exposed after 15 ... O-O-O; for example, 16 'ilVb3!? tiJh6 17 l:.gl e6 18 c3! bxc3 19 tiJxc3 sets up attacks based upon the open c-file and d5 breaks. Then Busemann- Vinot, email corr. 2002 continued 19 ... 'iit>d7 20 l:.g5 ~b6 21 'ilVc2 l:.b8 22 f5 exf5 23 i.h3 i.f6 24 l:.g2 lIhe8, and now the easiest course for White was 25 exf5; for example, 25 ... gxh5 26 'ilVd2 tiJg8 27 tiJe4, threatening ':xg8 among other things.

11 f5 (D)

Franzen - McAlpine corr. 1991 In some ways this is more thematic than the

11 h4 of the previous game, in that White frees

his e3-bishop for use upon the c I-h6 diagonal. The main difference is that Black is finally per- mitted to develop his g8-knight.

11 ... tiJgf6 This move wasn't advisable before 11 f5 be- cause White would have responded with e5. Here's a look at two instructive email correspon- dence games with alternative defensive plans.

This advance is eccentric (literally), but fun and respectable. Before going on to describe it in detail, let me mention two rare alternatives. The slightly more committal4. .. e6!? has been used to get to what is sometimes called the 'Hippo- potamus' set-up, which includes the moves ... b6, ... i.b7, ... g6, ... i.g7, ... ltJd7 and ... ltJe7, and sometimes even ... a6, ... f6 and ... c6! Such positions are not easy to crack and contain an elastic energy, which is to say that too hurried an advance by White can provoke a dynamic

64 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

counterattack. Nevertheless, it shouldn't sur- prise anyone that White can achieve the better game if he plays accurately. The best approach W is to advance slowly and only with support; af- ter all, Black isn't going anywhere! Probably 4 ... ~c6 (D) is the most interesting of the 'irregular' choices. w This attacks White's d-pawn. Black's idea is to reply to 5 ~f3 with 5 ... SLg4, further straining the defence of d4. Instead, 5 SLe3 opens vari- ous possibilities, induding 5 ... ~f6 (threaten- ing ... ~g4) 6 ~f3 O-O 7 SLe2, and here Davies likes the sequence 7 ... e6 8 O-O ~e7!? followed by ... b6 and ... SLb7, which is an 'improved' Hippopotamus due to Black's light-square pres- sure and possible central breaks (which is not to say that he'll achieve equality against perfect play, but you can have some fun here). In place of this, Velimirovic-Davies, Vrnjacka Banja 1991 saw 5 SLb5 (a move that Davies said drove him away from playing 4 ... ~c6) 5 ... a6 6 SLxc6+ bxc6 7 ~f3 f5!? (Davies cites grandmaster games which went 7 ... SLg4 8 O-O 'iWb8!? 9 h3 SLxf3 10 l:i.xf3 and 7 ... ~f6 8 O-O O-O 9 'iWel! with ideas of e5, f5 and/or ~4, depending upon Black's response; he rightly prefers White's chances in both cases) 8 e5 ~h6 9 'iVe2 e6 10 SLe3 O-O 11 O-O-O SLd7. Black has his pieces out, but he lacks space and his g7 -bishop is se- verely restricted. In the game, White expanded with h3, g4-g5 and h4-h5 with an excellent at- tack. For more on ... ~c6, see the next note (in which ... a6 and a4 are played before ... ~c6). Let's return to the game move, 4 ... a6 (D). It is sometimes called 'Tiger's Modern', af- ter Grandmaster Tiger Hillarp Persson, and has an even more modern feel than 4 ... c6. For one thing, Black doesn't even feint at contesting one of the four central squares. Such rook's- pawn pushes are increasingly common for both players in contemporary chess, representing a flight from some of the heavy theory associated with the traditional face-off of central pawns. These relatively noncommittal moves have a positive purpose (in this case, the support of ... b5 and ... SLb7), but they also serve a preven- tative function that can frustrate typical plans of the opponent. Here 4 ... a6 may remind you of the Najdorf Sicilian, in that it prevents SLb5. In- deed, the moves ... c5 and ... cxd4 often follow, when a very Sicilian-like position arises. Assuming that he continues with 5 ... b5, Black has played his first five moves with only one piece developed and a single central pawn mod- estly situated on the third rank. Why does he do this? One motivation is pragmatic: White's theoretically weakest point in this formation is e4 (as it is d4 in the King's Indian Defence structure with pawns on c4, d4 and e4), be- cause that square can't be defended by the f- or d-pawn. Thus both the moves ... J.b7 and ... b4 will increase the pressure on that point. Like- wise, ... ~f6 at some point attacks e4, and if White plays e5, Black can land a knight on d5, a post that is serendipitously strengthened by a pawn on b5 or b4 (because White cannot as easily play c4 to attack the knight on d5). Black might even find a way to make the move ... f5 work, perhaps after ... e6; notice that these are both moves that support the influence of Black's bishop on b7 down the light-squared long diagonal. Ultimately, Black's ideas and White's counterstrategies are hard to pin down

MODERN KINGSIDE FIANCHETTO 65

in advance, and will depend upon the opportu- nities presented by the opponent. 54Jf3 B 5 .lie3 is often played, and can easily trans- pose, for example, to the note to White's 7th or 8th move below. 5 a4, preventing ... b5, is a 'natural' response, at least for a player without a lot of experience with this system. But after 5 ... 4Jc6! (D), Black has improved upon 4 ... 4Jc6 because b5 is de- nied to a white bishop or knight, and should White play d5, Black's knight has access to M. In addition, White can only play O-O-O at the risk of exposing his king to a dangerous attack because of the weakened queenside. w The only potential risk for Black would be in the line 6 d5 4Jb4 (6 ... 4Jd4 7 .lie3 c5 ap- pears logical, but 8 dxc6 4Jxc6 9 4Jd5! targets Black's weakened b6-square) 7 a5. With this advance, White stops ... a5 and now threatens :a4 or a knight retreat followed by c3, trap- ping Black's knight. (Instead, the immediate 7 4Jbl threatens c3, but 7 ... a5! 8 c3 4Ja6leaves Black with better development, prospects of ... 4Jc5, and an extended long diagonal.) After 7 a5, however, Black stands quite securely if he plays 7 ... e6 8 .l:!.a4 c5!, as in Mikhailovsky- Hillarp Persson, Gothenburg 2003.

[diagram]
This is Black's idea: he will forego a central pawn challenge until after he develops by ... .lib7 and ... 4Jd7. Then after ... c5 and ... cxd4, Sicilian themes can arise, or the game can go its own way, as it does in this contest. 6 .lid3 (D) 6 ••• 4Jd7 Relatively noncommittal; Black would like to playa speedy ... c5 in some lines. There's no way to give a complete survey of this variation, so I'll confine myself to some examples; these will be a little dense but hopefully useful if you're in- terested in 4 ... a6. I shall be citing the games and opinions of Tiger Hillarp Persson a lot, because he is the leading contemporary exponent of 4 ... a6 in Modem Defence lines. Hillarp Persson prefers 6 ... 4Jd7 over 6 ... .lib7, when he feels that 7 a4! is good for White. This may well be so, yet the latter move is almost never played! Rather than use mountains of analysis, let's fol- low some logical moves: 7 ... M 8 4Je2 4Jd7 9 O-O 4Jgf6 (9 ... e6 allows 10 f5!, opening lines for both White's rook on f1 and his dark- squared bishop, always a dangerous proposi- tion for Black) 10 e5 4Jd5 (D). w If White can rid himself of the knight on d5, he can trust that his large, mobile centre will work to his advantage. In addition, moves such as e6 and 4Jg5 can be effective. For his part,

This strategy resembles Black's in variations of the Caro-Kann Defence (which sometimes directly transpose to these lines), the Scandinavian Defence and the Alekhine

w Defence. It seems odd to move so quickly away from the dark-square strategy that 1...g6 im- plies, but it turns out that the combination of ... g6, ... c6 and ... dS yields a solid position, whether or not White commits to a big centre. In general, the variation with ... c6 and ... dS suits players who want to play safely and not be too short of space. 4f4 Again, this is the most critical test. Indeed, f4 lines are especially appropriate versus the Modem Defence; they pose great danger for Black and at the same time are less risky than similar systems in other defences. Why? Be- cause in other lines with broad centres such as the Four Pawns King's Indian, the Exchange Griinfeld, or even the Four Pawns Attack versus the Alekhine Defence, Black's pieces generally develop more quickly than in the Modem. In the next game we shall see 4 lbf3 and 4 .llc4. 4 ... dS This move is one of the main points behind

3. .. c6: Black switches from the dark-square em-

phasis of 1...g6 and 2 ... .llg7 to a direct assault on White's light squares. In particular, White's e4-square can no longer be defended by pawns. Of course, it's not too late to return to 4 ... d6, which we saw above. S eS (D)

... hS The odd-looking advance of Black's h-pawn introduces Gurgenidze's system of develop- ment, which can also arise from the Caro-Kann Defence via I e4 c6 2 d4 dS 3 lbc3 g64 eS .llg7 (4 ... hS!? S f4lbh6 might save Black some time, but S f4 is hardly necessary) S f4 hS. Black's idea is multi-faceted. He prevents White's move

g4, which might not seem important until you realize that Black intends to put a bishop on g4, appropriately outside the pawn-chain which is about to be constructed by the move ... e6. Normally, that bishop will subsequently be ex- changed after White plays h3, when the useful- ness of ... hS becomes apparent: it can both prevent White's g4 directly and, in some cases, it will advance to h4 and restrain two pawns (on h3 and g2) with one. Black also secures an effective outpost for his knight on fS; and since the knight will prob- ably come there via h6, it's handy that the move ... hS prevents g4. It also eliminates h4-hS, a standard way in which White normally meets the combination of ... g6 and ... lbh6. Ultimately, then, Black sets up a fortress on the kingside with pawns on e6, f7, g6 and hS, daring White to expand in that sector. I should mention that Black can play other moves here. One such is S. .. lbh6, still looking at the light squares, and if White responds 6 lbf3, Black can reply with 6 ... .llg4, or even the strange-looking 6 ... f6, attacking the front of the pawn-chain (contrary to some of the old text- books, attacking the front of a pawn-chain is very often a productive way to attack it). I'm going to forego analysis of those lines, how- ever, in part because they tend to be less the- matic. 6lbf3(D) 6 .lle3 has some unique points after 6 ... lbh6 (6 .. :iib6 7 ':bl .llfS Slbf3lbh6 9 .lle2 doesn't look like what Black wants) 7 h3!?

White intends g4. 1l. .. h4 Now we have a position that has arisen many times over the years. Black logically clamps down on the possibility of g4. Given White's successes, however, we should look at alterna- tives: a) Anand-Blatny, World Junior Ch, Baguio City 1987 went 1l...ttJh4 12 iVg3 ttJf5 13 'iVf3 (13 i.xf5 h4! 14 "iVg4 exf5) 13 ... ttJh4 14 i.xh4 'iVxh4+ 15 g3 iVe7. Now White played too hast- ily with 16 g4?! hxg4! 17 hxg4 l:i.xhl+ 18 iVxhl iVb4 190-O-O iVxd4 and he lacked full compensation. Correct was 16 O-O-O! ttJd7 17 g4 (this is thematic: White wants to blast away with f5) 17 ... O-O-O 18 f5, and now 18 ... exf5 19 gxf5 gxf5 20 i.xf5 'it'b8 21 i.xd7!

(D) is in- teresting, trying to discourage White's straight- forward plan of O-O followed by queenside expansion: w bl) 120-O-O h4 (now that White has com- mitted his king to the queenside, Black should prevent g4) 13 "iVe2 (13 i.xf5 gxf5 14 ttJbl ttJd7 15 "iVe3 ttJf8! intends ... ttJg6 and perhaps ... i.h6, Alekseva-Pietrasanta, Le Touquet 2(01) 13 ... i.f8 14 "iVel i.e7 15 ttJe2!?

12 O-O ttJd7 (D)

Several top-level games have reached this point. Black has done everything right from a positional point of view: he rid himself of his bad bishop, block;lded White's centre (immo- bilizing his bishops), and established a 'one re- strains two' situation on the kingside (h-pawn versus h- and g-pawns). Nevertheless, White's record from this position has been extremely good. It's not only his two bishops that make the difference, but his greater command of territory. In combination with his lead in development, this is effective in squelching his opponent's counterplay. The position looks closed, but White will be able to operate on the queenside, and as long as he can keep lines open there, his bishops will exert a powerful influence in the long term. Similarly, any pawn-breaks like ... c5 or .. .f6 tend to open up lines for White's pieces, so Black usually has to stay passive. Finally, Black's pawn on h4 can become a target for White's pieces. Interestingly, if you look at other openings such as the King's Indian De- fence in which White's pawns on b2 and a3 are held up by the manoeuvre ... a5-a4, it will often happen that the pawn on a4 can be attacked to good effect by a queen on dl, bishop on c2 and

72 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

knight on c3. The mirror image of this attack shows up in the main game and notes below. 13b3 White anticipates playing c4. The somewhat more accurate 13 tt:Je2! has been played several times, covering g3 and freeing the c-pawn to move. Then Sivokho-Chernyshov, St Peters- burg 2000 illustrates the fundamental strate- gies: 13 ... b5!? (13 ... ii.f8 14 a4 prevents ... ii.a3 . ideas) 14 c3! (D) (preparing b3 and c4, rather than the immediate 14 b3 b4!, after which Black succeeded in contesting White's queenside ex- pansion in Smirnov-Kobaliya, European Ch, Ohrid 2001: 15 c4 bxc3 16 ~fcl! ii.f8 17 tt:Jxc3 !?, and Black could have just about lev- elled matters with 17 ... ii.a3 18 ~c2 'iVb6, based upon the tactic 19 tt:Ja4 tt:Jxd4!).

Black's position doesn't look so bad, but he lacks a plan. The game continued 14 ... tt:Jb6 (af- ter 14 ... ii.f8, one good line is 15 a4 a6 16 axb5 axb5 17 b3 with the idea c4) 15 b3 (here's the point: White has queenside play and Black has nothing equivalent; compare the comments in the main game) 15 ... ii.f8 16 ~fc1 'iWd7 17 c4 bxc4 18 bxc4 dxc4 19 ii.xc4 ii.e7 (if 19 ... tt:Jxc4 20 ~xc4, White's rooks will dominate the c- and b-files) 20 ii.a6 tt:Jd5 21 ~abl O-O, and here the most direct course was suggested by Lukacs: 22 ~b7 'iVd8 23 ii.d3! with ongoing pressure. 13 ... ii.f8 14 tt:Je2 14 a4!? would prevent the resource in the next note. 14 ••. ii.e7 This was Black's opportunity to exploit the slight weakening caused by 13 b3: 14 ... ii.a3!, and if 15 c4, 15 ... a5!. Then it's awkward for White to expel the bishop from a3 or utilize the c-file. 15 c4! (D) Neither side can do much on the kingside. White's greater control of territory, on the other hand, gives his pieces quick access to the queen- side if the play opens up there, so he is happy to advance on that wing.

15 .•• tt:Jb6 Black wants to lure White's pawns forward immediately and close the queenside. His alter- natives illustrate just how important space can be; in spite of the many strong players who have defended the variation beginning with ll...h4, it's possible that Black's position is simply lost: a) Grishchuk-Kalantarian, Anibal Open, Li- nares 1999 saw a straightforward execution of White's strategy: 15 ... 'iVa5 16 a3 ~f8 17 ~fc1 <t,;g7 18 ~h2 a6 19 ~c2 b5 20 c5 'iVc7 21 a4 l:ihb8 22 b4 bxa4 23 ~xa4 ~a7 24 ~ca2 ':ba8 25 ii.xa6 tt:Jb8 26 b5 cxb5 27 ii.xb5 and White emerged a pawn up. b) 15 ... ~f8 is perhaps the most logical move, scurrying over to connect rooks, but it hasn't done much better than the alternatives. One smooth example went 16 ~fc 1 ~g7 17 a3 tt:Jb6 18 ~h2 a5 19 c5 tt:Jd7 20 b4 axb4 21 axb4 b5! 22 ii.c2 'fIic7 (there is only one file open now, so Black hurries to make sure that White doesn't control it) 23 'iVc3 'iVb7 24 tt:Jgl!

The remarkable 3 ... dS!?, intending 4 ttJxdS c6 S ttJe3 'fixd4 or 4 exdS ttJf6 (with the idea S ..Itc4 ttJbd7 and ... ttJb6) is a speculative idea which has received recent attention. It is proba- bly in White's favour, but remains playable. You can research this in books and databases. 4ttJf3 White plays the natural developing move, aiming at the centre. Of course, there are many alternatives such as 4 i.e3 and 4 ..ItgS, and 4 h4 is certainly possible. But the popular 4 ..Itc4 (D) leads to particularly interesting play.

That directly discourages ... dS, and it puts a priority on quick development, sometimes hav- ing in mind a direct attack.

b4 7 lDce2 (or 7 lDa4, eyeing c5 and preparing a3) 7 ... cxd5 (D). w Black has played this way many times with passable results. He gives himself extra operat- ing room on the queenside and hopes to de- velop rapidly there ( ... a5 and ... .iLa6 is a natural follow-up). Nevertheless, his queenside struc- ture is a little airy: squares such as a4, a5, c5 and c6 will permanently lack pawn protection. Therefore, White should maintain some edge by gaining access to them; for example, 8.iLd2!? (the similar 8 a3 bxa3 9 I;1xa3 gives White posi- tional pressure against the queenside with max- imum flexibility) 8 ... a5 9 a3 bxa3 10 lIxa3 lDc6 11 lDf3 lDf6?!

Here White could safely play 17 ~xa5! 'ilVxa5 18 .iLxa5 with the idea 18 .. Jha5?? 191Ib8#. c) Black's most common reply is 4 ... d6 (reaching the same position as after 3 ... d6 4 .iLc4 c6). Then White's favourite independent move is the primitive 5 'ilVf3!?, in order to in- duce 5 ... e6 and create dark-square weaknesses on d6 and f6 (5 ... lDf6?! 6 e5 doesn't work out well). Then one main line goes 6 lDge2 lDd7 7 O-O lDgf6 8 .iLb3 0-09 .iLg5 (D). This curious position typifies many variations of the Modem Defence. Black has a backward pawn-structure and passively-placed pieces, but his position remains elastic and he is pre- pared to react dynamically to advances by his opponent, much as in the Hedgehog Variation of the English Opening and certain Sicilian

Defences. With that in mind, let's examine a couple of strategies: c1) Elsewhere in this book we've seen the kind of pawn-structure arising from 9 .. :~e7 10 .l:tadl h6 11 .iLh4 e5; for example, in the King's Indian Defence, Philidor Defence, and espe- cially the Pirc Defence. Nunn-Fauland, Vienna 1991 continued 12 ~e3 (White's pieces have good scope and he intends to break down the e5 strongpoint) 12 ... .l:te8!? (12 ... g5 13 .iLg3 lDh5 keeps lines closed and is at any rate safer) 13 f4! exd4 (initiating exchanges that leave White with the more active pieces; 13 ... exf4 14 lDxf4 '1t>h8 15 lDfe2 may improve, but throws Black on the defensive) 14 ~xd4 lDxe4 15 .iLxe7 .iLxd4+ 16 I;1xd4 lDxc3 17 lDxc3 .l:txe7 18 .l:txd6 lDf8 (in Nunn-Ehlvest, Skelleftea 1989, Black played 18 ... '1t>g7?!, when 19 f5! gxf5 20 .l:txf5 created two new weaknesses in his position) 19 .l:td8 b6 20 a4! .iLb7 21 .l:td6!. White has a large advan- tage, intending f5 and, under the right circum- stances, a5. c2) 9 ... b5! is more in the modem spirit: Black plays flexibly; he might want to follow up with ... b4 and ... .iLa6, or ... a5 and ... i.a6, or simply ... .iLb7. Now: c21) The forcing 10 e5!? is terribly compli- cated after 10 ... dxe5 11 'ilVxc6 .l:tb8, when a simple response to 12 lDxb5 is 12 ... .iLb7!, in- tending 13 ~c7 .iLxg2! or 13 ~c4 ~b6 with the ideas ... .iLd5 and ... .l:tfc8. So in Baramidze- Iordachescu, Dresden 2003, White played 12 dxe5 lDxe5 13 ~c5 lDfd7! 14 .iLxd8 lDxc5 15 .iLe7 lDxb3 16 axb3 .l:te8 17 .l:txa7 lDc6 18 .iLd6 lDxa7 19 .iLxb8 lDc6 20 .iLf4, and here Black's easiest course was 20 ... e5! with the idea 21 i.e3 lDd4.

c22) 10 a3 'fic7 (D) (l0. .. .ltb7 11 ':adl 'Wic7 also looks playable). w After 11 dS?! (straightforward development by 11 ':adl followed by ':fel appears best) l1...cxdS! 12 exdS .ltb7! 13l2JxbS iVcS, Black gets the pawn back with excellent activity. Rublevsky-Iordachescu, European Ch, Silivri 2003 went 14 l2Jbc3 l2JxdS IS l2JxdS .ltxdS 16 .ltxdS exdS (l6 ... l2JeS! is also good) 17 c3 l2JeS 18 'fig3 ':ab8 19 ':ab1 l2Jc4 with a nice initia- tive for Black. Instead, 14 .ltxf6l2Jxf6 ISl2Jbc3 l2JxdS 16l2JxdS .ltxdS 17 .ltxdS exdS 18 c3 l:l:ab8 19 ':abl was suggested, but then 19 ... 'fic4 20 ':fdl ':fe8 gives Black good counterplay. For example, the isolated queen's pawns can't be blockaded due to the tactic 21 l2Jd4 .ltxd4 22 ':xd4 ':xb2!. Black can fall victim to sudden attacks in these lines with 4 .ltc4 d6 S 'fif3. But some Modem Defence players like to provoke White into aggressive activity, trusting that their com- pact position can repel any rash advances. We return to the calmer 4l2Jf3 (D): 4 ... d5 5 h3 Over the years, this has become White's most popular choice. He expends a tempo, but prevents Black's plan of playing ... .ltg4 and ... .ltxf3, which is a good minor-piece trade-off in what will be a semi-closed position. After playing ... .ltxf3 and ... e6, Black is left with his good bishop and believes that his knights will be well-placed in the resulting structure. Three brief examples: a) S .lte2 .ltg4 6 eS e6 7 O-O l2Je7 8 h3 (slow) 8 ... .ltxf3 9 .ltxf3 cS (central counterattack along the lines of the French Defence makes the

knights as effective as the bishops) 10 l2JbS?! (correct in principle, but it's too time-consum- ing to try to prop up the central pawn-chain; Black has only a small edge after 10 dxcSl2Jbc6 11 .ltf4 iVaS 12 l:tel 'fixcS) 10 ... O-O 11 c3 l2Jbc6 12 l2Jd6 (White can no longer hold the centre: 12 l2Ja3 cxd4 13 cxd4 'ifb6 14 l2Jc2 l2JfS) 12 ... cxd4 13 cxd4 'iWb6 14 .lte3 and now 14 ... l2Jc8 IS l2Jxc8 l:.axc8 16 'fid2 wasn't bad for Black in Rozentalis-Blatny, Warsaw 1999, as he can break up the centre with ... f6. How- ever, he could have played the classic exchange sacrifice to destroy White's centre: 14 ... l:tad8! IS 'iid2lhd6! 16 exd6l2JfS (D). w In this position both d-pawns will fall, leav- ing Black's centre pawns unopposed and mo- bile. b) White has to be careful not to give Black a favourable French Defence in which he has exchanged off his light-squared bishop and re- tains excellent knights. For example, A.Belu- sov-Yurtaev, Seversk 1997 saw S eS .ltg4 6 h3

liJh6 (D) w This remarkable knight development is one of Black's favourite methods of working against White's structure. The point isn't immediately clear, since the follow-up ... dxe4 and ... liJfS won't normally have much impact if White de- fends his centre by c3. Instead, Black's main idea is an outrageous reorganization by ... f6 and ... liJf7! That looks like a misprint: after all, by playing in this manner Black is using valu- able tempi to block off his own bishop on g7, place a knight on the superficially uninspiring square f7, and weaken the e6-square! Never- theless, we have to remember that chess is a matter of specifics and timing. It turns out that Black's cluster of pieces on the kingside serves not only the purpose of preventing the advance eS by White, but of preparing ... eS for himself. For his part, White is happy to accept the gift of so much time, and will try to show that his op- ponent's strategy is too slow. 6 i..f4 A good, straightforward developing move. Black plays similarly versus 6 i..d3: 6 .. .f6 7 O-O 0-08 .tIel (8 i..f4liJf7 9 exdS cxdS 10 .tIelliJc6 with ... eS next is exactly what Black wants, but 8 'iVe2liJf7 9l:!.dl is a natural alternative set-up for White) 8 ... liJf7 9 b3 (D) (9 eS fxeS 10 dxeS and now 1O ... e6 intends ... cS and ... liJc6, or in some cases simply ... liJd7 and .. :fic7; 1O ... .Be6 is another way to prepare ... cS, when 11 liJd4 i..c8 doesn't leave White anything much better than l2liJf3, repeating the position).

With 9 b3, White dares Black to make use of his eccentric set-up. He has various ways to do so, none completely clear: a) It's not obvious how White answers 9 ... eS. One critical line would be 10 exdS cxdS 11 i..a3 e4! 12 i..xf8 (12liJxdS exd3 13 i..xf8 i..xf8 14 c4 is also obscure; the knight on dS may be more important than preserving a bishop) 12 ... i..xf8 13liJxe4 dxe4 14 i..xe4liJc6, and I suspect that Black's two pieces are the equal of White's rook and two pawns. b) 9 ... a6 (here Black plays a flexible move in the spirit of the Modern Defence: he covers bS in preparation for ... eS, and may be contem- plating ... bS) 10 i..b2 eS!? 11 dxeS (White can

This pseudo-sacrifice is logical. 8 ... liJa6 al- lows 9 c4 with real pressure. Then 9 ...

White adopts the classical development of his knights, as we saw in Volume 1 versus the Pirc Defence. He is satisfied with the 'ideal' two-pawn centre and follows the textbook ad- vice of bringing knights into play before bish- ops. Variations with 4 i.gS are by no means harmless, but less frequently seen.

By moving his knight first, Black supports ... c5 and perhaps ... e5, while keeping his bishop on the c8-h3 diagonal for a move, in case e5- e6 becomes bothersome. Nevertheless, 6 ... tLld7 has its own drawbacks, and we need to under- stand the implications of various move-orders. At this junction there are two natural alterna- tives: a) Black is behind in development in these ... a6/ ... b5 lines, and so both sides should be on the lookout for direct attacks. For example, an extremely important attacking theme arises in the variation 6 ... tLlf6? 7 e5! tLlfd7 (7 ... dxe5 8 tLlxe5 .ltb7 9 .ltf3!) 8 tLlg5! (or 8 e6!, since 8 .. .fxe6 9 tLlg5 attacks e6 and prepares moves such as .ltg4/f3 and .l:.el, and the common de- fensive idea 9 ... tLlf8? gets hit with 10 .ltxb5+! intending 1O ... axb5 11 'ili'f3) 8 ... dxe5 9 dxe5 and now 9 ... e6 (to prevent 10 e6) is strongly met by 10 .ltxb5!, again with the idea 1O ... axb5 11 'ili'f3. If Black instead plays 9 ... tLlxe5, he comes out on the short end of the long forced sequence 10 'ili'xd8+ ~xd8 11 f4 h6 12 fxe5 hxg5 13 .l:.xf7 .ltxe5 14 .ltxg5; for example, 14 ... tLlc6 15 .ltf3 .ltxh2+ 16 ~f2 .ltb7 17 .l:i.el .ltd6 18 .ltxc6 .ltxc6 19 .ltxe7+. b) The obvious alternative is 6 ... .ltb7, when 7 .i:!.el tLld7 transposes to the game. In order to counter this move-order, White might try 7 a4. This leads to very complicated play, with White striving for a small advantage; for example, 7 ... b4 8 tLla2 a5 (perhaps 8 ... .ltxe4 9 tLlg5 .ltb7 10 .ltf3 'ili'c8 should be played) 9 e5!? tLlh6!? 10 c3 bxc3 11 tLlxc3 O-O 12 'ili'b3. Some of these choices come down to a matter of personal style. For example, even 7 e5!? has been tried, hoping for an effective 8 e6 or 8 tLlg5. Then 7 ... tLlh6 and 7 ... e6 are solid answers, but the whole game lies ahead. We now return to 6 ... tLld7 (D):

7.tIel

Hillarp Persson asserts that White can claim superiority by 7 d5 .ltb7 (Black's game after 7 ... e6 8 tLld4! 'ili'f6 9 .lte3 tLle7 has an awkward look to it; White might play 10 dxe6 fxe6 11 f4 with ideas of e5 next, when Black is on the de- fensive) 8 tLld4 tLlgf6 9 a3, when he rightly points out that Black has trouble attacking the d5-pawn. But it's still a game, and Black can prepare a pawn-break; for example, 9 ... O-O 10 i.e3 tLlb8 (or 1O ... .l:.e8 or 10 ... 'iIi'e8, both with w the idea ... e6) 11 ~d2!?

82 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

w The position after 7 ... .1Lb7 has been the start- ing point for a good many Modem Defence bat- tles. It embodies the fight between classical and hypermodern development. S.1Lfl White moves his bishop out of the way, both protecting the e4-pawn and strengthening its potential advance to e5. In the next game we'll look at 8 .1Lg5. S•.• c5 Black begins his attack on d4. This com- pletes the plan laid out by 4 ... a6. 9a4 In the Classical Variation, this pawn advance is White's default strategy. White lures Black's b-pawn forward and then attacks it, opening lines for his own benefit. 9• •• b4 9 ... cxd4 10 ttJxd4 b4 transposes into the note above on 7 ... c5; 9 ... bxa4?! 10 l:txa4 not only re- duces the pressure on White's centre (via ... b4), but creates weaknesses on Black's queenside, notably on a5 and a6. 10 ttJd5 ttJgf6 (D) Black can't just toss out moves in this sys- tem; for example, 1O ... e6? 11 .1Lf4! was already practically decisive in the game Honfi-Vadasz, Kecskemet 1975, based upon 11...exd5? 12 exd5+ ttJe7 13 .1Lxd6 .1Lf6 14 .1Lxe7 .1Lxe7 15 d6, winning. 11 ttJxf6+ Or: a) 11 dxc5 ttJxc5 resembles a Sicilian De- fence. Then the aggressive 12 .1Lg5 is well-met by 12 ... O-O! with the idea 13 .1Lxf6 exf6 intend- ing ... l:te8 and/or ... f5, when 14 ttJxb4 ttJxe4 fa- vours Black. w b) After 11 .1Lg5 cxd4 12 ttJxd4, 12 ... h6! 13 .1Lh4 O-O 14 ttJxb4 ne8! threatens to regain the pawn on e4, which is surprisingly hard to de- fend. In response to a slow move, ... g5 or ... ttJc5 is good, so a plausible line is 15 .1Lxf6 ttJxf6 16 .1Ld3 a5 17 ttJa2 "iib6 18 c3 nab8! 19 "iie2 e5! 20 ttJb5 d5 21 exd5 e4 22 .1Lc4 ttJxd5 23 .1Lxd5 .1Lxd5 with the bishop-pair and activity in re- turn for the pawn. 11 ••• ttJxf6 11 ... .1Lxf6 seems playable as well, since the critical 12 .1Lh6 is unclear after 12 ... cxd4 13 ttJxd4 ~b6 14 c3 nc8. 12d5 White tries to shut out the b7-bishop and win space at the same time; the drawback is that Black's dark-squared bishop becomes all the more powerful. 12••• O-O 13 .1Lc4 White would like to play 13 a5, but then 13 ... e6! breaks up the centre with active coun- terplay. 13•.• a5 14 \li'd3 ttJd7 15 c3 ~b6 (D) w

White frequently places his bishop on this active square, from which point it pins the en- emy e-pawn, participates in direct attacks, and stays out of the way of White's e-file play (as opposed to 7 ~e3 or 8 ~e3, for example). From Black's perspective, the bishop doesn't defend against ... c5, and it can become isolated from the central squares if driven back to h4 by the move ... h6.

In the Modem Defence, Black always has to have a healthy respect for primitive-looking assaults; for example, 8 ... h6 9 ~h4 liJb6!? 10 a3 c5 (it's safer to attend to development by 1O ... liJf6 or 1O ... g5 11 ~g3liJf6) 11 e5!? cxd4 12 'iVxd4 dxe5 13 ~e3! ~c7?!

Obviously there are legitimate alternatives, such as 7 O-O-O i..b7 8 h4 h5 9 tiJh3, when Speelman suggests 9 ... l:tc8 with the direct idea ... c5, reinforcing both Black's attack on the queenside and his pressure along the a1-h8 diagonal. 7 ••• h6!?

This is an extremely solid set-up. The play- ers can also reach the position of the main game via 3 tbf3 d6 (3 ... c5 is the Hyper-Accelerated Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defence) 4 ~d3 (4 c3 tbf6 5 tbbd2 O-O 6 ~e2 transposes the note to 5 ~d3 below) 4 ... tbf6 5 0-00-06 c3. One of the most frequently-used non-trans- positional lines with 3 tbf3 is 3 ... d6 4 ~c4 tbf6 5 'iVe2. White has a simple idea: e5 followed by e6 and/or quick development. In many cases he clears the back rank and castles queenside. In response, Black can play 5 ... c6, to provide an anchor for his knight on d5 if White chooses to advance his e-pawn. Or, more interestingly, 5 ... 0-06 e5 tbe8 (D). w This is a strategy in the spirit of many mod- em openings: permitting White's centre to ad- vance so as to undermine and break it down. Two examples of contrasting pawn-play and piece-play on Black's part: a) 7 h3 (White tries to deny Black's c8- bishop any active squares) 7 ... c5!

The move we saw so often above, 4 ... a6, doesn't make as much sense now, because ... bS can be answered by a4; then there's no knight on c3 to be attacked by ... b4.

[diagram]
The attraction of White's formation is that the pawns on c3 and d4 blunt the influence of Black's bishop on g7. Then White can develop without having to worry over his centre. On the other hand, the formation with c3 is rather pas- sive, putting no real pressure on Black. Thus Black has plenty ofleeway in developing. There have been many games with this line over the years (as well as with White's bishop on e2 and queen's knight on d2, as in the previous note), but I'll limit myself to a popular remedy that fits the occasion: 6 ... lbc6 Although 6. .. lbbd7 planning ... eS is perfectly playable, it blocks Black's light-squared bishop and attacks nothing. By means of 6 ... lbc6, Black wants to play ... eS with direct pressure on d4, in order to force a commitment from White. Al- ternatively, Black has played 6 ... cS, planning ... lbc6 with the same end in mind. 7lbbd2 This is a natural move, yet it blocks the bishop on c1, so White sometimes waits and brings the knight to a3. To maintain flexibility, White often does that by 7 h3, because it's a move he plays in almost every line anyway, and of course it prevents ... Bg4. By looking at the lines which follow, you can see that 7 h3 usu- ally transposes. Other instructive choices: a) 7 dS gains time and prevents ... eS for the time being, but exposes the d-pawn to under- mining via ... c6 and/or ... e6 after 7 ... lbb8 (D): w al) 8 l:te1 c6, and if White plays 9 c4, then Black's g7 -bishop has regained its power on the long diagonal. a2) After the immediate 8 c4, 8 ... c6 is also fine for Black, while 8 ...

90 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Averbakh Variation Finally, we take a brief look at 1 e4 g6 2 d4 i..g7 3 c4, which is sometimes called the Averbakh Variation (not to be confused with the Aver- bakh System in the King's Indian, which arises after 1 d4 liJf6 2 c4 g6 3 liJc3 i..g7 4 e4 d6 5 i..e2 O-O 6 i..g5). This is White's most impor- tant alternative to the lines above, and in fact, for some players 3 c4 has been a disincentive to using 1 ... g6 at all. It's a set-up that may well ap- peal to those who play 1 d4, since 1 d4 g6 2 e4 i..g7 3 c4leads to the same position, and the re- sulting pawn-structures will be familiar to most of them. In fact, the game will very often trans- pose to a King's Indian Defence (if Black plays an early ... d6 and ... liJf6) or a Benoni-related defence if Black plays ... c5 and White replies d5; then Black may continue ... d6, ... e6 and ... exd5 as in the Modem Benoni and offshoots, or ... d6 and ... e5, a structure from various lesser- used lines. In addition, Black can choose from a variety of unique, non-transpositional lines, a few of which we'll identify in the following game. 1 e4 Sashikiran - Kakageldiev Asian Team Ch, Esfahan 2005 Another way to get to our main line is 1 d4 g6 2 c4 (or 1 c4 g6 2 d4) 2 ... i..g7 3 e4. If White plays 3 liJc3 instead, 3 ... c5 4 d5 i..xc3+!? 5 bxc3 f5 is one of those eccentric variations that has been around for many years. Black tries to show that his knight-pair and White's weak- nesses are sufficient compensation for his op- ponent's bishop-pair and influence on Black's vulnerable dark squares. This line has never re- ally caught on at the top levels, but can make for creative and instructive chess if you're looking to experiment.

1...g6 2 d4 i..g7 3 c4 (D)

3 ... d6 After 3 ... c5, 4 liJf3 cxd4 5 liJxd4 liJc6 is a Maroczy Bind Sicilian Defence, and 4 d5 d6 may transpose into some form of Benoni. In the latter case, Black may not arrive at one of the more dynamic lines, however, particularly be- cause if he plays the moves ... e6 and ... exd5,

White has the option of recapturing with his e- pawn. 4 liJc3 liJc6 4 ... liJf6 directly transposes to the King's In- dian Defence. 4 ... liJd7 can go every which way; the most important reaction is 5liJf3, if only be- cause in many cases, the move liJf3 has already been played on one of the moves 1-4. Then there are some unique lines after 5 ... e5 6 i..e2 (D).

Now 6 ... liJgf6 will almost certainly trans- pose to a line ofthe Classical King's Indian De- fence. Alternatively: a) 6 ... liJh6?! might be a handy way to sup- port ... f5, but it runs into 7 h4!. It's always im- portant for Black to watch out for this move when he can't respond to it by ... h5 or ... h6 (in order to answer h5 with ... g5). There can follow 7 ... f6 (7 ... exd4 8liJxd4liJf6 9 h5 doesn't solve anything) 8 h5 (8 i..xh6 i..xh6 9 h5 is also good; White has ideas of liJh4 and i..g4) 8 ... c6

b) 6.Jbe7 (D) has been used a lot over the years, but White has generally done well. w Black's idea is to enforce ... fS without play- ing ... ltJf6 and then having to move the knight again before being able to move the f-pawn. Al- ternatively, he can play for ... exd4 and ... ltJc6. The strategy is in itself logical enough, but without a knight on f6, White's centre isn't sub- ject to much pressure and Black's pieces are a bit cramped; for example, his queen can't use the e7-square. In addition, White gains ideas of h4-hS, whereas the useful move ..te3 (perhaps planning dxeS and cS at some point) isn't sub- ject to counterattack by ... ltJg4. Here are a few, brief, examples of the main lines: bI) 7 O-O O-O S ..te3 h6?! (S ... fS?! is risky when ltJgS is available; for example, 9 ltJgS ltJf6 10 dxeS dxeS 11 cS! 'ilVxd 1 12 ..tc4+ ~hS 13l:taxdl and White stands significantly better; the uninspiring S. .. exd4 9 ltJxd4 ltJc6 may be Black's best) 9 'ii'c2!? (not bad, but 9 dxeS! is strong regardless of how Black recaptures; for example, 9 ... dxeS 10 'ii'd2 ~h7 11 l:tadl ltJc6 12 'ii'c2) 9 .. .fS?! 10 dxeS dxeS 11 l:tadl f4 12 ..tcS l:tf7 13 ..ta3 ltJc6 (13 ... ..tf6 14 cS!) 14 cS (opening up the a2-gS diagonal) 14 ... ~hS IS ..tc4 l:tfS, Ilyin-Zemtsov, Kaluga 200S. White has space and activity, and among other moves, 16ltJdS lands Black in an utterly passive posi- tion. b2) 7 dS O-O S h4ltJf6 (S ... h6 9 hS gS 10 g4! dooms Black to suffering on the queenside, where White has a natural advantage; notice how White's pawns on dS and hS prevent a knight from getting to f4) 9 ..te3!? ltJg4 10 ~d2 hS 11 ltJgS (this is White's basic idea: the knight can't be kicked away from gS except by ... f6, after which the move ltJe6 forces ... ..txe6 and creates very serious light-square weak- nesses in Black's camp) 11...c6 12 f3 ltJf6 13 ..te3 cxdS 14 cxdS ..td7 IS 'ii'd2 a6 16 O-O-O! with the idea ~bl and l:tc1, when White con- trols the play on the queenside, Kiselev-Kant- sler, Ljubljana 1992. The theme of O-O-O, ~b 1 and l:tc1 is common in the Sfunisch Variation of the King's Indian Defence. b3) 7 h4 hS (7 ... h6 S ..te3 exploits the trade- off h4 vs ... h6, because the pawn on h6 is a tar- get) S ..tgS f6 9 ..te3 ..th6 10 ..txh6 l:Ixh6 (we've seen before that exchanging one's bad bishop by ... ..th6 or ... ..ta6, while sometimes effective, can also weaken squares of its colour and interfere with castling; in this case, the neg- atives outweigh the positives) 11 'iVd2l:thS 12

w Black wants to play ... f5 quickly, since his f- pawn isn't blocked by ... lbf6, as in the King's Indian Defence. But ... f5 lacks punch without a piece controlling e4, and White is able to carry out c5 much faster than in the corresponding King's Indian positions. After 6 ... lbd4 7lbge2, Black can't maintain his knight on the outpost and has to grant White a lead in space and development after 7 ... lbxe2 8 .Bxe2 (D).

White has numer- ous alternatives here, including 7 'iVd2, 7 .Bd3, 7lbge2 and the attractive 7 f3, when 7 .. .f5 8 g4 transposes to 8 f3 below. However, the most uncompromising choice is 7 c5, with the kind of accelerated queenside attack that Black is subject to in the Modem Defence.

Then: a) 9 .Bb5+ ~f8! 10 f3 .Bh6 11 .Bxh6+ lbxh6 gives Black the better bishop and a solid game, unless White makes an early pawn-break f4; then things become extremely complex and of- ten tactical.

This position is quite awkward for Black in view of ideas such as tiJe6+ and tiJg5. c3) 9 ... .Bd7 has only been played in a cou- ple of low-level games, but is definitely worthy of consideration; for example, 10 tiJb5 (10 .Bb5 tiJf6 11 tiJge2 fxe4 12 .Bg5 is unclear; 10 'iVb4 tiJf6! has the idea 11 'iVxd6 tiJxe4 12 tiJxe4 fxe4 with ... tiJf5 next; this seems satisfactory for Black) 1O ... ~f8! 11 ~a3 .Bxb5 12 .Bxb5 tiJf6

Karpov-Werk, Hockenheim (simul) 1994 went 8 ... f4?!

IS ..• .ixfS?! 15 ... tiJxf5! is more natural; perhaps White stands a bit better after 16 .Bg5 .Bxg5 17 'ilVxg5, but this looks quite manageable. 16 tiJgS ~d717 O-O-O IU8? 17 ... a6 is best, although White stands well after either 18 tiJc3 or 18 tiJa3 with the idea c5 and tiJc4. 18 cS! .ixgS 19 .ixgS 'iVg6 20 tiJxa7 h6 21 .ibS+ ~d8 22 .Be3 'iVxg2 23 ~xg2 White has an extra pawn and the better game. In this game and notes, we see various irreg- ular set-ups for Black versus the 'Averbakh' formation with c4, d4 and e4. While playable, they all suffer from the same defect: a lack of space. Whether Black stands objectively worse or not, most leading players don't want to deal with the difficulties that this presents in prac- tice, and either avoid it, or take the opportunity to transpose to the King's Indian.

4 Modern Queenside Fianchetto

In this chapter I'll be examining modem queen- side fianchetto systems, primarily those with ... b6 on one of the first two moves, but also I b3. These aren't extremely popular at the very top levels, but they have been played consis- tently by strong grandmasters as well as mas- ters. With ... b6 and ... i.b7, Black's play tends to be concentrated upon controlling the central light squares with moves such as ... e6, ... f5, . ..'Df6/e7 and ... i.b4; if he succeeds in doing so, his bishop on b7 will gain in strength. White will often challenge those squares and try to limit the bishop's influence by d5, e4 and/or f3, supported by tt:'lc3, i.d3 and "VJiIe2/c2. A comparison with 1...g6 of the last chapter is interesting. Perhaps the most significant dif- ference is that ... b6 doesn't contribute to early castling, which is a traditional opening prior- ity. On the other hand, in the critical lines,

1...b6 and an early ... i.b7 attacks an unde-

fended pawn on e4. This imparts a certain forcing quality to it and limits White's op- tions. By contrast 1...g6 and 2 ... i.g7 attacks a pawn on d4 that is naturally protected by the queen on d 1, so White is afforded more leeway in his development. When White plays 1 b3, his opponent doesn't necessarily feel obliged to play for an initia- tive and frequently refuses to present the broad target that White usually does versus 1...b6. You should remember that White's view of the chess opening is different from Black's, in that he doesn't want to arrive at an equal position at too early a stage of the game. Therefore 1 b3, while respectable and sporting a considerable body of theory, isn't used as often as one might expect by the same leading players who are willing to enter into ... g6 and ... b6 systems as Black. Nevertheless, a loyal band of 1 b3 devo- tees have developed ways to emerge from the opening with unbalanced positions. That out- come will satisfy players who are more con- cerned with having an original game than achieving an advantage from the opening. Owen Defence

1 e4 b6 2 d4 i.b7 (D)

Obviously White could have begun with 1 d4 as well, and in fact many games go 1 d4 e6 2 e4 b6 (2 ... d5 is a French Defence) and 3 ... i.b7. With either move-order, playing ... b6 and ... e6 on the first two moves has a few subtleties, as we'll see in the first few games. w In the eyes of traditional theory, 1...b6 has a varying reputation depending upon White's first move. For example, 1 c4 b6 (the English Defence) is a respectable unbalancing contin- uation. There have been thousands of master games with it, and recent theory is extensive, with books and lengthy articles devoted to its intricacies.

1 e4 b6, the Owen Defence, is a different

matter. It was looked at askance by masters for most of the 20th century, in spite of having the- ory associated with it which goes as far back as the 19th. Even after the kingside fianchetto of the last chapter, 1 e4 g6, achieved respectabil- ity, the queenside fianchetto was still frowned upon when White retained full freedom with his central structure. In the past two decades, however, 1 e4 b6 2 d4 i.b7 has been used by a fair number of strong grandmasters and has re- ceived renewed attention from theoreticians.

MODERN QUEENSIDE FIANCHETTO 95

As mentioned above, White's e-pawn is un- der attack. In the majority of cases, he will de- fend it while developing by 3 i.d3 or 3 ttJc3. Assuming that White doesn't follow 3 i.d3 with an early ttJc3, these two methods are fun- damentally different, although they often lead to types of positions that you may recognize from other openings. Let's begin with a classic game. I've adjusted the opening move sequence so as to address some basic move-order issues straightaway. Dorfman - Miles Tilburg 1992

1 e4 b6 2 d4 i.b7 3 i.d3 (D)

3 dS e6 isn't dangerous, because Black will succeed in breaking up White's centre (with ... ttJf6 and ... c6, if necessary), but I'm surprised that I can only find a handful of very low-rated games with 3 eS, since 1 b3 eS 2 i.b2 e4 is a legitimate line in which ... dS is played soon thereafter. The idea is that after 3 eS d6 (to dis- solve the cramping e-pawn) 4 ttJf3, Black's queenside light squares are weakened. Finally,

3 f3 is logical, erecting a barrier against the b7-

bishop. Then Black has many ways to go; for example, 3 ... e6 (3 ... g6!?) 4 ttJc3 (4 c4 is a line of the English Defence, examined below) 4 ... ttJf6 (4 ... ttJh6!? intending .. .fS) S i.e3 and now S. .. cS or S. .. dS.

3 ••• ttJf6 The ... b6 systems are flexible, so you see a wide variety of moves at nearly every juncture. This move and the main alternative, 3 ... e6, con- test the light squares, which is consistent with Black's strategy as a whole. The differences between them are important enough to warrant a fairly lengthy digression, and Black has a couple of other options. As always, it's impor- tant to understand move-orders in order to get the position you want: a) 3 ... cS?! is positionally suspect due to 4 dS, hemming in Black's queen's bishop. Black has forfeited the option of attacking dS by means of ... c6. b) Black plays 3 ... e6 more frequently than 3 ... ttJf6. It can variously transpose to any of the next few games. Importantly, however, it gives White the option of 4 c4, which is the main line of the English Defence section below (I c4 b6 2 d4 e6 3 e4 i.b7 4 i.d3). An independent line after 3 ... e6 is 4 ttJf3, and now: bl) 4 ... ttJf6?! (probably too provocative) S eS ttJdS 6 a3! cS 7 dxcS i.xcs (D). w This resembles the note to 8 a3 below, except that White hasn't played c3 and therefore can play c4 in one move rather than two. One exam- ple went 8 O-O (8 M i.e7 9 c4 is also good) 8 ... fS!?9c4ttJc71Oi.gS?! (10M!) 1O ... i.xf3! 11i.xd8 i.xd112 i.xc7 ttJa6?

Al- ternatively, White can play S O-O and allow the Sicilian variant S. .. cxd4 6 ttJxd4. In that case, S. .. ttJf6 6 eS ttJdS 7 l:e1 leaves White better de- veloped.

Some ideas: dl) 4 dS tbeS S .te2 e6 breaks up White's centre. If he overextends by 6 f4?! tbg6 7 c4, then among other good moves, 7 ... .tb4+ 8 .td2 'Wie7leaves White's centre further exposed. d2) 4 tbe2 tbb4 forces the exchange of White's bishop; considering his extra space, this is not bad for White (for example, S c4 e6 transposes to the English Defence, discussed below), but ceding the bishop-pair may not be to his taste. d3) 4 c3 (Martin gives this an '!') 4 ... eS (the point) S tbf3!

Black could use some improvements here. You might want to compare 4 ... ttJc6 below. Let's return to 3 ... ttJf6. 4 'iie2 (D) White definitely should avoid 4 e5? ~xg2. We shall see 4 ttJd2 in the next game, and 4 ttJc3 e6 transposes to lines covered via 3 ttJc3 below (in the game K.Nikolaidis-Minasian). 4 "ilke2 causes unique problems.

4 ... e6 Black has some move-order issues to worry about. He can try 4 ... c5, when 5 c3 e6 heads for the game. If White plays 5 d5 e6 and follows up with 6 c4, Black can reply 6 ... d6 with the idea of ... exd5; for example, 7 f4 exd5 8 cxd5 g6 sets up a sort of Benoni in which neither ... ~b7 nor ~e2 are particularly good moves; this should be perfectly playable for Black. Alternatively, he can try 8 ... ~e7 with the idea ... O-O. White can instead play 6 ttJf3 and transpose to the note to 6 c3 below. The developing move 4 ... ttJc6!? threatens d4 and has the idea of winning White's bishop by ... ttJb4. What is presently the main line runs

Then I think 8 ... ttJde7! 9 cxd4 d5 yields attractive counter- play; for example, 10 ~c2 g6 11 ttJc3 ~g7 12 0-00-0 13 a3 (versus ... ttJb4 and ... ~a6) and now 13 ... ~d7 or 13 ... ttJa5. As usual, you have ample opportunity to expand upon such raw material. 5 ttJf3 (D)

5 ... c5!? 5 ... d5 6 e5 ttJfd7 introduces variations from the next game, but allows 7 ttJg5. Then Black may stand all right, but has to know very specif- ically what to play; see the notes there. 6c3 White can play 6 d5! here, threatening c4 with a bind. This seems to leave White with the better game; for example, C.Bauer-Minasian, New York 2000 continued 6 ... exd5 7 exd5+ "ilke7 8 c4 b5?! (however, 8 ... 1i'xe2+ 9 ~xe2 d6 10 .l:!.el ~e7 11 ~f1 puts pressure on Black's position) 9 b3 'fi'xe2+ 10 ~xe2 b4 11 .l:!.el d6 12 ~f1 + ~e7 13 ~f4 with space and initia- tive. Black may be able to improve upon this; oth- erwise he might want to use a 3 ... e6 move- order, or look into deviations from the game such as 4 ... ttJc6 or 5 ... d5. 6 ... ~e7 This position too can arise via several move- orders. 70-0 To confuse matters, White can play ttJbd2 from move 3 onwards. At this point, 7 ttJbd2 d5 (7 ... ttJc6 8 a3 is the game) 8 e5 ttJfd7 9 O-O ttJc6 transposes into the next game. 7 ... ttJc6 (D)

w Sa3!? Playing this move before ttJbd2 has certain advantages (see the next note). It also has draw- backs, however, in particular the weakening of b3. Instead, S e5 (S dxc5 transposes if, after either recapture by Black, White plays 9 e5) S. .. ttJd5 9 dxc5 has done well for White, but with accurate play, Black's development and central pawns should more or less make up for his structural problems, as follows: a) After 9 ... bxc5 10 c4, Bauer analyses 1O ... ttJb6! 11 ttJc3 O-O 12 ~e4 (12 .Jif4 f5!?) 12 ... g6 13 .Jih6 l:!.eS, which might mildly fa- vour White following 14 ~f4! (14 .lte2 f6!) 14 ... d6 15 l:t.adl, but 15 ... ttJxe5 16 ttJxe5 dxe5 17 ~xe5 iVd4!? keeps things within bounds; for example, IS fIIc7 fIIh4 19 .ltf4 .ltdS! 20 ~xb7 ~xf4 and the opposite-coloured bishops help Black. b) 9 ... .ltxc5 10 b4 i.e7 11 a3 is more inter- esting. White intends c4 and .ltb2 and has more space. Black should challenge his central con- trol by l1...f5! (D). w With his cramped position, Black wants to stake out some kingside territory. 11 ... f5 covers the key e4-square and cuts off White's light- squared bishop from a potential kingside at- tack. Whether this works against White's con- siderable space advantage is another matter; I suspect that Black gets just enough play. The instructive game Rosandic-Filipovic, Zadar 2001 continued 12 c4 (12 exf6?! .ltxf6 and ...

100 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Black would like to play ... liJb4 and ... i.a6. Exchanging his bad bishop in this fashion is a major theme in the 'French-Owen', and White usually makes sure to prevent it: 12 a3 i.a6 13 i.bl .l:tc8 14 'ilVd2!? (heading for f4 and g4) 14 ... a4! (fixing the light squares) 15 i.c2 (15 'Ylif4liJa5!) 15 ... b5 16 i.d3 and Black played the relatively solid 16 ... liJa5 in Trygstad-Gawehns, Bergen 2000. He might have tried 16 ... 'iYb6, in order to attack the d-pawn and prepare ... b4; for example, 17 'Ylif4 h6 18 'iY g4 g6 with ... h5 to follow. In general, the play looks balanced in this line. 4 ... e6 5 liJf3 d5 If Black is heading for ... d5 structures, this is the obvious timing, but not risk-free. We saw 5 ... c5 6 d5! in the notes to the previous game. Again, it may be that Black should prefer a move-order with 3 ... e6 and an early ... c5 if he wants to avoid the problems described in the note to White's 7th move.

[diagram]
A critical juncture. 7liJg5 (D) is both aggres- sive and logical.

White not only brings the queen to the king- side to create threats, but he frees his f-pawn to advance. liJg5 is another move that pops up re- peatedly in the French Defence, but in that opening Black's attack on the centre or queen- side is already underway. After 7 liJg5, White has the immediate threat of 8 liJxe6 fxe6 9 'ilVh5+. Black is really forced to play 7 ... i.e7 (7 ... h6? 8 "iVh5 threatens f7 as well as 9liJxe6, but after 8 .. .'iVe7?, 9 liJxf7! wins anyway) 8 "iVg4! (8 h4 c5 9 z:th3!? is an alternative, after which Gawehns analyses 9 ... "iVc8 and 9 ... cxd4 10 liJxe6 fxe6 11 'ilVh5+ ~f8 12 .l:tf3+ i.f6 to equality) 8 ... h5 (White was threatening liJxe6 followed by 'ilVxg7, and a cute line is 8 ... c5? 9 liJxh7 .l:tg8 10 "iVxe6! fxe6? 11 i.g6#; Gawehns suggests that the strange-looking 8 ... liJf8 might be OK - the idea is to stabilize the kingside and get in the favourable move ... i.a6; for example,

JIh5, ... liJfd7 and ... ~f8-g8) 10 O-O (Khalifman's suggestion 10 liJf3 is also promis- ing; then 1O ... g6 11 i.g5 wins the dark squares; the inclusion of 9 ... h4 would also help in that case because ... .l:th5 challenges the g5-square) 1O ... .Ba6! 11 i.xa6 liJxa6 12 c3 c5 13 .l:tdl!? (13liJa3) 13 ... c4!? (13 ... .l:tc8) 14 .l:tel .l:tc8 15 h4 and in Deep Junior-Akopian, Dortmund 2000, the computer was happy. The line with 7 liJg5 is promising for White; Black can examine ideas such as 7 ... i.e7 8 'iV g4 liJf8, or 9 ... h4! in the main line, although the whole position is difficult and requires prepara- tion. One interesting point made by Gawehns is that with the moves ... c5 and c3 included, 8 liJg5 i.e7 9 "iVg4 isn't so intimidating due to 9 ... i.a6!; in fact, a little analysis will indicate that this is acceptable for Black. So ifBlack isn't happy with the lines in this note, he might want to go back and look at those ... c5 move-orders from the previous game; for example, 3 ... e6 4 liJf3 c5. 7 .•. c5 8 O-O liJc6 (D)

The most important thing to remember about all lines with ... cxd4 is that Black gives up the option of a later queens ide attack by ... c4. Such attacks tend to be important in these variations, so you need to be sure that ... cxd4 accomplishes something concrete before playing it. 9 ... ~e7 Note that 9 ... c4 10 ~c2 should probably be followed by 1O ... ~e7 anyway, because after 1O ... bS lllbgS! White threatens various king- side attacks. 10 lbbd2 (D)

10 b4 is met most naturally with 10 ... O-O,

which can be followed up by ... ~c8 and ... ffic7, while ... ~ae8 and ... f6 is a possible alterna- tive strategy. Black can instead lash out with 1O ... gS!?, as in the main game; this has been analysed in some depth. A brief extract is 11 bS (11 ~bd2 c4 12 .tc2 ~f8! intends ... ~g6, as does 11 ~b2 c4 12 ~c2 lbf8; different possi- bilities arise from 11 ~e3lbf8 12 bS!? lbaS 13 lbbd2 c4 14 ~c2 hS, which is analysis by Herbrechtsmeier) 11...lbaS 12 lbbd2 c4 13 ~c2. Thus far Khalifman. Now Gawehns sug- gests the familiar 13 ... lbf8 and appends 14lbel lbg6 with the idea IS 'iVhS lbf4. This seems reasonable, and in general, these lines look fun to play for both sides.

... g5!? This advance comes up repeatedly in the 'French-Owen', just as it does in the related French Defence positions. Black is not merely launching a kingside attack, but preparing to reorganize his pieces. In particular, ... lbf8-g6 can be surprisingly effective, as in the previous note. Be aware, however, that the correspond- ing attack with ... gS in the French Defence is backed up by moves such as ... 'itVb6, making ... g4 a continual threat to win White's d-pawn. That's not true in the Owen version, so the threat to White's centre is minimal. On the other hand, Black has one significant advantage here: if White plays dxcS, he doesn't gain the d4- square for a piece because Black can reply with ... bxcS. This is all hard to assess, but it's worth noting that the safer 10 ... O-O is also playable. 11 'iUe3 White might look into 11 b4 hS!? 12 ~b2. 11 ... lbf8!? 12 J:.dl g4 13lbel cxd4 The less committal 13 ... hS may be a slight improvement. 14 cxd4 ~g5!? 15 'iVe2 h516lbb3lbg617 ~a6? 17 ~xg6!? fxg6 18 'ilVd3 r3;f7 19 g3 favours White slightly due to Black's loose kingside. ... ~xa6 18 'ii'xa6 O-O 19 ~b7 ~c8 20 ~xg5 'ii'xg5 21 :tac1 'ii'e7!

White gets his bishop out before blocking it by lDbd2. Otherwise: a) Grosar-Filipovic, Ljubljana 2000 saw 9 lDbd2 lDc6 10 a3 (with the idea b4), and now we see the standard queenside attack 1O ... c4! II .Bc2 bS 12 l:!.e 1 !?

The defensive-looking move 3 f3 is remark- ably rare, perhaps because it gives Black too much leeway. I'm going to leave it to the reader to think about, but you should know that 3 ... e6 is normal, when the obvious ... dS soon thereaf- ter has the advantage that if White plays eS, the pawn on f3 will have to move again to f4, both to support eS and to clear f3 for the king's knight. That constitutes a loss of tempo, al- though it has compensating benefits. An inter- esting alternative to ... dS is to combine ... tiJh6 and .. .fS, or ... g6, ... .Bg7 and ... tiJe7, delaying the choice of pawn-breaks. In fact, 3 ... dS!? is also a reasonable reply. Then Black intends to answer 4 tiJc3 with 4 ... e6, which has the posi- tional ideas of ... tiJf6 and ... .Bb4, as well as an opportunistic .. :iih4+ to disturb White's build- up. Versus 4 exdS, Black can play 4 ... ~xdS; e.g., S c4 "it'd7. Finally, the move 4 eS can be logically answered by 4 ... e6 or 4 .. :~d7!?, with an eye towards ... .Ba6 and/or ... cS. 3 ... e6 (D) w When White plays 3 tiJc3, he develops more freely than in lines where he supports his centre with c3 and plays tiJd2. For one thing, his dark-squared bishop doesn't have to wait for the middlegame to come into play. In addition, Black has to be aware that an early ... cS can of- ten be answered by dS, and that in some cases the move ... dS can be favourably countered by exdS. On the flip side, the knight on c3 can be pinned by ... .Bb4, which adds to the pressure on e4 exerted by Black's queen's bishop. Further- more, White's inability to bolster the centre with c3 means that a properly-timed ... cS can create more difficulties than we saw in the pre- vious two games. 4 tiJf3 There are two important alternatives for White here: a) 4.Bd3 (the other move-order is 3 .Bd3 e6 4 tiJc3, which gives Black the option of3 ... tiJf6, as above). Now: al) 4 ... g6 (as used by Spas sky) is a legiti- mate way to play chess and avoid theory; Black often sets up the 'Hippopotamus' formation with ... .Bg7, ... tiJe7, ... d6 and so forth. Not sur- prisingly, most top players will prefer White in that case: he has space, development, and no weaknesses. Nevertheless, several grandmasters have shown that it's not easy to crack Black's position. Black has two more conventional approaches after 4 .Bd3: a2) The straightforward 4 ... tiJf6 can be an- swered by S tiJge2, when Black is faced with the question of how to challenge the centre: S. .. dS!?

English Defence The English Defence is defined by the moves ... b6 and ... e6 versus White's c4. In the great majority of cases, Black also plays ... .Bb7 and White d4, but occasionally Black plays ... i.a6, and White sometimes foregoes d4 in order to avoid central exposure. In general, I would characterize the English Defence as one of the most exciting and instruc- tive modem fianchetto openings. It embraces an extraordinary number of highly tactical varia- tions, which unfortunately requires a lot of prep- aration from Black (and an unusually detailed exposition on my part). However, most of those tactics grow out of distinctive positional roots. What's more, the hypermodern theme of attack- ing an occupied centre from the flank will sel- dom express itself more clearly.

1 c4 b6 (D)

1...b6 is more popular versus I c4 than I e4

or 1 d4, for reasons that become clear next move. Nevertheless, I should note that 1 d4 e6 is appropriate for a French Defence player, be- cause 2 e4 dS leads to the French Defence itself and 2 c4 b6 brings us back to the English De- fence. The other popular move-order after I c4 is

1.. .e6; for example, 2 d4 b6 transposes to the

main line. 2lLlf3 is an independent move-order that often transposes to another opening; for ex- ample, 2 ... dS (Queen's Gambit or Reti), 2 ... cS (Symmetrical English), 2 .. .fS (Dutch), or vari- ous Indian formations with 2 ... lLlf6 (notice that this kind of transposition isn't possible after I d4 b6 2 e4). w

2d4 The alternative 2ltJf3 il.b7 3 g3 i.xf3 is dis- cussed below, in the notes to Marjanovic-Ivan- isevic. 2 ... e6 Of course, 2 ... il.b7 is playable as well. With 2 ... e6 Black leaves himself ready to play an early ... il.b4. He might also want to hold off on 2 ... il.b7 in order to retain options for the bishop if White plays slowly. For example, 2 ... e6 3ltJf3 ltJf6 is a Queen's Indian Defence, when the modem main lines involve the move ... il.a6. Fur- thermore, the move 3 d5!?, which would directly block off the bishop after 2 ... il.b7, can now be answered by 3 ... il.a6 (4 e4ltJf6!), 3 ... ltJf6 4 a3 (to avoid ... il.b4) 4 ... il.a6, or the bizarre-looking 3 ... iVh4 (hitting c4), whose theoretical reputa- tion is not bad. 3e4 If there's a way for White to get a substantial advantage against the English Defence, this has to be it. Establishing a broad centre conforms with our usual 'stress test' of any black defence that doesn't itself establish a central pawn pres- ence. I should say that the slower approach with

[diagram]
i.b7 3ltJc3 e64 a3, with minor move-order is- sues) has been a deterrent to some prospective players of the English Defence, particularly at grandmaster level, because it's easy to fall into a cramped position. Nevertheless, Black has plenty of ways to develop his pieces and will not have to fear being steamrollered by pawns, so the a3 lines are not to be feared in the way that 3 e4 is. I'll take this up in a game below (Sher-Lempert). 3 ••• il.b7 (D) w This position constitutes the starting point for the most frequently-played and most challeng- ing variation of the English Defence. Black is in the strange circumstance that he has a remark- able number of moves at his disposal for each of his early moves, but that they tend to be the same moves: ... il.b4(+), ... 'iVh4(+), ... f5 and ... ltJe7 (or ... ltJf6, normally not before ... f5). Naturally, Black makes other piece moves and pawn-breaks (sometimes the light-squared break ... d5, for example, but rarely ... c5 or ... e5). Nev- ertheless, the basic attacks on White's centre are strangely similar for a move as noncommittal as ... il.b7. The implementation of these moves depends upon White's own set-up, of course, but right at this moment he settles much of the question by his choice, which is usually either 4 il.d3 or 4 ltJc3. White's general strategy is straightfor- ward: support of his centre, development, and a pawn advance. He can play f3 or 'ilVc2 to further the first goal, although the latter move tends to be ineffective. Pressing forward with d5 cuts off Black's bishop on b7, but it uses a valuable tempo and opens up some squares for Black's pieces - see the next note. The prospect of White's d5, however, accounts for the fact that Black seldom commits to ... ltJf6 before ... f5; that is, he wants to have the move ... f5 available to break down White's c4/d5/e4 phalanx. 4 ii.d3 This bishop development is the most impor- tant move, although 4 ltJc3 has been played more often and is discussed in games to follow. The drawback to 4ltJc3 is that it grants Black's dark-squared bishop an immediate and effec- tive role following 4 ... i.b4. By contrast, 4 ii.d3 il.b4+ lets White avoid doubled pawns by 5 il.d2 and can even speed his development; 4 ... ii.b4+ is a rare choice for Black, but a legiti- mate one with its own ideas, and we'll cover it in the next game. Some lesser continuations: a) 4 d5 has more than one good reply, but an attractive one is 4 ... ltJf6, recommended by Langrock, because Black takes the initiative. Then 5 e5?! ltJe4 threatens ... il.b4+ and ... ii.c5, and 5 il.d3 exd5 6 exd5 c6 or 6 cxd5 c6 is easy for Black to play. That leaves 5 ltJc3 il.b4 6 il.d3, which may even leave White in the worse position: 6 ... exd5 7 cxd5 (7 exd5 c6 8 dxc6!?

Since 6 ttJf3 ~g4 attacks g2 as well, and 6 dS ttJb4 7 ~e2 ttJf6 8 eS ttJg4 is a double attack on f2 and eS, only 6 g3 ~f6 7 dS seems playable, until you find that 7 ... ttJb4 8 ~e2 'iVd4! 9 .Bc2 .Ba6! wins.

In- stead, 6 .Bxh6 'iVh4+ 7 g3 'iWxh6 wins the dark squares; for example, 8 fxe6 .Bb4+ 9 ~f2 O-O with a strong initiative. After 4 .Bd3, Black's main replies are 4 .. .fS and 4 ... ttJc6.

White is about to be a rook down for two pawns, in return for obvi- ous attacking chances against Black's loose king. This extraordinarily tactical line has long been a theoretician's nightmare, and I'll try to show a complete solution with a minimum of details. 9liJe2! White develops and forces Black to capture on hI; this knight will head for f4. I won't go into the details about 9 hxg8'Yi'+?! ~xg8, but Black's activity gives him at least equality. 9 i.g5 is sometimes regarded as more accu- rate than 9liJe2, often transposing after 9 ... liJf6 10 'iVh4 .i.xh 1 11 liJe2. In fact, this was the ac- tual move-order Browne used in the game. In- stead, 11 liJd2 prevents the tricky move ... .i.f3 that we see below. But 11 liJd2 in tum forfeits the opportunity for liJc3 at some point, which contributes to White's victory in our main game. Fortunately (for simplicity's sake), it turns out (at least in my opinion) that Black is essentially lost after either 11 liJe2 or 11 liJd2, and that 9 i.g5 is therefore just as strong as 9liJe2. A key transposition to lines below is l1liJd2 'iie7 12 liJe2 i¥f7 13liJf4 (13 O-O-O isn't as good due to 13 ... liJxh7!). 9 ••. .i.xhll0 i.gSliJf611 'iih4 (D)

The much less radical 4 ... i.b4+ is played fairly often, although it doesn't immediately break up White's centre after 5 .Jtd2 (D) (in- stead of 5 ttJc3, which we'll see later by trans- position). White seems to have a small, conventional advantage; however, there's much that remains

to be discovered here, as in any such ultra- flexible line: a) 5 ... iLxd2+ 6 ~xd2 (or 6 ttJxd2 with the idea 6 ... 'ii'g5?! 7 ttJgf3!, and after the consistent 7 .. :~xg2?!, White establishes a meaningful lead in active development following 8 l:!.gl ~h3 9 'uxg7 ~h6 10 ~g3; 6 ... ttJh6 improves, and I'd assess White as marginally better for classical reasons, but modernists may wish to dispute that) 6 ... ttJh6 (6 .. .f5 7 ttJc3 ttJf6 falls slightly short of equality following 8 f3 ttJc6 9 exf5!? ttJxd4 10 ~e3 c5 11 ttJge2 ttJxe2 12 ttJxe2; for example, 12 ... O-O 13 fxe6 :le8 14 ttJf4 or 12 ... 'ii'e7 13 fxe6 with the idea 13 ... O-O 140-0 dxe6 15 'iVe5) 7 ttJc3 f5 8 ttJf3 O-O and now both

9 O-O and 9 O-O-O favour White.

b) 5 ... ttJc6 has the point that 6 iLxb4 ttJxb4 will force the exchange of White's bishop on d3. But in the first place, 6 ttJf3 should give White some pull; for example, he stood better after the forthright 6 ... ~f6 7 d5 .Jtxd2+ 8'ii'xd2 in Dautov-Speelman, Lippstadt 2000. And has Black gained anything from 5 ... ttJc6 if White plays 6 ttJe2? For example, 6 ... 'iYf6 (6 ... .Jtxd2+ 7 'iWxd2 'iYf6 8 d5 ttJe5 9 O-O) 7 .Jtxb4 ttJxb4 8 ttJbc3 and 8 ... ttJxd3+ is a slightly improved version for White of the main line, whereas 8 ... ttJe7 9 .Jtbl!? O-O 10 a3 ttJbc6 11 O-O looks promising. I should emphasize that both sides have tried other moves in the lines following 4 ... .Jtb4+, and although I lean towards White, it's not clear that Black can't keep things approximately level ifhe employs the proper move-order and strategy. 5 exf5 .Jtb4+ In this manner, Black manages to steer clear of White's terrifying attack in the previous

game, and initiate some aggression of his own. But he'll have to give up some material to do that. 6'iWl (D) White protects his g-pawn. It's easy to con- firm that if White interposes a piece, say, 6 .ltd2?, Black can exchange and play 7 ... .ltxg2. Then 8 'iVh5+ is wholly insufficient because of 8 ... ~f8.

White's pieces are harmoniously placed and he has an extra pawn, but with that poorly- placed king on a potentially half-open file, he has to play carefully. 9 .•• "iVe8!

10 fxe6! looks risky because of the open f- file, but in fact it opens lines for White as well; for example, 10 ... dxe6 11 ~e2 with the ideas of .i.gS and llJbS, and if 11 ... .i.xf3 12 ~xf3llJc6, then 13llJe4! llJxd4 14llJxf6+ .l:txf6 lS'ilVe4. 10• •• exf5! 11 c5! i.e7 Not ll...bxcS?? 12'ilVb3+ and ~xb7. 12 .i.xf5 'It>h8 Or 12 ...

1 c4 b6 2 d4 e6 3 e4 i..b7 4 i..d3 ttJc6 (D)

This move looks rather silly until you realize that if White defends his d-pawn with a piece, 5 ... ttJb4 exchanges his bishop on d3 and wins the bishop-pair. On the other hand, this leaves White with a clear lead in space and develop- ment. In other words, a typical opening trade- off. 5 ttJf3 This is often considered inferior to 5 ttJe2 (see the following game), because it blocks the f-pawn. Still, White has more central control and decent chances for a pull. a) A clever suggestion (of what origin I'm unsure) is 5 i..e2!?, protecting d4 with the queen and avoiding the exchange of the king's bishop. Then anything goes; for example, 5 ... ttJa5!? hits e4, an attack that can be fortified by ... 'iih4 and/or ... ttJf6, while .. .f5 can be a theme. b) After 5 d5 ttJe5 6 i..e2? (6 ttJc3), 6 ... ~h4! hits the e-pawn and White already has to be careful: 7 'iic2?! (7 ttJc3 i..b4 8 'iid4! d6 9 ttJf3 ttJxf3+ 10 i..xf3 'iif6 stays level) 7 .. .f5! 8 ttJc3 i..b4, Bosboom Lanchava-Stefanova, Gronin- gen (women) 1999.

It's useful to compare this to the Hedgehog Variation of the English Opening and similar formations in the Sicilian Defence. In fact, all the differences favour White. First, his bad light-squared bishop is gone, which is a huge plus. Then he is ahead in development in com- parison with those variations, and his queen on g3 is beautifully placed. Finally, Black's pawn on d6 is much weaker than usual. The game continued 16 ... g6 (Epishin analyses the depress- ing alternative 16 ...

A creative move that leaves the bishop look- ing silly out on b4, and also threatened with capture by 10 a3 and eS. 9 a3 is a little slow, and Black seems to get good counterchances fol- lowing 9 ... .llxc3 10 tbxc3 O-O; for example, 11 .llgS f6 12 .llh4 dS 13 f3 'iid7 14 nfdl .lla6 IS b3l:.ad8, Chuchelov-Teske, Cappelle la Grande 1998.

9 ••• tbg6?! This doesn't appear to work out. Langrock provides analysis of this otherwise untested po- sition: a) Versus 9 ... fS, he suggests 10 f3! (10 eS tbg6 holds together; White mustn't overex- tend by 11 a3 .lle7 12 f4 O-O 13 dS d6!, when his big centre crumbles) 1O ... fxe4 (versus 11 a3 .lld6 12 eS) 11 fxe4 tbg6 12 cS!?

The most investigated lines in the English Defence (although no longer the most impor- tant) begin with 4 tbc3, about which a fair-sized book could be written. I'll make the not-so- bold claim that Black's play is adequate in ev- ery line, and therefore show only one full-game example. However, because this variation is so thoroughly dependent upon specifics, you might want to supplement this coverage with other books and database searches, particularly if the English Defence becomes one of your primary weapons.

1 c4 b6 2 d4 e6 3 e4 ~b7 4 liJc3 ~b4 (D)

The funny thing about this position is that White goes into it more than any other, and yet it is the easiest for Black to play and the most difficult for White to defend. The trade-off of liJc3 for ... ~b4 seems to favour Black, since ... ~b4 clears the way for ... f5 (with f8 free for the king, White's exf5 and 'iih5+ attack is no longer strong), and brings Black closer to cas- tling. In the meantime, White's knight on c3 doesn't add to the defence of e4, and is subject to capture with the attendant doubled-pawn issues. It's worth comparing this with the Nimzo- Indian Defence, in which Black plays the same move with the idea of controlling and some- times occupying e4. The biggest difference is that in the Nimzo-Indian, White has no pawn on that square to defend, and thus needn't tie his pieces to it. In the English Defence, White has to scramble to ward off the direct attack on e4 and can't find time to pursue other goals. 5~d3 This is the most-frequently played move by some margin. Here are the major alternatives; notice how many traps White has to be wary of: a) 5 'iVc2 was popular when the English De- fence was first played, but the primitive attack 5 ... 'iih4 ! (D), hitting the e-pawn and preventing its defence by f3, caused it to fade from the scene. The tactics are entertaining: al) 6 ~d3 f5 7 g3 'iVh5 (7 ... 'iie7!?) 8 f3 liJc6!? forces White to do something about d4, w and the natural 9 ~e3?! fxe4 10 ~xe4 liJf6 leaves Black with the better of it. a2) 6 d5!? isn't as bad as it has been made out to be, but Black should equalize after 6 ... ~xc3+ (6 .. .f5!? 7 exf5 exd5 8 liJf3 'iie4+ 9 ~dl! ~xc2+ 10 ~xc2) 7 bxc3 f5 (7 ... 'iie7!?) 8 exf5 exd5 9 cxd5 ~xd5 10 liJe2 liJe7. b) 5 d5 is well answered by 5 ... 'iVe7! 6 ~e3 (6 liJe2 exd5 7 exd5 liJf6; 6 ~e2 liJf6 7 f3 exd5 8 cxd5 c6 9 dxc6 liJxc6 10 liJh3 d5 11 exd5 O-O-O with more than enough attack) 6 ... f5! 7 exf5 exd5 8 cxd5 (8 'ilVh5+ ~f8) 8 ... liJf6, win- ning back material with the initiative; the key line is 9 ~c4 'ilVe4! 10 'iUe2 ~xg2 11 ~d4+ 'it>d8. c) 5 f3 is White's most important alternative to 5 ~d3; it serves both to strengthen White's centre and to reduce the effect of Black's bishop on b7. There's nothing wrong with 5 ... liJe7 (in- tending .. .f5 or in some cases ... d5), but the most aggressive reply is 5 .. .f5 6 exf5 liJh6! (a gambit, with the idea ... liJ(x)f5, which in tum threatens ... 'iVh4+ and the pawn on d4; 6 ... exf5 is also playable, if duller) and now: c1) 7 ~xh6 'Yi'h4+ 8 g3 'ii'xh6 gains the bishop-pair with pressure on the dark squares like e3 and d4; for example, 9 'Yi'd2 'iUxd2+ 10 ~xd2 liJc6! 11 liJge2 (Heimberger-Teske, Linz 1995) and now Odessky suggests 11...O-O-O with the idea 12 fxe6 dxe6 13 ~e3 liJxd4! 14 liJxd4 ~c5. c2) After 7 fxe6 liJf5 the highly-charged main line runs 8 ~f4! (to counter ... 'ii'h4+; 8 exd7+ is not necessarily unplayable, but hardly anyone will want to fall so far behind in devel- opment after 8 ... liJxd7) 8 ... dxe6 9 'Yi'a4+ liJc6

Perhaps he feared the pin with 33 .l:td3, but there's no way to exploit it after 33 ... Rf7. As the game went, White es- caped with a draw after some inaccuracies. The whole variation after 4 liJc3 ii.b4 con- tains many specific points that have to be known by Black, but White should probably look else- where for his weapon versus the English De- fence. White's best 'slow' strategy after 1 c4 b6 2 d4 e6 is 3 a3 ~b7 4liJc3 (D), which is equiva- lent to 2 ... ii.b7 3 liJc3 e6 4 a3.

As mentioned in the first game of my cover- age of the English Defence, some players are discouraged by the lack of prospects for Black after these moves, although the evidence is mixed in that regard. White's idea is to play dS, gaining space while limiting the range of Black's bishop. It's easy to see that allowing Black to play ... ii.b4 robs that advance of its effectiveness by making the dS-pawn a target; hence the pre- liminary a3. For his part, Black can argue that a3 does little in lines where Black plays ... g6, and indeed, 4 ... g6 is a popular way of returning the game to a long-term struggle between White's space and Black's attempts to chip away at the centre. In this context, I should mention that with the move-order I c4 b6 2 d4 e6 3 a3, Black will sometimes play 3 ... g6 and 4 ... ii.g7, delay- ing the development of his queen's bishop, which may end up on a6 or elsewhere.

MODERN QUEENSIDE FIANCHE1TO 121

I suspect that White retains some theoretical advantage in the ... g6 set-up, which probably doesn't mean much in practice. Here's a game which illustrates a more confrontational strat- egy by Black: Sher - Lempert Erevan open 1996

The most aggressive players are attracted to this move. 4 ... tiJf6 also stops S e4. Then S tiJf3 is a Queen's Indian Defence (Petrosian Varia- tion), but S dS is a more ambitious idea. It is of- ten answered by the quick-developing S. .. .Jid6 (with the idea ... .JieS and ... .Jixc3) 6 tiJf3 O-O

w In practice, Black has gained equal play here; for example: a) 7 g3 c6 8 .Jig2 cxdS 9 cxdS exdS 10 O-O tiJa6 11 tiJh4 tiJc7 12 e4?! (12 tiJfS should maintain the balance) 12 ... .JieS 13 tiJxdS, Marin- C.Bauer, European Team Ch, Batumi 1999, and here 13 ... tiJfxdS! 14 exdS fif6 gives Black the upper hand. b) 7 e4 exdS 8 exdS c6 9 .Jie2 cxdS 10 cxdS tiJa6 11 O-O.!:te8 12 .JigS h6 13 .JiM tiJcs 14 tiJd4, Knaak-Planinc, PolanicaZdroj 1979, and now both 14 ... tiJce4 IS tiJxe4 .!:txe4 16 tiJfS .JieS and 14 ... .!:tc8 IS tiJfS .Jif8!? are complex but look perfectly satisfactory for Black.

After S. .. .Jie7 6 g3 .Jif6 7 .Jid2 tiJe7 8 .Bg2, Chemyshov came up with the rather bizarre manoeuvre 8 ... tiJc8!? 9 tiJh3 tiJd6 10 b3 tiJa6 followed by ... tiJcs controlling e4. Worth a try! 6g3 White intends .i.g2 and either tiJf3-d4 or tiJh3-f4. 6 ... tiJa6 6 ... g6 is a standard English Defence response to dS, since White has cleared the long diagonal for Black's g7-bishop, but here (unlike the lines below with ... .Jid6-eS), Black's bishop has no direct contact with c3, which means that the crucial manoeuvre ... tiJa6-cS is no longer pos- sible after 7 .Jig2 .Jig7 8 tiJh3! 0-09 O-O tiJa6 10 b4! (D).

The knight on a6 has no moves: 10 ... tiJe4 (White is about to play .l:Ibl or .Jib2 with spatial domination, and 1O ... tiJxdS 11 tiJxdS exdS 12 .JixdS+ .JixdS 13 ~xdS+ ~h8 14 .JigS doesn't help matters) 11 tiJxe4 fxe4 (1l....JixaI12 .JigS lie8 13 ~xal fxe414 .Jih6 .~.f7 ISl:.dl! threat- ens tiJgS, .Jixe4, dxe6 and general mayhem; the knight on a6 is useless) 12 .!:tbl exdS 13 cxdS ~e7 14 tiJgS ~h8 IS tiJxe4 with an extra pawn and positional superiority, Piket-Plaskett, Mon- dariz 2000.

Theory shuttles back and forth between verdicts of equality and a modest ad- vantage for White. The main appeal of 3 a3 is that it steers clear of the dramatic counterat- tacks that Black can play versus 3 e4. For his part, Black will have a relatively safe position, but he will often have to be satisfied with oper- ating from a position with less space and fewer tactical possibilities. You'll find that positional skill is at a premium in these lines. Finally, White can head for many other set- ups if he plays 2 lbc3 or 2 lbf3, as seen in the following game: Marjanovic - Ivanisevic Yugoslav Ch, Subotica 2000

[diagram]
Upon 2lbf3 iLb7, Black can always opt for a Queen's Indian set-up with ... e6 and ... lbf6, or enter into a Symmetrical English with ... cS. However, he has an important alternative plan when White plays g3 on this or the following move: a) 3 g3 (this is equivalent to 2 g3 iLb7 3 lbf3) and now 3 ... iLxf3!? 4 exf3 cedes the bishop-pair for positional compensation. Black usually continues with 4 ... cS (D) (he can also play 4 ... e6, with ... c6 and ... dS to come). w I won't go into the very lengthy details, but 3 ... .i.xf3 can be a good psychological weapon because it interferes with White's common in- tention to playa 'simple' English set-up with g3, iLg2, lbc3 and e3 or e4. The advantage of 4 ... cS is that it controls the weak point on d4. In response, White can develop by some combina- tion of lbc3, .i.g2 and O-O, but in doing so, he allows Black to fortify his grip on d4 and gain a strong outpost there by, for example, ... lbc6, ... g6 and ... iLg7. Since that is highly unattrac- tive, White almost always plays 5 d4!. Now S. .. cxd4 6 ~xd4lbc6 transposes to line 'b', or something very similar, but Black has the op- tion of S. .. lbc6!?, a provocative attempt to con- test d4 directly. Play usually goes 6 dS lbd4 7 iLe3lbfS. While White has tried several moves here, Black seems to equalize versus all of them, including the most frequently-seen 8 iLd2 g69 iLc3 .i.g7 10 iLxg7 lbxg7; for example, Knott-Summerscale, British Ch, Millfield 2000 went 11 iLh3 lbh6 12 O-O lbhfS 13 lba3 lbd4 14 lbc2 lbgfS IS lbe3 lbd6! 16 f4 O-O 17 b4 WIIc7 18 a4 fS 19l:ta3lbe4 20 .l:i.d3 eS with a fine position for Black. b) 3lbc3 (this is thought to be more precise than 3 g3) 3 ... e6 4 g3 .i.xf3!? (again, conceding a bishop to gain more control over d4; 4 ... lbf6 S .i.g2 cS would transpose into one of the Hedge- hog lines of the English Opening - see Volume 3) S exf3 cS 6 d4! cxd4 (this time 6 ... lbc6 7 dS lbd4 is regarded as inferior after 8 iLe3 lbfS 9 iLh3!) 7 ~xd4 lbc6 8 'ilfdl .uc8 (D) (not the only move, but it indirectly targets the c4-pawn).

124 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

w Again we have a case of White having the bishop-pair and open e- and d-files, which offset his weaknesses (the doubled f-pawns and the central squares d3 and d4). Play can continue 9 .i.f4!? .i.M 10 ':c1 tDge7 11 a3 .i.xc3+ 12 .l::txc3, as in Fridman-Mainka, Recklinghausen

1 b3 (D)

White himself may wish to take advantage of the benefits of a queenside fianchetto by play- ing 1 b3, sometimes known as Larsen's Open- ing, or the Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack. As I've mentioned, the top-level players use this move relatively infrequently, because Black has con- servative set-ups which neutralize White's pos- sibilities. Nevertheless, we'll look at a few of

126 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

the more lively lines, with a couple of games that illustrate the paradoxes inherent in reversed positions. But first, let's walk through some initial moves.

[diagram]
If Black can play this most cooperative of moves and get away with it, especially in con- junction with ... d5, that's not a good sign for White's ambitions as a whole. We'll test that theory in a couple of games. But first, let me de- scribe, without serious analysis, just a few of the many other ways that play can develop, with an emphasis on themes that cross over from opening to opening: a) 1...ttJf6 2 .i.b2 g6 (not the only move, of course) 3 .i.xf6!? (most other moves allow a comfortable King's Indian position following ... .i.g7, ... O-O and ... d6) 3 ... exf6 4 c4 (D).

Compare this position with the English De- fence variation I c4 b6 2 ttJf3 .i.b7 3 ttJc3 .i.xf3 4 exf3 c5! from the previous section. In that case, Black had a more interesting game than White does here, because d4 was a weakness and White had some looseness in his position. This happened because of White's move c4, whereas ... c5 isn't present in our reversed line. I should also mention that I b3 c5 2 .i.b2 ttJf6 3 c4 g6?! (more commonly arrived at via I c4 c5

2 b3 ttJf6 3 .i.b2 g6?!) 4 .i.xf6! exf6 5 ttJc3 fol-

lowed by g3 and .i.g2 combines the best of both worlds for White, because Black cannot carry out ... d5. Anyway, in the diagram position after 4 c4 (in the I b3 version), White's position is sound enough. Nevertheless, Black has no serious weaknesses, and can develop naturally by .. .f5 and ... .i.g7 or even win space by 4 ... d5!? 5 cxd5 'iVxd5 6 ttJc3 'iVa5, as played successfully in several contests. b) 1...c5 2 .i.b2 ttJc6 (D) and now: w bI) 3 ttJf3 d64 d4 (otherwise 4 ... e5) 4 ... cxd4 5 ttJxd4 .i.d7 and now 6 g3?! permits the ad- vance 6 ... e5! with the idea 7 ttJb5 ~a5+ 8 ttJIc3 d5! 9 'iVxd5 .l:.d8 and White is in trouble, be- cause ... .i.e6 and ... a6 is threatened. That illus- trates the danger of permitting your opponent a central majority. b2) 3 e3 d6 (3 ... e5 4 .i.b5 ttJge7 and 3 ... ttJf6 are also options) 4 ttJe2 (Odessky's recommen- dation, rather than 4 d4 cxd4 5 exd4 d5!) 4 ... e5 (after 4 ... ttJf6 5 d4 cxd4 6 ttJxd4 e5 or 6 ... g6, Black has few problems and his central major- ity may come into play) 5 d4. Now 5 ... cxd4 6 exd4 'iVa5+!? with the idea 7 .i.c3 ~d5 is one route. Another is 5 ... exd4 6 exd4 ttJf6!, since 7 d5 ttJb4 followed by ... .i.f5 and sometimes ... 'iVa5100ks good, but so does 7 dxc5 d5!, with the kind of isolated pawn position in which

MODERN QUEENSIDE FIANCHEITO 127

Black's activity is at least sufficient for equal- ity. c) l...dS 2 .i.b2 has another large complex of possibilities attached to it; we shall examine just a couple. White would often like to see something along the lines of 2 ... cS!? 3 e3 (3 lZ'lf3?! f6! is a famous positional trick, when Black achieves ... eS; then 4 d4?! is a poor re- sponse in view of 4 ... cxd4 followed by ... eS) 3 ... lZ'lc6 4 .i.bS, with a reversed English De- fence a tempo up in which he reserves the op- tions of lZ'lf3, lZ'le2 and/or f4. After 2 ... cS, we often get positions resembling those of the Nimzo-Indian and Queen's Indian Defences. Of course, 2 ... lZ'lf6 is safe and sound, as is 2 ... .i.fS; play may enter the realm of the Reti Opening if White combines g3 and c4. Another popular defence begins with 2 ... .i.g4!?, trying to get the bishop out in front of the pawn-chain following ... e6. This can go in many directions, such as 3 g3 c64 .i.g2lZ'lf6 SlZ'lf3, when S ... e6 6 O-O lZ'lbd7 7 c4 leads to a Reti Opening, with an optional d4. But Black can also play independ- ently for ... eS; for example, S. .. lZ'lbd7 6 O-O (6 d4) 6 ... .i.xf3!? 7 .i.xf3 eS. Finally, Odes sky analyses the rare gambit 3 f3 with the idea e4; for example, 3 ... .i.hS 4 e4 dxe4 S ~e2! threat- ening to win a piece with 6 ~bS+. Apparently this was even played by Kasparov! Let's return to 1...eS (D): w 2 .i.b2lZ'lc6 Naturally, 2 ... d6 can't be bad; then 3 e3lZ'lf6

4 c4 (4 d4 exd4 and after S exd4 dS White's

bishop is not happy on b2, but following S .i.xd4 lZ'lc6 Black will win the bishop-pair or gain more time; 4lZ'lf3 cS!? has the idea S d4?! cxd4 6 exd4 e4 7lZ'lfd2 dS) 4 ... lZ'lc6 S lZ'lc3 g6, and White will want to develop slowly, since 6 d4?! exd4 7 exd4 dS or 7 ... .i.g7 is at least equal for Black. 3e3

3 c4 is of course possible; it is an English

Opening with the less-than-inspiring b3 and .i.b2 thrown in. 3 ... d5 3 ... lZ'lf6 is a well-known continuation. A few ideas: a) 4 c4 dS S cxdSlZ'lxdS 6 a3! (D) prevents ... lZ'ldM and is a useful Sicilian Defence move in its own right.

al) Here I think that 6 ... g6! has been under- rated. White is supposed to gain the upper hand by 7 i.bS i.g7 8 lZ'lf3, putting direct pressure on eS and c6. A few games have proceeded 8 ... i.g4, when both 9 'iVc2 and 9 h3 favour White. But here the pseudo-sacrifice 8 ... O-O! turns things around; for example, 9 .i.xc6 bxc6 10 lZ'lxeS (10 i.xeS .i.xeS 11 lZ'lxeS "V$ gS 12lZ'lf3 'iVxg2 13 J:tgl 'iVh3 14 J:tg3 ~d7 IS ~c2 J::te8 and White's light squares are weak) 1O ... ~gS lllZ'lf3 'fixg2 12l:.g1 'iVh3 13 .i.xg7 <3;;xg7 14 lIg3 'fifS, and the combination of ... .i.a6 and ... l:.fe8 causes White difficulties. a2) The main line goes 6 ... .i.d6 7 'iVc2 O-O 8 lZ'lf3 'fiIe7 9 d3 fS 10 lZ'lbd2 <3;;h8!? (10 ... .i.d7 11 .i.e2l:.ae8) 11 .i.e2 .i.d7, and here instead of 12 O-O .l:.ae8, Odes sky recommends 12lZ'lc4 with a kind of dynamic eqUality. Some players will enjoy this Sicilian Defence structure as White. b) 4 .i.bS .i.d6!? (a surprising number of games and much analysis have been devoted to this move; although I should say that 4 ... d6 S

ttJe2 {so as not to block the f-pawn} 5 ... i.d7 is satisfactory for Black, with the idea 6 O-O g6; upon 6 d4, Black can play 6 ... exd4 7 ttJxd4 i.e7 or 6 .. :~e7 7 O-O g6) 5 ttJa3 (D) with the idea ttJc4.

Now there are all kinds of crazy lines with 5 ... ttJa5!? (to stop ttJc4) 6 i.e2 a6 7 c4 O-O, and 5 ... a6 6 i.e2; for example, 6 ... i.e7 7 ttJc4 e4. In Walti-Shabalov, Suhr 1992, Black played the fascinating move 5 ... e4!? (with the idea ... i.e5 or ... ttJe5), leading to 6 ttJc4 i.e7 7 i.xc6 (7 ttJe2? ttJb8! and ... a6 or ... c6) 7 ... bxc6 (7 ... dxc6 gives active play and equality) 8 ttJe2 O-O 9 ttJg3?!

'i:l¥xc5 14.l:'tc 1 would favour White slightly. Let's return to 3 ... d5 (D): w Here we have the Owen Defence Reversed, surely a position in which White can play for advantage. Of course, as with many reversed openings, you'll find that White's extra move will sometimes tip Black off to the appropriate defence. For a more thorough discussion of this phenomenon, see Chapter 6. 4i.b5 This pin is consistent with everything we learned from the Owen. If White is reduced to 4 c4 d4 (4 ... ttJf6 5 cxd5 ttJxd5 is a playable Re- versed Sicilian), then he's admitting to having achieved nothing with 1 b3. And 4 ttJf3 can be met by 4 ... f6, or simply 4 ... e4 5 ttJd4 ttJxd4 6 i.xd4 a6!? (versus i.b5+, which would follow if Black played 6 ... c5) 7 d3 (7 i.e2 'iVg5!) 7 ... c5 8 i.b2 ttJf6 9 i.e2 i.e7 10 O-O O-O, with even chances.

4. •. i.d6 5 f4

This is certainly the usual continuation in both the Owen and English Defences: when the f-pawn can't be captured, it makes sense to use it to break up the opposing centre. If Black de- fends e5 with pieces, then an exchange on e5 establishes a central majority. However, with the advance f4 come some problems, namely, a lack of development and exposure of the king- side, so it's worth noting that White has several less critical and less explored moves: a) 5 ttJf3 f6 6 c4 (6 d4!? is interesting; for example, 6 ... e4 7 ttJfd2 f5 8 ttJc4!? with the idea 8 ... dxc4 9 d5) 6 ... a6 7 cxd5?! (7 i.xc6+ bxc6 8 ttJc3) 7 ... axb5 8 dxc6 bxc6 with the bishop-pair and good central control. b) 5 ttJe2 ttJe7 6 O-O O-O 7 f4 i.e6 8 ttJbc3 f6 and both sides have plenty of play. In fact, 5 ttJe2 would be a good starting point for your in- vestigations. c) 5 c4 dxc4 (or 5 ... ttJe7) 6 bxc4 (6 i.xc4 'iUg5!? 7 ttJf3 ~g6 is an interesting set-up) 6 ... i.d7!? (6 ... ttJe7 is also logical and sound) 7 ttJf3 ttJb4!? (a remarkable move that seems to work; Palliser disapproves of 7 ... 'iUe7 8 c5! i.xc5 9 i.xc6 i.xc6 10 ttJxe5, when White has a central majority, but Black has a bishop-pair after 1O ... i.d5 and this really isn't much) 8 i.xd7+ 'i'xd7 9 O-O ttJd3! 10 'iUb3 ttJc5 and the exciting 11 'iVc2 e4! 12 i.xg7? exf3! gave Black a superb attack in Van Arkel-Posch, COIT. 1987. Instead, 11 'i'c3 needs to be tested, to which the best response is again 11...e4!, when a long forcing line would be 12 ttJe5! (12 'i'xg7 exf3 13 'iUxh8 O-O-O gives obvious compensation)

[diagram]
White seeks to weaken Black's kingside and at the same time soften up the al-h8 diagonal. However, this is not necessarily his best course: a) 6 fxeS?! fxeS 7 iLxc6+ bxc6 8 iLxeS?? is a blunder: 8 .. :~h4+ (8 ... iLxeS 9 ~hS+) 9 g3 'iVe4 10 iLxg7 ~xhl! (l0 ... iLg4 11 4:Jc3! iVg6 12 iLxh8 iLxdl 13 4:Jxdl is almost equal!) 11 ~hS+ ~e7 and White can't make his attack work, especially because 12 ~f2 fails to the cute 12 .. .i Lxg3+!' b) 6 4:Jh3 (D) is completely logical, devel- oping and defending f4 without getting in the way of the queen's path to hS. If you've looked at the English Defence lines above, you'll recognize that after 6 ... iLxh3?! 7 '*lVhS+ g6 8 ~xh3, White controls the light squares and has good chances. Versus 8 ... exf4, Odessky's 9 4:Jc3! fxe3 10 dxe3 (10 ~xe3+! looks better still) with the idea O-O-O gives White more than enough for the pawn. Unfor- tunately, Odes sky ultimately (and overdramati- cally) gives 6 4:Jh3 a '?!' because of the line

6 ... 4:Jge7 7 fxeS fxeS 8 O-O iLfS!, which he thinks can't be cracked. Surely White can get as much play here as in any other equal position. True, Odes sky is convincing in his dislike for 9 ~S+ iLg6 10 iVf3 'i¥d7; nor is he a fan of 9 iLxc6+ bxc6 10 4:Jf2 O-O 11 d3 4:Jg6 12 e4 iLe6. But White should attack the centre by 9 c4 a6 (9 ... O-O 10 cxdS 4:Jb4 11 4:Jf2! a6 12 iLe2) 10 iLxc6+ bxc6 and now 11 d4!?, threatening cS, or 11 ~S+ g6 12 'iib4. As far as I can see, 6 4:Jh3 is one of White's best opportunities in this S. .. f6Iine. 6 .•. g6 7 'iVh4 Now White has potential or actual threats to win the eS-pawn, which Black usually liqui- dates right away: 7 ... exf4 (D) 84:Jf3 This move hasn't scored brilliantly. Two al- ternatives are critical, and perhaps better: a) 8 exf4 ~f7!? 9 4:Jf3!? (a big decision; 9 iLxc6?! bxc6 10 4:Jf3 ~g7! 110-0 4:Jh6 with the

(10 .td3! .tfS 11 O-O! is very unclear) 1O ... ~g7, Gonsior-Novak, Czech- oslovakia 1979. Suddenly Black threatens ... liJfS and he's also ready to fortify the centre with ... c6; the knight on eS isn't doing much. b) Odessky suggests that 8 liJe2 may be best. Then Fontana Sotomayor-Palomar, Aragon 1992 was a short affair: 8 .. .fxe3!

w Black's doubled c-pawns and isolated a-pawn. White's f-file is useful in that regard, with ideas such as l:!f4-a4 in waiting.

If you have the patience to wade through it, however, you'll be pleasantly surprised with how much fun the variations are, as well as gaining new systems to use in your games.

5 Gambits

First, what is a gambit? In the broadest terms, it's the sacrifice of a pawn or two in the open- ing. Sometimes a piece sacrifice is also called a 'Gambit' (e.g., the Cochrane Gambit in the Petroff: 1 e4 e5 2lbf3 lbf6 3lbxe5 d6 4lbxf7), but I think that it's most accurate to restrict the term to pawn sacrifices, and to ones that arise in the early stages of the opening. Of course, there's a hazy line here between 'early stages' and later ones. In the Marshall Attack of the Ruy Lopez, for example, Black doesn't give up a pawn until his 8th move. Some might con- sider that more of a pawn sacrifice than a gam- bit. The distinction isn't important in that case; however, if you look at a long list of named gambits, you'll see that they almost all sacrifice a pawn within the first five moves, and very of- ten on the second or third move. Up to this point in the series, we haven't dealt with a great many gambits. To some extent, that's because they tend to be lacking in the standard themes that I've emphasized through- out. For example, we usually won't see much similarity in pawn-structures between a partic- ular gambit opening and the more conventional openings that we are used to. Nevertheless, when taken as a set, gambits share fundamental characteristics. We shall see, for instance, that almost every gambit emphasizes free piece- play. In addition, most gambits are designed to control the centre, whether by the influence of pieces or by a superior pawn presence. In gam- bits which depend upon early attacks, that cen- tral advantage is often cashed in for tactical gains; in positional gambits, it tends to persist for a while. Oddly enough, there are two fun- damentally opposed techniques by which a gambiteer tries to take charge of the middle of the board. In some gambits, a flank pawn is sacrificed for the opponent's central pawn, thus establishing a central majority. In others, para- doxically, the gambiteer sacrifices his centre pawns for the sake of rapid piece development, and then uses those pieces to control the central squares. Both approaches are perfectly legiti- mate; I'll talk further about this distinction be- low. What about the person on the other side of the board, who is charged with defending against a gambit? What techniques are avail- able to him? Broadly speaking, there are two basic approaches. Some players are happy to grab a pawn or two; they find that their extra material makes up for some temporary discom- fort, and fully expect the pressure to abate after they play some accurate defensive moves. Other players, however, don't want the bother of de- fending against an attack, or of suffering under positional constraints, so they'll decline many or all gambits. Similarly, some will accept the gambit pawn(s), but then return them soon thereafter, in order to catch up in development or improve the central situation. In fact, there are gambits that have disappeared from ordi- nary practice because declining or returning the material proves so effective. In any case, all three of these methods of defence are justified in the appropriate situations. How important are gambits? Because of their rarity at the highest levels, it's easy to underes- timate their influence and utility. For each gam- bit mentioned in this chapter there corresponds one or more books, and/or sections of books, devoted to its investigation, along with articles and masses of master games. With a few ex- ceptions, in fact, I can't possibly present a sig- nificant percentage of the theoretical details behind these openings because there is so much material. But I shall try to outline the most im- portant variations and subvariations, along with what I think are the most critical defences. More importantly, I want to describe the basic ideas behind selected gambits, and point out their positive and negative qualities. It's true that some gambits are of dubious or marginal worth if the opponent knows how to defend precisely. But others are perfectly sound, and your chess education will be seriously lacking

134 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

without exposure to this unique opening form. In that context, the words of Grandmaster Alex Yermolinsky are enlightening: "From the early days of my development as a chess-player I hated gambit play ... I just couldn't accept this as chess ... All classic gam- bits seemed to lead to the same scenario: White (in most cases, but sometimes it can be Black- anyway, a gambiteer) has to rush things up, has to try to transform his short-lived initiative into an attack against the black king. If it works out, he wins a beautiful game ... if not - I don't know, those games never seem to get published - maybe he loses? "Looking back I realize now, things were not so simple. My stubborn refusal to accept gambit playas an important part of chess strategy inevi- tably caused me to miss something. I missed a chance to learn how to play wide open posi- tions, when your pieces seem to be hanging in the air, and there are maybe 2-3 moves given to you to create something, before they get ex- changed or driven back. The hard work I had to put up to overcome this case of arrested devel- opment ... could have been easily avoided if I had given myself a little practice in my younger days." In what follows, I've looked at a few gambits in more detail than they would seem to merit from their frequency of use. That's because, in contrast with positional openings, the precise move chosen in a gambit is often the difference between life and death. Interestingly, it's some- times easier to discover original ways of play- ing .gambit openings, and defending against them, than it is to come up with new ideas in openings which are, at least superficially, under fewer constraints. I think that's mainly because gambits haven't undergone as thorough a reap- praisal with the assistance of computers as have a number of the more mainstream openings. It turns out that there are numerous flaws in the analysis which has been handed down from au- thor to author over the years, which is all the more reason to take an interest in this area. Primitive Gambits One large group of gambits consists of straight- forward attacking enterprises. Here structural issues and long-term gains are of considerably less concern than the immediate success of di- rect assault. Most of the time, this means that the gambiteer sacrifices a centre pawn for rapid development and open lines. I don't use the word 'primitive' in a derogatory sense; after all, direct attack can be very effective. Let's see some examples, starting with those classic gam- bits that Yermolinsky was referring to: Danish and Goring Gambits Many of the oldest gambits begin with 1 e4 e5, which is logical in view of the fact that 1 e4 is already the fastest developing move, and 1...e5 one of the most committal replies. The Danish Gambit is a fascinating attempt to jump all over Black from the outset, and you can certainly use it to play for a win, especially against oppo- nents within your own rating range or some- what higher. It's not the kind of opening to play casually, however; without a fair amount of study, there a risk that you either won't recover your material or that there will be an unfavour- able simplification. Fortunately, the positional and tactical ideas are great fun to go over, so you'll find yourself easily motivated. Linden - Maczuski Paris 1863

This move-order doesn't necessarily indi- cate that White wants to playa Danish Gambit, but it avoids the need to study openings begin- ning with 2 ttJf3like 2 ... d6 and 2 ... ttJf6. For ex- ample, the Goring Gambit begins 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 d4 exd4 4 c3 dxc3 5 ttJxc3, yet 2 d4 exd4 3 c3 dxc3 4 ttJxc3 will often come to the same thing. See the note to 4 i..c4 below. 2 ... exd4 3 c3 (D) With this move White makes it a gambit. 3 ttJf3 ttJc6 (other moves could be investigated) 4 ttJxd4 is a Scotch Game where White has by- passed the main-line Petroff. 3 'iVxd4 (the Cen- tre Game), while by no means bad, loses time after 3 ... ttJc6. For the consequences, I'll refer you to the standard theoretical sources. After 3 c3, White plans to sacrifice pawns in return for open lines and a direct attack on Black's king. Before getting into the details in

GAMBITS 135

the next few notes, it's worth playing over the main game itself in order to get a feel for this fundamental idea. 3 ... dxc3 Most gambits can be declined, and at this juncture Black has several instructive ways to do so; for example: a) 3 ... d5 4 exd5 Wixd5 5 cxd4 ttJc6 6 ttJf3 (perhaps the best way to keep the queens on is 6 i.e3, which Nigel Davies argues is more likely to produce complications; for example, an orig- inal piece placement arises after 6 ... ttJf6 7 ttJc3 i.b4 S ttJe2!?, intending a3; then the most criti- cal line is S. .. i.g4!? 9 h3!?, introducing another pawn sacrifice: 9 ... i.xe2 10 ..txe2 ~xg2 11 i.f3 Wig6 12 Wib3 followed by O-O-O, as sug- gested by Voigt and MUller) 6 ... ..tg4 7 ttJc3 ..tb4 S ..te2 (D).

This is a position that can arise from the Goring Gambit via 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 d4 exd4 4 c3 d5 5 exd5 Wixd5 6 cxd4 ..tb4+ 7 ttJc3 ..tg4 S ..te2. Oddly enough, it can also come up in the Chigorin Defence to the Queen's Gambit De- clined! That is, from 1 d4 d5 2 c4 ttJc6 3 ttJf3 ..tg4 4 e3 e5 5 cxd5 ~xd5 6 ttJc3 ..tb4 7 ..te2 exd4 S exd4. At any rate, the best-known solution was played by Capablanca: S. .. ..txf3 9 .txf3 ~c4, when White can't castle and c3 hangs, so he needs to commit: al) 10 ~b3 ~xb3 and now 11 ..txc6+ bxc6 12 axb3 transposes to the 10 ..txc6+ bxc6 11 'iYb3 line, while 11 axb3 ttJge7 has proven solid for Black in many games. a2) Marshall-Capablanca, Lake Hopatcong 1926 went 10 ..te3!? ..txc3+ (Black can also play 10 ... O-O-O, when 11 'iVb3 is pretty much forced anyway) 11 bxc3 'iYxc3+ 12 ~f1 'iVc4+ 13 ~gl ttJge7 14:tel ~xa2 15 l:tal ~c4 16 l::tcl lh-1f2. a3) 10 ..txc6+ bxc6 11 ~e2+ (l1lWb3 Wixb3 12 axb3 ttJe7 is thought to be equal; maybe all the weak pawns even out! But either side can press on with ambitions of winning) 11...~xe2+ 12 ~xe2 ttJe7 13 ..te3 ttJf5 14l::thdl O-O-O 15 l::td3l::theS 16 l:f.adl with balanced play, Velim- irovic-Ziatdinov, Kusadasi 1990. It's hard for either side to make real progress. Nevertheless, several positions along the way can be played for a win with either colour. b) 3 ... ttJe7 isn't played much, because Black seems to be cutting off his own pieces (the queen and fS-bishop). However, he wants to continue ... d5 and gain access to key light squares after White advances the e-pawn. A knight on the more natural square f6 would be subject to tempo-gaining e5 attacks. After 4 cxd4 d5 (D), White has to decide what to do about his e-pawn. w

136 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

One example out of many is S eS (S exdS ltJxdS leaves Black with the ideal blockade of White's isolated queen's pawn, and faster de- velopment to boot; S ltJc3 dxe4 6 ~c4!? has been suggested, when 6 ... ltJfS! 7 ltJge2 ltJd6 looks like a good reply) S ... ltJfS (a well-posted knight; Black can also play S. .. cS 6ltJf3 ltJec6 with pressure on White's centre) 6ltJc3 ~e7!? (6 ... ~b4 is more aggressive, with the idea of tar- geting White's d-pawn in a line like 7ltJf3 O-O 8 ~e2 ltJc6 9 a3 ~a5 10 O-O ~b6 11 ~e3 ~e6 and .. .f6, with chances for both sides) 7 ltJf3 O-O 8 ~d3ltJc6 9ltJe2 (here 9 ~c2! has kingside at- tacking designs) 9 .. .f6 10 a3? (White tries to stop ... ltJb4, but this is much too slow; 10 O-O is correct) 1O .. .fxeS 11 dxeSltJh4! (a standard idea, eliminating the defender) 12 ltJxh4 ~xh4 and White can't defend both his e-pawn and f-pawn in view of 13 ~f4 (13 g3ltJxeS 14 gxh4?? ltJf3+ IS 'iiii>f1 ~h3#) 13 ... ltJxeS! 14 ~xeS ~xf2+ IS 'iiii>d2 'iVgS+ 16 ~f4 ':'xf4 17 ltJxf4 'iYxf4+ 18 'iiii>c2.1i.g4 19 ~f1 cS with an overwhelming at- tack, Voigt-Hector, Hamburg 2000. Both sides have numerous ways to generate play in this line. Compare 2ltJf3 ltJc6 3 d4 exd4 4 c3 ltJge7 in the next game. c) 3 ... d3 removes some of the dynamism from the position, but it's a bit passive and there's a whole game ahead after 4 ~xd3ltJc6 (4 ... dS S 'iVe2 dxe4 6 .1i.xe4 ~e7 7 ltJf3 ltJf6 8 .1i.c2 O-O 9 O-O) S ltJf3 d6 6 O-O (or 6 i.c4!? ltJf6

7 O-O), when White has better central control.

d) I should mention that 3 ... ltJf6 4 eSltJe4 is very awkward for Black because of S "iWe2!. Compare the gambit in the next game, in which White has the same configuration but has com- mitted to ltJf3, meaning that the move f3 isn't available. 4~c4 White gives up a second pawn for space and development. 4 ltJxc3 is the important move- order mentioned above in the note to 2 d4, played by Alekhine and recommended by Nigel Davies. Then after 4 ... ltJc6, S ltJf3 is a Goring Gambit, of which the next game is an example. But White also has S ~c4 and can retain more flexibility by not committing his king's knight. After 4 ltJxc3, Black won't want to continue 4 ... ltJf6?! S eS! 'W/e7 6 ~e2. Note also that after 4 ... ~b4 S i.c4 ltJc6, 6 ltJf3 is the main line of the Goring Gambit (see the next game), but 6 ltJe2!? is a sensible alternative, protecting c3 and leaving White's f-pawn able to advance at a later time. 4 ... cxb2 5 ~xb2 (D)

5 ..• ~b4+ It is considered that the Danish is theoreti- cally sound, and there's no way for Black to guarantee himself the better game. But there are a number of respectable alternatives that give satisfactory play, and some whose assess- ments are not established. Here is a selection: a) A miserly solution that used to be talked about in older books is S. .. c6 6ltJc3 d6 7 ltJf3 ltJd7!, with the idea of meeting 8 O-O with 8 ... ltJcS. I won't go into the details, but by means of ... i.e6, Black hopes to snuff out White's at- tack, while he is covering key squares such as dS and b3.It's difficult to believe that Black can play so slowly, but the line illustrates how well pawns that cover central squares can serve as de- fenders; in that respect, you might compare the Sicilian Defence. The other move that goes with this sequence is 8. .. ltJb6, to gain time on White's bishop, intending 9 ~b3 ~e6. Of course, White still has a dangerous attack, and also has many options on moves 6, 7 and 8; for example, he can try to combine ltJc3 and "fIie2/c2 with O-O-O, while ltJdS can be a sacrificial theme. Strange to say, although S ... c6 and 6 ... d6 used to be a standard recommendation, no modem source that I've seen mentions it. b) S. .. d6 can lead to all sorts of positions and transpositions. Since 6 ... ~e6 is a threat to break the attack, White often plays 6 ~b3 "fIid7 (6 ... ltJh6 is complex) 7ltJc3, intending 7 ... ltJc6 8 ltJdS, and if 8 ... ltJaS, then 9 "fIig3!. This may

GAMBITS 137

not be decisive, but it retains a strong attack for the two pawns. c) S. .. dS is a very well-known idea. Black can either give back both pawns and seek equal- ity, or try to hold on to one of them. Play contin- ues 6 i.xdS (D) (6 exdS blocks off White's attacking bishop, allowing 6 ... lLlf6 7 lLlc3 i.d6 with a solid extra pawn).

There is extensive theory here, and I'll try to present just enough for you to work with: c1) 6 ... lLlf6 is tricky: 7 i.xf7+!? (this seem- ingly devastating move only wins a pawn, but re-establishes a material balance; 7lLlc3!? lLlxdS S lLlxdS is an ambitious way for White to retain more chances - then S. .. lLld7! has the idea ... c6 and avoids the ancient trap S. .. c6? 9lLlf6+! gxf6 10 'iVxdS+ 'ittxdS 11 i.xf6+) 7 ... 'ittxf7 S'iVxdS i.b4+ (Black's point) 9 'iVd2 i.xd2+ 10 lLlxd2. This simplified position was once regarded as favourable for Black because of his queenside majority, but it is probably about equal (after all, White has a kingside majority!). Play can con- tinue 1O . ...l::.eS 11 lLlgf3 (or 11 i.xf6?! gxf6 12 ttJgf3 ttJa6 13 O-O b6! intending ... i.b7, ... lIadS and ... lLlcs; 11 f3 is a consolidating option, al- though eventually White would like to get his kingside majority moving with f4) l1...lLlc6 12 O-O i.g4 13 lIfel lIadS 14 h3 i.e6 with a bal- anced and unresolved position. c2) 6 ... i.b4+ and now: c21) 7 'It>f1?! is well answered by 7 ... lLlf6!, with the idea S 'iVa4+? lLlc6 9 i.xc6+ bxc6 10 'iVxb4?? (but after 10 eS 'iVd3+ 11 lLle2 i.a6 12 'iVxc6+ lLld7 Black wins at least a piece) 1O ... 'iVd1+ 11 'iVel i.a6+ 12 lLle2 i.xe2+ 13 'ittgl 'iVxel #. c22) 7 lLlc3 i.xc3+ S i.xc3 lLlf6, and once White has lost his attacking piece on dS, he may still have enough compensation for the pawn, but no more than that. His best line seems to be 9 'it'f3 lLlxdS 10 exdS O-O 11 lLle2, when in practice, the opposite-coloured bishops - fa- vouring the attacker - have combined with prospects of lLlg3-hS or lLlf4-hS to produce balanced results. c23) 7 lLld2 (this maintains a threat on g7) 7 ... i.xd2+ (after 7 ... lLle7, White might play S i.xf7+ 'ittxf7 9 ~b3+ lLldS! 10 O-O-O! 'iVe7 11 exdS and Black's king is exposed; 7 ... 'ii;>fS!? is a curious alternative, protecting g7 and dodging ~a4+; the Danish Gambit is by no means worked out) S "i!Vxd2lLlf6 9 ~gS (9 'it'c3!? is an alternative: 9 ... c6 10 i.b3 O-O 11 lLlf3 i.e6!? and here White might try 120-0 'iVe7 13lLld4!?) 9 ... O-O 10 O-O-O 'iVe7 11 lLle2 with some at- tacking prospects. Black has a material plus, however, and 'dynamically equal' seems a fair verdict. 6 lLlc3 lLlf6 7 lLle2 (D)

White develops calmly. Black has to be care- ful that eS doesn't create big trouble, and sim- ply 'iVb3 with O-O-O is also in the air. 7 ••. lLlxe4? This is really too greedy. Black should try to develop something by 7 ... lLlc6 or 7 ... O-O, or break in the centre with 7 ... dS. I've chosen this game to illustrate the most elementary gambit situation, in which rapid development and open lines triumph over material advantage. 80-0! Now every white piece is out, and lLlxe4 is a threat, along with lLldS.

I'm going to switch to heavier analytical mode, because it's so important to know precise moves if you're going to enter into either side of this opening.

White can also proceed in Danish Gambit style with S i.c4, which opens up some new possibilities after S. .. cxb2 (S ... c2!?) 6 i.xb2, but in the end, the simple S. .. lbf6 (with the idea 6 eS dS!) is probably best answered by 6lbxc3 or 6 O-O d6 7lbxc3, transposing to other main lines below. S. .. d6 also transposes after 6lbxc3, but if White is a lunatic, he can try Marshall's amazing re- sponse 6 'it'b3 ~d7! (guarding f7 and threaten- ing ... lbaS) 7 ~xc3!!??

Again, White's sneaky move-order with 2 d4 (described in the last game) might have given White more leeway in these lines, since without having com- mitted to lbf3, he could play an early lbge2, f4 or even iib3, just to take the game out of main- stream theory. At any rate, it's easy for Black to go wrong in the Goring, and even fairly strong players can

get in trouble after 5 ... ~c5!? 6 ~c4 d6 7 ~3

The most important line goes 7 ... flid7 (with the idea ... tDa5; 7 ... tDa5 8 ~xf7+ ..t;>f8 9 ~a4 ..t;>xf7 10 ~xa5 leaves Black's king a bit ex- posed, and the advance e5 will be a theme) 8 tDd5!; for example, 8 ... tDge7 (8 ... tDa5? 9 ~c3 tDxc4 10 ~xg7) 9 'ii'c3! O-O 10 O-O tDg6?! (re- turning the pawn by 1O ... tDxd5 11 exd5 tDe5! 12 tDxe5 dxe5 13 'iWxe5 ':'e8 gives Black roughly equal chances) 11 b4 ~b6 12 a4 tDce5 13 tDxb6?!

White really has to develop speedily at all costs. 6 ... d6 6 ... ~xc3+ 7 bxc3 d6 is also possible. It usu- ally transposes (8 'YWb3, for example, is the note to 7 O-O) but has the benefit of forcing White to capture with a pawn on c3. In principle, White could exploit this move-order with ~a3 and e5, but that's hard to implement successfully. Simply 6 ... tDf6 is a major option. Then the line 7 e5 d5 (7 ... tDe4?? 8 'i'd5) 8 exf6 dxc4 9 'i'xd8+ tDxd8 10 fxg7 lIg8 has been around for a long time. Now: a) 11 O-O!? ~xc3 (versus tDd5) 12 bxc3 is a unique and little-tested approach. White gives up the g-pawn in order to gain pressure in the centre and on the queenside: 12 ... f6 (upon 12 .. J:txg7 13 lIel+, play can go 13 ... ~e6 14 ~f4 ':'c8 15 lIe2 with ideas of tDd4 or tDg5; nor is 13 ... tDe6 14 ~h6 lIg6 15 ~f4 attractive) 13 .l:f.el+(l3tDd4..t;>f714~f4c615~d6l1e816 .:tfe 1 tDe6 17 ~f8 ~d7 18 tDxe6 will be drawn) 13 ... ..t;>f7 14 lIe4!? b6! 15 ~h6 ~b7 16 lIxc4 tDe6 (16 ... ~xf3! 17 gxf3 ..t;>g6 18 ~f4 c5 19 ~g3 tDe6) 17 tDh4! ~d5 18 .l:ta4 tDxg7 19 lIdl ~e6 20 f3 tDe8 21 ~f4 tDd6 22 ~xd6 lIgd8, and the action subsided in Ketola-A.Ivanov, ICCF email 2004. b) Traditionally White plays 11 ~h6 ~xc3+ 12 bxc3 (D).

Now Black has pursued two main paths. The resulting lines are very concrete: bl) Black mayor may not stand satisfacto- rilyafter 12 ... tDe6 130-O-O, but it's easy to fall into trouble; for example, 13 ... tDxg7 (l3 ... tDc5? 14 tDg5 tDd3+ 151Ixd3! cxd3 16 tDxh7 ..t;>e7 17 l:tel + ~e6 18 f4 f5 19 g4 ..t;>d6 20 gxf5 ~xf5 21 tDf6 with a winning game, Levy-Karaklajic, Cienfuegos 1972) 14 lIhel+ (or 14 tDh4!?) 14 ... tDe6 (l4. .. ~e6 15 g4! and now 15 ... lId8?! 16 tDd4! .l:f.d5 17 f4..t;>d8 18 ~xg7 lIxg7 19

Now Black has two ways to protect e6, and some fascinating attacking themes result from both: a1) With iO ... ~c8, Black decides that he wants to look after his b7-pawn as well: 11 lbgS (11 .Jta3!? looks inviting, with the idea of eS, either immediately or in conjunction with lbgS) 1l...lbd8 (1l...<t;e7? 12 .Jta3! has the idea 12 ... h613lbxe6!; after 12 ... lbh6, there can follow 13 f4 intending eS, or even 13 eS!? with the idea 13 ... lbxeS 14 f4 lbef7 IS lbxe6!; the whole line with iO ...

However, the position is rela- tively unexplored. For example, White might try the simple 11 lbd4, which threatens 'iixb7 as well as a capture on e6 (the book line is 11 ~xb7 l::tbS 12 iYa6, when 12 ... lbf6!, with good piece- play, is almost certainly better than 12 ... lbge7 13 .i.e3 O-O 14l::tabl with an edge for White).

I've given a lot of details in this section, so that you can pick up this open- ing right away if you're interested. Milner-Barry Gambit The Danish and Goring Gambits are classic ex- amples of 1 e4 e5 gambits which jettison cen- tral pawns for development and attack. The same idea can be used against other openings. Here's an example from the French Defence. R. Moyer - B. Kaczmarek corr. 1969

This is the traditional main line of the Ad- vance Variation.

6.Bd3

In the vast majority of cases, White plays this move with the intention of gambiting the d-pawn. We saw 6 .Be2 in the introductory

146 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Chapter 3 of Volume 1, and 6 a3 is also played; both of those moves keep White's d-pawn de- fended by the queen on d 1. B 6 .•. cxd4 7 cxd4 .Jtd7 (D) Black prepares to capture on d4. Notice that 7 ... liJxd4?? loses a piece to 8 liJxd4, since 8 .. :~xd4?? 9 .JtbS+ costs Black his queen. w 80-0 Formally speaking, it is this move that intro- duces the Milner-Barry Gambit. White's d-pawn cannot be comfortably defended, since 8 .Jte3? allows 8 .. :iVxb2, and 8 .Jtc2 runs into 8 ... liJb4 9 .Jtb3 (to preserve the bishop-pair generally, and his good bishop in particular; 9 .Jta4 'ilVa6! threatens ... liJd3+) 9 ... 1I¥a6!, preventing castling and preparing ... liJd3+. White can also gambit the pawn with 8 liJc3 first, which normally transposes after 8 ... liJxd4 if White continues with the natural 9liJxd4 'ilVxd4 10 O-O (10 'ilVe2 has the drawback that Black can play 1O ... f6!; compare the next note). Here the bold move 9 liJgS !? is sometimes tried and might be fun to play, although like other slower moves in the Milner-Barry, it allows Black to retreat and at- tack the e-pawn via 9 ... liJc6!. 8 ..• liJxd4 9liJxd4 'ilVxd4 10 liJc3 (D) 10 'iVe2 first can run into the instructive 1O .. .f6!, decimating the centre and frustrating an attack; for example, 11 exf6 (11 'ilVhS+ ~d8 12 1I¥f7liJe7! develops quickly; Black's extra pawn and superior centre more than make up for his king position) ll...liJxf6 12 liJc3 i.d6 with ideas of ... WVeS, ... 'iVh4 and ... O-O. If Black wants to, he can also answer 10 ~e2 by 10 ... a6, when 11 liJc3 liJe7 transposes to the main line with- out Black having had the chance for 10 .. :iVxeS. After 10 liJc3, we should ask what White has for his pawn, and why he is offering Black an- other one. Essentially, the answer is the same as in the Danish and Goring Gambits: he has cleared out central lines and taken a lead in de- velopment. But there are some differences: in those double e-pawn examples, White con- trolled the centre with a pawn on e4 facing one on d7 or d6. Here he faces a central majority of pawns and a very solid black pawn-structure. Thus White has little long-term compensation, and the onus falls on him to drum up quick ac- tion with his pieces. 10••. 'ifxe5 (D) Now it's a truly 'primitive' gambit, with both centre pawns cleared away. While 1O ... 'ii'xeS is the riskiest move, losing still more time without developing, it is in some sense the most princi- pled: Black gains not only a key central pawn, but a 2:0 majority in the centre. In the next game we see 10 ... a6. w 11 l:te1 'iVd6?

GAMBITS 147

Black loses even more time in this way. He should return one of the pawns and get devel- oped by 11..:~b8! 12liJxdS i.d6, which is an- other main line that is held to be at least equal for Black. White can try to work up chances by 13 'iig4 ~f8 14 i.d2, when a typical sequence is 14 ... hS IS 'iih3 liJh6 16 liJe3 ~g8 17 liJc4 iLf4 18 i.xf4 'iixf4, after which White has to improve upon 19liJeS?! liJg4 20 ~g3 'iVxg3 21 hxg3 liJxeS 22l:f.xeS i.c6 23 i.e4? f6! 24 l:!xe6 ~f7, Weeramantry-Berrocal, Turin Olympiad 2006. 12 liJbS! i.xbS 12 ...

In fact, that's what happens. But you should re- alize that this is only because of the unusual ex- tent of that lead in development. If it were Black's move, for example, he could develop straightforwardly (by ... liJf6) and even have a substantial advantage, because it's so difficult to attack a strong pawn-centre without the help of pawn-breaks. That's why so few gambits rely entirely upon piece-play. 14 'iihS! After 14 'iif3?!, a nice example went 14. .. f6?

Morra Gambit Versus the Sicilian Defence, the gambit that most follows a primitive line-clearing policy is the Morra Gambit. Many books and articles

150 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

have been written about the Morra, including whole ones about specialized subvariations, so I'll have to be content with presenting a struc- tural overview that concentrates upon the most important variations. In doing so, I'll attempt not to skimp too much on details so that the reader can get a good start on a Morra and/or anti-Morra repertoire. My apologies in advance for the density of coverage; these are unruly lines, and sometimes the moves are more im- portant than the explanations! Hardarson - de Firmian Copenhagen 1999

1 e4 c5 2 d4 cxd4 3 c3 (D)

White offers a pawn. Notice how the combi- nation of 2 d4 and 3 c3 resembles the Danish and Goring Gambits.

3 ... dxc3 Most of the time, Black takes up the chal- lenge and accepts the pawn. As usual, he can decline the gambit in many ways, among them the following: a) 3 ... d3 denies White's knight access to c3, but doesn't gain a tempo or occupy the centre. A common idea is 4 .i.xd3 (4 c4!?) 4 .. .'~Jc6 (4 ... dS? S i.bS+) S c4, establishing a kind of Maroczy Bind. b) 3 ... dS 4 exdS 'i!VxdS S cxd4 is a line from the I e4 cS 2 c3 Sicilian, that is, 2 ... dS 3 exdS 'i!VxdS 4 d4 cxd4 S cxd4. However, in that line, Black ordinarily doesn't exchange on d4 at this early a stage, so his options are somewhat re- duced, and he must tread a little carefully. One long-established continuation is S. . .'~Jc6 6lbf3 eS (6 ... i.g4?! 7 lbc3) 7 lbc3 i.b4 8 i.d2 i.xc3 9 i.xc3 e4 10 lbeS. c) Similarly, 3. .. lbf6 4 eSlbdS is a main line of the 2 c3 Sicilian (1 e4 cS 2 c3 lbf6 3 eS lbdS

4 d4 cxd4). To be well prepared on either side,

you should consult the theory of the 2 c3 Sicil- ian. d) 3 ... eS!? used to have a poor reputation, but is not so bad. One variation goes 4lbf3lbc6 S i.c4 (S cxd4 exd4 6 lbxd4 and now both 6 ... i.h4+ and 6 ... lbf6 7 lbxc6 dxc6 8 'ilkxd8+ 'it>xd8 9 f3 are known lines which offer White a very slight edge) S. .. i.cS!?

The reason that Black doesn't decline the Morra Gambit more often is that the methods of doing so are unambitious, and in many cases slightly inferior. If nothing else, his winning chances are appreciably reduced. 4lbxc3 (D)

J:ta7-d7 is the defining idea of the Chicago Defence: Black intends to shore up d6, thus dissuading the attacking move e5 for the foreseeable future. Then ... Sl.b7 may well fol- low, or simply ... tbf6 and ... Sl.e7. The rook also supports a potential ... d5. In return, White gets a few tempi to decide where to put his pieces. He can, for example, play Sl.e3 and tbd4, con- templating sacrifices on e6, but also preparing to attack with f4-f5. Actually, Black has a number of move-orders with which to introduce ... .l:ta7-d7, and 8 ... .l:ta7 may not be as accurate as Langrock's prefer- ence 8 ... tbc6! 9 "iVe2 .l:ta7 (upon 9 ... Sl.e7 10 l:!dl .l:ta7 11 Sl.e3 .l:td7, the remarkable piece sacri- fice 12 tba4! bxa4 13 Sl.xa4 has been tested and analysed, with White apparently holding the upper hand) 10 Sl.e3 .l:td7 11 .l:tac1 Sl.b7, and now 12 tbd4 is a sound way to continue the at- tack, but Langrock-Reddman, Cuxhaven 2001 saw 12 tbxb5!? axb5 13 "iVxb5 tbge7 14 tbd4 tba7!

Notice that White's attacking themes in this note are not all that different from the ones we see in mainstream Sicilian Defence variations. b) The Finegold Defence tries to develop the queenside first, and can involve a funny-looking fianchetto of the queen: 6 ... tbf6 7 O-O a6 (or 7 ... Sl.e7 8 fie2 a6) 8 ~e2 b5 (or 8 ... tbbd7) 9 Sl.b3 tbbd7 10 .l:tdl (D).

Let's return to 4 ... ttJc6 (D). w 5 ttJf3 S iLc4 is an appealing move-order finesse. Then someone looking to escape the books and stay aggressive as White might consider S ... d6 6 f4!? with the idea of ttJf3 and a potential eS. Against S. .. e6, however, 6 f4?!, is strongly met by 6 ... iLcS!, so White should probably trans- pose with 6 ttJf3. A possible advantage of S iLc4 could come in the line S. .. g6, when White has various tries to avoid the main lines given in the next note (which deals with S ttJf3 g6). For example, 6 ~3!? (6 iLgS i.g7 7 'ilVdS!? e6 8 'ilVd2 might be worth a try) 6 ... e6 (6 ... ttJeS 7 iLf4 ttJxc4 8 'ilVxc4 d6 9 ttJdS) 7 ttJf3 ttJaS 8 'ilVa4 a6!

S. .. g6 is known as the Fianchetto Defence, which has a sound reputation. If Black can get ... i.g7 and ... d6 in, his position will be well-nigh unassailable. Therefore, to justify his gambit, White needs to act quickly.

6 ... a6 Many players feel that this is the most reli- able defence in the Morra Gambit complex, or at least the easiest to play. Black retains the idea of ... ..tg4, and also the flexibility to decide be- tween ... e6 and ... e5. In any case, we've come to a major splitting point where Black needs to commit to a structural choice. One of the main defensive lines begins with 6 ... e6, but you might also want to check out the move 6 ... ltJf6, which, if playable, can cut down the number of White's options: a) 6 ... e6 7 O-O leads to two other standard positions: al) 7 ... ..te7 8 'i*'e2 a6 (8 ... ..td7 9 l:f.dl and now 9 ... a6 transposes, while 9 ... ltJf6 10 ..tgS! introduces the idea of ..txf6, damaging Black's pawn-structure, and prepares to double on the d-file; naturally, that's not fatal for Black, but keeps the game lively) 9l:f.dl (D). This is White's basic set-up in the Morra Gambit. As befits a 'primitive' gambit, White relies mainly upon piece-play, almost never re- sorting to f4 or g4-g5, as he does in the Open Sicilian (see Volume 1). Instead, development by ..te3, ..tf4 or ..tg5 follows, hoping to exploit the weaknesses in Black's position, such as d6 and b6, and, with luck, using his single pawn- break e5. Black can argue that he has an extra pawn and a central majority, the latter covering all of White's potential forward posts cS, dS, eS and f5. His problem, of course, is catching up in development. Some sophisticated players use the following move-order: 9 ... ..td7 (Black de- lays ... ltJf6 so as to prevent White from placing his bishop on g5 early on; he also blocks the d- file in the face of 10 eS) 10 ..tf4 eS 11 ..te3ltJf6 12 l:td2 O-O 13 Itadl h6 (13 ... b5 14..tb3ltJaS! is recommended by Langrock, although White might bailout with the tactic ISltJxeS!? ltJxb3 16 axb3 dxeS 17ltJdS! ltJxdS 18 .l:txd5, when 18 ... ..te6! 19 l::txd8 l:f.fxd8 looks about equal) 14 ltJh4!? ltJa5 (14 ... b5 IS ..tb3 b4 16 ltJa4 ltJxe4 17 ..tb6 ltJxd2 18 ..txd8 ltJxb3 leads to equality, according to Langrock) 15ltJg6ltJxc4 16 ltJxe7+ 'i*'xe7 17 'iUxc4 ..te6 18 'iib4 :ac8 (18 ... b5!? 19 :xd6 .l::i.fb8 has the idea of ... ltJe8 and/or ... a5) 19 .l:txd6 l::tc4 20 ~6 :fc8 21 f3 .l:.4c6 1/2-1/2 N.Regan-Holm, London 1994. a2) 7 ... ltJf6 8 'iUe2 ..te7 9 .l::!.dl eS!?

Black sacrifices a whole tempo and cedes the dS-square, but stops eS and intends ... ~g4 to increase his new-found control over d4, or sim- ply ... ~e6. As compensation for Black's extra pawn, White has space and control of the dS- square. One important line goes 10 ~e3 (10 h3 has been played a lot, when 10 ... O-O 11 ~e3 ~e6 or 11.. .a6 is a typical follow-up) 10 ... O-O (1O ... ~g4 11 h3 ~hS!? 12 g4 ~g6 13lLlM! in- tends lLlfS) 11 b4! (a typical queenside space- grab) 11...~g4 (l1...lLlxb4 12lLlxeS eliminates Black's hard-earned central presence) 12 a3. This position introduces a middlegame that ap- pears about equal. White doesn't have immedi- ate threats, but Black has some issues with the weakness of his dS-square, and has to find a way to redeploy his forces. b) 6 ... lLlf6!?, sometimes thought to be dubi- ous, has the advantage that after 7 O-O (7 ~gS e6), Black can play 7 ... a6 and transpose into the line 6 ... a6 7 O-O without having to face 6 ... a6 7 ~gS. White's standard reply has been 7 eS (D).

Now Black can't play 7 .. .lbxeS?? 8 lLlxeS dxeS?? 9 ~xf7+; this is a recurring theme in gambit play. Nor is 7 ... dS 8 ~bS comfortable. Two others: bl) After 7 ... dxeS?! 8 'ikxd8+ lLlxd8 9lLlbS ~b8, White should continue 10 lLlc7+!

Finally, we return to 6 ... a6 (D): w 70-0 Already White might want to look for some- thing harder-hitting. An often-recommended idea for him is 7 ~gS, with the line 7 ... lLlf6 8 ~xf6 gxf6 9 O-O e6 (9 ... l:tg8!?) 10 lLld4. It has been pointed out that this is virtually the same position as a sideline of the Richter-Rauzer Si- cilian with the same tempi but White having a pawn less! After 1O ... ~e7, intending ...

11...ttJeS) is effective. White has almost noth-

The developing player would do well to try out the Morra Gambit upon occasion. It can serve to improve your tactical skills, while throwing a lot of Sicilian Defence players off balance. Even in slow openings such as the Caro- Kann Defence, there are respectable gambits in this category; for example, White clears out the centre for activity in the variation 1 e4 c6 2 4Jf3 dS 3 ttJc3 i.g4 4 h3 i.xf3 5 'iixf3 e6 6 d4 dxe4 7 4Jxe4!? ~xd4 8 i.d3, intending to attack with the help of the open central files. Blackmar-Diemer Gambit

1 d4 by its nature develops less dramatically

than 1 e4, but I should mention some fairly mainstream examples of primitive gambits in d-pawn openings. The most obvious example is the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit, which goes 1 d4 d5 2 e4 dxe4 and either 3 f3 or 3 4Jc3 4Jf6 4 f3 exf3 5 4Jxf3, the latter a mirror-image of the Goring Gambit. Once more, there are books and many publications on this opening. There are many wonderful traps and tactics in the Blackmar-Diemer, and it may be worth experi- menting with, but I don't think it quite holds up against accurate defence. To keep the coverage concise, I'll bypass much of the fun and give a respectable example: Alexander - Golombek British Ch, Nottingham 1946

Unfortunately, serious move-order issues can interfere with White's plans in the Blackmar- Diemer. Here 2 4Jc3 ttJf6 3 e4 is also played, when 3 ... dxe4 transposes. But Black can also play 3 ... ttJxe4 4 4Jxe4 dxe4, which has been pretty effective in practice. Some fans of the gambit are willing to accept that and work around it. Others feel that 2 e4 dxe4 3 4Jc3 may be the best move-order, even if White has to deal with 3 ... e5 in the note to Black's third move. 2• •• dxe4 3 4Jc3 Upon the immediate 3 f3, 3 ... eS! is known to be good.

'ii'xdl +. b) 4 ttJxe4 has several answers, an ambi- tious one being 4 .. :~xd4 5 i.d3 f5, while after 4 ... exd4, the common reply 5 i.c4 seems to end up in Black's favour after 5 .. .'ike7 6 ~e2 i.f5. c) Nor is the slow 4 i.e3 exd4 5 'ii'xd4 'ii'xd4 6 i.xd4 ttJc6 appealing. d) White has often played 4 'ii'h5, but the countergambit 4 ... ttJf6! 5 'ii'xe5+ i.e7 subjects him to difficult pressure. e) 4 ttJge2 ttJc6!?

4 f3 (D)

4 ••. exf3 Black can also decline the gambit. Among other tries, 4 ... c6 is a particularly useful semi- waiting move. Black's first point is that 5 fxe4 e5! makes structural gains. Black has the advan- tage after 6 dxe5 (6 d5 is met by 6 ... i.b4; 6 ttJf3 exd4 7 ~xd4 'ii'xd4 8 ttJxd4 may be best, but both 8 ... i.b4 and 8 ... i.c5 with the idea ... O-O and ... ttJbd7 leave White with little compensation for the isolated e-pawn) 6 ... 'ii'xdl + 7 'iiitxdi ttJg4 8 ~el ttJxe5, when he has a powerful out- post on e5 in front of the isolated pawn. Other moves for White include 5 i.c4 'ii'a5! and 5 i.g5 ttJbd7, which is a variation of the Veresov Opening, that is, 1 d4 d5 2 ttJc3 ttJf6 3 .tg5 ttJbd7 4 f3 c6 5 e4 dxe4. In that line, 6 fxe4 e5! 7 dxe5 'ii'aS! with the idea 8 exf6 'ii'xg5 is known to be at least equal for Black. Finally, 5 ttJxe4 isn't what White wants in terms of structure (the pawn on f3 is misplaced); then 5 ... ttJbd7 already equalizes or more. 5 ttJxf3 Black has an overwhelming record versus 5 ~xf3? His pawn advantage is safe after 5 ... g6 or 5 ... c6, which leave no weaknesses in the po- sition. With care, Black can also get away with 5 ... ~xd4!, since White can't win enough time attacking the queen to succeed in attack.

[diagram]
This is one of the better defences. Black strengthens his control of d5 without blocking off his queen's bishop, which can develop to f5 or g4. To my mind, the frequently-played alter- natives 5 ... e6 and 5 ... g6, analysed in remark- able detail over many years, offer White more chances to work up a significant attack. 6 i.c4 (D) Black does very well against other moves; for example, 6 ttJe5 ttJbd7 (or 6 ... i.f5), and 6 i.d3 i.g4!' 6 .•. i.f5 White gets what he wants after 6 ... i.g4?? 7 ttJe5! i.e6 (7 ... i.xdl?? 8 i.xf7#; 7 ... i.h5?? 8 'ii'xh5) 8 i.xe6 fxe6 (Black's isolated e-pawns are not only targets, but they also imprison Black's bishop) 9 O-O ttJbd7 10 i.f4 ttJxe5 11

That's a mirror image of the Morra Gambit. A more original idea arises in the Queen's Gambit Semi-Slav sequence 1 d4 dS 2 c4 c6 3lbc3 e6, if White continues 4 e4!? dxe4 (4 ... i.b4 is the most promising way to decline the offer) S lbxe4 i.b4+ 6 i.d2!? 'iVxd4 7 i.xb4 'iVxe4+ 8 i.e2 (D) (or 8 lbe2). White has again allowed the capture of both central pawns in order to develop quickly and open lines. The difference here is that in addi- tion to attacking chances, he has gained an es- sentially positional advantage: the dark squares in Black's camp have lost the natural protection afforded by Black's king's bishop. Neverthe- less, this sacrifice has the usual drawback of a 'primitive' gambit, that is, White's pressure on those squares is not supported by central pawns, and there are no immediate ways to break down Black's solid pawn-structure. Therefore Black will frequently manage to consolidate, espe- cially when he succeeds in playing ... e5 and freeing his bad bishop. Theory goes back and forth with respect to how this imbalance plays out, but I should say that 4 e4 has been one of White's most respectable gambits at the highest levels for many years. You may have noticed that I haven't yet mentioned any gambits by Black in the 'primi- tive' category. It's asking a lot for Black, al- ready a tempo down, to offer valuable centre pawns in pursuit of attack. For example, you sometimes see Black try 1 d4 eS 2 dxeS d6?! 3

160 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

exd6 i.xd6 at lower levels of play, but that has yet to attract much interest among masters. If White plays 4 tLlf3, he is not even behind in the number of pieces developed. On the other hand, I f4 eS 2 fxeS d6 3 exd6 i.xd6, known as the From Gambit, has a long history of grandmas- ter practice. Clearly, that's because of the fact that 1 f4 doesn't help White's development and somewhat exposes his king. See Chapter 6 for some analysis. Similarly the gambit 1 e4 cS 2 f4 dS 3 exdS tLlf6 4 c4 e6! S dxe6 i.xe6 clears out Black's centre, but leaves holes all over White's position (the moves f4 and c4 have not been productive) and gives Black a lead in develop- ment. The Hennig-Schara Gambit is a good exam- ple of a 1 d4 opening in which Black plausibly abandons his centre pawns for activity. It be- gins 1 d4 dS 2 c4 e6 3 tLlc3 cS 4 cxdS cxd4!?

The dynamic old main line continues 10 e3 "iYe7 11 i.e20-O-O 12 O-O gS! 13 b4!. White returns the pawn to launch a queenside attack after 13 ... i.xb4 14 ~b3. Positional Gambits When modem chess was first developing, gam- bits were almost always used as a means to es- tablish an attacking game. Today, those gambits are still with us (see above), but we often play gambits which are positional in their orienta- tion. In these, the gambiteer retains an influen- tial pawn-centre, which is usually part of his compensation. The most common strategy em- ployed is the sacrifice of a flank pawn to estab- lish a full and often mobile pawn-centre. This can involve giving up a flank pawn in order to divert one of the opponent's centre pawns, thus establishing a pawn-majority. Or it might in- volve surrendering a flank pawn with the goal of gaining time, which is then used to establish a large centre. Note that this is the opposite of the strategy in the previous section, which in- volved clearing out one's own centre pawns! Let me begin by listing some of these gambits and examine a few others via games. To begin with, there's the King's Gambit, discussed in Volume 1: 1 e4 eS 2 f4. White of- fers his f-pawn in order to draw Black's e-pawn away from the centre. Then, ideally, he will be able to play an effective d4 and develop his pieces quickly around a mobile centre. Black has several gambits which employ the same philosophy, the two most prominent of which are the Latvian Gambit (l e4 eS 2 tLlf3 fS) and the Schliemann Defence to the Ruy Lopez (1 e4 eS 2 tLlf3 tLlc6 3 i.bS fS). The Queen's Gambit (discussed in Volume 2) is not a real gambit, at least in its pure fonn 1 d4 dS 2 c4 dxc4, because White can recover his pawn quickly. We do see a number of lines, however, in which White sacrifices a pawn for the sake of establishing a large, mobile centre; for example, 1 d4 dS 2 c4 dxc4 3 tLlf3 tLlf6 4 tLlc3 a6 S e4 bS 6 eS. An analogous line in the Slav is 1 d4 dS 2 c4 c6 3 tLlf3 tLlf6 4 tLlc3 dxc4 S e4 bS 6 eS, while 1 d4 dS 2 c4 c6 3 tLlf3 tLlf6 4 tLlc3 e6 S i.gS h6 6 i.h4 dxc4 7 e4 gS 8 i.g3 bS is a major line in the Semi-Slav. These have a rather opportunistic character, and when White succeeds he usually does so by direct assault supported by tactics, rather than by further cen- tral pawn advances.

b4 Gambits In openings which begin with moves other than B

1 e4 or 1 d4, most gambits for White are

positionally-based flank-pawn sacrifices. In the Symmetrical variations of the English Open- ing, we find various offers involving b4; for ex- ample, 1 c4 cS 2 g3 g6 3 Ji.g2 Ji.g7 4 tbc3 tbc6 S a3 e6 6 b4!? The point is seen in the line 6 ... cxb4 7 axb4 tbxb4 8 Ji.a3 (D).

Here the considerations are more positional than tactical. White's development advantage is only slight, but he has some serious pressure on the dark squares: tbbS or tbe4 might follow, and d4 and tbf3 also hit dark squares; finally, even e4-eS is sometimes an issue. In this pre- cise position, furthermore, the knight can't be easily defended in view of 8 ... aS? 9 Ji.xb4. Consequently, the pseudo-sacrifice 6 ... tbxb4 7 axb4 cxb4 is more common, when 8 d4 bxc3

9 e3 intends tbe2xc3 and Ji.a3, a gambit with

the same dark-square themes. In Volume 3, I covered this position in some detail. In the Sicilian Defence, the diversion of the black pawn from cS arises in the Wing Gambit,

1 e4 cS 2 b4, which allows White to have more

leeway in the centre following 2 ... cxb4. He can play 3 d4 or 3 Ji.b2 at that point, but more com- monly opts for 3 a3, trying to develop quickly after 3 ... bxa3 4 tbxa3 or 4 Ji.xa3 (D). White intends to construct a large centre, but he also hopes to win dark squares and pre- vent Black from castling if he plays ... e6 or ... eS; this strategy resembles the English Opening example above. Of course, there are many options for Black even before this point, including 3 ... tbf6 or 3 ... dS. The same idea (and sometimes the same pawn-structure) arises in the French Wing Gam- bit: 1 e4 e6 2 tbf3 dS 3 eS cS 4 b4 cxb4, when White can play either the central move S d4 or the developing S a3 bxa3 6 Ji.xa3. In the Scandinavian Defence with 1 e4 dS 2 exdS "iYxdS 3 tbc3 ~a5, White can play an- other sacrifice of the b-pawn, Mieses's long- discarded 4 b4!? After 4 .. :t#Vxb4, the older S l:Ibl scrounges up some activity, but has gen- erally been ineffective because after s .. :iVd6, Black develops normally. Recently, White has played S a4! with the idea 6 Ji.a3; then Black has some problems getting developed, because White can answer ... eS or ... e6 with Ji.xf8 and prevent castling, as well as gaining influence on the dark squares. Even the move as can prove useful. Of course, this gambit may tum out to be of marginal soundness, but at least it com- bines quick development with positional con- siderations. g4 Gambits in the Dutch Defence The mirror image of the Sicilian Defence gam- bit with b4 is a Dutch Defence gambit with g4. It turns out that there are quite a few of these: Ravikumar - Nasir Ali New Delhi 1982

1 d4 f5 2 g4!?

This is called the Krejcik Gambit. White un- dertakes to divert Black's f-pawn from control of e4, just as 1 e4 cS 2 b4 tries to draw Black's

162 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

c-pawn from control of d4. White has three similar and respectable ways to gambit the g- pawn: a) The move 2 h3 has the same idea of g4, but intends to recapture on g4 with his h-pawn in case of ... fxg4, while not allowing ... g3 (see the note to move 3 in the main game). This is sometimes called the Korchnoi Attack. Play can proceed 2 ... lDf6 (after 2 ... d5, White can still continue with 3 g4 fxg4 4 hxg4 i.xg4 and 5 f3 or 5 i.h3, but that looks speculative, and it's probably more sensible to exploit the hole on e5 by 3 lDf3 and 4 i.f4) 3 g4 fxg4?! 4 hxg4lDxg4 (D), and now: w al) 5 e4 d6 6 i.g5!? g6 (6 ... c6 is recom- mended by A.Watson) 7 f3lDf6 SlDc3 c6 9 'ilVd2 with positional pressure and attacking chances, Korchnoi-Kanel, Bie11979. a2) 5 ~d3! appears still stronger, and in- cludes the trap 5 ... lDf6?? 6 .l:t.xh7!. Also terrible is 5 ... lDh6? 6 i.xh6 gxh6 7 ~f5!, threatening ~h5#. Even the best move, 5 ... g6, allows 6 J:i.xh7!? .l:txh7 7 ~xg6+ l:!.f7 S 'iVxg4, which is probably somewhat better for White, and 6 ~xh7 is by no means necessary; for example, both 6 lDf3 and 6 lDh3 generate more than enough play for a mere pawn. b) Another version of a g4 gambit in the Dutch Defence stems from Alapin's move 2 ~d3, attacking f5. Then if Black chooses 2 ... e6 (2 ... d5 is probably better), White plays 3 g4 fxg4 4 h3 gxh3 (not the only move) 5 lDxh3, which is an approximate mirror-image of a line in the Sicilian Wing Gambit. White has reason- able compensation, with ideas of lDf4 or lDg5, as well as simply i.g2 and e4. c) 2 lDc3 lDf6 (2 ... d5 is the main alterna- tive) 3 g4!? is a similar idea, when 3 ... lDxg4 (3 ... fxg4 4 h3) 4 e4 forms a big centre, and then 4 ... d6 5 i.h3 keeps up the pressure. As usual, Black's e6-square is weak. w 2 ••• fxg4 (D) 3h3

3 e4 is the next game.

3 ... gxh3?! This cedes the h-file to White, who also gets rapid development against a weakened king po- sition. 3 ... g3 4 fxg3 lDf6 is a good way to de- cline the gambit. Then 5 lDc3 d5 6 i.g2 e6 7 i.f4 i.d6 S e3 0-09 'iVd2 with the idea 9 ... lDh5 10 lDge2 leads to a nicely imbalanced position, perhaps slightly in favour of White because of Black's difficulty in achieving ... e5. 4lDxh3 (D)

White picks up material; he won easily. ... b5 Gambits in the Nimzo-Indian Defence Sometimes the offer of a pawn by ... bS can be used to divert White's c-pawn. This occurs in the Benko Gambit, discussed below, where Black completes the analogy with the Sicilian and Dutch examples by playing ... bS and then ... a6. In several variations of the Nimzo-Indian Defence, we see the same idea; for example, 1 d4 tDf6 2 c4 e6 3 tDc3 ..tb4 4 e3 O-O S tDe2 bS!? 6 cxbS a6 is a gambit based upon controlling the light squares. It was developed by Vitolins. Another type of flank pawn sacrifice is seen in this game: Short - Aleksandrov European Team Ch, Pula 1997

[diagram]
This is the Leningrad System of the Nimzo- Indian. Now one of Black's primary methods of defence involves sacrificing a flank pawn: 4 ••• h6 5 ..tb4 c5 6 d5 b5 (D) In typical gambit style, Black undermines White's support of dS. 7 dxe6 7 cxbS gS 8 ..tg3 tDxdS works out well for Black. If White is going to decline the gambit, 7 'iVc2 with the idea of e4 is one of the best ways to do so. 7 ... fxe6 8 cxb5 d5 This is the point: once the c-pawn disap- pears, Black is able to establish a central superi- ority.

164 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

9 e3 O-O

The game we are following actually went 6 ... O-O 7 e3 b5 8 dxe6 fxe6 9 cxb5 d5, trans- posing to this position. I'm using the normal move-order because it avoids certain compli- cations. Now White has to deal with the pros- pect of Black's centre advancing further. 10 i.d3 a6!? (D) This is a familiar pattern for us by now: Black exchanges White's advanced b-pawn so as to activate his pieces. In fact, however, 10 ... d4 is more common, often leading to the forcing line 11 exd4 cxd4 12 a3 i.a5 13 b4 dxc3 14 bxa5 i.b7 15 lbe2 i.xg2 16 .l:tgl, when 16 ... i.f3 17 .l:i.g3! i.xe2 18 'iNxe2 seems to favour White, al- though it's still tricky. w 11 lbe2 White almost has to return the pawn and get his pieces out. One major point of 1O ... a6 be- comes clear in the line 11 bxa6?! d4 12 exd4 cxd4 (or 12 .. :~Vxd4!?, hitting the bishop on h4 15 ~xd3 i.xa6) 13 a3 i.a5 14 b4 dxc3 15 bxa5 ~xa5 16 lbe2 lbxa6 17 O-O lbc5 with ideas of ... lbxd3 and ... i.a6; then Black stands better. 11 •.. e4 12 i.e2 12 i.bl1eaves room on c2 for the queen. Af- ter 12 ... axb5 13 ~c2, 13 ... i.xc3+ 14 bxc3 e5!? has been played, but 13 ... lbbd7! 14 O-O ~b6 looks safer, with a central majority and space. ... axb5 130-0 lbe6?! Insisting upon playing with a material defi- cit. Simply 13 .. J:ta5! keeps Black's good struc- ture intact, because 14 a4 (14 a3 i.e7; 14 lbd4 i.xc3 15 bxc3 e5 16 lbf5 lbc6) 14 ... bxa4 15 i.xa4 i.d6 leaves White with a vulnerable b- pawn. 14 lbxb5 e5?! 14 ... i.c5 followed by ... ~b6 and/or ... lbb4 gives Black meaningful compensation, although White should keep a small edge. 15b3 White misses his chance: 15 i.xf6! ':'xf6 16 b3 gives him the better of it. Now Black in tum could play 15 ...

The reason why these gambits are possible in the Nimzo-Indian is that Black takes an early lead in piece development when he plays

1. .. tLJf6, 3 ... .Bb4 and 4 ... O-O while White is tak-

ing time to establish a pawn-centre. A pawn sacrifice that works on the same principle in the King's Indian Defence is 1 d4 tLJf6 2 c4 g6 3 tLJc3 .Bg7 4 e4 d6 S f3 O-O 6 .te3 cS 7 dxcS dxcS 8 ~xd8l:hd8 9 i..xcs tLJc6 (D). w Black intends to exploit his lead in develop- ment, the hole on d4, and White's dark-square weaknesses. He will usually do so by ... tLJd7, unmasking the powerful g7-bishop with tempo. Notice how bad White's bishop on f1 is. In spite of the fact that White has no overt pawn weak- nesses to target, and the queens are off the board, Black's pawn sacrifice is considered sound, and this has become his most popular line of defence versus the Sarnisch Variation. Gambits in the Reti Opening Early flank pawn gambits abound in chess. Here are a few of many positional gambits in the Reti Opening (and closely related lines of the English) which involve diverting Black's d-pawn to c4: a) 1 c4 c6 2 tLJf3 dS 3 g3 tLJf6 4 i..g2 dxc4 S O-O tLJbd7 6 ~c2 tLJb6.

You'll find many variations on these themes in opening praxis. The Evans Gambit Finally, a flank pawn may be sacrificed purely for the sake of gaining time. In the classic ex- ample, the Evans Gambit, White wants to use that time to set up a large centre. Here are a cou- ple of games and a brief survey:

This introduces the Evans Gambit, which for some time in the 19th century was the most popular attacking opening around. The Evans is still being used by some grandmasters, and received a boost from Kasparov's successful adventures with it. This charming game shows why enthusiasts love it, and I've embedded as many important lines as I can, including some fun miniatures, to illustrate the lay of the land for potential gambiteers. 4 .•• i.xb4 5 c3 i.a5 Or: a) 5 ... i.d6!? looks funny, blocking the d- pawn, but it supports e5 and therefore allows Black to castle quickly, something he often doesn't get to do in the Evans Gambit.

Positional Gambits of Centre Pawns Sometimes one side sacrifices a centre pawn (rather than a flank pawn), not for an attack, but with the object of improving his central posi- tion and/or establishing lasting positional ad- vantages. One simple example is the Albin Counter-Gambit, 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 d4, which I discussed in Volume 2; Black's d-pawn cramps White and wins territory. It has a rea- sonably good reputation. The Falkbeer Coun- ter-Gambit, 1 e4 e5 2 f4 d5 3 exd5 e4, is a king's pawn mirror image of the Albin! In modem chess it has few takers, however, because the pawn on e4 can't be maintained. In Volume 3, I discussed an early central pawn sacrifice by White which has all the char- acteristics of a positional gambit: 1 c4 lDf6 2 lDc3 e6 3 e4 c5 4 e5 lDg8 5lDf3 lDc6 6 d4 cxd4 7lDxd4lDxe5 8lDdb5 (D).

Black can also gambit a central pawn simply to free his pieces, particularly if he has a reason- able chance to recover the pawn. A prime exam- ple is the Budapest Gambit, 1 d4liJf6 2 c4 e5, challenging the centre while activating Black's dark-squared bishop. After 3 dxe5, Black nor- mally plays 3 ... liJg4 (although 3 ... liJe4, which is a true gambit, remains unrefuted and is taken quite seriously by some strong players). Then White will generally return his forward e-pawn for what he hopes will be a slight positional su- periority. For example, after 4 .Bf4 liJc6 5 liJf3 .Bb4+, one line is 6liJbd2 'iWe7, when ... liJgxe5 will follow shortly, and White counts upon the fact that his c-pawn restrains ... d5, along with the idea of a timely c5, to give him some pressure. White can also play 6liJc3 .Bxc3+ 7 bxc3 'iWe7 8 'iWd5, to hang on to his material, after which Black can drum up an initiative by 8. .. f6 9 exf6 liJxf6, with compensation for the pawn; whether it is sufficient has been debated for decades. The number of positional gambits that mas- ters play is growing every year. They are enor- mously instructive to study from both sides of the board, and I recommend adding at least one or two to your own repertoire. The Ultra-Positional Benko Gambit The most important true gambit in modern times is the Benko Gambit, whose nature is about as far as possible from the Danish Gam- bit (which we saw at the start of this chapter). Because it serves no attacking or tactical pur- pose and only aims for long-term positional pressure, the Benko Gambit was effectively ig- nored for more than 100 years of modern chess. Even the positional gambits above contain pos- sibilities of attacking the king in the long run, but the Benko is ultra-positional, in that Black's play consists of queenside pressure which may not even come to fruition until the endgame. Let's begin by examining one of Pal Benko's own games from several decades ago. In essen- tial ways, little has changed since. w Camara - Benko Silo Paulo 1973 1 d4liJf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 b5 (D) This is the Benko Gambit. 4cxb5 In the following game, I'll briefly discuss declining the gambit on this move or returning the pawn on the next move. The most important positional lessons proceed from its acceptance. 4 •.. a6 5 bxa6 .Bxa6 In the early years of the gambit, it wasn't re- alized that 5 ... g6 is more accurate, for reasons that are explained in the next game. 6 liJc3 d6 7 liJf3 When White tries to use this knight to bolster his queenside, its passive position allows Black to make a central break. Gross-Benko, Aspen 1968 is a good introduction to the gambit's character: 7 e4 .ixfl 8 ~xfl g6 9 g3 (9 liJf3 transposes to the game) 9 ... .Bg7 10 ~g2 O-O (here we have the standard formation that we discuss in the main game) llliJge2!? iVb6 12 l:tbl liJa6 13 b3 liJc7 14 f3 (everything looks solid enough) 14 ... e6!

What is Black's compensa- tion for the pawn? It turns out that there are many factors; initially, we can identify these: a) He is ahead in development. Apart from his bishop and knight, his rook on a8 is devel- oped on a useful half-open file. b) Black's undeveloped pieces have conve- nient and active squares to go to: his bishop on g7 will be a powerful, unopposed piece, his queen's knight can go to d7, and his king's rook and queen can occupy the b- and/or a-files. c) Black can put serious pressure on White's queenside pawns, especially with his g7-bishop bearing down on c3 and b2. The Benko pawn- structure is particularly instructive because it shows how unobstructed a- and b-pawns can so easily be rendered immobile. This occurs in other openings, even when the pawns are passed (i.e., in the absence of an enemy c-pawn), as long as they are on half-open files. In the Benko Gambit, White's b-pawn advance creates a hole on a3 and target on a2, whereas if his a-pawn steps forward, that forms a weak square on b3 and makes it easier to attack b2. One extra possibility for Black is to capture White's knight on c3 in a situation where White has to play bxc3. The idea is to create a further weakening of White's pawn-structure because of the newly-isolated a-pawn, weak c-pawn, and attractive outposts for Black's pieces on c4, a4 and a3. Sometimes White will get compen- sation in the form of weakened dark squares around Black's king, but in a number of posi- tions that won't have practical value. d) White's centre can sometimes be attacked by ... e6, which either gives Black a direct attack on dS if he gets to play ... exdS, or a broad and potentially mobile centre if he answers dxe6 with ... fxe6. This occurred in Gross-Benko above. e) In terms of defence, Black's pawn-struc- ture is weakness-free and his king is extremely unlikely to face attack. Importantly, White will have trouble marshalling enough forces to carry out his desired pawn-break e4-eS, because Black can aim so many pieces at that square. So, you may ask, why does White even bother to play against the Benko Gambit, given this array of inspiring features in his opponent's position? First, an extra pawn is nothing to sneer at. In addition, White has no overt weak- nesses in his pawn-structure; for all of Black's wonderfully-placed pieces, he still needs to at- tack something more times than it's defended, or to craft a pawn advance that breaks down his opponent's position. And while authors are de- scribing all the positive aspects of Black's situ- ation, they seldom mention that his queenside attack is based mainly upon piece-play; we know that such attacks are more difficult to bring to fruition than those which have the aid of pawn-breaks. It's true that Black sometimes has an opportunity to play ... fS or ... e6, but White can often prevent those moves or render them harmless. As we shall see, for example, neither of those moves is likely to be successful if White plays g3 and i.g2.

174 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

8e4 A major decision. White stakes out room in the centre, but loses the right to castle and cre- ates an interior weakness on d3. In the next game we shall see other ways of handling the position. 8 .•• .i.xfl 9 'it>xfl .i.g7 10 h3 At the time of this game, this was the most popular move.

In doing so we shall be in- troduced to some basic themes of the Benko Gambit. Once White has moved his king to g2, he must decide whether to allow ... ttJg4-eS: a) Upon 12 .l:.el, 12 ... likaS is a good move, but the most thematic idea is 12 ... ttJg4, prevent- ing eS and bringing a black knight to eS, from where it watches over c4 and d3. That needn't be fatal, of course, and Black has to be wary of playing ... c4 (intending ... ttJd3), because he gives White access to his own d4-square with the possibility of ttJd4-c6. White can respond with piece-play or pawn-play: al) 13 .i.f4 ~aS 14 h3 ttJgeS IS ttJxeS ttJxeS 16 ~e2 .l:!.fb8 17 .l:r.acl (D). 17 .. :~a6!?

To this day, Black wins many games based upon the positional ideas that appear in this game. Next, we'll look at a modem variation in which Black doesn't have such an easy time finding good squares for his pieces. Van Wely - Carlsen Wijk aan Zee 2008

1 d4 tbf6 2 c4 cS 3 dS bS 4 cxbS

White has a great many ways to decline the gambit or return Black's pawn. Here are some brief comments: a) An obvious try is 4 a4, intending 4 ... bxc4 5 tbc3. But 4 ... b4, closing the position, can sti- fle the play and make it difficult to open lines. b) 4 tbd2 has the simple idea e4, which shouldn't be too dangerous if Black quickly breaks up the centre via ... bxc4 and ... e6. White would rather have his knight on c3 in such posi- tions. c) 4 'iVc2 (D) is more subtle than 4 tbd2, still intending e4 but reserving the possibility of tbc3 and leaving a path to f4 or g5 open for his queen's bishop. Then Moskalenko suggests that the most important lines are:

c1) 4 ... bxc45 e4 e6 6 i.xc4 exd5 7 exd5 d6 8 tbc3 i.e7 9 tbge2 (or 9 tbf3 O-O 10 h3) 9 ... O-O

10 O-O tbbd7 11 tbg3 (by delaying tbf3 in fa-

vour of~c2, White now has a direct view of the f5-square) l1...tbb6 12 b3! tbxc4 13 bxc4 is a structure worth remembering, since White's space, grip on d5 and superior minor pieces outweigh Black's bishop-pair. c2) 4 ... b4 5 e4 d6 6 f4! sets up a mobile cen- tre as in the King's Indian Four Pawns Attack. White intends tbf3, i.d3, O-O and/or tbbd2 in some order. c3) 4 ... tba6 5 tbc3 (or 5 a3) 5 ... bxc4 6 e4 tbb4 (6 ... e6 7 i.xc4) 7 'iVa4! e6 8 i.xc4 i.b7 9 i.g5 i.e7 10 i.xf6 i.xf6 11 tbge2 with the idea of a3; again, delaying tbf3 proved useful. c4) 4 ... e65 e4 exd5 (5 ... bxc4 transposes to 'c1') 6 cxd5 c4 7 tbc3 with a small advantage for White. d) 4 tbf3 (D) is arguably the most signifi- cant attempt to get the better game by purely positional means. Then 4 ... e6!? is the Blumenfeld Gambit, af- ter which 5 i.g5 is an older main line, but I be- lieve that 5 dxe6 fxe6 6 cxb5 should, with care, give White an advantage. The usual responses to 4 tbf3 are: dl) 4 ... bxc4, when 5 tbc3 and 6 e4 is com- fortable for White, although playable for Black. d2) 4 ... i.b7, when among other ideas, 5 tbbd2 bxc4 6 e4 and 5 'iWc2 tba6 are critical.

d3) 4 ... b4, when 5 a3 creates queenside pos- sibilities. d4) 4 ... g6 is probably Black's safest choice, and can still transpose into normal lines follow- ing 5 cxb5, or go its own way after 5 ctJbd2 or 5 ~c2. Considerable theory is attached to 4 ctJf3, and players on both sides of this opening will benefit from its investigation. 4 ... a6 (D) w 5 bxa6 Acceptance is the principled move, but White has some important alternatives here such as 5 b6, 5 f3 and 5 e3. Each of those moves has ex- tensive theory associated with them, and if you want to build a repertoire with the Benko Gam- bit, you'll want to learn something about them as well. To keep this coverage fairly concise, I'll refer you to more specialized sources.

... g6! (D) Of all the move-order nuances in the Benko If Black plays 5 ... i.xa6 (as he did in many of the early games with this variation, including the previous one), it turns out that White can defend effectively by fianchettoing both bish- ops: 6 g3 d6 (6 ... g6 7 b3) 7 i.g2 g6 8 b3! i.g7 9 i.b2 O-O 10 ctJh3 and 11 O-O. Experience has shown that, with Black's g7-bishop neutral- ized, he will have a relatively more difficult time achieving counterplay against White's queenside. Compare the next note. w 6 ctJc3 Here, however, the line 6 b3 i.g7 7 i.b2 O-O

8 g3 is well met by 8 ... ctJxa6!, when Black's

bishop has more options and ... ctJc7 has to be taken into account: 9 i.g2 d6 10 e4 (for exam- ple, White has to be careful that his d-pawn isn't lost to a combination of ... ctJc7 and ... i.b7) 1O ... i.b7 11 ctJe2 e6! with a very effective cen- tral attack. 6 ... i.xa6 (D) w Gambit, this one most needs to be understood. 7 g3

178 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Introducing the Fianchetto Variation, the most popular choice of grandmasters today. 7 ttJf3 i..g7 8 g3 d6 9 i..g2 transposes to the main line of this game. In such a flexible open- ing there are always obscure variations hidden within the transpositions, but fortunately they tend not to be too important at this juncture. 7 .•. d6 8 i..g2 i..g7 9 ttJf3 ttJbd7 (D) w For our purposes, I'll use this move-order, because in some lines it helps Black to delay

... O-O.

Why is White taking two moves to put his bishop on a square (g2) where it is blocked by its own d-pawn? There are a few reasons for do- ing so, ones which should be more comprehen- sible when you have been through the material in the previous game: a) He gets to castle, a lUxury not afforded by the lines involving e4. b) He doesn't create any internal weaknesses such as the one on d3 that the move e4 pro- duces. c) He discourages the move ... e6, which we have seen can break up White's centre and es- tablish a mobile central pawn-mass. Now ... e6 is still conceivable, but will be an exceptional occurrence because dxe6 will extend the range of White's bishop along the long diagonal. d) Now that it isn't doing much useful work, White may actually profit from the presence of Black's bishop on a6. In fact, Neil McDonald goes so far as to say that White's bishop on g2 is in general a better piece than Black's on a6! His point is that the latter piece has nowhere partic- ularly useful to go, and in fact it gets in the way of Black's attempts to threaten White along the a-file or occupy a6 with another piece. That may sound rather abstract, but you will see that in key variations below, Black's favourite and probably best move is ... i..c8! Of course, Black mustn't be too upset with the passive position of White's bishop on g2; he should get on with his queenside play. That generally means ... O-O, ... 'iVa5 and ... .t:tfb8, as in the previous game, but he also has ideas of a well-timed ... ttJb6 in order to attack d5 and en- courage White to move his queenside pawns. 10lIbi It's remarkable how this simple move turned a previously humdrum line into White's favour- ite variation against the Benko Gambit. Granted, White's move is useful: it protects b2 and re- moves the rook from indirect attack from the bishop on g7. But the key factor is that White can play b3 at the right moment. And that's where timing comes in. In the past, White had played 10 O-O with the idea 10 ... O-O lll:!.bl, but he found himself confronted with 1O ... ttJb6!

w This causes problems with the simultaneous protection of d5 and the queenside; for exam- ple, if White now plays IIl:!.bl !?, he has to deal with 11 ... i..c4, which attacks both d5 and a2. At least that's how theory explains it. Actually, you might want to take this a bit further and see how the position plays out after, say, 12 ttJg5; I'm not sure whether this is as harmless as its lack of coverage suggests.

10. .. O-O

Carlsen has used the move-order 1O ... 'iVa5 11 i..d2 (after 11 O-O, 11...O-O will transpose, and ll...ttJb6 can be met by 12 a3! with the idea

11 b3 (D).

This move keeps Black's pieces out of c4 and a4, while in some cases preparing i..b2. Now if Black plays ... c4, White will reply b4, establishing two connected passed pawns on the queenside and making the bishop look silly on a6. Nevertheless, Black has returned to this position with some new ideas and it is still be- ing disputed today: a) 1l...i..b7 (attacking dS) 12 tiJh4! (12 e4 can be met by 12 ... i..a6!, establishing the sort of position that we got used to in the previous game) 12 ...

2004. The e4/dS structure is fine as long as

Black has no access to White's internal weak- nesses, and here the bishop on b2 neutralizes that on g7. b) 1l...i..c8!? (D) has the idea ... i..fS. If White prevents that with 12 e4?!, 12 ... i..a6! will bring us back to a familiar type of position in which Black has prevented castling and can target d3. A good illustration is 13 i..f1 'iVc8 14 i..d2 O-O IS i..xa6 ~x a6 16 'IV e2 tiJe8! 17 a4 'iVxe2+ 18 ~xe2 fS!, as in Cvitan-Matamoros, Cannes 1996, when White will have to give back his d-pawn and leave Black with a 2:0 central majority. Nevertheless, this exotic strategy (. .. i..c8-a6) is in itself proof of the efficacy of White's place- ment of his bishop on g2, in that Black's bishop on a6, so powerful in other variations, feels obliged to retreat to its home square so long as White hasn't moved his e-pawn. This corre- sponds with McDonald's observation above about the relative strengths of the two sides' light-squared bishops. Instead of 12 e4, White should move his f3-knight, and there seems to be a pleasant choice: bI) 12 tiJh4 h6 (D). w Black intends 13 ... gS and ... i..fS, forcing a response: bll) 13 'iic2 'iVd7!

'iVf5 16 e4 'iVg6 17l:Idl J.a6 18 'iVc2 O-O 19 J.b2. b2) 12 ttJd2 is also promising, covering c4 and e4. Black can still implement his plan by 12 ...

White's pieces are coordinating better than in Cvitan-Matamoros above. His knight on d2 and bishop on b2 are unusually well-placed. In Van Wely-E.Berg, Reykjavik 2008, seeing no prospects on the queenside, Black tried to play in the centre with 17 ... e6!? 18 dxe6 fxe6 19 a4! d5, but White easily neutralized the pressure after 20 l:1el 'it'd7 21 'it'e2 (21 ttJb5! is also strong) 2l...c4 (2l...d4 22 ttJb5 d3 23 'it'd1!) 22 bxc4 ttJxa4 23 ttJxa4 l:1xa4 24 cxd5 exd5 25 J.xf6!

However, if an opening survives its initial challenges, which the Benko Gambit certainly has, it tends to sur- vive later ones, so we'll see what the future holds. This chapter has described a range of gam- bits from the directly attacking to the posi- tional. In my opinion, every developing player should try to incorporate one of each type into his repertoire, if only as an optional weapon. 6 f-Pawns and Reversed Openings This chapter re-opens the topic of reversed openings, which I've already discussed at some length in the context of the English Opening in Volume 3, and to a lesser extent in other places (for example, 1...b6 and 1 b3 in Chapter 4 of this volume). A reversed opening usually refers to a case in which White plays an opening best known as a black defence, hoping to exploit the advantage of his extra move. Sometimes Black plays what is normally a white opening with a tempo less; this is the case with a couple of the double e-pawn variations I'll mention below. Obviously, for White to gain a tempo on a known variation will more often be attractive than for Black to playa known variation with a tempo less. Even so, since white systems on av- erage sport a somewhat higher evaluation than black ones, their adoption with a tempo less will not necessarily lead to a disadvantage. Up to this point in the series, I've examined openings in which the first pawn move is made by the b-, C-, d-, e- or g-pawn. In this chapter, I'm beginning with a discussion of the ne- glected f-pawn openings, namely, 1 ... f5 (the Dutch Defence, played versus 1 d4 or 1 c4), and

1 f4 (the Bird Opening). The Dutch has a sto-

ried history of use by elite players, and numer- ous devoted grandmaster advocates today. The Bird, although it has never been played exten- sively at grandmaster level, has a respectable master following and is undergoing a modest revival. I'll devote most of this chapter to a seri- ous investigation of this opening duo. Then I look at the King's Indian Attack in the context of reversed openings, since it is the other side of the King's Indian Defence coin. Finally, I touch rather lightly upon some examples of reversed openings that stem from I e4 e5; hopefully they are instructive in their own right. The study of reversed openings will increase your understanding of what can and cannot be achieved in openings. Many chess-players are mathematically oriented, with a facility for logical thinking. So it's only natural to assume that there must be some way to make use of an extra move. After all, chess moves have value, and you wouldn't voluntarily give a move away under normal circumstances. However, as we've talked about throughout these vol- umes, the worth of an extra move isn't a straight- forward matter. In reversed positions of the English Opening, for example, it's remarkable how seldom White can actually claim to have the better game. For one thing, any advantage is limited by the fact that he will usually be play- ing what are essentially defensive or counterat- tacking lines. In addition, there's a paradoxical benefit in not having to move, in that Black gets a better look at what his opponent is up to and is able to react accordingly. Thus White's strat- egy will be to try to gain something from his ex- tra move without compromising his position, and Black will try to make use of the extra in- formation revealed by that move. It sometimes happens that, if White isn't careful, he will ac- tually end up in a worse position than if he hadn't had the extra move at all! Stepping outside the practical realm, this dif- ficulty (of converting a move into something of value) is also revealing about the nature of chess itself. The paradox of information applies to every move, whether in a reversed position or not. In some sense, however sound and logical a move is, it contains the risk of leaving you worse off! That enormously magnifies the com- plexity and subtlety of the game. If advantages and disadvantages were additive in some linear fashion, chess would be a minor game at best. But we have geniuses who do little else but study and play chess from the time they are five years old into their forties, and they make mul- tiple mistakes in nearly every game, often quite serious ones! As an exercise, set up a reversed opening and try to find ways to make even mod- est improvements in your position without de- stabilizing something elsewhere on the board. You'll find that the most trivial-seeming change

I-PAWNS AND REVERSED OPENINGS 183

always seems to show up in one or another line of analysis where you're least expecting it. When you see how such a straightforward task (concentrating on only a single move) can en- tangle you in a whole complex of issues, it helps you appreciate how deep and impenetra- ble chess really is. Returning to the task before us, and before moving on to specific examples, you need to know which reversed openings are fit for inclu- sion in your repertoire. The simplest criterion is subjective: do you enjoy playing the opening in question? Strictly speaking, that's not neces- sary, but it is certainly helpful. Two other con- siderations present themselves:

1. Is the opening objectively good? For ex-

ample, let's assume that you're playing White and reversing a standard black defence; will the opening produce any advantage against accu- rate play? Does White, with a tempo more, risk ending up in a more exposed position than Black does with a tempo less?

2. If the reversed opening that White is using

doesn't produce any advantage, will it never- theless cause practical difficulties for Black? That is, are there easy ways for Black to equal- ize against it, or will he be confronted with problems to solve even after the opening phase is over? It's worth noting that the answer to this question also determines whether White plays a particular 'mainstream' opening. That is, since Black can ultimately equalize against most if not all openings, White will want to choose openings which exert lasting pressure. In con- ventional thinking, that would explain the high- level use of the Ruy Lopez (1 e4 e5 2 tbf3 tbc6 3 i.b5) rather than the Scotch Game (3 d4), the Vienna Game (2 tbc3) or any of the double e- pawn gambits. Arguably, all of these openings draw with perfect play. Similarly, among strong players, you largely see White's choice of the Queen's Gambit after 1 d4 d5. That is, he plays

e3, or 2 tbf3 with 3 i.f4. It's not that Black can't ultimately equalize in any mainstream opening; it's that against the better ones he is confronted with serious challenges and, having solved them, is still left with a complex struggle to conduct. On a practical level, this can have additional benefits such as tiring out your oppo- nent or putting him in time-trouble. Having said all that, let's move to our first set of reversed openings. Dutch Defence/Bird Opening

1 d4 f5 (D)

The Dutch Defence is a traditional and es- sentially sound opening which nevertheless re- quires precise treatment on Black's part. At the grandmaster level, therefore, it is primarily the province of loyal specialists. But for the aver- age player and even the master, the Dutch can be a particularly effective weapon. In part, that's due to a potential imbalance in knowledge be- tween opponents: most 1 d4 and 1 c4 players will allot only limited time to study of the Dutch, placing a higher priority upon much more frequently-played openings such as the Queen's Gambit and Indian systems. This situ- ation suits Black, all the more so if he applies himself to mastering the general ideas and con- crete variations of 1...f5. Black has three primary set-ups in the Dutch Defence. The Classical System includes the moves ... f5, ... tbf6, ... e6, ... i.e7, ... O-O and ... d6; the Leningrad System combines ... f5, ... tbf6, ... g6, ... i.g7, ... O-O and ... d6; and the Stonewall System consists of the moves ... f5, ... tbf6, ... e6, ... d5 and ... c6. I'll mainly concentrate upon the first two of these and discuss the Stonewall in less detail at the end of this section. The rare Antoshin System involves the moves ... tbf6, ... d6, ... c6, ... 'ilic7 and ... e5. Black's develop- ment suffers in this case, so he generally ends up in a somewhat inferior position; I'll have to

refer you to the standard remedies in theoretical works. The Dutch Defence can be thought of as a mirror image of the Sicilian Defence. In partic- ular, we see that if White plays e4 in the Dutch Defence, .. .fxe4 gives Black a central majority and a half-open f-file, just as in the Open Sicil- ian with, e.g., 1 e4 c5 2lbf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4, Black obtains a central majority and a half-open c- file. In the Dutch, Black's first goal is usually to achieve ... e5, whereas in the Sicilian, a success- ful ... d5 usually denotes equality or better. Take the position after the following se- quence:

lbc3 lbc6 6 li.e2 e6 7 O-O li.e7 8 li.e3 li.d7 9 ~h1 lbxd4 10 li.xd4 li.c6 11 'iVd3 O-O 12 f4 ~a5 (D) First, note that in all variations of the Dutch Defence, since Black plays ... d6 or ... d5 at some point, he will have a weakness on e6. Similarly, in the Open Sicilian (with 3 d4 cxd4 4lbxd4), assuming that Black plays either ... e6 or ... e5, he adopts a weakness on d6 (that applies to most variations, although not in the Dragon and Accelerated Dragon). In the Dutch, Black will generally have to castle kingside, i.e., on the same side of the board as his weakness, and he will lack the natural protection that a pawn on f7 affords a castled king. In the Sicilian Defence, w Black's corresponding weakness on d6 is fur- ther away from his normal king placement on g8, and all three kingside pawns remain on the second rank, guarding their charge. A comparison of flank attacks is also reveal- ing. After the exchange on d4 in the Sicilian Defence, Black has a potentially strong minor- ity attack on the queenside via ... b5-b4. In both the Classical and Leningrad Dutch, after an eventual e4 and ... fxe4, Black's advance of his kingside minority exposes his king. Neverthe- less, by the time White plays e4, Black's f- pawn in the Dutch Defence can sometimes as- sist a serious kingside attack by ... f4, often in conjunction with ... g5. As White's most popu- lar and arguably most promising lines nearly all stem from playing g3, li.g2 and O-O, this kingside advance, combined with moves such as ... 'iWh5, ... li.h3 and ... lbg4, can cause consid- erable havoc in White's camp. I should mention that in the Classical Variation ( ... lbf6, ... e6, ... d6 and ... li.e7), Black can also playa sort of waiting game with moves such as ... c6, ... a5 and ... lba6, delaying both ... e5 and ... g5. This time there is no analogy in the Open Sicilian, since d41. .. cxd4 has already been played; whereas, when playing Black in the Closed Sicilian, there would be no point in delaying both ... d5 and ... b5 in favour of risky moves like ... f6, ... h5 and ... lbh6. From White's point of view, the two most im- portant differences between these openings are: 1) In the Sicilian, he usually attacks in the centre and on the kingside; in the Dutch, he at- tacks in the centre and queens ide. 2) In the Sicilian, his centre is typically un- der attack from ... lbf6 and the likes of ... b5-b4,

f-PAWNS AND REVERSED OPENINGS 185

... Jtb7 and ... liJbd7-c5; it is also subject to radi- cal transformation from the move ... e5. In the Dutch, his c4/d4 centre tends to be fairly se- B cure, particularly since ... g5-g4 is a risky ven- ture; and the move ... d5 is not a realistic option in most positions (with a few important excep- tions). Needless to say, most strong players feel that the trade-offs for the Sicilian Defence are worth it as Black, whereas fewer are willing to adopt the Dutch Defence. Nevertheless, the compari- son is useful for identifying the underlying fea- tures of both openings. Leningrad Dutch Beliavsky - Malaniuk USSR Ch, Moscow 1983

I'll concentrate upon this move in all varia- tions; White plays g3 and Jtg2 in a large major- ity of all Dutch Defence lines. On an obvious level, this supports White's ideal break e4, which will open lines for White in classical fashion. Another factor is that, with pressure on b7, Black will have to be careful in develop- ing his queen's bishop. In some cases, it's im- portant that White's attack on d5 makes the move ... d5 itself more difficult for Black to play, whereas the moves ... c5 and ... e5 can sometimes weaken d5 and the centre. Finally, whether or not Black plays ... c6, the bishop on g2 supports the advance b4-b5, just as it does in the English Opening. Not surprisingly, there's more to this move, but that's best shown by ex- ample. Instead, the natural move 2 c4 can transpose, or White can go his own way. Perhaps the main sequence that Black should avoid is 2 ... liJf6 (2 ... g6?! 3 h4!, when 3 ... Jtg7 4 h5 is annoying, while 3 ... liJf6?! 4 h5! liJxh5 5 .:txh5 gxh5 6 e4 is worse still; compare the rest of this note) 3 liJc3 g6 (3 ... d6! with ... g6 next avoids the fol- lowing problem) 4 h4! Jtg7 5 h5!, intending 5 ... liJxh5 6 e4! (D). Now there is no ideal defence against White's threats of 7 .:txh5 and 7 exf5; for example, 6 ... liJf6 (6 ... e6 7 exf5 exf5 8 .:txh5 gxh5 9 'iVxh5+ 'it>f8 10 liJd5 with a huge attack, threat- ening both 'iVxf5+ and Jtg5, to begin with) 7 exf5 gxf5 8 Jtg5 (or 8 Jtf4 d6 9 'iic2 and O-O-O; or even 8 liJh3 intending liJf4; in every case, White's half-open h-file facing Black's weak- ened kingside gives White some advantage) 8 ... 0-09 'iVd2 d6 100-O-O, and White has more than enough for a mere pawn. Always be aware of this h4-h5 possibility. 2 ... d6 Sometimes Black uses this particular niove- order in order to discourage liJh3 lines (see be- low). Instead, 2 ... g6?! 3 h4! presents the kind of difficulties seen in the previous note. So the conventional move-order is 2 ... liJf6 3 Jtg2 g6

Then apart from the normal4liJf3 Jtg7 5 O-O d6, transposing to the game, White has: a) 4 liJh3, intending liJf4 followed by d5. After 4 ... Jtg7 5 liJf4, a common defence is 5 ... liJc6, intending ... e5. After 6 d5liJe5, Black's knight can't easily be dislodged from e5; a typi- cal continuation is 7liJc3 c6 8 e4 fxe4 (8 ... d6 is also playable) 9 liJxe4 liJxe4 10 Jtxe4 cxd5 11

.ltxdS e6 12 .ltg2 O-O with chances for both sides. b) Alternatively, White can play 4 c3!? with the idea of'iVb3, which both attacks b7 twice and prevents Black from castling; for example, 4 ... .ltg7 S lDh3 O-O? 6 'iVb3+ and 7 .ltxb7. Black usually resorts to ... e6 and/or ... dS at some point in order to get castled, with which he has achieved respectable results. I won't say more about these deviations, but they will repay some study. 3lDf3 Now 3 .ltg2lDf6 4lDh3 (with the idea 4 ... g6 SlDc3, looking to play dS and lDf4) 4 ... eS! de- nies White's knight access to f4, and Black has no problems following S dxeS dxeS 6 ~xd8+ ..to>xd8. Of course, there are options other than S dxeS, but Black should come out all right be- cause White's knight is poorly placed on h3. 3 ••• g6 4 .ltg2 .ltg7 5 O-O lDf6 (D) w This is the Leningrad Dutch formation for Black, distinguished by the fianchetto of Black's king's bishop. It is the choice of most modem players, although the Classical and Stonewall Variations are still important. An optimist might argue that the Leningrad Dutch is an improved version of the King's Indian Defence, because in the King's Indian, Black ends up moving his king's knight in order to advance his f-pawn, whereas in the Leningrad Dutch, the pawn is al- ready on that square! Naturally there are some limitations to that argument, but it's true that Black initially has more direct control of the centre due to the move .. .fS, and ifhe can carry out ... eS (almost always a major goal, especially in the Classical and Leningrad Variations), the companionship of his pawn on fS increases the possibility of a productive central advance. 6c4

6 b3 O-O 7 .ltb2 will be examined below.

6 ...O-O 7lDc3 (D) 7 ...' iVeS This is the modem main line of the Lenin- grad Dutch, replacing the moves 7 ... c6 and 7 ... lDc6, which used to be considered the only two respectable choices. Those moves are still important choices, of course, but I'll stick with the queen move so as to cover the essential practical details. The Leningrad Dutch is a pop- ular system and, like others, has a massive body of theory attached to it. Why 7 ... 'iVe8? It's really a matter of timing and specifics. The threat of an early ... eS limits White, who has to prevent Black from equaliz- ing with that advance, and it turns out that transferring Black's queen to the kingside (usu- ally by ... 'ii'hS) can have real benefits. Black also keeps his options open, as can be seen in the next few notes. Finally, he has a concrete defence in mind versus 8 :tel, which you will see in the game following this one. S d5 (D) White's two main strategies in the Leningrad Variation involve this central advance dS and the break e4, seen in the next game. The older move 8 lDdS has failed to produce any advan- tage after either 8 ... lDa6 or 8 ... lDxdS 9 cxdS ~bS 10 lDgS h6 11 lDh3 eS. After 8 dS, if White can play lDd4 and then enforce the opening of the e-file, the weakness on e6 will be of decisive importance. He also has the idea ofb4, .ltb2 and, at the right moment,

c5. Playing b4 has the additional benefit of dis- couraging Black from ... c6 because of dxc6 fol- lowed by b5. On the negative side, 8 d5 opens the al-h8 diagonal for Black's bishop and gives him squares on c5 and e5 upon which to put knights. White's advance is also very committal and thus allows Black to focus upon a narrower set of problems than would be presented by a more flexible move. 8 ... ttJa6 8 ... a5 is the main alternative. It forestalls White's b4 expansion on the queenside (which is a plan that can cause Black considerable dis- comfort following 8 ... ttJa6), and in doing so it secures a post on c5 for Black's queen's knight. Now 9.l:tbl is rather slow after 9 ... ttJa6 10 b3 .i.d7 (versus ttJb5) 11 .i.b2 ttJc5 12 e3 c6. White has any number of other replies, includ- ing 9 .i.e3, 9 ttJel and 9 .i.d2. I'll limit myself to 9 ttJd4, which is the most thematic move, as it covers e6 and opens up the possibility of e4. Black replies with 9 ... ttJa6 (D).

a) 10 b3 .i.d7 11 .i.b2 g5! saves Black a tempo, because in other lines he usually has to play ... h6 and ... g5, the former move contribut- ing little to his plans. One instructive variation goes 12 e3 f4! 13 exf4 gxf4 14 ttJe6 .i.xe6 15 dxe6 c6 16 ttJe2?! fxg3 17 hxg3? ttJg4!, when White has problems in the face of ... ~h5. After 18 .i.h3 .i.xb2 White has to give up a pawn by 19l:!.bl ttJxf2 20 l:txf2, etc., because 19 .i.xg4? .ltxal 20 ~xal ~g6 21 .i.h3 'iVh5! costs him more material. b) 10 e4 fxe4 11 ttJxe4 ttJxe4 12 .i.xe4 .i.h3 13 l:tel (or 13 .ltg2) 13 ... ttJc5 14 .i.hl Wif7 15 .lte3 .l:tae8 (15 ... .ltd7!? prepares ... c6, not nec- essarily immediately) 16 'iVd2 e5 17 dxe6 ttJxe6 18 ttJxe6 .i.xe6 19 .l:.tac1 b6 with equality, Van der Sterren-Nikolic, Ter Ape11994. Naturally, there's more to be said here, but White should probably look into his 9th-move alternatives. 9 ttJd4 9 .lte3 isn't bad (compare the reversed posi- tion in the Bird Opening, where it equalizes). But the most important alternative to 9 ttJd4 is 9 l:tbl (D), which removes White's rook from the long diagonal and prepares b4, both capturing territory and restricting Black's pieces.

In this case, Black almost always gives up his kingside plans for the moment and plays on the queenside with ... c6 or ... c5. Many years of theory and practice have yet to resolve this vari- ation; here's a brief look at two key lines: a) 9 ... .i.d7!? 10 b4 c6 11 Wib3!? cxd5 12 cxd5 .l:[c8 13 .Be3 ttJg4 14 .i.d4 .i.xd4!

Note how White advances every pawn in a relentless terri- torial expansion; this enhances the power of his bishops. 22 .•. c6 23 b4! .itg7 24 e3 ttJe6 25 h4! .u.xdl 26 ':xdl ':d8 27 ':bl! ~f7 28 ~g2 l:.d7 29 ~f2 a6 30 ~e2 ttJc7 31 .:n+ ~g8 32 h5! gxh5 33 gxh5 ttJe8 34 ':gl ttJd6 35 .itc2 h6 36 c5! ttJf7 37 .itf5 ':e7 38 e4 ttJg5 39 a4! ~f8 40 .:n ~e8 41 .itg6+ ~d8 42 b5 axb5 43 .ita5+ 'it>c8 44 ':dl b6 45 cxb6 c5 46 axb5 ~b7 47 .itf5 ttJf7 48 .itd7 .itf6 49 .itc6+ ~b8 50 .itc3 1·0 Bird Opening We aren't done with the Dutch Defence by any means, but I want to tum to the reversed open- ing, I f4, known as the Bird Opening, both to examine it on its own merits and in order to compare it to the Dutch. If4 (D) The Bird Opening has never had a steady fol- lowing at grandmaster level. For most players, its main drawback is that Black doesn't have to work hard enough to reach equality. In most openings, White has an initial advantage that persists for a while and requires accurate han- dling from Black in order to achieve equality. The Bird Opening doesn't present that level of challenge. In addition, some players are reluc- tant to deal with the From Gambit, I f4 e5 2 fxe5 d6, which takes the initiative away from White in the first few moves. Having said that, I f4 is perfectly respectable from a theoretical point of view and, along with other unorthodox openings, has been receiv- ing renewed attention. Today's players have an understandable desire to get away from 'theory' once in a while; that's not always pos- sible in standard openings because the most interesting systems include at least a few very lengthy variations which need to be memo- rized. By contrast, there are few truly critical variations involved if you pick a repertoire based upon I f4. The From Gambit is one of them: you have to study it (or play 2 e4, trans- posing to the King's Gambit). But this gambit has been looking increasingly shaky versus accurate play by White, and the relevant the- ory isn't too difficult to absorb (see the next note). The other lines that you'll probably want to master are those that stem from I f4 d5, a re- versed Dutch Defence. For one thing, statistics show that you will see 1.. .d5 far more often than any other reply. Although you can always avoid playing reversed Dutch positions, it's more promising and instructive to take up the challenge and see what you can do with your extra move. In fact, many I f4 players also use the Dutch Defence, so the two openings can reinforce one another.

192 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

In the first two games, I'm going to look at the reversed Leningrad Dutch variations, deal- ing primarily with the main lines. At the same time, there are many early options, and I'll try to supply enough background details so that you can get a feel for how the opening breaks down in general, and which lines might appeal to you when playing either colour.

1...d5

Obviously, Black can do without ... dS and thus side-step a main-line Dutch Defence posi- tion; for example: a) Black can contest the critical eS-square by 1...d6!?, with the idea 2 ttJf3 iLg4. Upon 2 e4, Black might play into a line of the f4 Sicil- ian by 2 ... cS, a King's Gambit Declined by 2 ... eS or choose a Pirc set-up with 2 ... ttJf6 3 ttJc3 g6 (or here 3 ... iLg4!?). You can imagine how many independent move-orders can result from this or other slow first moves. That's be- cause 1 f4 puts so few demands upon Black. b) The naturall...ttJf6 is another example: after 2 ttJf3, it can transpose to a reversed Dutch after 2 ... dS. Alternatively, Black can play 2 ... cS, 2 ... g6, 2 ... b6 or another noncom- mittal move. The position is practically uncon- strained, which is the reason so many games with the Bird Opening leave the beaten track earlyon. c) 1...ttJh6!? (D) is a curious way to get to unique positions. w This resembles variations of the Dutch De- fence in which White plays ttJh3. Black's idea is for his knight to occupy the fS-square; for ex- ample, 2 e4 (2 ttJf3 g6 and now 3 e4 dS is simi- lar; naturally, White has solid alternatives such as 3 g3) 2 ... dS 3 exdS!? (3 eS also opens the way for Black's knight to settle on fS, after 3 ... cS or 3 ... iLg4) 3 ... 'iVxdS 4 ttJc3 'iVd6 S ttJf3 ttJc6 (or S ... g6) 6 d4 iLfS 7 dS? (overextension) 7 ... ttJb4 8 ttJd4 O-O-O 9 ttJxfS ttJxfS with the ad- vantage. This is analysis by Reinderman. I won't go into further detail, but 1 ... ttJh6 is a legitimate choice. d) I'm going to refer the reader to books and databases for a detailed coverage of the From Gambit: 1...eS 2 fxeS (2 e4 is the King's Gam- bit) 2 ... d6 3 exd6 iLxd6. At the moment, it seems to favour White in the main lines after 4 ttJf3 (D).

Here are a few thoughts about theory, featur- ing some practical approaches: dl) 4 ... ttJf6 can be answered by the slightly unusual S ttJc3 (recommended by Larsen; the main line S d4 ttJg4 6 ~d3 cS 7 'iVe4+ is a bit hard to assess; for example, after the recom- mended 7 ... iLe7 8 e3 0-09 iLd3 fS 10 iLc4+ 'iii>h8 11 'ilVd3, l1...f4! 120-0 ttJc6 offers com- pensation; S e3 opens another can of worms following S ... ttJg4 6 'iVe2) S ... ttJg4 6 g3!; for example, 6 ... hS (6 ... ttJxh2 7 J::!.xh2 iLxg3+ 8 .l:tf2 has been analysed at some length and seems to favour White) 7 ttJe4 h4 8 gxh4 (8 ttJxd6+ ~xd6 9 gxh4 ttJc6 10 d3 is recom- mended by Vigus) 8 ... iLfS (8 ... iLe7 9 ttJegS .1:.xh4 is rather slow after 10 d4! .l:.hS 11 h3; for example, 11...ttJc6 12 'iVd3) 9 ttJxd6+ ~xd6

10 d3 with the idea 'ilVd2-f4, when White has

the upper hand. d2) 4 ... gS S d4!? (again, not the normal choice; loads of theory indicates that White can survive some dangerous attacks and emerge

i.g2, and White has two well-placed bishops with good prospects. e) The most important of Black's positional alternatives to 1...d5 and 1...liJf6, at least in practice, is l...c5 (D), often used by Sicilian Defence players.

Then: el) 2 e4 transposes to a Sicilian Defence sideline (1 e4 c5 2 f4), but that allows the well- known 2 ... d5! 3 exd5 liJf6 with the idea 4 c4 e6!, a gambit in which Black gets at least enough compensation after 5 dxe6 i.xe6. Note that White has holes on d4 and d3, while if he plays d3, then e3 becomes weak as well. What with good development and pressure down the d-file against White's backward pawn, most people prefer to play Black. e2) White typically continues 2liJf3 liJc6 3 g3 (3 e4 d5!? is again worth considering: 4 exd5 'fiIxd5 5liJc3 and 5 ...

(a common Closed Sicilian and King's In- dian Attack theme; 6 ... e6 and 6 ... liJf6 are con- ventional alternatives) 7 d3 liJge7 8liJc3 0-09 .Be3 exf4 (9 ... liJd4) 10 i.xf4 (10 gxf4 f5!) 1O ... liJd4 with equal prospects. Please forgive me a digression here. This idea of ... d6 to cover e5 comes up with reversed colours in the English Opening version of the Stonewall Dutch if Black is not very careful with his move-order: 1 c4 f5 2liJf3 liJf6 3 g3 e6 4 i.g2 d5 5 O-O c6?! 6 d3 (D).

This is strangely difficult for Black to play against; for example: a) 6 ... .Bd6 7 liJc3 O-O 8 e4! with the idea 8 .. .fxe49 dxe4liJxe4 10 liJxe4 dxe4 11liJg5. b) 6 ... liJbd7 7liJc3 i.e7 8 e4 (8 ~c2 is also good, preparing to play e4) 8 ... fxe4 9 dxe4liJxe4 10 liJxe4 dxe4 11 liJg5!

vantage. White has the plan of liJb3, l:!.ac1 and penetration down the c-file. The point is that the Stonewall structure em- phasizes control of e4, and Black's play flows more freely once White has committed to d4. Let's return to 1 f4 d5 (D):

194 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

w 2 ttJf3 Naturally White can set up in numerous ways, such as 2 d3 or 2 e3, but it's probably worth delaying a fianchetto: a) 2 g3 h5 3 ttJf3 h4! is a theme we've seen before, with the idea 4 ttJxh4? J:lxh4! 5 gxh4 e5. Black will have a pawn for the exchange, as well as an attack and an ideal centre after 6 .llg2 'iVxh4+ 7 ~fl 'iVxf4+ 8 ~gl ttJf6. b) 2 b3 .llg4!? is a clever move, reversing White's line 1 d4 f5 2 .llg5 versus the Dutch. Here Black is a tempo down, but the extra move b3 will sometimes hurt White's position. Just for example, the tempting 3 h3?! .llh5 4 g4 e6! threatens ... 'iVh4# (here 4 ... e5 5:th2!? ~h4+ 6 :tf2 is unclear). Play can continue 5 .llg2 (5 ttJf3 .llg6 6 .llb2 c5 7 .llg2 ttJc6 gives Black a greater share of the centre and a good chance of playing ... d4 at some point, cutting off the b2- bishop) 5 ... ~h4+ 6 ~fl.llg6 7 ttJf3 'iVf6!, forc- ing the weakening 8 d4, and thus pointing to a drawback ofb3. We now return to 2 ttJf3 (D):

2 ••• ttJf6 2 ... g6 will be seen in the following game. A couple of alternatives in brief: a) 2 ... ttJc6 parrots the popular line 1 d4 f5 2 ttJc3. This seems an acceptable choice after 3 g3 (naturally 3 d3 and 3 e3 are playable; after 3 b3 .llg4 4 .llb2, 4 ... d4 cuts into White's ambi- tions) 3 ... .llg4 (3 ... g6 4 .llg2 .llg7) 4 .llg2 'iVd7 (4 ... .llxf3 5 .llxf3 e5?! is too hurried after 6 c4! exf4 7 cxd5 ttJe5 8 'iia4+ 'iVd7 9 'iixf4) 5 d3 O-O-O!? 6 O-O!? h5 with dynamic play ahead. b) 2 ... .llg4 contemplates ... .llxf3, especially if that exchange can assist in achieving the move ... e5 with a central superiority: bl) 3 ttJe5 mimics the Trompowsky Attack move 1 d4 ttJf6 2 .llg5 ttJe4, and can lead to in- teresting positions after 3 ... .llh5. Then White should avoid 4 g4? e6 5 h4 f6 in favour of a line such as 4 c4 f6 5 'iVa4+ c6 6 ttJf3. Instead, 3 ... .llf5 and even 3 ... h5!? are reasonable alter- natives. b2) 3 e3 ttJd7 4 h3 (in response to 4 .te2, 4 ... c6 5 O-O .llxf3 6 .llxf3 e5 is one of a wide va- riety of defences; nevertheless, 4 .lle2 holds forth better long-term prospects than 4 h3) 4 ... .llxf3 5 'iVxf3 ttJgf6!? (5 ... e6 and 5 ... c6 are safe and solid alternatives, while the gambit 5 ... e5!? has the idea 6 'iixd5!? 'iVh4+ 7 ~dl O-O-O, when Black has a significant initiative; for example, 8 fxe5 'ile7 9 "iVa5 ~b8 10 ttJc3!? ttJxe5 11 'iVa4 ttJh6 12 d3 ttJf5 with active play, Hanegby-Pijl, IECG email 2001; of course, a pawn is a pawn) 6 g4!? c6 (or 6 ... e6 7 d3 h6) 7 g5 (7 d3 e5 8 g5 ttJg8 has also been played, with mutual chances) 7 ... ttJe4 8 d3 ttJd6 9 e4 dxe4 10 dxe4 e5 11 f5?!

(D):

3g3 White heads for a Leningrad Dutch set-up, easily the most popular of Black's choices when playing the Dutch. We shall see a reversed Classical Dutch, 3 e3 g6 4 .lle2 .llg7, below. The Stonewall formation with 4 d4 is particu- larly harmless to Black if he hasn't played ... c5 yet, and gives him more options if he hasn't cut

off his bishop by ... e6. For example, 4 ... i..g7 S .Bd3 0-060-0 i..fS!? (instead, 6 ... b6 with the idea ... .Ba6 is a favourite anti-Stonewall tech- nique; Black is a tempo down on a normal line for White, but should still have decent chances) 7 i..xfS gxfS with complex play. White has a very bad bishop, but Black's own bishop on g7 has few prospects and it's hard to open lines. Sometimes White can play for g4. 3 ... g6 4 i..g2 i..g7 Having strolled through the initial moves, let's tum to a game. The move-order illustrates a couple of new ideas:

H. Danielsen - A. Petrosian Schwerin 1999

1 f4 d5 2lLlf3 g6 3 g3 i..g7 4 i..g2 (D)

4 ••• lLlf6 The following two moves by Black are ones sometimes played by White in the Leningrad Dutch: a) 4 ... lLlh6 with the idea ... lLlfS and some- times ... d4 is a legitimate alternative. In fact, when White plays lLlh3 in the reversed system, one of his problems is that Black will liquidate the centre and play ... eS with a rather dull equality. But in the Bird Opening, White would like to avoid that outcome on principle, and thus may not wish to prepare e4. One way to set up would be S O-OlLlfS 6 d3!? (6 e3 is less ambi- tious and anticipates playing e4 versus ... d4) 6 ... d4 7 c4 with the idea of lLla3-c2, covering e3 and expanding on the queenside by l:.bI and b4. In most cases, Black will play ... as, but has to decide whether to play ... cS and ... lLlc6, or ... lLlc6 alone. Then, in most lines, he will try to break with ... eS. This is a very technical line in which both sides should have fully-fledged play. b) 4 ... c6 can be slightly irritating for White. Play can continue: bI) S O-O 'iVb6+ attacks b2 twice and forces 6 d4, when White has a hole on e4. However, this is a structure which Black often plays in the reversed position, and rather more dou- ble-edged than it might at first seem. b2) White can also play S d3, when S ... 'fUb6 threatens b2 and intends ... lLlh6 followed by ... lLlg4 or ... lLlfS; these positions are playable for both sides. b3) S e3lLlf6 6 d3 O-O 70-0. White has vari- ous modes of development here such as 'fUe2 or lLlc3, usually followed by e4 at some point. With logical play, however, Black should reach equality. 50-0 c5 6 d3 (D)

6••. O-O

196 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

6 ... ltJc6 will transpose in most cases, but does make the move 7 ltJc3!? more appealing to White than usual: a) 7 ... O-O permits 8 e4; it's unclear how 8 ... dxe4 9 dxe4 comes out, but White has the better prospects for an edge. White can also play 8 a3, which anticipates the need for b4 and is consistent with the idea that follows. Finally, Bucker's suggestion 8 h3!? is another useful semi-waiting move, in that it assists White slightly in most possible continuations, without hurting him in any obvious way; however, com- pare 7 'ieelltJc6 8 h3 in the note to 7 c3 below. b) 7 ... d4 8ltJa4ltJd7 (contemplating an ex- change sacrifice with ... bS) 9 c4 (9ltJgS 'ViIIc7 10 fS!? is Lars Karlsson's idea, leading to exotic tactical play; this is fun to analyse) 9 ... O-O (D). w We've arrived at what amounts to a King's Indian Defence (the YugoslavlPanno Variation), but with colours reversed and White having the extra move f4! Perhaps not surprisingly, f4 has both good qualities (increased central control) and drawbacks (central weaknesses, potentially exploitable by ... eS). Morozevich-Svidler, Inter- net 1999 continued 10 e4!? (10 a3 with the idea l:tbl, i.d2 and b4 is another thematic approach) 1O ... dxe3 11 i..xe3 ltJd4 12 ~bl llb8 13 b4 ltJxf3+ 14 i.xf3 cxb4 IS J:i.xb4 b6 16 d4, and White may be slightly for preference because of his good centre, but that's not clear. 7 c3 A very flexible move-order; of course, ev- erything is committal in some way, and White does forfeit the possibility of ltJa3 and c4 in one go. He also foregoes 7 ltJc3, a traditional but somewhat less popular move in the reversed Dutch position. Then if Black plays 7 . ..tDC6, White might want to reply 8 h3, as suggested by Stefan Bucker. After the more conventional 7 'iiVel (analo- gous to the main line ... 'iee8 in the Leningrad Dutch), a similarly thought-provoking line is 7 ... ltJc6 8 h3!? (D).

In reversed positions, it's hard to make a use- ful move that doesn't also give Black some- thing in return. In fact, h3 is a move that White will almost always make in conjunction with 'ViIIel, since g4 and ~h4 (or ~g6) can follow and it's useful to prevent ... ltJg4 in many lines. As an exercise in reversed positions, let's see what might follow: a) 8 ... b6 9 ltJa3 (9 g4 looks premature in view of 9 ... hS! 10 gS ltJe8 11 e4ltJc7) 9 ... i.b7 (9 ... i.a6!? 10 g4) 10 e4 dxe4 11 dxe4 is dou- ble-edged. Now ll...eS!? 12 fS!? (12 fxeS? ltJxeS!) 12 ... gxfS (or 12 ... ltJd4 13 ltJh4 ltJhS with the idea 14 c3? ltJxg3!) 13ltJh4 is a stan- dard attacking scheme seen in the Closed Sicil- ian, King's Indian Attack, and various Botvinnik set-ups in the English Opening. For example, 13 ... fxe4?! (13 ... f4 14 gxf4ltJhS) 14 i.gSltJd4? ISl:!dl'Ville7 16l:!.xd4! exd4 17ltJfS and White wins (17 .. .'iVeS 18ltJc4). Still, there's a line in which White's pawn on h3, and new weakness on g3, can be a negative: b) 8 ... ltJd4! 9ltJxd4 (9ltJa3 is playable; for example, 9 ... ltJxf3+ 10 J:i.xf3 b6 11 e4 i.b7 12 eS ltJe8 13 l:!.f2 ~c8 with chances for both sides) 9 ... cxd4 10 'iVf2 (Black in the same posi- tion - without ... h6 - plays ... ~bS here, but White's equivalent 10 'i!Vb4 runs into 1O ... ltJhS!

Again, how- ever, the committal moves 'iVei and a4 com- bine to give Black an opportunity that he doesn't get in the reversed position: 9 ... i.e6!, which is a safe enough deployment in any case, hits the newly weakened b3-square; for example, 10 ltJa3 (10 ltJbd2 not only weakens e3, but gets in the way of i.d2, so Black can play any useful move, such as 1O .. :iVc7 or 1O ... l:tb8) 1O ... i.b3 (or 1O .. :iVd7, since the usual II ltJg5 is weak in view of 11...i.b3) 11 ltJc4 i.xc4 12 dxc4 dxc3 13 bxc3 (13 'ii'xc3 ltJg4 and ... ltJd4) 13 ..

9• •• k!.b8 Just as in the reversed position, Black doesn't want White's knight sitting on c4, so he re- moves the rook from the long diagonal in antic- ipation of ... b5. 9 ... .i.d7 isn't so ambitious, but is safe and sound, and 9 ... .i.e6 is also equal. Of course, White's main idea in the Bird Opening is to get a complex battle, not necessarily a the- oretical edge. 10 i.d2ltJd5 Black continues as White does in the reversed position; this lets White target his d-pawn. 1O ... i.e6 is a noncommittal and arguably better move; White might even be able to force through M, but he's unlikely to get any advantage from a position in which he controls less territory. llltJc2 11 ltJc4 b5 (or Il...i.e6) 12 ltJce5 ltJxe5 13 ltJxe5 'iid6 gives Black no special problems. 1l• •• b5 12 cxd4 cxd4 13 'iVf2 'iVb6 (D) w A familiar sight.

7 ... h6!? With this move, Black anticipates a few pos- sibilities. Directly, he wants to eliminate the combination of d5 and lOg5. He is also plan- ning ... 'ii'e8, when ... g5 and ... ~h5 becomes a possibility; or, if he wants to play .. :iWf7, the move lOg5 won't be available. Finally, h7 can be a handy place to tuck the king away. Of course, the move 7 ... h6 neglects the cen- tre for the moment, which is a little bit risky. In place of it, Black can always play moves such as 7 ... c6 and 7 ... a5, the latter with an eye to- wards gaining space on the queenside. But his most frequent move is 7 ... 'ii'e8, which bears a closer look. Then 8 d5 e5! 9 dxe61Oc6 followed by ... .Bxe6 develops smoothly, with equal pros- pects. And after 81Obd2, 8 ... lOc6 with the idea of an early ... e5 is better than usual, even if it doesn't immediately guarantee Black an even game. Finally, White's normal-looking 8 c4 has various possible answers, including 8 ... lOa6!?, intending ... e5; then 9 d5 c5 keeps a knight from travelling to e6 via d4, and it is apparently premature for White to embark upon 10 lOg5 h6!? 11 lOe6 .Bxe6 12 dxe6, because 12 .. .llb8 with the idea ... lOc7xe6 and .. :iWc8 scoops up the pawn on e6 without apparent punishment. Given all that, White will often allow ... e5, but he needs to avoid a standard attacking theme that everyone should know, since it has appeared in hundreds of games like this one: 7 ... llVe 8 8 c4 lOa6 9 lOc3 e5 10 dxe5 dxe5 11 e4?! f4! 12 gxf41Oh5!

The point. Black's control of f4 is of enor- mous worth, as we see in many lines from a wide variety of openings.

The formation with ... e6, ... d6 and ... i.e7 is called the Classical Variation, or the Ilyin- Zhenevsky Variation. It gives Black a rather cramped but solid position. White's obvious plan is to break with e4 (or sometimes d5), and Black's response is first and foremost to re- strict the effectiveness of that advance. Then he can prepare ... e5 and/or tum his attention to a kingside attack. When we get to the reversed versions in the next game, we'll see that the

homing in on the drawbacks of White's extra move. The Dutch Defence move 8 'iVh4 was well met in Larsen-W.Schmidt, Arhus 1971: 8 ... b6 9 ~bd2 i.a6! 10 l:tf2?! (compare our last game with colours reversed; the extra move ~bd2 isn't helping matters) 1O ... ~e8! 11 c3 e5 (a good move, and 11...~d6 is also strong, threat- ening 12 ... ~f5 13 'iih3 .ltc8!, as we saw above; then 12 e4 dxe4 13 dxe4 .ltxe2 14 lhe2 e5! 15 'iYxd8 l:!.axd8 clearly favours Black) 12 'iixd8 (12 'iig3 e4! emphasizes the problems with d3, since 13 dxe4 i.xe2 14 .l:Ixe2 dxe4 15 ~xe4?? loses to 15 .. :~d3) 12 ... l'i.xd8 13 fxe5 ~xe5 14 ~xe5 iLxe5 and Black has a clear positional advantage. 8 ... b6 9 ~bd2 (D) White keeps his queen close to the centre. After 9 'Yi'h4, 9 ... .lta6! exploits the fact that White's d-pawn is pinned and the d3-square is weak, so achieving e4 will be difficult.

Black stands well here, and the knight's at- tack on e3 succeeds in disturbing White. But he can also play in straightforward fashion; for ex- ample, Taylor suggests 9 ... fic7 with the idea 10 e4?

I would be re- miss not to show you the following attacking theme, variants of which have won many games against masters and even grandmasters.

Stonewall Dutch Finally, let's get a feel for the Stonewall Dutch, without any pretence of being thorough. This venerable opening produced some classic bat- ties in the olden days, with Black trying to rip apart White's kingside. Today, we usually see it with a modem interpretation.

[diagram]
Black's move-order doesn't reveal which sys- tem he is heading for, which makes the follow- ing note significant. 4 t'iJf3 White commits to playing the main line against either the Classical or Stonewall, ac- cording to Black's preference. As in other Dutch variations, this knight can also go to h3 by, for example, 4 c4 dS 5 t'iJh3 c6 6 O-O iLd6 7 ii.f4

7 ... ii.e7!? (a shrewd idea: Black wants to show that White's knight has no good square other than f4, which is now occupied by his bishop; retreating loses time, but Black will gain it back if White moves his bishop again, and sometimes Black can play an effective ... gS) 8 t'iJc3 (obviously not the only move; upon 8 t'iJd2, Johnsen and Bern like 8 ... 'iVb6! with a double attack on d4 and b2; then 9 cxdS cxdS 10 t'iJb3 can be met by their suggestion 1O ... iLd7 11 :tel t'iJa6 intending ... iLa4 or ... iLbS, or 1O ... a5) 8 ... O-O 9 'ClVd3! t'iJa6 10 a3 t'iJc7 11 :tael. Black stands solidly, but White has more positive prospects. Actually, if Black wants to playa Stonewall Variation after 4 c4, he can· avoid such prob- lems with the clever move 4 ... c6. This is de- signed to prevent t'iJh3, since Black preserves the idea of booting the knight with ... d6 and ... eS; for example, 5 t'iJh3 iLe7 6 O-O O-O and now 7 t'iJf4 d6, or 7 t'iJd2 d6 intending an early ...eS. Instead, S t'iJf3 dS reverts to a normal Stonewall. 4 ... d5 5 O-O iLd6 This active move has largely overtaken the older S ... iLe7 in popUlarity, so we'll focus on it. S ... iLe7 is still viable, however, and might even have some surprise value. 6c4c6(D) w This is the starting position of the modem Stonewall Dutch. It has a rather anti-positional look to it, because Black's bishop on c8 is al- ready very bad (even if he achieved ... eS, the pawn on fS would be in its way). White also has the wonderful eS outpost available to his pieces. In view of this, it's not easy to explain why the Stonewall Dutch is a respectable de- fence at all, but let's tackle the issue of that bishop on c8 first. Kramnik, who has played the Stonewall, defends the honour of that piece with the simple statement that it is no worse than White's bishop on g2! By this he means that White's fianchettoed bishop has virtually no scope as it runs into the 'stone wall' of

i-PAWNS AND REVERSED OPENINGS 209

Black's pawns, which guard both e4 and d5 twice. In addition, White can hardly suppress the development of the c8-bishop forever. In nonnal practice, it will often come to b7 (or a6) after ... b6 or to h5 after ... .ltd7-e8. The activa- tion of this piece corresponds to what I think should be a chess mini-rule: that the earlier one assumes weaknesses or bad pieces, the more likely they are to be manageable problems, or not problems at all. As for that outpost on e5, it is indeed a nega- tive feature of Black's position. But in modern chess we can often accept a central weakness in return for other factors. For example, in the Sveshnikov Sicilian (and other variations of the Sicilian going back to the Boleslavsky), Black accepts a weakness on d5: 1 e4 c5 2ltJf3 ltJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4ltJxd4ltJf6 5 ltJc3 e5 6ltJdb5 d6 7 .ltg5 a6 8 ltJa3 b5 9 .ltxf6 gxf6 10 ltJd5

From this point, ignoring the details (which will be familiar to many players), White can in most cases only reinforce his outpost on d5 by moving his a3-knight to e3 via c2, completing an elaborate journey of six moves with that one piece. Black will usually put his good bishop on e6, from where it helps to contest the outpost. Returning to the diagram of the Dutch Stone- wall after 6 ... c6, we find that in practice, White will have to make a similarly arduous trip with his queen's knight if he wishes to reinforce e5; for example, by ltJa3-c2-el-d3. Black's bishop on d6 is analogous to his bishop on e6 in the Si- cilian. Furthennore, in the Sveshnikov, Black's bad bishop will go to g7 and he will work around the outpost on d5 by playing .. .f5. In the Stonewall, Black very often plays ... .ltb7 and ... c5. Well, it would be stretching things to claim too much for the analogy, because other factors in these positions obviously differ. But the Sicilian and Dutch Defences (whose first moves are mirror images of one another) share the principle that you can live with one signifi- cant enemy outpost in your midst. Finally, returning to the virtues of the Stone- wall Dutch, a black knight on e4 can be very powerful. True, that square isn't an outpost, as is White's e5, but White finds it difficult to ex- pel the intruder. If he plays, for example, ltJel and f3, then the pawn on f3 renders White's king's bishop particularly unimpressive, and a subsequent e4 has to be very carefully planned, because the d4-square can prove particularly vulnerable to ... c5 and ... e5 attacks. 7b3 White pursues his best-known strategy: to exchange Black's good bishop on d6 by means of .lta3 and thus strengthen his control of e5. He can also fortify that square by means of i..b2. Let me show two instructive battles be- ginning with 7 "iVc2 (the queen protects c4 from capture and potentially works along the c-file) 7 ... O-O (D), and now:

a) 8 .ltf4 pursues a similar policy of ex- changing off Black's good bishop: 8 ... .ltxf4 9 gxf4 (at first, the doubled pawns appear to as- sist in controlling key squares) 9 ... ltJe4 10 ltJbd2ltJd7 11 e3 (White's central pawns are on the colour opposite his remaining bishop, but again, that 'good' bishop hasn't much influ- ence) 1l..."iVe7 12 ':!'fcl (l2ltJe5ltJxe5 13 dxe5 ltJxd2 14 "iVxd2 .ltd7 is fine for Black, who can

His idea is some combination of ... a4 and ... tDe4, worrying about his queen's bishop later. It seems a workable remedy. 8 ... a5 Black duly proceeds to fix the weakness on b4. Johnsen and Bern designate 8 ... O-O as '?!', and in the game Kasparov-Short, Rapid match (game 1), London 1987, after 9 ~a3 ~xa3 10 tDxa3, they also disapprove of 1O ... tDbd7.

212 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

King's Indian Attack The King's Indian Attack is a simple system in- volving the moves ltJf3, g3, .ltg2, O-O and d3, which can be played against nearly any set-up by Black. In most cases, the moves ltJbd2 and e4 follow, and in fact some lower-rated players will make those moves without thinking. Lovers of chess and readers of Volume 2 un- derstand that the King's Indian Defence is one of the most popular and exciting of Black's defences. And yet the King's Indian Attack, which reverses the King's Indian and even gains an extra move for White, is rarely played by grandmasters, international masters, or na- tional masters, and its use is discouraged for most students by their teachers. That seems sur- prising at first, but by now you can probably guess what's going on: almost any logical de- fence by Black equalizes, all the more so ones that don't try for an advantage, and it's hard to find lines where White poses real problems to his opponent. That's not what White wishes for in the opening. Again, the standard characteristics of re- versed openings apply. First, Black is able to adjust to the new information that White gives him with his extra move, especially because the King's Indian Defence is mainly a reactive and counterattacking opening. It's worth noting in that regard that the defining moves of the King's Indian Attack (listed above) give White little direct control of the centre, nor even pieces with much scope; suddenly it's not so surpris- ing that strong players aren't interested in it! Incidentally, another such opening is the classical Colle system, which begins with the moves d4, ltJf3, e3, c3, ltJbd2, .ltd3/e2 and O-O in some order. It's practically unknown in mod- em grandmaster play. With reversed colours, assuming that the game begins 1 d4 d5, those moves make up the Semi-Slav, which is proba- bly Black's most popular and dynamic response to 1 d4 in today's chess, and is used by many of the world's elite! The same reasons apply: ver- sus the Semi-Slav, White has to play aggres- sively and allow sharp positions if he wants to claim any advantage. Against the Colle, by contrast, Black can equalize in any number of ways; after all, by move 7, White has managed to put only one pawn on the 4th rank and has given himself a bad bishop on c 1 which already can't move! Returning to the King's Indian Attack, we find that, much as with the BirdlDutch duo, Black needn't even play modestly to secure eqUality. Remarkably, he can use most of the formations that are main lines when White uses them with colours reversed, even though those are aggressive and committal. Let's look at some games and see how that can be. Larsen - Ljubojevic Bugojno 1978 1 ltJf3 d5 2 g3 c5 3 .ltg2 ltJc6 4 O-O e5 Black is cooperating by setting up a big cen- tre and daring White to use the attacking meth- ods employed in the King's Indian Defence. You can argue that if this doesn't favour White, no other logical defensive set-up by Black will. In reply, White might say that the King's Indian Attack, like the Bird Opening, is not designed to produce an advantage, but only a game with chances for both sides.

[diagram]
Black has a particular idea in mind that de- pends upon him not having the standard move ... ltJf6 in. In the next game, Black plays 5 ... ltJf6 and makes similar adjustments a few moves later.

w 7 a4 This secures a spot for White's knight on c4, as we often saw in the King's Indian chapter of Volume 2. If White wants to avoid what happens

f-PAWNS AND REVERSED OPENINGS 213

next, he could speed things up by 7 ttJa3. Then 8 ttJbd2 (D) 7 ... i.e6 (7 ... gS!? 8 ttJc4 f6 is a playable set-up) 8 ttJc4 'fic7 9 a4 compares well with the game, although Black is not objectively worse, and apart from the conventionaI9 ... ttJf6 might even B pursue the idea of 9 ... hS !? For example, 10 h4 ttJh6 (l0 ... ttJf6? 11 ttJfxeS! ttJxeS 12 ttJxeS with the idea of trapping the queen and winning the piece back after 12 ... 'fixeS 13 i.f4 i.g4 14 i.xeS i.xdl IS l:taxdl) 11 ttJgS i.xgS (or the similar 11 ... i.xc4 12 dxc4 i.xgS 13 hxgS ttJg8) 12 hxgS (12 i.xgS !? f6 13 i.d2 ttJf7 is dynami- cally balanced) 12 ... ttJg8, planning some com- bination of ... h4 and ... ttJge7-g6. This appears to yield at least equal chances.

[diagram]
This unusual flank thrust is a possibility af- forded by the fact that Black hasn't played ... tZ:lf6. Whether this equalizes or not (and it seems to do so handily), he is playing upon White's extra tempo to create new chances for himself. In fact, this is the case in more ways than one: compare the analogous situation in the King's Indian Defence following 1 d4 ttJf6

2 c4 g6 3 ttJc3 i.g7 4 e4 d6 S i.e2 O-O 6 g4,

when Black's traditional recipe is 6 ... cS, to strengthen the effect of his bishop on the long diagonal after 7 dS (D).

For example, 7 ... e6 and ... exdS can follow, with Benoni-like themes. The move ... cS would make little sense if ... eS were already in; for one thing, Black's knights wouldn't have access to cS, as White's do (to c4, that is) in the main game. Thus White's extra move e4 in our main game, while obviously good in some respects, becomes a mixed blessing.

For more equalizers against the King's Indian Attack, see Morozevich-Krarnnik, the last game in this se- quence. S O-O lbf6 (D) In the previous game, Black played S. .. i.e7 here. Incidentally, I've messed with the actual move-order of the game before us, which was 1 lbf3 cS 2 g3lbc6 3 .tg2lbf6 4 O-O eS S d3 dS. As you might imagine, there are other ways to reach the position; for example, beginning with

1 g3 or 1 lbf3 lbf6.

w 6lba3 This is the mirror image of ... lba6, which is Black's second most popular move in the main- line King's Indian Defence. After 6 e4 .Be7 the traditional main line would arise following 7 lbc3 d4 8 lbe2, with Black a move behind. As might be expected, he doesn't have to walk into the standard King's Indian pawn-storm, partic- ularly as he has not yet castled. You might want to play around with these positions, as well as with 7 exdS lbxdS 8 l:tel f6, to see how they compare with the reversed ones. 6 .... i.e7 7 e4 d4 8lbc4 'iYc7 9 a4 i.e6!? (D) We've arrived at a reversed King's Indian position; in the regular King's Indian line, White would already have castled by this point. In this actual position, Black can seek to benefit from not having castled, for reasons that be- come clear in a moment. 10 lbel Or: a) 10 lbfd2 hS! takes advantage of the delay in ...

In spite of his excel- lent knight on c4, White has no way to open lines safely and can become saddled with a ter- rible light-squared bishop, whereas Black has kingside prospects; for example, IS g4?!

Here's the point at which White can be faulted for following the main moves of the reversed variation too faithfully. Black can change the entire dynamic by 1O ... h5!

This primitive move is largely based upon discouraging White's standard attack with f4, followed by ttJf3 and/or f5 and g4. Some possi- bilities: a) 11 f4 h4 12 f5 .txc4 13 dxc4 hxg3 14 hxg3 O-O-O 15 ttJd3 ~dg8, with the idea ... g6, launches a kingside attack. Note how bad the white bishop on g2 is. b) 11 .tg5 and now ll...ttJd7 or ll...ttJg4 either exchanges White's good bishop or, upon its retreat, enables Black to pursue his kingside attack. c) 11 ttJf3 ttJd7 12 ttJg5 .txg5 13 .txg5 f6 14 .td2 h4 with good chances on the kingside. d) 11 h4 is reasonable, but now if White plays the thematic f4, he loses the g4-square. Black could even castle kingside here, but it's consistent with the pawn-structure to expand on the queenside; for example, 11...b6 12 .td2 .nb8 13 f4 (13 c3?! O-O! 14 ~cl.nfd8) 13 ... .txc4 14 dxc4 exf4 15 gxf4 (15 .txf4 iLd6 16 ttJd3 O-O followed by ... .:tfe8 and ... ttJg4 takes con- trol of e5 and leaves White with a backward pawn) 15 ... ttJg4 16 ttJf3 O-O 17 ttJg5 .l:Ibd8!, threatening ... d3. It's remarkable how being a move behind the reversed position opens up this whole set of new ideas for Black.

11 f4 f6?!

This is a positionally suspect move. Piket suggests 11...ttJb6, an unambitious attempt to simplify, after which there might follow 12 ttJa3!?

The players get there by means of a Sicilian De- fence:

(thumb- ing his nose at White's extra tempo, Black plays the move that makes his whole position most vulnerable!) 10 .l:tel l:te8 11 a4!?, and here Gufeld suggests l1...lLldb4('!'), a trick which comes from the white side of a standard King's Indian Defence line.

Black wants to play this anyway in order to develop and centralize while fortifying his po- sition. Those familiar with King's Indian De- fence theory will recognize this exact position as yet another in which White is playing the role of Black with an extra move. But White has the usual issue that if he plays the equalizing moves available to Black in the King's Indian

218 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Defence, he can't expect more than a level game. And the tactical possibilities appear in- sufficient to produce an advantage; for exam- ple: a) 12 'iVa3lLlde7! 13 'ii'xcS 'ii'xd3. b) 12 'iVbS lLlc7! can be followed by 13 'ii'xcS 'iixd3 or 13 'ii'xb7 i.dS!. c) After 12 lLlb3, which is the main move with reversed colours, Nisipeanu gives 12 ... lLlb6 13 'i¥bS (13 'ii'h4 'ii'xh4 14lLlxh4lLla4) 13 ... c4 14 lLlcs a6, which is good for Black after the forced IS lLlxe6 axbS 16 lLlxd8 l:tfxd8. Why does this work? In the King's Indian Defence position, White has played the extra move 'i¥c2, which is the equivalent of ... 'iVc7 in this line. So, after 14 lLlcs a6 IS lLlxe6, IS ... axbS?? would lose 16lLlxc7. The extra move hurts! We should remember that White's position is a King's Indian Defence that is designed to give Black ways to react to White's advances, not necessarily to force the pace. The recurring exchange of a pawn on d3 for a pawn on cS is an example of how Black can go for equality in a way that White wouldn't want to with colours reversed. 12 'ii'c4! i.e6! 13 'ii'xc5 :fd8 Black has a well-centralized position and pressure on d3, which seems enough for a pawn. 14 'ii'a3 (D)

It's important to realize, however, that the slower the system that Black plays, the more easily he equalizes, which is why the KIA can be so unrewarding for White. Let me describe some standard options, with- out detailed analysis: a) l. .. cS is an extremely popular move; for example, 2 g3 (2 e4 is a Sicilian Defence; 2 c4 is a Symmetrical English) 2 ... lLlc6 3 i.g2 g6 4 O-O (4 d4 cxd4 S lLlxd4 i.g7 forces the d4- knight to move and affords White little chance for advantage) 4 ... i.g7 S d3 (D). Now Black can safely play S. .. e6 or S. .. lLlf6

6 e4 d6, both set-ups with good track records.

A slightly more ambitious move is S. .. eS (or S. .. d6 6 e4 eS), since 6 e4 (6 c4lLlge7 7lLlc3 O-O is a standard line of the Symmetrical English, which is equal; see Volume 3) 6 ... lLlge7 is not only equal, but easy to play. One frequently- played sequence is 7 lLlbd2 O-O 8 c3 d6 9 a4 (9 a3 is more sophisticated, but both 9 ... l:i.b8 10 b4 bS and 9 ... h6 10 b4 a6 are fine) 9 ... h6 10 lLlc4

i.e6 with smooth development for Black, who has ideas such as ... ~d7 and the possible pawn advances ... f5 or ... g5, or simply ... ~c7 fol- lowed by ... d5. b) l...ttJf6 2 g3 g6 3 i.g2 i.g7 4 O-O O-O 5 d3 c5 (5 ... d6 is still more flexible, if not neces- sary; then 6 c4 e5 is a 'reversed KIA'!) 6 e4 ttJc6 7 ttJc3 (after 7 c3, 7 ... d5 is fine, but 7 ... d6 can be effective if White tries to enforce d4; for example, 8 :tel h69 d4?! cxd4 10 cxd4 i.g4) 7 ... d6. This is a rather harmless type of Closed Sicilian. For White to create problems for his opponent, he would ideally have his pawn on f4 in front of his knight, or his king's knight on e2. All of these lines are equal, of course, but the latter set-ups force Black to play accurately.

2 g3 (D)

2... c6

This is the move we saw in the Reti Slav chapter. 2 ... ttJf6 3 i.g2 i.f5 is another popular set-up: 4 O-O (4 c4 can lead to some independ- ent lines, including 4 ... dxc4 5 ttJa3 i.e6!?) 4 ... e6 5 d3 h6 (not strictly necessary, but it will probably be played later anyway) 6 ttJbd2 i.e7 7 'iWel (again the most popular move, to en- force e4; I should mention that 7 b3 O-O 8 i.b2 is also played, when White will normally fol- low with c4 rather than e4; then the game can transpose into the Reti Opening) 7 ...

Let's start with a pairing oftwo openings that are out of to day's mainstream: the Vienna Game and the Ponziani Opening. We'll see how the most modest of ex- tra tempi impacts the resulting positions. Ljubojevic - Ciocaltea Skopje Olympiad 1972

1 e4 eS 2 ttJc3 ttJf6 3 f4 dS!

This is the standard reply, held in high regard for well over 100 years. 4 fxeS ttJxe4 S ttJf3 (D)

s. .. iLcS!? Black intentionally loses a tempo to set up a pin that in tum forces White to lose time on the queenside. 5 ... iLb4 is a sensible alternative; for example: a) 6 .i.d3!? has the idea 6 ... ttJc5 7 iLe2 d4 8 a3 .i.a5 9 b4 dxc3 10 d4 ttJe4 11 bxa5, when White seems to have a modest edge. But Black might try 6 .. .f5!?, which looks fully playable after 7 exf6 (7 iLe2 O-O 8 O-O iLe6) 7 ... ttJxf6 8 0-00-0 (a small joke is 8 ... ttJc6 9 iLb5?! O-O 10 d4 and Black has gained a move!) 9 .i.e2 ttJc6

10 a3 iLa5 11 d4 iLg4.

b) 6 ~e2! may be as good as anything; for example, 6 ... iLxc3 7 dxc3 O-O 8 iLf4 iLe6 9 O-O-O ttJd7 10 ~e1 c6 with active chances for both sides. Compare the reversed position with 6 iLb5 in the Ponziani Opening game below.

6 d4 iLb4 (D)

7 iLd2 7 'ii'd3 positions the queen slightly oddly: 7 ...

In this position, strongly reminiscent of a French Winawer, Black's knights are aggres- sively placed and White's bishops have yet to find active roles.

w 7 •.. iLg4 (D) 7 ... cS! is the main line, after which Black is considered to have levelled the game.

4d4 It's logical to strike back in the centre in this way, as Black does in the Vienna Game. The W only other reasonable way to counter Black's threat of ... fxe4 is 4 exf5, when the obvious course is 4 ... e4, but 5 lbd4 with the idea d3, played in many games, seems to keep a small edge. Maybe Black could play 4 .. :~f6, trying to win the f-file in old-fashioned King's Gambit style. The play could go 5 d4! e4 6lbg5 d5 (D). w Here White needs to disturb the equilibrium: a) 7 ~h5+!? g6 8 fxg6 hxg6 9 "iVe2 .Bd6, and in terms of space, open lines, and develop- ment, Black has quite a lot for a pawn. b) White can also try to undermine Black's centre by means of7 c4; for example, 7 ... .Bb4+ 8lbc3 (watch out for 8 .Bd2?? ~xgS) 8 ... lbge7! (development comes first; the pawns are not as important) 9 g4 (9 cxdSlbxd5 10 lbgxe4 ~xd4) 9 ... ~xd4 with an obscure position, which is about equal. 4 ... fxe4 5 lbxe5 lbf6 (D) After S. .. ~f6, the blockading manoeuvre 6 lbg4 ~g6 7 .Bf4 (or 7 .Be2) 7 ... d6 8 lbe3 has had some success, but the resulting positions are playable for Black. Instead, S. .. lbxe5!? 6 dxeS threatens ~dS, when 6 ... dS 7 exd6 .Bxd6 8 ~a4+ wins the e-pawn. That may not be the end of it, however, because Black can tum the opening into a gambit following 8 ... c6 9 ~xe4+ lbe7 10 .Bc4 (versus ... O-O) 1O ... ~c7 with the idea ... .ifS. Of course, White has a pawn and no weaknesses, so this is speCUlative.

6.Bc4!?

As we've seen, this idea originates from the Vienna Game. White reasons that he'll be a tempo up on what is after all a pretty good line for Black. Naturally, White has other ways to handle the position, of which 6 .Bg5 may be the most important. White stands well after 6 ... .Bd6?! 7 lbg4! .Be7 8 .Bxf6 .Bxf6 9 dS!, 6 ... .Be7 7 .Bb5! or 6 ... d6 7lbxc6 bxc6 8lbd2 d5 9 ~a4 .Bd7 10 f3. Following 6 ... ~e7 7 .Bxf6 (7 lbg4 dS!?) 7 .. :iiVxf6 8lbg4 ~g6 White can try 9lbe3 or 9 dS. These ideas are barely explored, as is typical with some of the oldest openings. The entertaining and instructive attacking game Nakamura-Becerra, USA Ch, Stillwater 2007 continued 6 .ibS .Bd6 (6 ... ~e7 may be best, as in the reversed position) 7 lbc4 (7 f4! exf3 8lbxf3 is a fighting alternative; compare 6 .Bd3 fS in the reversed line) 7 ... .Be7 8 .Ba4 (8 dS a6 9 .Ba4 bS doesn't improve much upon the reversed position, because White's extra move c3 isn't generally useful; he can win a pawn at the cost of development by 10 dxc6 bxa4 11 'YWxa4 dS 12 lbe3 O-O, but Black has a strong centre and excellent attacking chances) 8 ... dS 9 lbeS O-O! (this is a typical sacrifice in double e- pawn openings, famously in the Two Knights Defence; it yields Black development and ac- tivity for a pawn) 10 .Bxc6 (10 lbxc6? bxc6 II .Bxc6lIb8 has ideas such as ... .Ba6, ... lIb6 and ... 'i!Vd6 with ... lbg4) 1O ... bxc6 I1lbxc6 'iNe8 12 lbxe7+ ~xe7 13 O-O (D).

This actually produces a worse position than White would have without his extra move c3. White can also play 8 liJxd7 'iVxd7, which is equal, or try 8 c4!. Then he has lost a full tempo (c3-c4) and transposed exactly to Black's posi- tion from the corresponding Vienna Game po- sition from the last game (the note to 7 ... i.g4). As it happens, he gets better winning chances with that move than with any other! 8 ••• liJxeS 9 dxeS i.xbS 10 exf6 ~d7 Now White would like to be able to play 11 liJc3, but can't! In fact, the bonus move c3 has hurt him and Black has a clear advantage. To close out the subject of reversed posi- tions, I'll put a number of other examples from the double e-pawn realm into the following game. J. Polgar - Ivanchuk Amber Blindfold, Monte Carlo 1994

Or: a) 2 liJf3 is a forcing move, but Black can still play variations with reversed themes, again involving the f-pawn: al) 2 .. .fS (D) is the Latvian Gambit. In comparison with the black side of the King's Gambit (1 e4 eS 2 f4), White has the ex- tra liJf3, a vital move that plays a role in most 1 e4 eS openings. But the knight development also has drawbacks. Now, upon 3 exfS, Black has a move which would be pointless for White in the King's Gambit, that is, 3 ... e4, when 4 liJe5 and 4 liJgI are playable, but certainly not cause for abandonment of the Latvian. Similarly, if White tries to 'decline' the gambit by 3 i.c4, Black has the opportunity to play 3 .. .fxe4, meet- ing 4 liJxe5 with 4 ... 'iVg5 or 4 ... d5, both standard variations that have been heavily analysed for over SO years and apparently still regarded as playable for Black, although that can be dis- puted. In the King's Gambit, the same idea 1 e4 e5 2 f4 i.cs 3 fxe5?? loses to 3 ... "iVh4+. Another

i-PAWNS AND REVERSED OPENINGS 225

example is 2 liJf3 f5 3 liJc3 fxe4, when 4 ~5+ is illegal- the extra move gets in the way, as op- posed to 1 e4 e5 2 f4liJc6 3 fxe5?? ~4+. W Finally, 3 d4, trying to reverse the Falkbeer Counter-Gambit upon 3 ... exd4?! 4 e5!, runs into 3 .. .fxe4! 4 liJxe5 liJf6; note again that if White didn't have liJf3 in, 3 ... fxe4 would be a blunder due to 4 'i!Vh5+. All of the 3rd moves above are playable for White, in spite of the differences I've noted, but they aren't convincing ways for him to secure the better game. As a consequence, you will see the move 3 liJxe5 in most Latvian Gambit con- tests, which isn't a reversed variation, and yet offers the best chances for a substantial advan- tage. a2) 2 ... liJc6 (D) has its own twists: w a21) 3 liJc3 liJf6 is the Four Knights Game, which we shall look at in Chapter 7 as an exam- ple of symmetry in the opening. Now 4 ~c4 liJxe4 5 liJxe4 d5 6 ~d3 dxe4 7 ~xe4 is yet another reversed position, probably favouring White slightly. Its twin is 3 ... ~c5 4liJxe5liJxe5 5 d4~d6 6dxe5 ~xe5 7 ~d3, andif7 ... 'i!Vh4, 8 liJd5. In this version, White's tempo helps, and his superiority is clear. a22) 3 ~b5 f5 (D). This is the Schliemann Defence, which has a decent reputation. In terms of a reversed open- ing, it's a Vienna Game (1 e4 e5 2 liJc3 liJf6 3 f4), in which White has the extra move .tb5. Strange to say, this would hurt White if he tried the standard remedy to the Vienna position, which is 4 d4 fxe4 5 liJxe5?! (5 ~xc6 dxc6 6 liJxe5 liJf6 is about equal), as 5 ... liJxe5 6 dxe5 c6 (in the reversed position, White's bishop is still on fl, so this tempo-gain isn't possible) 7 ~c4 (having come this far, White normally tries the unclear piece sacrifice 7 liJc3 cxb5 8 liJxe4) 7 .. :~a5+ followed by 8 .. :iVxe5 wins a pawn. White should play otherwise; for exam- ple, by 4 d3 or the traditional main line, 4liJc3. b) 2 d3 is a bit odd for White, but the idea is to delay the move f4 until Black commits. Then 2 ... liJf6 (the equivalent of 1 e4liJf6 2 d3 e5) 3 f4 is a sort of reversed Philidor Counter-Gambit, an opening which goes 1 e4 e5 2 liJf3 d6 3 d4 f5. After 3 f4, there can follow 3 ... exf4 4liJf3 (4 e5 Wlie7 5 "iVe2 liJd5! is good, with the idea 6 c4?! Wlib4+!) 4 ... d5 5 e5liJh5!, and Black has a typical King's Gambit Accepted position, but with the move ... d5 in exchange for d3, clearly a trade-off in Black's favour. Compare the actual Philidor Counter-Gambit with 2liJf3 d6 3 d4 f5 4 exf5 e4, when 5 liJh4?? loses a piece. On the other hand, White can play 5 liJg5, which is theoretically favourable for him, so this com- parison merely reveals a drawback to the line with 2 d3 and 3 f4, rather than providing salva- tion for the Philidor Counter-Gambit. 2 ... liJf6 (D) 3~c4 Or: a) One of several replies to 3 g3 is 3 ... i..b4, a reversed Ruy Lopez (1 e4 e5 2liJf3liJc6 3 ~b5 g6) in which g3 and ~g2 is enough to equalize, but too slow for White to expect an advantage. After 4 ~g2, Mariotti-Korchnoi, Rome 1982 continued 4 ... O-O (4 ... c6 5liJf3 d6 is also equal) 5 liJge2 c6 6 O-O d5!? (or 6 ... d6 7 d4 ~e6) 7 exd5 cxd5 8 d4 exd4 9liJxd4 ~xc3?!

7 Symmetry and its Descendants

Students often complain about how this or that opening is 'drawish'. However, it's hard to find convincing examples. Even well past the open- ing stage, simplified and equal chess positions can be won by the better player on that day. This is all the more true when the players are below master strength, because their more fre- quent mistakes will present opportunities for the opponent. The charge of drawishness is regularly lev- elled at symmetrical openings, or ones that in- volve a symmetrical pawn-structure. There's a huge difference, however, between a 'drawish' opening and one which seems boring to you or not dynamic enough. In fact, I think that a dis- taste for dry openings can be a healthy thing for developing players; after all, most masters have energetic styles and strive for the initia- tive. And even those who ultimately adopt highly positional styles usually start out with some ambitious openings (Karpov and Kram- nik come to mind). However, it's important to realize that just because an opening seems te- dious, it doesn't follow that a drawn result be- comes likely. Also, fortunately, you'll find that positions which previously bored you become increasingly interesting as you study them more deeply. Understanding the issues related to symmetry in the opening can expand your overall under- standing of chess. The game would be impover- ished if one side could simply imitate the other, or even if White were the only one who could productively avoid symmetry. As it happens, there are few if any variations in chess in which neither player can productively break symme- try. As is the case with reversed openings, in- formation can be the key factor. That is, the knowledge of what White has done makes it easier for Black to find an independent set-up. For his part, White can break symmetry simply by setting up positions in which imitation leads to inferior positions. You will see how easy that is. We've already seen' numerous examples of symmetrical openings in this series, notably in Volume 3 with the many variations of the Sym- metrical English (l c4 c5). After I d4 d5, the best-known truly symmetrical opening is the Exchange Variation of the Slav Defence, I d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 cxd5 cxd5. We examined this in Volume 2, Chapter 3. While it's true that some players use this variation to gain early draws, we saw that either player can deviate from symmetry with full confidence of maintaining equality while unbalancing the play. The sym- metrical variation I d4 d5 2 c4 c5 is a different matter. Whether White plays 3 cxd5 or 3 dxc5, he can quickly reach asymmetrical and favour- able positions, which accounts for the obscurity of2 ... c5. In this chapter, I'll concentrate upon a few fairly important openings that aren't dealt with elsewhere in this series, in which symmetry begins on move one. In doing so, I'll also be able to consider a number of pawn-structures I haven't previously addressed. Petroff Defence

This is called the Petroff Defence, also known as the Russian Defence. w

230 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Like many symmetrical variations, it has a reputation for dry or even drawish play. This stems from the perceived drawish nature of games between elite players and years of com- mentary from books and magazines. To be sure, of the 900+ Petroff Defence games in my data- base between opponents who are both rated above 2600, we find that 63% of the games are drawn, as opposed to 50% for both the Sicilian and French Defences. Nevertheless, White has an overall success rate of 58% (well above av- erage), and a solid lead over Black in perfor- mance rating. Clearly Black doesn't get his normal share of wins, a fact which can easily be missed as we see elite players like Kramnik us- ing the Petroff in order to secure effortless draws (and even occasional victories) as Black. But just because a world champion manages to pull off a draw doesn't mean that you, as White, won't find ample winning chances. Let's explore some theory of the Petroff De- fence, keeping an eye on the way that symmet- rical structures influence the play. At the same time, I'll give an overview of how this classic opening breaks down. Keep in mind that many variations are necessarily omitted, and this cov- erage doesn't reflect the proportion in which they are played in practice. Shirov - Yusupov Ter Apel1997

1 e4 eS 2 4:lf3 4:lf6 3 d4 (D)

In the next game we'll see 3 4:lxe5; the two variations can end up in similar positions. For a discussion of 3 4:lc3, see the Four Knights sec- tion below.

3 .•. 4:lxe4 These days, 3 ... exd4 is less popular. One main line goes 4 e5 4:le4 5 ~xd4 d5 6 exd6 4:lxd6 7 4:lc3 4:lc6 8 ~f4 with the idea of .1i.e3 and O-O-O, posing Black some problems.

4.1i.d3

If White plays 4 dxe5, Black usually replies 4 ... d5, when after 5 4:lbd2, 5 ... 4:lxd2 and 5 ... 4:lc5 are the main lines. White has been finding his way to modest advantages versus those moves. But 4 ... .1i.c5 may be considerably stronger than previously thought, especially with variations like 5 .1i.c4 4:lxf2 6 .1i.xf7+ ~xf7 (6 ... ~f8 7 ~d5 4:lxhl 8 .1i.h5! is unclear) 7 ~d5+ (follow- ing very old theory) 7 ... ~g6!' This was played in Short-Smeets, Wijk aan Zee 2010: 8 i.g5 ~e8 9 4:lh4+? (9 O-O) 9 ... ~xg5 10 4:ld2 ~h6? (1O ... d6! should win, as the black king survives its walk) 11 4:lf5+ ~g6 12 4:lh4+ ~h6 13 4:lf5+ ~g6 14 4:lh4+ with a draw. Of course, White has many alternatives early on, but nothing that looks particularly attractive. 4 .•• dS S 4:lxeS (D)

S• •• .1i.d6 Black opts for perfect symmetry. Countless high-level games have proceeded 5 ... 4:ld7 6 4:lxd7 (playing so as to preserve the pawn- structure without losing time; 6 O-O 4:lxe5 7 dxe5 4:lc5 8 4:lc3 c6 has the idea of an early ... 4:lxd3, to get another pair of pieces off - this position is unclear, but high-level games so far indicate that Black is close to equality) 6 ... .1i.xd7

Other moves: a) The line 7 ... c6 8 tbc3 tbxc3 9 bxc3 pretty much expresses White's strategic goals with re- spect to undermining the knight on e4 and main- taining central pressure.

O-O-O to fol- low) 7 ... ttJc6 (D). w We have seen the idea of exploiting such an e5-pawn on an open file in many openings be- fore. The success of this strategy depends upon developing quickly and maintaining the initia- tive; for example: a) 8 iLb5 iLd7 9 ttJc3 'ilVb4! was played and analysed by Friedrich Volkmann and others and seems sufficient for equality. b) 8 f4!? may be underrated. Then 8 ... iLg4 with the idea ... O-O-O has been recommended, along with 8 ... 'iVb4+ 9 ~xb4 ttJxb4, but I sus- pect that White retains the better game in both cases. c) 8 .tf4 g5! 9 iLd2 (not 9 iLg3?? in view of 9 .. .f5!. and ... f4 will win the bishop) 9 .. .f5 10 ~e2 ng8 with the idea .. .i Le6 and ... O-O-O, Baron-O.Cohen, Givataim 2007. d) Of course, White has less ambitious pos- sibilities; for example, Cohen analyses 8 ttJc3 'iVxe5 9 ~xe5+ ttJxe5 10 iLf4 f6 with a slight edge for White, which is perhaps not the goal of either player! 4 ttJf3 I'll mention some lesser-played lines as I go along. A rather silly sacrifice that has had peri- odic success is 4 ttJxf7?! ~xf7, the Cochrane Gambit, and now White can play 5 ttJc3, 5 iLc4+ or 5 d4. Having written about these moves in detail, I can only say that this sacrifice is wildly overrated, and that Black gets a definite advantage with correct play. On the other hand, Black seldom plays correctly, and in fact the few times elite players have faced 4 ttJxf7, they have reacted with playable but inferior moves! 4 •.. ttJxe4 (D) w 5d4 The Petroff Defence is not as limited as you might think from watching top-level technical games over the years, most of which repeat the same lines over and over. Here is a brief outline of some early alternatives for White, of which 'c' and 'd' are the most attractive: a) 5 d3 ttJf6 6 d4 d5 (an Exchange French) is not the most inspiring of symmetrical positions, but the players can always get creative later. b) Another attempt to break symmetry has been used extensively over the years: 5 ~e2 ~e7

6 d3 ttJf6 7 iLg5, threatening to double Black's

pawns on f6. This has tended to allow Black easy equality; for example, 7 ... ttJbd7 (or 7 ... 'ilVxe2+ 8 iLxe2 i.e7 9 ttJc3 h6 10 iLh4 ttJbd7) 8 ttJc3 'iVxe2+ 9 iLxe2 h6 10 iLM g5 11 iLg3 ttJh5 12 ttJd5 ~d8 with a good game, Reinderman- Kasimdzhanov, Wijk aan Zee 1999. c) A very interesting asymmetrical line at this point begins with 5 c4!? Then if Black plays slowly by 5 ... iLe7, White can try to trans- pose into a pleasant main line by 6 d4, and upon other moves such as 5 ... c6, 5 ... ttJc6 and 5 ... d5, he plays 6 ttJc3, answering 6 ... ttJxc3 with 7 dxc3, a pawn-structure which lends itself to ac- tive development. For those looking for variety, it's worth experimenting with this. d) 5 ttJc3 ttJxc3 6 dxc3 has been played a great deal at the very top levels. If Black is

234 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

well-prepared, he should equalize; often, how- ever, the resulting position will be sufficiently unbalanced for either side to play for a win. I'll leave this one for you to research as well. S•.• dS (D) Some strong players have done all right with S. .. J..e7 6 J..d3 lbf6, but after White sets up with h3, O-O, c4 and lbc3, he has more territory under control and an undoubted, if small, ad- vantage. w A funny picture. It's as though Black had the first move of the game, and after four symmetri- cal moves (e.g., in an Exchange French), played S ... lbe4. Normally, in other openings, such an advanced and supported knight is a force to be reckoned with. But here it is actually a minor disadvantage, in that White can undermine the knight's support by c4 and .i.d3, subsequently forcing its retreat or exchanging it under more favourable terms than are presently available. He usually does this via moves such as.:tel, ~c2 and lbc3. Crucially, the knight on e4 doesn't defend dS, which can be attacked. By contrast, White's knight on f3 protects the d4-pawn. Note also that there is only one file open in this position, so you might think that rooks would inevitably be ex- changed on it. However, as in the Exchange Variation of the French Defence, that seldom happens unless the players are mutually intent upon drawing. For one thing, all the key squares down the e-file are protected by pawns or minor pieces, so the rooks may find better prospects somewhere else on the board. 6 i.d3 i.d6 Maintaining the near-symmetry.

4. .. J1i.b4

Or: a) Rubinstein's move 4 ... liJd4, with the idea 5 liJxe5 'iVe7, has traditionally been a sound theoretical answer to the Four Knights with 4 J1i.b5. White has many ways to proceed, such as the traditional main line 5 J1i.a4 and less common ideas such as 5 O-O, 5 J1i.e2 or 5 J1i.c4. There is currently a good deal of research going into the Four Knights, and this last move, 5 ~c4, in particular is unresolved. For example, after 5 ... liJxf3+, 6 gxf3! is enjoying consistent suc- cess, even on a grandmaster level (d4 and/or f4 follow), and some analysts believe that 5 ... .iLc5 6liJxe5, while risky-looking, results in a small advantage for White. From Black's point of view, a potential drawback to 4 ... liJd4 is 5liJxd4 exd4 6 e5 dxc3 7 exf6 ~xf6 (Black falls too far behind in development following 7 ... cxd2+? 8 .txd2 ~xf6 9 O-O J1i.e7 10 l:!.el O-O 11 J1i.c3, and

Marin points out that Black has "no active prospects at all if White so wishes", and that he "has to play carefully ... to avoid falling behind in development". This is true, but the majority of games are drawn, so as a practical matter this can't be to White's liking either. Alekhine- Capablanca, StPetersburg 1914 was an early il- lustration: 8 .. :~'e5+ 9 ~e2 (9 .i.e2!? with the idea 9 ... .i.c5 10 O-O O-O 11 .i.d3 d5!? 12 'iff3 gives White a few chances) 9 ...

The point is not that 4 ... .i.b4 is a superior move, but that it seems to be a better way for Black to guarantee himself an unbalanced game. b) 4 ... .i.d6!? illustrates the creativity in mod- em opening play. Black has had reasonable success with this move, which prepares the re- organization by ... O-O, ... l:i.e8, ... .1f8 and per- haps ... d5, while protecting the e-pawn so as to give the opportunity for ... a6 if desired.

Once again, White has to decide when and how he wants to break symmetry. 6d3 Or: a) The natural 6 tLJd5 tLJxd5 7 exd5 tLJd4 8 tLJxd4 exd4 returns to a symmetrical position in which White hasn't yet demonstrated an effec- tive way to disturb the equilibrium. In this re- gard, however, he might try 9 c3 i.c5 10 'ii'f3, or the more ambitious, if committal, 9 ~g4 .1c5 10 .i.d3!? d6 11 ~f4 with the idea b3 and .i.b2, or sometimes c3. b) After 6 .1xc6 dxc6, White gets nowhere with 7 tLJxe5 l:te8, and so plays 7 d3. This is another type of Exchange Ruy Lopez position. Black has tried many moves here, such as 7 ... ~e7, 7 ... .1d6, 7 ... l:te8 and 7 ... tLJd7. They are all playable, but direct and active solutions are generally easier to handle, so I like Marin's recommendation of7 ... .1g4 8 h3 (after 8 ~e2, Black can play 8 ... tLJd7 with the idea 9 tLJdl 'iVf6!) 8 ... .1h5. Then Soffer-Alterman, Tel-Aviv 1998 continued 9 'iVe2 (9 g4? tLJxg4! 10 hxg4 .1xg4 11 'iitg2 f5 is too strong; this is a sacrifice which comes up in several e-pawn openings) 9 ... tLJd7 10 g4!? .1g6 11 tLJdl .1d6 12 tLJe3 tLJc5!

In place of this, Alterman suggests the tactical device 13 tLJxe5!? i.xe5

The first two moves let White reorganize with 17 lZJc4 and in some cases i.e3, but 16 ... h6!? forces 17 fxg6 fxg6, which establishes control of some dark squares and keeps White's knight from f5. That should be fine, and 16 ... h5 17 fxg6 fxg6 might be even more accurate, since 18 gxh5? allows 18 .. .l:txfl 19 lZJxfl ~f8 20 i.e3 i.xe3 21 lZJxe3 lZJe6!. 6 ... d6 Maintaining the symmetry. 6 ... i.xc3 7 bxc3 d6 is also possible, if only to avoid White's al- ternative in the next note. 7 i.g5 (D) With this move White threatens 8 lZJd5. 7 lZJe2 is another standard idea; then Black's bishop is a bit stranded on b4 and the move lZJg3 is useful for kingside action. In top-level encounters stretching back to Tarrasch, Rubin- stein and Euwe, Black has chosen to imitate White by 7 ... lZJe7 (Smyslov once played 7 ... i.d7

White protects e4 and plans to use his extra time to expand in the centre. 9 ... lZJd810 d4lZJe6 (D) w This position, the result of a manoeuvre by Black which is not intuitively obvious, has nev- ertheless been reached in over 800 games in my database. After 115 years or so of practice, it is still the main line of the Four Knights Game. Historically, 4 i.b5 i.M has a drawish reputa- tion, but in fact White has a 57% score from this point, and a considerable lead in performance rating. Even the drawing percentage, at 37%, is not out of the ordinary, and includes a large number of quick draws in which the variation went essentially untested. In other words, this position is full of life. 11 i.el! White has ideas of using this bishop on a3, but his retreat is also a reaction to the lack of promising alternatives.

As previously explained in the context of the King's Indian and Pirc Defences, a knight on f4 has more ef- fect if there's a pawn on h3. We now return to the position arising after 11 ..tc1 (D):

After this bishop retreat, we can see the ba- sic features of the position developing. White has a bishop-pair and prospects of gaining space, which is generally a good combination. But the difficulties with his structure are worth noting. White has three options regarding what to do with the d-pawn: 1) He can exchange it on e5, but that isolates his c-pawns and frees the c5-square for one of Black's pieces. 2) He can advance the pawn to d5, but this seriously reduces the mobility of his pawns, be- cause c4-c5 is easily prevented (by ... b6, if nothing else). Worse, if Black can play ... c6 and ... cxd5 (or recapture with a piece if White plays dxc6), then White's pawns on c2 and c3 will be especially exposed down the half-open c-file, and Black will have permanent outposts for his pieces on c4 and c5. Therefore White will nor- mally make the advance d5 only when he has a strong attack elsewhere (for example, on the kingside with f4), or when Black has already committed to ... c5 and cannot open the c-file. These themes are almost the same ones that we saw in the Nimzo-Indian Defence in Volume 2, and especially in the Samisch Variation. 3) White can and usually does leave the d- pawn where it is, exerting some pressure on e5. Then he can organize f4, to attack that square further, and/or play for lLlh4-f5 . Black would like to neutralize White's bish- ops by locking the position, but there's no way to rule out some pawn-break by White, regard- less of whether d5 has been played. So he will generally try to reserve activity somewhere else on the board. Depending upon circumstances, that may well involve a queenside advance such as ... b5 (particularly in the ... c5 main lines); sometimes he can aim for ... d5, either with or without ... c6. Black will also try to prevent or anticipate any attempt to play f4, and in doing so he can even play on the kingside himself if the opportunity arises. 1l. .. c5 The most direct move, trying to resolve the central situation. Black has a row of legitimate alternatives; for example: a) ll...c6 12 ..tfl (intending a double cap- ture on e5) 12 .. .'iVc7 (or 12 .. J:td8) 13lLlh4l:[e8

14 g3 (14lLlf5 might be better) 14 ... h6 15 f4!?

~a5, Sturua-A.Mikhalevski, Biel 1999, and now Mikhalevski suggests 16 lLlf5 exf4 17 ctJxd6, but then the tactic 17 ... 'iVxc3! 18 ctJxe8 ctJxe8 19 ..txf4 ctJxd4! wins back material, in view of 20 ..td3 'iVxe1 +! 21 'iVxe1 ctJf3+. In all of these positions, White has to prepare f4 care- fully or risk overextending his position. b) 1l...l:[d8 12..tfl (12 ctJh4 c5 13 ctJf5 'iVc7) 12 ... b6!? introduces a strategy of luring the d- pawn forward so as to eliminate the central ten- sion and target White's queenside. For example,

White has doubled c-pawns: Black should play 15 ... c6!, when 16 dxc6 i.xc6 leaves White's c-pawns exposed along the c-file, and 16 c4 can be answered by 16 ... b5! or 16 ... cxd5 17 cxd5 .tc8 with the idea of ... i.d7 and ... l':!.ac8. c) ll...a6 12 i.n 4:Jd7 13 g3 (D) (13 a4 would restrain Black's queenside for the mo- ment) and now: cl) In the game Shabanov-Hecht, Dresden 2004, Black simply overprotected the e5-pawn by 13 ... 'ilVf614 i.e3l':!.e8 15 i.g2 h616 ~d2 b6, at which point the players agreed to a draw. White might try 17 4:Jh4, intending f4, when 17 ... i.b7 18 4:Jf5 4:Jg5! hits e4 and plans 19 f3 d5! 20 h4!? dxe4 with great complications. c2) 13 ... c5 14 i.g2 l':!.b8 15 h4 b5 16 h5 a5 17 4:Jh4 (Aagaard suggests 17 d5 4:Jc7 18 4:Jh4) 17 ... g6. Here, instead of 18 i.e3 b4 19 d5, as in Conquest-Ledger, British Ch, Liverpool 2008, when Black should have played 19 ... 4:Jf4!, White can close the centre and try to activate his bishops by 18 i.h6l':!.d8 19 d5 4:Jc7 (19 ... 4:Jf4?? 20 gxf4 "iVxh4?? 21 i.g5) 20 a4 b4 21 'ilVd2 with the idea f4. These are not dull positions. You can see that the symmetrical nature of the Four Knights doesn't limit its strategic complexity. We now return to 11...c5 (D): w 12 i.ft Another bishop retreat to its home square! There are several points to this move, but the main one is that White would like to play g3 in order to support the move 4:Jh4 and, in the best of worlds, f4. But if he is to do this, his bishop is needed to defend the kingside light squares. Instead, 12 dxe5 dxe5 13 4:Jxe5?? loses to 13 ... ttJc7, and 12 d5 releases the tension before it's necessary; in response, Black can smoothly develop his queenside play via 12 ... 4:Jc7 13 i.n i.d7 14 a4l':!.ab8, with ... b5 to follow shortly. White's main alternative is the flexible move 12 a4, to restrain ... b5 and see how events de- velop. Then: a) In Spassky-Xie Jun, Copenhagen 1997, Black committed a common error by opening up the central position: 12 ... 4:Jc7 13 i.n i.g4 14 h3! i.xf3?! 15 'ilVxf3 cxd4 16 cxd4 exd4 17 e5! 4:Jd7 18 i.a3 4:Jxe5 19 'i!Vxb7, threatening 20 l':!.xe5!. b) 12 ... l':!.d8 (D) is much better: bl) In Short-Anand, Linares 1992, White clarified the centre and tried to advance on the kingside by 13 dxe5 dxe5 14 'ilVe2 ~c7 15 i.c4 h6 16 4:Jh4 l':!.e8 17 4:Jf5 4:Jf4 18 'iWf3, where- upon Anand suggests that 18 ... i.e6 19 i.n c4 would at least equalize. b2) After 13 d5, Black can employ a stan- dard set-up by 13 ... 4:Jf8 14 i.n 4:Jg6 15 g3 h6.

Symmetry in the English Opening The English Opening with 1 c4 cS is a major source of symmetrical play (as well as a gold- mine of reversed lines). As you can see by ex- amining Volume 3, most variations become unbalanced by move S at the latest, but a few are likely to exhibit extended symmetry. Two generalizations seem to apply to these lines. First, Black can depart from symmetry in vari- ous ways with little risk. However, the longer Black imitates White's moves, the greater are White's chances to reach a favourable and dou- ble-edged position. Let me briefly cite some variations from Volume 3 to illustrate this. One of the best-known symmetrical varia- tions is 1 c4 cS 2 lOc3 lOc6 3 g3 g6 4 .Bg2 .Bg7, when after S 1Of3, the old main line is S. .. lOf6 6 O-O (or 6 d4) 6 ... O-O 7 d4 cxd4 8 lOxd4. Then White has a small advantage and has enjoyed excellent results. However, Black doesn't have to imitate White to this extent; he can break the symmetry earlier with S ... eS, S. .. e6 or S. .. d6, all respectable moves which grant him fully-fledged play. Similarly, after S a3, Black can imitate his op- ponent for a long time, notably in this variation:

Black decides to be the one to break symme- try. Continued imitation is risky, but not fatal; for example, 1O ... lOf6 11 d4 dS 12 .Bf4 (12 lOeSlOxeS 13 dxeSlOg4) 12 ... .ifS (12 ... nb6 is also possible) 13 .Bxb8 .ixbl 14 .i.f4 .ifS (14 ... .Be4 probably improves) IS O-O O-O 16 lOeS!, and now the symmetry is finally broken, in view of 16 ... lOe4?? l71Oxc61Oxc3 18 'iiel. Black should play 16 ... 'iib6 17 .ixdS! lOxeS! (17 ... lOxd4 18 .txf7+ l:txf7 19 .i.e3 and White will emerge a pawn up) 18 dxeS (18 .i.xeS nc8!) 18 ... lOg4, although he hasn't yet equal- ized following 19 .Bg21OxeS 20 lOdS. This is a typical result of too slavish an imitation, but it was fun while it lasted! 11 d4! White chooses the best point at which to seek an imbalance, rather than play 11 e4 and revert to the status quo. 11 ... exd4 12 lOd5 This unresolved and unclear position is ana- lysed in Volume 3, Chapter 7, in the notes to M.Domingo-Alekseev, Berlin 2006. The point is that you can find plenty of promising mate- rial in a symmetrical variation if your goal is to play for a win. Here's another variation that is traditionally considered drawish, probably more so than any other imitative line in the English. It won't sur- prise you that its evaluation is also unclear.

w White has chosen to enter into the truly sym- metrical version of the Double Fianchetto. Black is supposed to equalize rather easily here, and indeed, the variation has a high percentage of draws. The key for Black is that he's under no pressure, and can therefore break the symmetry without much risk. Often this takes the form of a central liquidation.

But that doesn't preclude a normally contested game if the players choose to pursue one.

The slightly odd-looking 9 .Be3 is the most popular move at this juncture. It very often transposes to the note to Black's 10th move after 9 ... ltJbd7 10 nfdl, so I'll defer a discus- sion about it until then. 9• •• ltJbd7 (D) Black often delays castling in these lines to keep more options open. Here 9 ... O-O should be answered by 10 'iVh4, as in the game. If the queen remains on d4 it is subject to discovered attack by ... ltJe4 or ... ltJd5. w You may recognize this as the Hedgehog Variation from Volume 3, but with ... g6 and ... iLg7 replacing ... e6 and ... .Be7. It's an inter- esting trade-off. At first blush, this seems to fa- vour Black, who can boast that his bishop is more active on the long diagonal, and that he has no weaknesses, in contrast to the weakness of the pawn on d6 which can be so important af- ter ... e6 and ... iLe7. Needless to say, that's not the end of the story. For one thing, in the Hedgehog, a pawn on e6 covers d5, so Black needn't worry about ltJd5 in most lines. In addi- tion, Black's kingside structure (with pawns on f7, g7 and h7) is ideal for protection against a direct attack, whereas Black's structure with ... g6 in the Double Fianchetto leads to the pos- sibility of attack via 'iVh4 and .Bh6. In the end, the two systems are roughly equivalent in worth, with the Double Fianchetto having a slightly safer feel, and the Hedgehog giving more coun- terattacking prospects. 10 'ii'h4 The most common move-order is 10 .Be3 (which is the equivalent of 9 .Be3 ltJbd7 10 l:!.fdl). As mentioned, the bishop covers c5 against a rook -lift, and it also aims at b6; the lat- ter tends to be a sensitive point because the move ... a6 is almost always included in Black's

We now return to 10 'fih4 (D):

.... l:!.e8 This is sometimes played after ... O-O, and will often transpose. Black wants to have ... :tcS available at the right moment, helping to defend against a potential kingside attack by White; to that end, ... .l:!.cS-hS is a theme. He also prepares ... .l:!.c7, in order to shift his queen to a8 and then double rooks on the c-file. The latter manoeuvre, in conjunction with ... a6 and ... bS, can create great pressure on White's queenside. In fact, Black's discovery of this rook manoeuvre was key to making the Double Fianchetto popular some years back and remains essential to the variation today. As regards move-orders, the game's 10 'ii'h4 is less frequently played than 10 i.e3, perhaps because of the response 10 ... h6 (D). Then the simple idea of ... gS can be a prob- lem in various lines, especially since the retreat w 'iWh3 runs into ... g4, and ~d4 might subject the queen to discovered attack.

8 Irregular Openings and Initial Moves

In this series, I've focused primarily upon what I call the 'important' openings, which are gen- erally the ones used most, but also on those that have an established history of practice. In this chapter I'll devote some time to a discussion of irregular openings, and then look at unusual first moves in detail. I'm using the adjective 'ir- regular' to denote openings that are not fre- quently employed by master players, but still enjoy a following on lower levels. Sometimes such openings are called 'unorthodox'; that isn't such a bad word, but from the point of view of strategy, 'unorthodox' techniques can still be popular ones, whereas certain 'orthodox' treat- ments of positions fall into relative disuse (per- haps because they are too easy to meet). For example, the Trompowsky Attack 1 d4 ttJf6 2 .tg5 has become popular and universally ac- cepted, but one could argue that 2 .tg5 itself is not an 'orthodox' move; on the flip side, the form of the Torre Attack with 1 d4 d5 2 ttJf3 ttJf6 3 .tg5 is orthodox by the classical stan- dards of development, but it isn't very popular any more. In a similar way, classically-oriented openings such as the Ponziani Opening (1 e4 e5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 c3) and the Hungarian Defence (1 e4 e5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 .tc4 .te7) are orthodox in strategic terms, but rare in master practice; to- day, they could legitimately be called 'irregular'. This distinction can extend to eccentric-looking openings which were until recently irregular and have moved into the mainstream; for exam- ple, the Chebanenko Slav (1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 ttJf3 ttJf6 4 ttJc3 a6). While this variation could hardly be called 'irregular' any more, being the respectable subject of books and articles, I'm still not sure who is so advanced as to call Black's strategy 'orthodox'! Of course, the ter- minology isn't terribly important; the point is that the openings I refer to as 'irregular' in this chapter aren't yet used by masters or grand- masters on an ordinary basis, although many remain stubbornly popular with average play- ers. The Appeal of the Irregular Some irregular openings are perfectly playable; others are used merely for surprise value and have limited or no logic behind them. In either case, their attraction is undeniable. The Web is surfeited with articles on various unusual ways to begin the game, and there are numerous sites solely devoted to them. If you go often enough to any chess club, or to the skittles rooms of tournaments, you'll eventually run into people who are discussing some strange and dubious opening, usually having a great time doing so. What is the appeal? First, there's something lib- erating about playing around with an opening that you haven't seen before, and having the feeling (illusory or not) that the move you're suggesting hasn't been thought of by anyone until this moment. Along the same lines, chess- players like having 'their own' special opening, be that an eccentric first move, a speculative gambit, or even something that they've in- vented. Furthermore, a lot of irregular openings have an exciting, paradoxical feel to them: you make counterintuitive moves, waste time, or sacrifice pawns, and yet some not-so-obvious factor is working in your favour to give you positive chances. It's a break from the drudgery of 'cor- rect' play and following those tired old princi- ples. Even if you don't secure the better game, you can at least irritate your opponent and pres- ent him with multiple opportunities to go wrong. The most entertaining irregular openings also contain tactical traps into which one innocent victim after another falls. It takes a confluence of forces for this to happen, but makes every- thing more fun. Then there's the issue of convenience, un- derestimated by the professionals who write chess literature. The most obvious reason to go out of the mainstream is to have something to play without needing very much preparation.

250 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Depending upon the time you have available, getting away from your opponent's favourite opening can be a practical necessity. Just don't forget that opening preparation has benefits that go well beyond the immediately practical; as I'm constantly stressing, it will increase your understanding of middle games and of chess in general. Perhaps that's why we see so few un- compromising adherents of irregular and even out-of-the-way openings reach the top of the chess hierarchy. There are exceptions, of course, but you will find that the successful grand- masters who play anti-theoretical lines (includ- ing obscure sidelines of mainstream openings) have previously or concurrently spent years playing and studying more conventional open- ings. The knowledge and skill derived from knowing a wide variety of standard opening ideas and associated middlegames informs their use of irregular openings; it's not so clear that the reverse is true. In any case, most masters who employ unconventional openings aren't simply tossing out the moves; they have usu- ally put a great deal of time into examining their consequences. Properly motivated, this kind of investigation can increase your under- standing and playing strength, just as any other kind of opening study can. Thus, by itself, play- ing out of the mainstream shouldn't do damage to one's results; after all, a strong player can win with any opening. But playing something just because it gets you 'out of the books' prob- ably won't payoff, because your overall under- standing of how to play openings is a more important factor than the specific opening you use. Finally, the major openings have for the most part achieved their status because they tend to produce the best practical outcomes in master play. I don't believe this consideration affects the inexperienced player much, if at all, nor even the average one. Playing gambits, for example, can be very healthy for your rating at the club level. Nevertheless, as you begin to improve and play stronger opponents, the ob- jective worth of an opening takes on more sig- nificance. So there's a point at which you will want to know which irregular openings are ac- tually inferior, which are acceptable but unpop- ular, and which are easy to play. In addition, if you're going to use such an opening, you'll want it to conform to your personal tastes. We still find a widespread snobbishness about irregular openings among masters and teachers, many of whom seem to ignore the finer dis- tinctions among them. Teachers find it easy to inculcate their students with the popular open- ings they themselves are studying and playing; that is fine, but at the same time many become dismissive of everything outside the received wisdom. Thus we see juniors who feel that anything except main-line Sicilians are infe- rior (and, as a result, we see a monotonous stream of Dragons, Najdorfs and Sveshnikovs at scholastic tournaments). It turns out, however, that much of what is ir- regular today becomes conventional tomorrow. The contemporary literature on irregular and unusual moves, in both book and periodical form, is increasingly professional, much of it written by masters and grandmasters. They are discovering that more opening ideas, including old ones, are playable and can lead to rich posi- tions. By keeping an eye on such literature, you can more easily separate openings with real worth from those with only shock value. Adventures with 1 e4 It's staggering how much is going on at the most fundamental levels of opening theory. By way of example, and with an eye on ways that we might spice up our chess experiences, let me list a se- lection of unconventional variations following from the initial move 1 e4. They all arise within just the first five moves, all have been played by grandmasters, and all are good enough to be worthy of consideration for practical play. Most of them are truly irregular lines; to the extent that a couple have assumed top-level respect- ability, they have only done so recently. And, in spite of being recommended by players and theoreticians, the majority of these lines haven't gained large followings or elite approval. To be clear: I'm not including the countless ingenious new ideas that are refreshing already estab- lished openings. Rather, I am selecting very early moves that define a unique opening varia- tion. Let me begin with what is easily the most popular 1 e4 opening, the Sicilian Defence.

IRREGULAR OPENINGS AND INITIAL MOVES 251

Players on both sides of the board are discover- ing that variations previously ignored at the top levels are in fact legitimate. To put that in con- text with an older example, it's worth remem- bering that about two decades ago, 1 e4 c5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 .tb5 (the Rossolimo Variation) was still considered somewhat irregular (or at best harmless), and now it has driven some grand- masters away from their lifelong preference for the move 2 ... ttJc6! As Black in the Open Sicilian, there are many irregular set-ups which now seem quite playable; for example: a) The Lowenthal Sicilian with 1 e4 c5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ttJxd4 e5 5 ttJb5 a6, al- lowing 6 ttJd6+. When I compare the various recent books and articles on this system, in- cluding those by grandmasters recommending particular systems for White, I see nothing to indicate that Black doesn't stand perfectly well. b) The Grivas Sicilian with I e4 c5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ttJxd4 'iVb6. This isn't terribly ambitious, but gives you thematic Sicilian po- sitions without requiring memorization of the ultra-critical variations of, say, Dragons and Najdorfs. A related and playable irregular sys- tem is the 'Gaw-Paw': 1 e4 c5 2 ttJf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ttJxd4 ttJf6 5 ttJc3 'iUb6, and a move ear- lier in this sequence 4 ... 'iUb6 is also used (the Kveinys Variation). c) The O'Kelly Sicilian: 1 e4 c5 2 ttJf3 a6, which is undergoing a great resurgence of inter- est. Properly handled, it consistently produces unbalanced positions in which the better player on that day will win the majority of games. d) Various lines of the amazingly flexible PaulsenlKan Sicilian. For example, 1 e4 c5 2 ttJf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ttJxd4 a6 5 .td3 g6 is still an irregular line, but has serious theoretical backing. After five moves, Black appears to have the weakest dark squares imaginable - but a playable position! Next, let me tum to some irregular early moves on the white side of the Sicilian. As White, you can have fun with slow and eccen- tric moves because of your extra tempo: a) 1 e4 c5 2 a3. This is Grandmaster Bezgo- dov's move; he has written a 200+ page book on it. White's idea (among others) is to play b4 in some lines to get a favourable form of Sicilian Wing Gambit (1 e4 c5 2 b4) while avoiding some of Black's most active defences. Each of 2 ... ttJc6, 2 ... e6 and 2 ... d6, for example, are an- swered by 3 b4. There are also elements of the English Opening reversed; for example, 2 ... g6 3 c3 !? is 1 c4 e5 2 g3 c6 with the extra a3 for White. Incidentally, there have been a number of articles about the Wing Gambit itself, and that might be another choice for the well-prepared player. b) A related, somewhat older line is 1 e4 c5 2 ttJc3 ttJc6 3 f4 g6 4 ttJf3 .tg7 5 a3. White in- tends to play b4 (especially on a move like 5 ... e6) and otherwise uses a2 as a potential re- treat-square for his bishop (for example, after 5 ... d6 6 .tc4), while holding up ... b5-b4 under some circumstances. c) 1 e4 c5 2 ttJa3 has been played by the strong and experienced grandmaster Zviagin- tsev (7 times against 2600+ rated opponents!), as well as a few other prominent grandmasters such as Malakhov and Sashikiran. This is a sound line with some surprisingly positive fea- tures. It's also a real mix-and-match. For exam- ple, White can enter into a sort of c3 Sicilian with ttJc2 or ttJc4 via a sequence such as 2 ... e6

3 c3 d5 4 e5 ttJc6 5 ttJf3 with the idea ttJc2 and

d4. Or, against 2 ... ttJc6, the Rossolimo-like 3 .tb5 leaves the Grand Prix move f4 available to be played later. Moves like 2 a3 and 2 ttJa3 will probably never become wildly popular, but they are sound lines which will doubtless see periodic usage by strong players. d) The Closed Sicilian with 1 e4 c5 2 ttJc3 ttJc63 g4. The idea is to accelerate White's ex- pansion on the kingside; normally, he plays 3 g3 and only later, g4. Another offbeat Closed Sicilian is 1 e4 c5 2 ttJc3 ttJc6 3 .tb5, used by a number of grandmasters. e) I'll also mention Vasiukov's variation 1 e4 c5 2 ttJf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 'iUxd4, playing for rapid development, which is orthodox by com- parison with the ones above. This has been around for ages, and although it has never really caught on at the elite level, it has scored reason- ably well. It is also wide open to new interpreta- tions. What about 1 e4 e5? For Black, irregular old lines are being reconsidered; for example:

252 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

a) 1 e4 e5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 .ltb5 g6, played by Smyslov, is an interesting alternative to the con- ventional Ruy Lopez lines. b) I e4 e5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 .ltb5 f5, the Schlie- mann Defence, is still irregular but has been ap- pearing in elite practice and has much new high-level theory devoted to it. As a practical consideration, very few opponents will enter the lengthy and tactical main lines of the Schlie- mann (starting with 4 ttJc3), so you will often see modest responses, such as 4 d3, which is generally regarded as more or less equal. After I e4 e5, many of White's newer ap- proaches come well beyond the first few moves and don't define independent systems. How- ever, we do see the revival of some older lines. Remember that the Scotch Game (1 e4 e5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 d4) had arguably become an 'irreg- ular' opening by the time that Kasparov revived and popularized it. Here are some other double e-pawn openings which have recently had at- tention drawn to them: a) I e4 e5 2 ttJf3 d6 3 d4 ttJf6 4 ttJc3 ttJbd7 5 g4 is Shirov's gambit in the Philidor Defence (an opening which nowadays more often arises via I e4 d6 2 d4 ttJf6 3 ttJc3 e5 4 ttJf3 ttJbd7). It continues to do well and for many players, that beats 20 moves of positional manoeuvring! b) In Chapter 7, I covered the Four Knights Game, 1 e4 e5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 ttJc3 ttJf6 (this is also a possible outcome of the Petroff De- fence: 2 ttJf3 ttJf6 3 ttJc3 ttJc6). White is play- ing several 'irregular' moves following 4 .ltb5 ttJd4, whereas Black has deviated successfully before that with 4 ... .ltd6 !? A half-move earlier, White can get a fresh set of positions out of 4 a3!?, the Gunsberg Variation; this little move prepares d4 without having to worry about ... .ltb4, and tries to create new problems based upon 4 ... .ltc5?! 5 ttJxe5 and 4 ... d5 5 .ltb5. c) 1 e4 e5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 .ltb5 a6 4 .i.a4 ttJf6 5 'iie2, the Worrall Attack, has never been in bad standing, but has generally been treated as an irregular variation. Now it is seeing a revival. Incidentally, various Ruy Lopez lines with 4 d3 and 5 d3 have been increasingly employed by top grandmasters. In the French Defence, Black has always had great leeway in how to bring his pieces out. For example: a) Recently, I e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ttJd2 is being answered by irregular moves such 3 ... h6 and 3 ... b6, even at master and grandmaster level, as well as by the better-established but still non- mainstream moves 3 ... ttJc6 and 3 ... a6. b) In the Advance Variation, after I e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5, 3 ... b6 is increasingly respectable. Black can also play the odd-looking 3 ... .ltd7, which reserves the option of the normal ... c5 (when d7 is the most common square for the bishop), but also ... a6 and ... .ltb5 in the right sit- uation. c) After I e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ttJc3, 3 ... ttJc6 has been an irregular byway for years, but now has strong adherents and a respectable body of theory behind it. Strange to say, even 3 ... i..e7 and 3 ... h6 are being played by strong players. With regard to the latter move, the seemingly unrelated and bizarre 1 ttJf3 h6!? (the subject of intense analysis by Wind), may well have drawbacks, but it can lead to 2 e4 e6 3 d4 d5, and the pawn on h6 proves useful. Indeed, 4 ttJc3 ttJf6 is then a transposition to the French Defence variation 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ttJc3 h6 4 ttJf3 ttJf6, a line which has been played by nu- merous masters and grandmasters. For his part, White periodically experiments with irregular moves in order to keep the play outside the main lines of the French; for exam- ple: a) On the second move, in addition to the previously irregular but now-established 1 e4 e6 2 'iie2, I e4 e6 2 b3 d5 3 .ltb2 is being seen as a provocative way to mix things up. b) 1 e4 e6 2 ttJf3 d5 3 e5 c5 4 b4 cxb4 5 a3 (or 5 d4) is the French Wing Gambit. Although infrequently used at grandmaster level, it has an earnest following below that and considerable theoretical backing. In the Caro-Kann Defence, BJack has many new ideas in established variations, but also some within the first few moves: a) 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 ttJc3 b5, with the idea 4 exd5 b4, is an old line by Gurgenidze. It is be- ing reinvestigated and seems a useful weapon. b) Against I e4 c6 2 ttJf3 d5 3 ttJc3, often a dull variation, some high-level players have used the line 3 ... ttJf6 4 e5 ttJe4. Much of the experimental action for White is taking place in the Advance Variation:

IRREGULAR OPENINGS AND INITIAL MOVES 253

a) After 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 .i.f5, the varia- tions 4 .i.e3 and 4 lbd2 have gone from being wholly irregular to respectable enough that they now have numerous grandmaster practi- tioners. b) Versus 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 c5, we are seeing 4 c4 and 4 lbf3 lbc6 5 c4. Up until re- cently, these moves were virtually unknown. c) The pseudo-Advance variation 1 e4 c6 2 lbe2 d5 3 e5 has drawn some high-powered at- tention of late, both in theoretical articles and grandmaster play. In the Pirc and Modern Defences, Black's flexibility is such that irregular or at least un- usual move-orders are commonplace. Essen- tially, he can play the moves ... .i.g7, ... c6, ... a6 with ... b5 and ... O-O in almost any order to keep White guessing. Several unconventional lines have recently attracted attention in the Modem Defence: a) I e4 g6 2 d4 .i.g7 3lbc3 d5!? is a surpris- ing thrust, mentioned in Chapter 3, with the idea that 4lbxd5 c6 wins back White's d-pawn, and 4 exd5 lbf6 will either do so or extract other con- cessions from White. I'm doubtful that Black can achieve real equality after 5 .i.c4 (5 h4!? in- tending 5 ... lbxd5 6 h5 could be tried) 5 ... lbbd7, but it's a position into which many strong play- ers have entered. b) A whole complex of ... a6 systems, some- times referred to as 'Tiger's Modem', can be played against White's main set-ups, especially

1 e4 g6 2 d4 .i.g7 3lbc3 d6 (even 3 ... a6 is possi-

ble) 4 lbf3 a6, 4 .i.e3 a6, and 4 f4 a6. I exam- ined these in detail in Chapter 3. White can also play outside the main lines; for example: a) He can launch early h4 attacks, the most common one going 1 e4 d6 2 d4 lbf6 3 lbc3 g6 4 .i.e2 .i.g7 5 h4. b) 1 e4 d6 2 d4lbf6 3 lbc3 g6 4 .i.e2 .i.g7 5 g4, less frequently seen, has had some success. c) In the Austrian Attack, 1 e4 d6 2 d4 lbf6 3 lbc3 g6 4 f4 .i.g7, the move 5 a3 was almost unknown a decade ago. Pushing the a-pawn avoids the standard line 5 lbf3 c5 and the large amount of theory associated with it (that is, 5 a3 c5 6 dxc5 "iVa5 allows 7 b4). 5 a3 O-O 6 lbf3 (equivalent to 5 lbf3 O-O 6 a3) is a related line which has met with some success. The Modem Variation of the Alekhine De- fence, 1 e4lbf6 2 e5 lbd5 3 d4 d6 4lbf3, is an astonishing example of the increasing interest in what had been minor sidelines. First, the top grandmasters are treating 4 ... dxe5 5lbxe5 as the main line of the entire defence (with first 5 ... g6 and more recently 5 ... c6 as the follow-up), even though it was a minor irritant just two decades ago compared to 4 ... g6 and 4 ... .i.g4. Then, on the same move, we see a distinct revival of the irregular moves 4 ... lbb6 and 4 .. . lbc6, accompa- nied by much analysis. Even Miles's unlikely- looking move 4 ... c6 has a following and contin- ues to perform reasonably well. Finally, in the Scandinavian Defence with 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 1Wxd5, so much has been discov- ered over the last decade that it's hard to distin- guish what's irregular from what isn't. As a general observation, I find it amazing that after 3 lbc3, Black's popular move 3 ... 1Wd6 was an irregular sideline just 10 years ago. It is now ar- guably the main line, especially at grandmaster level. Incidentally, it wasn't so long ago (per- haps 30 years or so) that the Scandinavian was seldom played and considered marginal by most masters. A number of older opening books even dismissed it entirely on the basis of Black's loss of time with his queen. The great Bent Larsen was instrumental in changing that assessment. In this by no means complete review, I've limited myself to 1 e4 openings, and to the first five moves; as you can imagine, a similar array of irregular lines is associated with 1 d4 open- ings. There's a feast of offerings out there. Of course, some of these ideas will prove wanting in the long run, just as new ones will appear. The real point is not to fill your repertoire with unusual openings. In fact, I personally advise against that, and believe that you willieam more about chess if you mostly play (and study) major openings. But I also think that the judicious use of some irregular variations can make your chess more fun, and stimulate you to think creatively. Responding to the Unfamiliar Of course, a lot of the time you'll be on the other side of the board when the surprising

254 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

move or variation appears. What should you do when faced with an unfamiliar opening, or even an unfamiliar move in an opening that you know? Your first reaction should be to take a deep breath and try to understand what your op- ponent is doing. Is he attacking or planning to attack any weak points? Is he preparing a cer- tain positionally desirable move? Are there any tactics involved? Once you've got a feel for the key factors of the position, you can react ac- cordingly. For example, against most slow moves that don't engage your pieces, it's appropriate to oc- cupy the centre with pawns (many irregular openings permit you to do so, which is part of the reason that they're irregular!). Then de- velop pieces towards the centre, just as you would do in the majority of openings. Of course, even if your moves are more principled than your opponent's, you shouldn't expect an imme- diate payback. The game of chess is forgiving enough that most pawn and piece deployments, however strange, can be coordinated in some logical fashion, so that the disadvantages of most irregular openings won't lead to disaster. If the situation is turning tactical or excep- tionally dynamic, you should take extra time to assess the problems and do as much calcula- tion of concrete sequences as possible. In that way, you may not be able to solve the position but you'll get a clear idea of what the issues are. You shouldn't be intimidated; after all, it's unlikely that an irregular opening will win by force, and it's quite possible that there's some serious flaw or drawback to it. Be alert and take advantage of specific mistakes. Say that you have a fair general knowledge of open- ings, but within the first few moves, your op- ponent plays a gambit that you've never seen. It's likely that the reason you haven't seen it is because you can safely accept the pawn. For example, the sequence 1 d4lZ:lf6 2 g4 has a cult following, and might make some sense in con- junction with the moves g5 and perhaps iLg2. But 2 ... lZ:lxg4 3 e4 really isn't very impressive; among others, 3 ... d6, followed by ... lZ:lf6 ifthe knight is attacked, leaves White short of com- pensation. Similarly, a gambit such as 1 d4 e5 2 dxe5 d6 should be accepted by 3 exd6; White has no weaknesses to assist Black, who has only slightly better developmental prospects. Declining such gambits lets your opponent off the hook. Assuming that the irregular opening is logi- cal and contests important squares, it's useful to keep your pawn-structure in mind. Quite often, unusual openings either come with weaknesses or they allow you to create weaknesses in your opponent's position. Regardless of the specifics, replying with common-sense moves and apply- ing what you know about analogous situations will serve you well. Assessing the Initial Moves If you look through a listing of irregular open- ings, you'll find that a majority of such openings include weakening moves, unjustified sacri- fices, or a disdain for central control. You are also confronted with an intimidating reality: ir- regular openings, even limiting ourselves to named ones, are more numerous than conven- tional ones! The cynic might say that's because there are more bad moves in chess than good ones. Indeed, when we find out that there are at least four named openings beginning with 1 a4, including 1 a4 b6 2 d4 d5 3 lZ:lc3lZ:ld7 (with the 'idea' 4lZ:lxd5 iLb7), which has been called the 'Cologne Gambit' of the 'Ware Opening', it's easy to agree with that. By the time we get to move 5, the number of 'irregular' moves ex- plodes for both sides. Rather than tackle the near-infinite subject of irregular openings in general, I thought that it would be fun and in- deed revealing to look at openings defined by the very first move. This exercise is particularly appropriate for the average player, because the logic of these openings does not depend upon prior knowledge of variations leading up to it. As it is, there's not nearly enough room to cover even these first moves in a comprehensive fash- ion. But I think that there's much to learn from how the variations break down, even if they can't be subject to detailed analysis. For many players, unusual first moves are the most attractive; after all, what's better than playing an initial move that makes your oppo- nent think? This psychological motivation has its effect, as evidenced by the number of games played with the least promising of first moves. For example, in one of my combined databases,

IRREGULAR OPENINGS AND INITIAL MOVES 255

here is the number of games (in parentheses) with the following first moves for White. In ev- ery case, numerous masters (over 2200 rating) are represented: 1 f3 (166); 1 lbh3 (231); 1 c3 (437); 1 e3 (1,190); 1 a3 (1,829); 1 g4 (2,845). Non-transpositional games with llbc3 (which is used frequently for transpositional purposes) number 9,152; and 1 b4, respectable but nowhere near mainstream, is represented by 20,689 con- tests, more than the main lines of many major openings. These figures include some joke draws and I-move contests, but not enough to have a significant effect. And, to be sure, they represent small percentages of the entirety of games. Nevertheless, given the thousands of conventional (and unconventional) variations to choose from that stem from 1 e4, 1 d4, 1 c4 and llbf3, I'm surprised that tournament play- ers are inclined to choose those above so fre- quently. And you should keep in mind that these numbers would surely balloon if you in- cluded amateur and club games (which are for the most part absent from standard databases). So what are the characteristics of these first- move openings? First, it's useful to classify them according to evaluation. I'll call some openings' good enough' (if they were worthy of an unqualified 'good', they'd probably not be irregular!), others 'substandard', and still oth- ers 'bad'. 'Bad' and 'good enough' are readily understandable categories; I'll get more spe- cific on a case-by-case basis. A 'substandard' opening is generally uninspiring and tends to produce below-average results. This kind of opening is functional at lower levels, especially if it's tricky and has surprise value; however, a substandard opening becomes difficult to han- dle as you come up against stronger opponents. Of course, any assessment depends upon what you expect to get out of the opening. I often hear advocates of irregular openings for White bragging about how their opening 'hasn't been refuted'. That's not a very good criterion! After all, it takes some pretty poor play for White to actually come out of the opening with a disad- vantage, and when White goes through contor- tions merely to reach equality, we shouldn't be impressed. To the extent that the opening is harmless, easy to play, and leaves White with the ability to pose as many problems as Black, that's 'good enough'. But if, in practice, the opening is more difficult for White to play than Black and also doesn't yield any advantage, it qualifies as 'substandard' . When it's Black who is playing an irregular opening, my assessments are naturally more forgiving. If Black can achieve a normal (i.e. very slight) disadvantage with perfect play, that's probably 'good enough'. An exception might be when the resulting position, although theoretically only moderately worse, requires a sophisticated handling that is out of the range of the average player. For example, Black may come out of the opening with quasi-permanent weaknesses or horrible-looking doubled pawns. A top player might know how to play around them, find a complex way to liquidate them, or even use them productively. However, if that in- volves extremely refined moves and/or extraor- dinary accuracy, then the opening isn't really satisfactory in practical terms and I'd call it 'substandard'. You can see that my evaluation isn't perfectly objective, and it is skewed to- wards the 'average' player, which in this case covers the broad range from developing players to experienced ones who are nevertheless be- low master level. It turns out that everything has a name, and usually multiple names. For example, according to irregular openings aficionado Eric Schiller, the "greatest living exponent" of the move 1 h4 is the Hungarian master Kadas, after whom he names the opening, but he points out that it is also known as the 'Desprez Opening' and the 'Reagan Attack'. This reflects the fact that chess-players crave immortality; it also con- firms the old saw that 'bad publicity is better than no pUblicity' . Curious, I went to my large combined database and found 354 non-trivial games with 1 h4, including 23 games by a fel- low named Ats, which swamped the number by his countryman Kadas or anyone else. A num- ber of masters have used 1 h4, among their ranks even a couple of 2400+ players. It some- how didn't surprise me that the overall success rate of 1 h4 was only moderately lower than White gets in chess overall. In over-the-board play, versus Black's replies 1...d5 and 1...lbf6, White has a typical edge over Black in raw score and performance rating, but he does quite

256 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

poorly in both respects versus 1...e5. In corre- spondence play, White does reasonably well ex- cept when playing against 1...d5, which scores exceptionally well for Black. Remarkably, look- ing through the games themselves, I didn't find any in which h4 made a significant contribution to an opening advantage for White! I suppose that should be no surprise either: on a lower or even average level of play, I h4 can be used without disastrous consequences, because both sides' more serious mistakes later will easily outweigh the disadvantages of the first move. Nevertheless, I believe most leading grand- masters would assess White's game after I h4 as already inferior. If nothing else, it's a major concession when you forfeit the possibility of castling kingside in a large majority of posi- tions. In addition, the g4-square will often be occupied by an active black piece that will be hard to get rid of, because the move f3 would create further weaknesses. If we had a large sample of games between master players, I'm convinced that I h4 would score considerably below 50%, and trail significantly in perfor- mance rating. In my judgement, then, I h4 is simply 'bad'. To get a feel for the consequences of the choice of first move (and have some fun), let's run through every initial move for White, and a selected group of them for Black. First of all, the 'regular' first moves I e4, I d4 and I c4 all occupy and/or control central squares without exposing the king or creating weaknesses. Ilbf3 controls two central squares and develops in a way that is compatible with a wide range of good systems for White. These four moves are indisputably good ones. Continuing with moves for White, both first- move fianchettoes I g3 and I b3 are logical and safe. Having studied 1. .. g6, we can infer that 1 g3 must be satisfactory. Most of the time, it transposes to openings such as the English Opening and Reti, or to any number of d-pawn openings featuring a fianchetto by White. But 1 g3 has also been played in many games which haven't transposed into other variations; for ex- ample, it often becomes a reversed Pirc De- fence such as I g3 d5 2 i.g2 e5 3 d3 c6 (or 3 ... lbc6) 4 lbf3. The same comparison holds for I b3 (which we looked at in Chapter 4), since it is an 'improved' 1...b6. Both 1 g3 and 1 b3 are a bit too passive to produce an advantage against solid play, but that's a different issue. Similarly, the Bird Opening (1 f4) was exam- ined in Chapter 6. It has a longer history of master play and is clearly sound. That leaves what I consider truly irregular first moves, divided by colour. We begin with White. Most of White's irregular first moves are 'good enough', even though some of them are passive and fail to challenge Black at all. The only reason that some of those survive 'substandard' status is that they are not partic- ularly difficult to play. A few irregular first moves have positive qualities, and are suffi- ciently attractive to recommend for the occa- sional experiment, and I'll start with those: Sokolsky/Polish: 1 b4 As discussed above, this is the most popular and respectable of the irregular first moves. To the untrained eye, it may seem a bit bizarre. Yet several books, including two very recent ones, are solely devoted to 1 b4, which is called, vari- ously, the Sokolsky Opening, the Polish Open- ing, the Orang-Utan, and probably a few other things. 1 b4 is obviously good enough; it will probably never break through on the grandmas- ter level, but it can lend a lively flavour to the game and deserves special attention. With that in mind, here are two games in very critical variations, with notes to indicate a few other di- rections.

1 b4 (D)

Schiffler - Skirl corr. 1950 What's the idea behind this move? First and foremost, White wants to fianchetto his bishop, as he does when he plays I b3. In addition, he takes some queenside space and discourages the move ... c5. In some cases, White will play b5, and the mere possibility of that move can dissuade Black from playing ... lbc6. As we have seen following I b3 and 2 i.b2, White can develop in a variety of ways. Most frequently, he plays e3, lbf3 and c4, but a double fianchetto by g3 and i.g2 is also possible. Sometimes

IRREGULAR OPENINGS AND INITIAL MOVES 257

White will play f4 before developing his knight to f3, in order to strengthen his control of the long diagonal. Black is also flexibly situated. First, there's a decent chance that ... eS or : .. e6, attacking the b-pawn, will gain a whole tempo without a meaningful concession. Since White isn't plac- ing a pawn in the centre, Black frequently takes the opportunity to do so himself by ... dS and/or ... eS. He also faces no serious threats, so he can pick from a number of set-ups and develop quickly.

1...e5

I'm going to focus on this thematic move, which attacks the pawn on b4, since it is by far the most frequently played, as well as the best chance to 'refute' I b4, in the sense of giving Black the better game by force. That mayor may not happen with best play, but White has to be careful in many lines. Here, extremely briefly, are two of the main alternatives: a) l...tLlf6 2 ..Bb2 and then: al) 2 ... g6 is a safe line, with a typical con- tinuation being 3 e3 (3 c4 ..Bg7 4 tLlf3 O-O S g3 was used by Reti; 3 ..Bxf6 exf6 isn't so effective when White doesn't gain a knight outpost to offset the bishops; compare I b3 cS 2 ..Bb2 tLlf6

3 ... ..Bg7 4 c4 d6 S tLlf3 0-06 d4 tLlbd7 (or 6 ... cS) 7 ..Be2 eS 8 O-O (8 dxeS dxeS 9 tLlxeS? tLle4), and Black has a broad choice; for example, 8 ... exd4, 8. .. 'iie7, 8 ... tLle4 and 8 ... e4 9 tLlfd2 l:te8. a2) 2 ... e6 3 a3 is playable, of course, but 3 bS is more challenging, planning to maintain the pawn there as long as possible and cramp Black's game a bit. This position has occurred in many games, without dramatic results for ei- ther side. b) I ... dS 2 ..Bb2 (D) also gives Black numer- ous options, among them:

bI) 2 ... tLlf6 3 e3 ..ifS 4 tLlf3 (4 f4 e6 S a3 as 6 bS tLlbd7 7 tLlf3 ..Bd6 and Black's rapid devel- opment ensures a good game) 4 ... e6 S a3 (S bS!?)

260 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

the insertion of a3 and ... i.a5; compare the simi- lar line below. Of course, Black can play 9 ... c5! with the idea ... ttJc6, when he has gained a tempo in lines where ... i.c7 follows (that is, he plays ... i.a5 unprovoked in lines below, and a3 is unproductive for White). 4 ... O-O 5 ttJf3 (D)

Here White has traded a flank pawn for a centre pawn, usually an advantage in chess (think of all the gambits in which one side sac- rifices a flank pawn in order to gain a central majority). In fact, we might compare White's strategy with the Sicilian Defence, in which Black willingly falls behind in development in order to secure the extra central pawn. How- ever, there are a couple of flaws in this compari- son. First, after Black wins a tempo on the bishop on e5 with ... ~e8 and/or ... ttJc6, he owns the dangerous e-file, which aims through the thickets at White's king. That is significant be- cause White is so far away from castling (a con- sequence of spending time on the moves b4, .ltb2, .ltxe5 and .ltb2). Furthermore, there are idiosyncratic qualities to this variation, in which the particulars often trump general consider- ations. For one, White's d-pawn is pinned, which makes d3 impossible for the moment and, as we shall see, creates some awkward de- fensive problems on e3. Furthermore, White's bishop is committed to the long diagonal and can get shut out of play by ... d5-d4. In what fol- lows, you'll see many examples of the attack- ing chances these factors produce. 5• • J':!.e8 This presages some tactical ideas. Naturally, Black has other options: a) Sometimes he attacks with 5 ... ttJc6, which is reasonable, but it's nice to retain the option of ... c5; for example, if White doesn't play c4, then Black can set up with ... d5 and ... c5, as in 'b'. b) 5 ... d5 6 .lte2 c5 7 O-O ttJc6 8 i.b2 (D) is a well-known position.

Play can go: bI) 8 ... ne8 9 d3!? (here 9 d4?! c4! cannot be recommended to White) can be answered by 9 ... .lta5 (compare line 'b4'). Instead, Pomme- rel-Mrkvicka, email 1990 saw 9 ... i.g4 10 ttJbd2 d4 11 a3 i.xd2!? 12 ~xd2 fIle7 13 e4, when 13 ... i.xf3 14 i.xf3 .l:tac8 has the idea of ... c4 and is dynamically balanced. b2) Naturally, 8 ... i.f5 is a sound alternative. b3) The advance 8 ... d4 produced a curious and unbalanced position following 9 c3! d3! 10 .ltxd3 ~xd3 11 cxb4 ttJxb4 12 i.xf6 gxf6 13 ttJel ~g6 14 ttJc3 .l:td8 in E.Pedersen-T.Chris- tensen, Danish Team Ch 1998/9. b4) 8 ... i.a5! is a slightly strange move used by many experts in this line; it is relatively non- committal, and has the idea of ... i.c7, taking aim at White's kingside if the opportunity arises. For example, 9 c4!? (upon 9 d3, Black plays 9 ... d4! with the idea ... ttJd5; 9 i.a3 has been suggested, but 9 ... b6 10 d4 ttJe4 makes this look like a waste of time) 9 ... d4 10 exd4 cxd4 11 d3 (Benoni-like; however, White's bishops aren't as well located as in that opening) Il..J:te8 12 ttJbd2 fIle7!?

a1) 7 ... cS 8 cxdS ttJxdS 9 i.e2 ttJc6 is solid. I think that White should play 10 'iWc2, prevent- ing ... i.fS, rather than 10 O-O i.fS!. a2) 7 ... i.fS threatens ... dxc4 and ... i.d3. a3) 7 ... ttJc6 8 cxdS 'iWxdS!? has been a fairly popular set-up for Black, since 9 i.xf6 is the fourth move by White's bishop and leaves d3 vulnerable to attack by ... i.fS and ... l:tad8. b) 7 i.e2 is arguably White's safest way to proceed, but it allows simplification by 7 ... ttJc6 8 i.b2 dxc4 9 i.xc4 i.e6, securing light-square influence in White's camp, although this time there are no tactics. 7 .•. ttJxd5 (D) 7 .. :tIVxdS 8 i.b2 ttJc6 is line 'a3' of the previ- ous note. w Si.b2 Black has won several games with tactical tricks on the e3-square; for example: a) 8 i.e2? l:txeS! 9 ttJxeS ~f6 (now both the knight and d-pawn are pinned) 10 f4 ttJxe3 and now: a1) 11 ~a4 bS!?

Al- though the move hasn't ever inspired a tidal wave of interest, it has a solid reputation and a number of strong adherents, with periodic use by grandmasters. Even the chess stars Moroze- vich and Ivanchuk have given it a whirl. In fact, whole books with extensive analysis have been devoted to the intricacies of llZ'lc3. I shall only present one game including a general outline of early moves, but you will see how ex- traordinarily rich a set of ideas can spring from the knight development. Of the irregular first moves presented in this chapter, it might well be the most fruitful to play and study. For one thing, the pawn-structures that result are often related to those in mainstream openings. A. van den Berg - Liubarsky European Seniors Ch, Arvier 2004 llZ'lc3 (D) White's basic notion is that llZ'lc3 is a flexi- ble centralizing move that looks out at e4 and dS, just as 1lZ'lf3 controls d4 and eS. Depending upon Black's reply, White can either transpose to more conventional openings or find a forma- tion in which the knight on c3 serves a useful

function. This is best explained by example, as are Black's counter-strategies. 1 .•. e5 1 lZ'lc3 can lead to an outrageous number of potential transpositions and original paths, which makes it rather attractive if you want to try something new on the first move. I'll just present a tree-structure overview with a limited selection of starting points. Keep in mind that a good deal of theory is attached to some of the following variations: a) 1...dS (D) is the main alternative to 1...eS, and introduces the idea of ... d4. w Now 2 lZ'lf3 can lead in various directions; for example, 2 ... d4 3 lZ'le4lZ'lf6 4 d3!? A funny reversed line would be 2 ... cS 3 d4 cxd4 4 li'xd4, which is a Queen's Gambit Declined, Chigorin Defence, with the extra tempo lZ'lf3; there might follow 4 ... lZ'lf6 S e4!? lZ'lc6 6 iLbS iLd7 7 iLxc6 iLxc6 8 exdS lZ'lxdS 9 O-O. The solid 2 d4 is an invitation to the Veresov Opening following 2 ... lZ'lf6 3 iLgS, or White

can play 3ltJf3, to be followed by 4 .i.f4, 4 .i.gS or even 4 g3. But by far the most important move is 2 e4 B

White attacks Black's pawn on dS directly, and challenges him to exchange, advance, or transpose into a conventional opening. Here are some possibilities: a1) 2 ... e6 is a French Defence. White can transpose to main lines by 3 d4, or play the less popular variation with 3 ltJf3. Moves such as 3 g3 and 3 f4 are playable, but unimpressive. a2) Similarly, 2 ... c6 3 d4 is a main-line Caro-Kann. White has the option of a Two Knights Variation by 3 ltJf3, and a number of unusual tries such as 3 'iff3 d44 .i.c4!? ltJf6! S eSltJbd7!? 6 exf6ltJeS 7 .i.xf7+, when neither recapture is particularly clear. a3) 2 ... ltJf6 is a line of the Alekhine De- fence by transposition: 1 e4 ltJf6 2 ltJc3 dS. This is looked upon as relatively harmless after 3 exdS ltJxdS or 3 eS ltJfd7. Sometimes Black meets 3 eS with 3 ... ltJe4!?, when the most criti- cal move is 4 ltJce2, by which White prepares, with d3, to drive Black's knight away with tempo; or he can play d4 and threaten to win the knight on e4 by f3. All of this can be found in theoretical works and databases. a4) 2 ... dxe4 3ltJxe4 (D) is commonly seen, with the usual wide choice for Black: a41) Strangely, 3 ... 'iVdS 4ltJc3!? is the same position that arises from 1 e4 dS 2 exdS 'iVxdS 3 ltJc3, a Scandinavian Defence! a42) 3 ... .i.fS and now 4 'iVf3!? has the idea, hardly forced, of 4 ... 'iVdS SltJd6+ 'iVxd6 6 'iixfS. Alternatively, 4 ltJg3 Bg6 S h4 h6 6 ltJf3 ltJd7 is possible, when play can continue 7 .i.c4 e6 8 d3 !?, while after 7 d4 e6 8 hS .i.h7 9 .i.d3 .i.xd3 10 'ii'xd3 ltJgf6, Black hopes to play ... cS and save a tempo over similar lines in the Caro- Kann Defence. ·a43) Another common continuation is 3 ... eS 4 .i.c4, when 4 ... ltJc6 (not the common blunder 4 ... .i.e7??, which loses to S 'ii'hS) S d3 .i.e7 6 ltJf3 ltJf6 7 O-O O-O is a fair position from which to begin a game. a44) 3 ... ltJc6 is one of Black's soundest moves; for example, 4 ltJf3 .i.fS!

(9 ... ii.M+! 1O..t>f2 ttJe7) 10 ~d2! ii.d6 11 ~g5, as in Sydor-Kapengut, Lublin 1973. White has the bishop-pair and mobile kingside pawns to compensate for his lack of space and poorly- placed pieces. White's second main idea is get his bishop out to c4 or b5 in front of the pawn-chain (that is, before closing it in with d3); for example, 4 ttJg3 ii.e6! (versus ii.c4; naturally there are many other moves) 5 ttJf3 (5 c3 c5 6 ii.b5+ gets the bishop out safely, but Black has nothing to complain about following 6 ... ttJd7 7 ttJf3 f6) 5 .. .f6 6 ii.b5+! c6 (or 6 ... ttJd7) 7 ii.a4 (D). 7 ... ttJa6 (7 ... ttJd7 8 ii.b3 is similar, although Black lacks the option of ... ttJM; one line is 8 ... ii.xb3 9 axb3 d3 10 c3 a5 11 O-O ttJc5 12 ttJel, which is not easy to assess; another tempt- ing move is 7 .. :i¥a5, when 8 c3! prepares 9 ii.b3) 8 ii.b3 (or 8 O-O ttJc5 9 ii.b3 ttJxb3 10 axb3 d3) 8 ... ii.xb3 9 axb3 d3 10 O-O ttJb4 11 cxd3 (11 c3!? ttJc2 12 lla2 ii.c5 13 ttJel is dou- ble-edged) l1...ttJxd3 12 ttJel ttJh6 13 "ii'c2 ttJxc1 14 llxcl "ii'c7 15 ttJf3 nd8, Lammens- Ehlvest, Vlissingen 1996, and now 16 d4! exd4 17 nfdl secures some advantage, with ideas of ttJxd4, "ii'c4 and ttJh5.

You can see by all this that 1...d5 is certainly an acceptable way for Black to play, and gives both players opportunities to unbalance the po- sition. b) 1...c5 (D) is likely to be the Sicilian player's choice. Then w bl) Indeed, 2 e4 transposes to a Closed Si- cilian. b2) 2 d4 cxd4 3 "iVxd4 ttJc6 (3 ... e6) 4 "iVh4 is quite interesting, and occurred in no less elevated a game than Morozevich-Kasparov, Frankfurt rapid 2000, which continued 4 ... ttJf6 (4 ... d5 is the most frequent choice) 5 ttJf3 (White could transpose to a Trompowsky Attack by 5 ii.g5, that is, 1 d4 ttJf6 2 ii.g5 c5 3 ttJc3 cxd4 4 ~xd4 ttJc6 5 "ii'h4) 5 ... d5 6 ii.g5 ~a5 7 O-O-O ii.e6!.

will find many such transpositions after 1 tDc3 that are theoretically harmless; still, White may be able to move his opponent into unfamiliar territory by employing them. A refreshing alternative is 2 d4!? exd4 3 'iVxd4, which is a reversed Scandinavian De- fence with an extra tDc3.

In fact, the move a3 can be useful in the 1 e4 e5 openings and the Sicilian Defence; there's even a whole book on 1 e4 c5 2 a3, as mentioned ear- lier in the chapter. However, if played on the first move, there are too many lines in which it is hardly relevant. For example, the 'irregular- move killer' 1...g6 makes you wonder why any- one would trade a3 for ... g6. White could argue that after 2 c4, there are many lines in which a3 will eventually prove useful, but that's a little lame. More ambitiously, Neil McDonald tried to solve this problem by means of 1 a3 g6 2 f4!? i..g7 (2 ... e5!? would be a strange spin-off of the From Gambit) 3 tbf3 d5 4 g3, a reversed Le- ningrad Dutch Defence with an additional a3, which is interesting but no more than equal. Of course, a properly-handled 1...d5 can also ren- der 1 a3 harmless. b) 1 e3 has little going for it in a positive sense, but it's trouble-free, since 2 d4 can always follow, and 2 f4 with a Bird Opening is often possible. After 1...e5, French Defence players might like 2 d4, and English Opening players 2 c4; also, 2 b3 would be an Owen Defence reversed with the normal move e3 included. Against 1...d5, 2 d4 will probably become a Colle Opening or Queen's Gambit Semi-Tar- rasch, whereas others might like 2 f4 or 2 b3. And so forth; the point is that, while 1 e3 is a thoroughly uninspired move, and I'm not rec- ommending it, it isn't 'substandard' or 'bad'. c) 1 d3 is slightly more conventional in spirit, because White can slip into default Pirc De- fencelKing's Indian Attack mode by 2 tbf3, 3 g3, 4 i..g2 and 50-0. Otherwise, the cornme~ts about 1 e3 apply here too. d) 1 c3, sometimes called the Saragossa Opening, commits White rather early on. This

270 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

rather pathetic-looking move has been associ- ated with the truly abysmal 'iVc2, but if White keeps wasting time in that manner, Black really will stand better. So 2 d4 should probably fol- low. As applies to 1 e3, Black can play almost anything, but 1...e5 2 d4 exd4 3 cxd4 d5 is a form of the Exchange QGD that is harmless to Black, and 1...d5 suggests itself, because then 2 d4 is equivalent to the anaemic 1 d4 d5 2 c3, 2 lLIf3 lLIf6 doesn't inspire, and otherwise Black has nothing to fear. The following two fIrst moves may in some theoretical sense be adequate, but will be diffi- cult to handle and are somewhere between good enough and substandard: e) I a4 strikes me as playable, much more so than 1 h4, although I can't particularly rec- ommend it. You can generally pick conserva- tive openings in which a4 tends to be useful, or is at least not harmful. Let's see how this might go. My own sense is that King's Indian AttaclF set-ups are compatible with a4; for example, 1 a4 d5 2lL1f3 c5 3 g3 lLIc6 4 i.g2 e5 5 d3 (the equivalent of I a4 e5 2 d3 d5 3 g3 c5 4 ~g2 lLIc6 5lL1f3) is a King's Indian in which, regard- less of whether Black plays for ... f6, ... lLIf6, ... i.e7 and ... i.g4 or otherwise, White's move e4 will at some point (perhaps after lLIa3 or lLIbd2) secure the use of c4. There are any number of move-orders for both sides, of course and Black by no means has to commit to either ... c5 or ... e5 when he plays 1 ... d5, nor White to lLIf3. But I think there are clever ways for White to squeeze at least some utility out of the inclusion of a4. Versus 1...e5, White can play in similar fash- ion with a reversed Pirc Defence (2 d3, 3lL1f3, 4 g3, etc.), or even a Philidor-style formation, get- ting a playable game in which a4 can help his cause somewhat. There are more provocative ways to set up. After I a4 e5, for example, it seems to me that 2lL1f3, a reversed Alekhine De- fence, is a legitimate try; many variations of the Alekhine utilize the move ... a5, as you can verify by going through the main lines, although natu- rally Black can benefIt too (versus lines with lLIc3, for example, ... ~b4 might be useful). Don't get me wrong: I a4 is basically only a waiting move and you have little positive rea- son to play it. It allows instant equality, which White shouldn't really concede to Black on the first move. For Black, the possibility of coming to an actual disadvantage is reduced dramati- cally, almost regardless of what his first move is; in that sense, I a4 isn't really to be played except as a matter of fancy. I should also note that against I a4, 1 ... g6 is a sound and useful re- ply. That will apply to many other irregular first, second and third moves as well. I made the same point in Volume 3, when talking about irregular moves in the English Opening. f) 1 lLIa3 is defInitely ugly, but not so bad. I actually played many games with it as a 2100+ player. Against l...e5, I liked to try 2 lLIf3!?, when 2 ... i.xa3 3 bxa3 is a double-edged deci- sion, since White gains the bishop-pair and b- fIle and, as noted elsewhere, doubled a-pawns tend not to be much of a problem until the end- game. Moreover, the move lLIa3 sometimes proves useful in the reversed Alekhine Defence positions after 2 ... e4 3 lLId4, because the move c4 can justify some otherwise marginal forma- tions. Versus 1 ... d5, White can pI ay 2lL1f3 (2 c4 is safe but less flexible); for example, 2 ... c5 3 c4 or 2 ... lLIf6 3 b3 (or 3 c4). IlLIa3 c5 2 e4 is a Zviagintsev Sicilian, which turns out to be per- fectly respectable; White can also play 2 lLIf3 . Finally, as always, 1 ... g6 is quite satisfactory. The rationale given by some books for IlLIa3 is that the knight will be re-routed to c2 after White plays c3; that is rather sad-looking, however. A more interesting course for White against 1 ... g6 is to set up with e4, d4 and c3 and await the chance for a profItable lLIc4. I won't go into more details about this eccentric knight devel- opment, but you can probably put together enough ideas to elevate it to the 'good enough' category. Finally, we have some moves that I'll assess as simply 'bad': g) The unpalatable 1 lLIh3 simply puts the knight on a bad square from which it will soon have to move again. In contrast to IlLIa3, White cannot normally permit his h-pawns to be dou- bled after ... i.xh3. If he prevents that with g3, the knight is still subject to attack by ... h5-h4 or the queen and bishop along the h3-c8 diagonal. Normally one might be able to use this knight productively to support the move f4, but here that will dangerously weaken White's kingside. It's hard to argue with 1...e5 as a response, but

1...d5 2 g3 e5 is the obvious course, when 3

IRREGULAR OPENINGS AND INITIAL MOVES 271

.itg2lZ'lc64 O-O? h5! is not what White wants! Another logical set-up is 3 ... lZ'lf6 4 d3 c6. h) I h4 is described above. It has no redeem- ing value that I've found. i) I h3, Basman's Opening, moves a rook's pawn for no reason, except perhaps to play 2 g4, with a transposition to I g4 below. True, I h3 doesn't create as serious a weakness as I h4. On the kingside, however, every situation tends to be more delicate; after I a3, for example, an early c4 is often desirable. After I h3, by con- trast, White would court disaster by playing the mirror-image move f4. A more serious problem for White is that I h3 wastes a tempo and essen- tially hands the advantage of the first move to Black. That's because, unlike most slow first moves by White, it doesn't go with or support many (if any) logical piece deployments. That is, if Black plays l...d5 or l...e5, it's unlikely that White will be able to arrive at a position in which h3 is useful without making concessions elsewhere. j) I f3 is sometimes used to set up strange formations with, for example, 'it>f2, g3 and e3, and sometimes White plays g3 and lZ'lh3-f2. Unfortunately, I f3 does more than forfeit the advantages of the first move. It hurts White's future chances for occupying the centre with pawns (for example, e4 exposes White along the a7-g1 diagonal), and it is highly inflexible (weakening the king's protection and taking a good square from White's king's knight). Grob: 1 g4 I g4 (D) This is called Grob's Attack, or 'The Spike'. It has a serious following, and has stimulated considerable analysis in articles, chapters of books, and even small books by strong players. Indeed, calling I g4 'bad' is bound to offend some fans of the opening. But at best, with proper play for both sides, White squanders any . chance at a first-move advantage, and usually finds himself the one who has to find the more difficult moves in order to reach equality. That in itself is at least a substandard situation. But I'd go further and say that White can't even equalize against best play. It would be interest- ing to see if most grandmasters agree with that,

or merely find it difficult and impractical to play. At any rate, because of the cultish status of I g4, here's a serious look at some of the most critical lines. I g4 8a5man - Kudrin Manchester 1981 White has the same basic goals as in the Sokolsky/Polish with I b4. He will fianchetto quickly and at the same time grab some king- side territory; this is obviously more ambitious than I g3. It also has terrible drawbacks: by not covering h4 and encouraging a timely ... h5, White reduces his chance of castling kingside. If he plays for e4, as he might in the King's In- dian Attack (which includes g3), he creates an- other hole on f4. In addition, the move g5 is often forced and can expose his position fur- ther. By contrast, in the Sokolsky, the move b5 can serve to cramp Black's game.

I'm going to concentrate upon this reply for the same reasons as I focused on 1.. .e5 versus I b4: it is the most popular move, directly at- tacks g4, and can be played with the hope of a forced advantage for Black. Of course, Black can go for the same goal with the naturall ... e5. I won't go into the details, but one very attrac- tive approach for him after 2 .itg2 (2 d3, per- haps best, is usually answered by 2 ... d5, but 2 h3?! h5! is already awkward for White) is 2 ... h5! 3 gxh5 (3 d4 hxg4 4 dxe5lZ'lc6 has fared no better) 3 .. :i*'g5. Then 4 .itf3 'iVh4! 5lZ'lc3 (5 d3) 5 ... lZ'lf6 is already in Black's favour, and 6 e4? (6 d3 c6) 6 ... .itc5 7 d4!? .itxd4 8 'iVe2

.ll.xc3+ 9 bxc3 tbxhS made things worse in Skembris-Mariotti, Budva 1981. w 21Lg2 This is the traditional move, introducing a sort of gambit in which White hopes to put pressure on Black's d-pawn via c4; he usually regains the pawn soon. If this fianchetto, con- sistent with the purported aggressiveness of 1 g4, doesn't work, that's a very bad sign for the Grob. The passive alternative 2 h3 will transpose into our main game if Black chooses 2 ... eS 3 .ll.g2 c6. He can also play 3 ... tbc6, which has a good record. Then Basman-Miles, Manchester 1981 tested the consistent move 4 c4!?, but Black gained the advantage after 4 ... dxc4 S ~a4 tbe7 6 tbf3!? (6 'ii'xc4 .ll.e6 is very awk- ward; for example, 7 'YWa4 'ii'd4! 8 'iVdl 'YWd7 9 tbc3 hS 10 gS O-O-O) 6 ... tbg6 7 tbc31Le6 8 h4?! (but White is already a pawn down with the in- ferior position) and here, instead of Miles's (perfectly good) move 8 ... .ll.b4, 8 ... tbf4! 91Ln 'iYd7 would be extremely strong. Perhaps White should resign himself to the passive 4 d3, but then it's difficult to justify 1 g4 with its atten- dant weaknesses. 2 ..• c6 Black simply blocks the long diagonal and maintains the threat of ... 1Lxg4; White will find it hard to justify the move g4 in the result- ing structures. Nevertheless, in my opinion, 2 ... .ll.xg4! provides a good reason for con- demning White's move-order. There follows 3 c4 c6 (D) (3 ... d4!? is called the Romford Gam- bit; given the excellent alternatives, this spec- ulative exchange sacrifice isn't recommended, but leads to a fun position following 4 .ll.xb7 tbd7 S .ll.xa8 ~xa8, when White must go in for

6 f3 eS, since after 6 tbf3?? d3 he loses a piece!;

alternatively, 4 ~3 tbd7 S "i!Vxb7 .:tb8 6 "i!Vxa7 eS gives Black plenty of compensation). w White is a pawn down and his options are not enviable: a) 4 'YWb3 has several good replies: al) 4 ... ~b6 S cxdS ~xb3 6 axb3 cxdS 7 .ll.xdS tbc6 is more comfortable for Black, al- though White can almost equalize by 8 .ll.xc6+ bxc6; for example, 9 .:ta6 .ll.c8 10 .:ta4 eS and in place of 11 tba3.ll.e6 12 tbc4 e4!, as in O.Vovk- Kernazhitsky, Kiev 2000, White should accept the mild discomfort that follows 11 tbf3 f6 12 d3 tbe7. a2) 4 ... e6! is a more advantageous approach: S h3 (or S ~xb7 tbd7 6 cxdS cxdS) S. .. .ll.hS 6 ~xb7 tbd7 (D). w Now 7 'iVxc6?! is well met by 7 ... .l:.c8 8 ~a6 l:!.xc4 9 tbc3 'iYc7.

Com- pare the position after 4 cxd5 cxd5 5 ~b3 lbf6 6lbc3 e6 7 'ifxb7 below; the insertion ofh3 and ... i..h5 doesn't matter. b) 4 cxd5 and now: bl) 4 ... lbf6! is a promising option, when Kosten gives 5 'ifb3 'ifd7 (for 5 ... cxd5, see 'b2') 6 lbc3 cxd5 7 lbxd5 lbc6 "with free de- velopment"; after 8 lbxf6+ exf6 9 lbf3, either 9 ... i..c5 or 9 ... O-O-O 10 O-O i..d6 with the idea ... l:!he8 might follow, which looks rather de- pressing for White. 8 lbe3 can be answered in various ways, such as 8 ... i..e6 9 'iVa4 g6 10 lbf3 i..g7 11 0-00-0 12 d3l:.ac8. b2) 4 ... cxd5 5 'ifb3 (5 lbc3 lbf6 6 'ilVb3 transposes to line 'b22') 5 ... lbf6 (D) and now: w b21) 6 'iVxb7 and now 6 ... lbbd7 is fine, but simply 6 .. :Yi'c8 7 'iVxc8+ i..xc8 gives Black slightly more central control. In addition, his half-open b-file is more important than White's g-file; for example, 8lbc3 e6 9 d3lbc6 10 lbf3 l:!b8, etc. b22) 6 lbc3 e6 (6 ... lbc6!? has the ideas 7 'iVxb7l:.c8! or 7lbxd5 'ifd7, transposing to line 'bl'; 6 ... 'iVd7 is an immediate transposition to that same line) 7 'ifxb7 lbbd7 8 lbb5 l:.c8, Polliotto-Figeac, Montpellier 1998. Black has a lead in development, and if White grabs a pawn by 9 'ifxa7 (9lbxa7? l:.b8 10 'ifa6l:.b6 11 'ifa4 'iVa8!), that lead expands; for example, 9 ... i..c5 10 ~a4 O-O 11 d4 i..e7 12 i..d2 lbb6 13 ~3 lbc4 with great pressure. I suspect that 2 ... i..xg4! constitutes a virtual refutation of 1 g4 d5 2 i..g2. It doesn't bode well for White that Black has so many options which appear to give him the advantage. The game's 2 ... c6 (D) remains relevant, how- ever, since it can transpose to 2 h3 e5 3 i..g2 c6, and in any case it produces standard pawn- structures whose understanding is relevant to several mainstream openings. w 3h3 Surprisingly, White is at a loss for realistic alternatives: a) 3 c4? loses a pawn to 3 ... dxc4. b) Sometimes 3 e4? is suggested, but the re- ply 3. .. lbf6! is already very good for Black: 4 exd5 (4 e5 lbxg4 5 d4 g6) 4 ... i..xg4 5 dxc6 lbxc6 and he dominates the centre, in addition to having better development and a superior pawn-structure. c) 3 g5?! is awfully loosening, and one good answer is 3 ... h6! 4 h4 hxg5 5 hxg5 .l::i.xhl 6 i..xh 1 'ifc7, which threatens ... ~h2 and intends 7 lbf3 e5 with ... e4 in store. Of course, Black can also play 3 ... e5. 3•.• e5 (D) As if this position weren't difficult enough for White, he also has to be ready for 3 ... h5!? 4 g5 e5, when 5 d4 is probably best, as in the main line. 4d4 This provocative move tries to justify g4 by luring Black's pawns forward. 4 d3 doesn't challenge the centre and compels White to at- tend to his kingside weaknesses; for example,

274 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

w 4 ... tbe7 (contemplating ... tbg6-h4; 4 ... hS is also good when, in order to avoid split pawns, S gS is probably best, but the resulting position after S. .. i.d6 or S. .. i.e6 can't be attractive) S tbf3 tbg6 6 tbc3 hS 7 gxhS (7 gS lets Black play ... i.e6 without worrying about tbgS) 7 ... tbh4 8 tbxh4 ~xh4 9 e4 d4 10 tbe2 'iVxhS with the better pawn-structure. 4 ... e4 This is played most often, although with White's weaknesses, it should come as no sur- prise that more restrained moves also do well. For example, 4 ... exd4!? S ~xd4 tbd7 has an ex- cellent practical score. 4 ... tbd7 is also convincing: S c4!? (White gambits a pawn; otherwise, how does he gain any activity for his pieces? S dxeS tbxeS leaves him with a serious disadvantage in the centre) S. .. dxc4 (D). w 6 tbc3 (after 6 dxeS Kosten gives 6 .. :~WaS+! 7 tbc3 tbxeS) 6 ... i.d6 (or 6 .. :iVb6!) 7 tbf3 and now 7 ... tbe7 8 tbe4 gave Black an edge in Basman-Strauss, British Ch, Brighton 1984, but 7 ... hS! is even better; for example, 8 gS tbe7 9 tbe4 i.c7 10 dxeS tbxeS 11 'ii'xd8+ ~xd8 12 i.e3 tbxf3+ 13 i.xf3 i.eS 14 O-O-O+ ~c7 with the idea ... tbfS or ... tbg6. Lines like these illustrate a general disadvantage for White that goes beyond any particular move-order. Sc4 Otherwise Black develops casually and plays on the kingside by ... fS.

... i.d6 This is the most ambitious move; neverthe- less, S. .. hS, S. .. fS, S. .. tba6 and S. .. i.b4+!? have all functioned satisfactorily. 6 tbc3 tbe7 (D) w 7 i.gS!? White's idea is to provoke ... f6 and thereby open the a2-g8 diagonal; then 'ii'b3 will have more effect. Two alternatives are particularly revealing: a) 7 gS i.e6 8 h4 tbfS! 9 i.h3 (9 e3? tbxh4! 10 ':xh4 ~xgS). Now in Basman-Keene, Man- chester 1981, Black won a fine game after 9 ... O-O 10 cxdS cxdS 11 tbxdS? (II i.xfS is better) 11...tbg3!, but more convincing is sim- ply 9 ... dxc4!, which nets a substantial advan- tage after 10 ~c2 0-011 'ii'xe4 g6! or 10 tbxe4 O-O (or here 1O ... tbxd4 11 i.xe6 fxe6 12 e3 tbfS). b) 7 ~b3 can be met in several ways (for ex- ample, 7 ... tba6).

tLla6 and Black will win back the d-pawn with much the better position. 7 ••• f6 8 .i.d2 O-O! Precisely the move that White was hoping for, since after 9 'iiVb3 he can try to use a pin on dS to amplify his pressure. Nevertheless, it turns out that Black can easily defend against any threats. 8 ... tLla6 is also acceptable; for ex- ample, 9 'iiVb3 'iiVb6! 10 cxdS 'iiVxb3 11 axb3 cxdS. 9 'iiVb3 ~h8! (D) w 10nc1 Biicker likes Black after 10 O-O-O as 11 cS .i.c7 with the idea .. .fS. The most critical line is 10 cxdS cxdS, and now: a) II e3 tLlbc6 120-O-O (walking into an at- tack, but 12 tLlge2 fS! and 12 tLlxdS? .i.e6 13 .i.xe4 .i.c7! are no fun either) 12 ... tLlaS 13 'fUc2 .i.e6 with a promising queenside attack for Black, Querataro-Golmon, CompuServe 1994. b) 11 tLlxdS .i.e6 12 .i.xe4 tLlbc6! 13 tLlf3 (13 'iiVxb7? nb8 14 ~a6 .i.xdS!

(D) 12 ... tLlg6!, threatening ... tLlh4, is both better and strong. w 13 tLlxe4 tLlxa2 14 tLlxd6?! An interesting try, but White will come up short of compensation for the exchange. 14 'iVxa2 fxe4 IS O-O is unclear. 14• •• tLlxc115 tLlxc1 'fUxd6 16 .i.b4 At this point, instead of 16 ... 'fUc7 17 cxdS cxdS, when 18 'iVc3! followed by tLld3-f4 would initiate some counterp1ay on the dark squares, Black had the clearer 16 ... ~f6!, forcing 17 i..xe7 'Wixe7, which neutralizes White's initia- tive and produces a clear advantage. Even if you're satisfied with the game's main line, which is hardly likely, Black's many early alternatives should prove discouraging. As far as I can tell, 1 g4 is competitive with 1 h4 for the honour of being White's worst first move . Against an informed or skilled opponent, it is simply masochistic. Universal First Moves for Black Since the quality of Black's first move depends upon White's, we shall have to talk about indi- vidual cases. But some first moves have a 'uni- versal' character, in that they can be played against any first move by White. For example,

1...g6, while thought of as eccentric and/or in-

ferior in the past, is now an approved way to an- swer 1 e4, 1 d4 and 1 c4 (see Chapter 3). The acceptance of 1...b6 has taken longer, and it is

276 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

still viewed askance in some quarters, although that mainly applies to the I e4 b6 lines (see Chapter 4). Probably l...b6 can be given the as- sessment of 'good enough', but it's a bit more marginal than 1.. .g6. 1\vo other irregular opening moves, 1.. .d6 and l...ttJc6, can be played as universal systems. They aren't seen a great deal at top levels, but are effective enough to have grandmaster adherents. In part, that's because Black can pick and choose against which of White's first moves to play in- dependently, and against which to transpose into conventional openings. I should mention that playing these systems will repeatedly expose you to ideas and manoeuvres that crop up in mainstream openings, and of course mainstream opening ideas inform the use of all four universal systems that I've mentioned. Black Plays 1 ... d6

1. .. d6 has long been used as a transpositional

device but has grown into an independent weapon against 1 d4. Recently, strong players have used l...d6 with increasing frequency and promoted it in books and DVDs. Let me outline some possibilities: 1 d4 a) 1 e4 d6 is the Pirc Defence, a mainstream opening. Some players like to use the Pirc move-order to get to Philidor Defence-related systems, via 1 e4 d6 2 d4 ttJf6 3 ttJc3 e5, when 4 dxe5 dxe5 5 'iYxdS+ <;2;>xdS has thus far proven of little value for White, with 6 .tc4 adequately answered by 6 ... <;2;>eS or 6 ... .te6. b) 1 c4 d6 can lead to any number of varia- tions from Volume 3. In whatever order White plays ttJc3, g3 and/or ttJf3, Black can enter ei- ther a Reversed Closed Sicilian with ... e5 or a Symmetrical English with ... c5. He can also playa King's Indian set-up with ... ttJf6, ... g6 and ... .tg7. 1.. .d6 provides a particular type of flexibility in ... e5 systems; that is, if he is not committed to ... ttJf6, he can still play .. .f5. See, for example, the Volume 3 discussion of 1 c4 e5 2 ttJc3 d6 with 3 ttJf3 f5 and 3 g3 f5. c) 1 ttJf3 d6 is likewise very flexible and will often transpose to an English Opening af- ter White's c4. If White plays for a King's In- dian Attack by 2 g3, Black can play, among other set-ups, ... e5 & ... f5, ... c5 & ... e5, "'ttJf6 & ... g6, or simply ... g6 & ... Ji..g7 with Modem Defence themes. Finally, 2 d4 Ji..g4 transposes to 1 d4 d6 2 ttJf3 Ji..g4. w

1. .. d6 (D)

2 ttJf3 Or: a) 2 g3 e5 3 dxe5 (3 .tg2 f5) 3 ... dxe5 4 'iYxdS+ <;2;>xdS is regarded as perfectly safe for Black. A bishop on g2 can be opposed by ... c6. b) 2 c4 e5 (some players prefer 2 ... ttJf6 3 ttJc3 e5; 2 ... g6 will usually transpose into a Modem Defence or King's Indian Defence af- ter 3 e4 or 3 ttJc3) 3 ttJf3 (again, 3 dxe5 dxe5 4 'iUxdS+ <;2;>xdS is considered equal; 3 ttJc3 is a transposition to the English Opening - see Vol- ume 3 under the move-order 1 c4 e5 2 ttJc3 d6 3 d4) 3 ... e4 (there are options like 3"'ttJd7, but this is the most attractive move) 4 ttJg5 f5 5 ttJc3. This is covered in Volume 3 via the move- order 1 c4 e5 2 ttJc3 d6 3 ttJf3 f5 4 d4 e4 5 ttJg5. According to theory, Black stands reasonably well. 2 ... Ji..g4 Black announces his willingness to part with the bishop-pair in the interest of central control. Alexander Finkel has championed 2 ... g6 3 c4 Ji..g7 4 ttJc3 .tg4 5 e3 c5, with pressure down the al-hS diagonal, including ideas of ... cxd4 and ... ttJh6-f5. Perhaps that's objectively the best non-transpositional system, and it's also a good practical choice because Black's strategy is easy to implement.

3 c4 (D)

3"'ttJd7 Black is preparing to defend his queens ide against 'iYb3. Furthermore, once he gives up his

IRREGUlAR OPENINGS AND INITIAL MOVES 277

g4-bishop, Black wants to be assured of getting ... e5 or ... c5 in. The alternative 3 ... ~xf3 looks premature, but is playable; for example, 4 gxf3 (4 exf3 g6 5 lbc3 ~g7 6 ~e3 lbf6 7 ~e2 c6 has been played in many grandmaster games; Black counts upon White's relatively immobile pawn-structure to compensate for the bishop- pair) 4 ... g6 (or 4 ... c6, having in mind ... e6 and ... d5 in some cases) 5lbc3 ~g7 6 f4!? lbc6 and White has usually chosen 7 e3, but there is also 7 d5. Probably White has the better prospects in all of these ... ~xf3 lines, but the positions are unbalanced and reward good play. 4lbc3 Upon 4 g3 ~xf3 5 exf3, one route is 5 ... g6 (or 5 ... e6 6lbc3lbgf6) 6 ~g2 ~g7 7 O-O lbh6 with the idea ... lbf5. Compare what follows, where Black's bishop is more passively placed on e7. White can prevent doubled pawns by 4 'i¥b3 (protecting f3 while attacking b7); then 4 ... l:i.b8 5 h3 ~xf3 6 1i'xf3 g6 and ... ~g7 again gives Black active play. His usual plan is ... c5, trying to extend the range of his dark-squared bishop. 4 ... e5 (D) Some grandmasters play 4 ... ~xf3 here. Ver- sus either recapture, 5 ... g6 and 6 ... ~g7 is a good way to contest the central dark squares. White will generally control more space, how- ever, and can claim a small advantage in most lines. 5 g3 White agrees to take on doubled pawns in re- turn for the bishop-pair and easy development.

5 e3 lbgf6 6 ~e2 is less ambitious, although it

can lead to complex strategic struggles. Black's most popular method of play is then 6 ... ~e7 7 w O-O O-O; for example, 8 b3 !1e8 9 .Bb2 .ifS (or 9 ... c6; in either case, Black would like to play ... e4 and possibly ... d5) and now: a) White can play h3 at several junctures, when Black has to consider whether ... ~h5 is worth it, allowing White to play g4 and after ... ~g6, lbh4 to win the bishop-pair at the cost of kingside weaknesses. After 10 h3 in this po- sition, most players will prefer 1O ... ~xf3 11 .Bxf3 and now 11...c6 or 11...e4 12 ~e2 c6, with well-placed pieces and the prospects of territorial gain to offset his opponent's bishops. b) 10 "iVc2 c6 11 dxe5 dxe5 12 l:i.adl 'fic7 with equal prospects, Pfleger-Lobron, Bundes- liga 1993/4. 5 ... ~xf3 6 exf3 exd4?! Here Black has a variety of moves such as 6 ... lbgf6, 6 ... lbe7 and 6 ... g6; in general, White should have a very modest edge, but with plenty of ideas for both sides. Although the text-move has been played in many games, Black gives up the centre and comes up short of space. 7 'ii'xd4lbgf6 8 ~g2 ~e7 9 O-O O-O Now White undoubtedly has some advan- tage with 10 f4 or 10 b3l:i.e8 11 ~b2, because his bishop-pair outweighs other factors. Be- cause of this, Black might want to look into his 6th-move alternatives. Earlier, I would recom- mend the plan with 2 ... g6 as a good way to ob- tain a solid position with a clear-cut strategy. Black Plays 1. .. 4:Jc6 The fact that l...lbc6 is playable is perhaps sur- prising, in that the reversed move 1 lbc3 leads to so many delicate positions. This suggests that for Black to play 1. .. lbc6, he has to proceed

278 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

more conservatively than White usually does when he embarks upon 1 ttJc3. Let's see a game with notes which outline the possibilities. 1 e4 Campora - Wockenfuss Amsterdam 1985

1 d4 ttJc6!? is daring, and usually consid-

ered slightly inferior because of 2 dS. In view of that, Wisnewski, who champions 1...ttJc6 against other moves, prefers to play 1 ... dS and then ... ttJc6 next, regardless of White's second move. That is somewhat less than a 'universal' system, but it's in a similar spirit. Anyway, let's look at I d4 ttJc6: a) 2 e4 transposes to our main line I e4 ttJc6 2d4. b) 2 ttJf3 can be met by 2 ... dS, with a type of Chigorin Defence, and it can transpose to that defence upon 3 c4. Most books on that opening cover moves such as 3 i..f4 and 3 g3. Instead, 2 ... d6 3 e4 is mentioned below, via the move- order I e4 ttJc6 2 ttJf3 d6 3 d4. c) 2 dS ttJeS (D). w Black is playing a mirror-image Alekhine Defence. As in that opening, he hopes to lure White's pawns forward and then decimate his centre. Most of what follows depends more upon specifics than principles, but a general difference consists in Black's ability to play ... cS in many Alekhine lines, whereas in the variation before us, ... fS could only be played at some risk to Black's king and kingside. Having said that, Black has the resources to make a real game out of it: c1) 3 f4 is a reasonable move, and after 3 ... ttJg6, Black's knight is immobilized and lacks immediate prospects. Still, the move f4 is itself weakening, and White has to be careful about overextending his centre. After the natu- ral 4 e4, Black has 4 ... eS!, preparing ... i..cs, when White must avoid S fS? (simply a mis- take) S ... 'i!Vh4+ 6 'iitd2 ttJf6! (this is better than 6 ... 'i!Vxe47 fxg6 'i!VxdS+ 8 'iitel 'i!Vxdl + 9 'iitxdl hxg6, as given in some sources, which may be only slightly in Black's favour) 7 'i!Vf3 (the knight on g6 can't be taken due to 7 ... ttJxe4+, but there's also no good way to defend the e- pawn; for example, 7 ttJc3 i..b4 or 7 i..d3 ttJxe4+ 8 i..xe4 'i!Vxe4 9 fxg6 'i!Vxg2+ 10 ttJe2 'i!VxdS+ and Black ends up with four pawns and a strong attack for the piece) 7 ... ttJxe4+ 8 'iite2 ttJf4+ (8 ... ttJf6 9 fxg6 hxg6, with an ongoing at- tack, is also promising) 9 i..xf4 'i!Vxf4 10 'i!Vxf4 exf4 11 'iitf3 ttJf6 and Black is clearly better; for example, 12 c4?! d6 13 'iitxf4? gS+! 14 fxg6 i..h6+ IS 'iitf3 fxg6 and ... O-O, which is simply awful for White. Instead, S dxe6! is best, when S. .. fxe6 6 h4!? might be better than it looks, with the initial point 6 ... ttJxh4? 7 'i!Vg4! ttJg6 8 Itxh7. Another line is 6 ... i..cS!? 7 hS ttJ6e7 8 h6 g6 9 ttJf3 dS 10 ttJc3, intending 1O ... ttJf6 11 ttJgS!. There is a lot to explore here. c2) 3 e4 (D) is White's most common and natural move:

3 ... e6!? (presumably 3 ... c6 is playable, with the idea that the natural response 4 ttJc3 blocks a later c4; then 4 ... d6 S ttJf3 ttJxf3+ 6 'iVxf3 ttJf6 with the idea of ... g6, either before or after ... cxdS, looks fairly normal; for some reason, 3 ... c6 is represented by only one game in my

(this simple solution is a prob- lem for Black; if White continues in a type of reversed Alekhine Four Pawns Attack by 4 f4 lbg65 c4, then either 5 ... i.c5 or 5 ... lbf6 is sat- isfactory - the latter is a variation from the Knight's Tango, which goes 1 d4 lbf6 2 c4 lbc6, and is one of the most respectable irregu- lar openings) and now we have: c2l) 4 .. .fxe6 5 lbc3! waits for Black to com- mit: 5 ... b6!?

(after 6 lbf3, 6 ... lbf7!? 7 i.f4 i.c5 8 i.e2 lbe7 doesn't look too bad; instead 6 ... lbxf3+ 7 'iVxf3 i.b7 was cleverly answered by 8 ~h5+! g6 9 iKe5 lbf6 10 i.b5!, threatening 'ii'xe6+, in Volkov-B.Savchenko, Moscow 2006; 6 i.f4 lbg6 7 i.g3 should also give White an edge) 6 ... lbf7 (6 ... lbg6) 7 lbf3, and Black's develop- ment is awkward; he might try 7 ... i.c5!? 8 lba4 i.e7 9 i.d3 i.b7 10 O-O a6 with the idea ... b5 and ... lbf6. c22) 4 ... dxe6 5 'iVxd8+ 'it>xd8 and now 6 f4!? lbg6 may slightly favour White, but is a bit loose; instead, 6 i.f4 seems to yield an edge: 6 ... lbg6 (6 ... i.d6!? 7 i.g3 'it>e7 may be better) 7 i.e3 lbf6 8 lbc3?! (8 f3! with a modest cen- tral advantage) 8 ... lbg4, and Black equalizes after 9 .i:td 1+ i.d7 10 i.c 1 i.c5 11 lbh3 'it>e 7 12 i.e2 lbf6. w Let's return to the game:

1. .. lbc6 (D)

This is the long-debated Nimzowitsch De- fence, one of the best of the irregular openings versus 1 e4. Black will usually attack the centre by ... d5 or ... e5, but he hasn't committed yet. Again, over the years, several books and many theoretical articles have been produced about

1...lbc6, mainly by the move's advocates, but it

still isn't used at the elite level. I'll outline se- lected variations, trying to concentrate upon critical lines. 2d4 2 lbf3 is the main alternative, and a popular way to side-step Black's speciality lines. Then Black can switch to a main-line double e-pawn opening by 2 ... e5, or enter a somewhat shaky form of the Scandinavian Defence by 2 ... d5 3 exd5 ~xd5 (the development of the knight to c6 is usually deferred or skipped altogether). Another reasonable line that has been played by numerous grandmasters is 2 ... d6 3 d4 lbf6 4 lbc3 i.g4, with the main line going 5 i.e3 e6 6 h3 .Bh5; it is theoretically somewhat in White's favour. Even the absurd-looking con- tinuation 2 ... f5!? has had serious analysis de- voted to it. But the most intriguing independent reply to 2 lbf3 is 2 ... lbf6, when after 3 lbc3, 3 ... e5 is a Four Knights Game, interesting but not usually feared by Black. Or Black can enter less charted waters with 3 ... d5; for example, 4 e5 can be an- swered by 4 ... d4!? or by 4 ... lbd7 5 d4 lbb6, af- ter which Black's bishop will get to g4 or f5 with approximate equality. So the main line after 2 lbf3 lbf6 is 3 e5! lbg4 (3 ... lbd5 will transpose to a line of the Alekhine Defence that is considered a little risky, but is nevertheless quite respectable; note that Black's move-order has avoided the Four Pawns Attack of that opening) 4 d4 d6 5 h3 lbh6 (D). w

280 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

Black has a pretty ugly position that neverthe- less has some merits. His decentralized knight is an undoubted disadvantage, but he has prospects of chipping away at White's centre, after which that piece might be reintroduced by ... tLlf5. Of course, White can hardly complain about his prospects, but he shouldn't expect too much from the capture .i.xh6, which gives up the bishop-pair. 5 ... tLlh6 introduces a wide range of eccentric possibilities that are typical of irregu- lar openings; for example: a) 6 e6!? fxe6 7 .i.xh6 gxh6 8 tLlh4?! (8 .i.c4 .i.g7 9 0-00-0 is comfortably equal; Wisnewski gives the cute line 10 ':'el ~h8 11 .i.xe6? .i.xe6 12 ':'xe6 ':'xf3 13 gxf3 .i.xd4!, threatening both ... 'ikg8+ and ... .i.xb2) 8 ... 'ikd7! 9 'ikh5+ ~d8 10 c3 'ike8 11 .i.e2 and now 1l....i.g7 was fine in Trias-JRamirez, Catania 1990, but 11.. :~xh5 12 .i.xh5 e5 would definitely favour Black. b) 6 exd6 iVxd6 7 tLlc3 a6 looks strangely similar to a Scandinavian Defence with 3 ... 'ikd6. c) 6.i.b5 a6 7 .i.xc6+ bxc6 8 O-O g6 is 0 K. d) 6 tLlc3 (D).

Now 6 ... a6!? intends 7 exd61lVxd6 8 d5 tLle5. This favours White somewhat, but seems better than Narciso Dublan's 6 ... dxe5?! 7 d5 tLld4 8 tLlxe5 tLlhf5, when many moves have been tried and analysed, but not the simple 9 .i.e3!. e) 6 .i.xh6 gxh6 7 .i.b5 a6 8 .i.xc6+ bxc6 9 'ike2 l:tg8!, Sprenger-Keilhack, COIT. 1996. Now if 10 g3 llb8 11 b3, Wisnewski recommends ll...iVd7 12 tLlc3 c5, although 13 O-O-O or 13 d5 looks better than his 13 dxc5 dxe5 14.l::!.dl ~c6. In general, White seems to keep the advan- tage in the lines after 5 ... tLlh6, but Black's posi- tion is within playable boundaries. 2•.• d5 2 ... e5 3 d5 (3 dxe5 tLlxe5 is another story; without going into the details, it seems that 4 tLlf3, 4 tLlc3 and 4 .i.f4 all achieve a modest ad- vantage, which is perhaps enough to discourage Black from 2 ... e5; on the other hand, my data- base shows over 1000 games after 3 ... tLlxe5, so not everyone feels this way) 3 ... tLlce7 (D). w This is the reverse of 1 tLlc3 d5 2 e4 d4 3 tLlce2 e5, as discussed earlier. As in that line, Black's goal is to play ... tLlf6, ... tLlg6, and bring his bishop to c5 or b4. Now White has many possible moves, of which I'll note just a few: a) In keeping with the reversed variation, 4 f3 has the idea 4 ... tLlg6 5 .i.e3 ! (compare 1 tLlc3 d5 2 e4 d4 3 tLlce2 e5 4 tLlg3 .i.e6!). But since White's queen is cut off from h5, Black might try 4 .. .f5!?, to which White could reply 5 .i.g5!? h6 6 .i.e3 or 5 tLlc3 tLlf6 6 .i.g5. For any plan in which Black plays ... g6 and ... .i.g7, White can claim the normal advantage that he gets in the Samisch Variation of the King's Indian follow- ing c4, tLlc3, .i.e3, f3, 'ilVd2 and O-O-O, because Black's knight really doesn't belong on e7 in that case. Also, h4-h5 might gain in force. b) With the above in mind, it seems to me that 4 .i.d3 also deserves a closer look, with the same ideas. c) Another interesting idea is 4 h4, with the idea of advancing the h-pawn in the case of ei- ther ... tLlg6 or ... g6. d) The usual version of the h-pawn advance has gone 4 tLlf3 tLlg6 5 h4, when A.lvanov- Benjamin, USA Ch, Parsippany 1996 contin- ued 5 ... h5 6 .i.g5 tLlf6 7 tLlc3!? (7 .i.d3 .i.c5 8 tLlbd2) 7 ... .i.c5 (Ivanov analyses 7 ... .i.b4 8

(8 'iVd2 O-O 9 O-O-O is better) 8 ... ..Bb4+! 9 c3 ..Be7 10 ..Bxf6 ..Bxf6 with ap- proximate equality, or perhaps a very slight edge to White because of his superiority in space after 11 g3. 3 tL'lc3 White attacks the centre directly, but this isn't his only move: a) 3 eS (D) bears some resemblance to the French and Caro-Kann Advance Variations.

It's true that Black's knight on c6 prevents him from attacking the d4-pawn by ... cS, but in modem openings Black attacks the front on the pawn-chain (in this case, eS) as often as the 'base' (d4); after the move ... f6, that attack is assisted by his knight on c6. In terms of devel- opment, Black gets the best of both openings: in contrast to the French Defence, he can get his queen's bishop out to fS or g4, and in contrast to the Caro-Kann Defence, he can put his queen's knight on c6! White's main advantage is his firm command of territory and the cramping in- fluence of his eS-pawn. For example, in both the French and Caro-Kann, he finds it difficult to shore up his pawn-chain with f4; here it's easy. Unfortunately, he creates some light-square weaknesses by so doing. Let's see how this plays out; Black has two main moves: al) 3 ... ..ifS isn't approved by most theoreti- cians, but it is sufficient to establish a meaning- ful stake in the position. all) An entertaining example went 4 tL'le2 e6 S tL'lg3 ..Bg6 6 h4 hS (6 .. .f6 7 hS ..Bf7 8 f4 'iVd7 is probably a better approach) 7 tL'le2!? (a little outrageous; White neglects his develop- ment, but threatens tL'lf4) 7 ... ..ifS!? (the third bishop move) 8 tL'lf4 (and the fourth by this knight!) 8 ... g6 9 c3 'iVd7 10 tL'ld2 (10 b4!) 1O .. .f6! 11 exf6 eS!? 12 dxeS tL'lxeS, Roman- ishin-Mariotti, Leningrad 1977, and here 13 tL'lf3 is dynamically balanced. a12) Instead, 4 tL'lf3 can be met by 4 ... 'iVd7, 4 ... f6 or 4 ... e6. In the last case, S ..Be2 tL'lb4!? 6 tL'la3 cS 7 c3 tL'lc6 8 O-O with the idea tL'lc2-e3 is a possible continuation; compare the Short Variation of the Caro-Kann Defence. a13) White's most important move may well be the ultra-flexible 4 c3. The play can go in a great many directions at this point. 4 ... f6 S f4 tL'lh6 resembles 'a2' and 4 .. .'t,wd7 is often played with the idea of an early ... O-O-O. The obvious 4 ... e6 defines the light-squared pawn-chain with Black's bishop outside it. After S f4, Black should consider restraining White's kingside first with ... tL'lh6 or ... hS and ... tL'lh6 before un- dertaking action elsewhere. Compare line 'a2'. a2) 3 ... f6 has several possible replies. Per- haps the most significant is 4 f4 (4 ..Bd3 can be met by 4 ... tL'lxd4!? or4. .. g6; 4 ..ibS ..Bd7 has the idea S. .. tL'lxeS, familiar from the French De- fence, so S tL'lc3 fxeS 6 dxeS e6 7 tL'lf3 ..Bb4 might follow, with perhaps a slight edge for White after 8 ..Bxc6) 4 ... tL'lh6 (trying to take over light squares; fS, g4 and e4 are all poten- tially vulnerable; simply 4 ... ..ifS S tL'le2 'it'd7 6 tL'lg3 tL'lh6 is also playable) S tL'lf3 ..ifS (or S. .. ..Bg4, which White could have avoided by S c3 first; with the text-move, Black has in mind some combination of the moves ... e6, ... ..Be4, ... tL'lfS and ... fxeS) 6 c3 e6 (D). w

Black will play for ... gS by ... h6, ... ~e7 and ... l:tg8, and White has no equally productive plan; 7 ~bS doesn't achieve much after 7 ... ~d7 80-0 a6) 7 ... ~e7 8 0-00-09 tba3 ~e4! 10tbc2 ~e8! 11 tbe3 fxeSI2fxeS ~g613 ~d2l:tf714 'it>hl l:taf8 with play on the light squares and kingside pressure to counterbalance White's spatial advantage, EGomez-Castro Rojas, Med- ellin 1977. In general, 3 ... f6 seems satisfactory for Black. b) 3 exdS ~xdS (D) is equivalent to 1 e4 dS 2 exdS ~xdS 3 d4 tbc6. w Black intends to play ... eS and bring his pieces out quickly (as in the Chigorin Defence to the Queen's Gambit). Since this is critical for the fate of 2 ... dS, we need to be careful about details: 4 tbf3 (4 ~e3 eS! has scored very well for Black after S tbc3 ~b4 6 a3 ~xc3+ 7 bxc3 tbf6, the most frequently seen line, as well as after S tbf3 ~g4 and S c4 'iVaS+) and now: b 1) 4 ... eS has to be taken into account. After S tbc3 ~b4 6 ~d2 ~xc3 7 ~xc3 e4 8 tbeS tbxeS 9 dxeS, if Black tries 9 ... tbe7, then 10 'ii'e2! is probably the best try to extract some- thing from the position, and indeed, 10 ... ~e6 probably won't equalize after 11 g3! e3 12 f3, as in T.Schmid-Vitouch, Bundesliga 2008/9, while White's bishop-pair gained life after iO ... ~fS IIl:tdl ~c6 12 g4! e3 13 l:tgl exf2+ 14 'it>xf2 with the idea ~bS in Arribas-Bruzon, Havana 1997. Probably 9 ... ~e6 is more accu- rate, when 10 ~e2 can be met by 10 ... O-O-O. b2) 4 ... ~g4 (the most ambitious move) S ~e2 (S tbc3!? 'iVhS {or S. .. liaS} 6 ~e2 O-O-O is wild and unclear: 7 O-O tbf6 8 h3 tbxd4! 9 tbxd4 ~xe2 10 tbcxe2 eS or 7 dS ~xf3 8 i.xf3 ~eS+ 9 ~e3 e6 10 O-O tbf6) S. .. O-O-O (D). w We've reached a curious juncture. Now 6 tbc3 ~aS is a major line of the Scandinavian Defence, and 6 ... ~hS is also played. White has two other important moves: b21) 6 ~e3 eS (after 6 ... tbf6 7 O-O both 7 ... e6 and 7 ... ~fS have been satisfactory for Black) 7 c4 ~aS+ 8 ~d2 ~b4 9 dS ~xf3 10 ~xf3 tbd4! (even better than iO ... ~xd2+ 11 tbxd2 tbd4 12 O-O ~ 13l:tel, C.Koch-Rahde, corr. 200S, when 13 ... tbf6! is correct) 11 tbc3 ~a6 12 ~e2 tbf6 13 a3 l:the8! 14 ~d3?! e4 IS ~f1 e3! 16 fxe3 ~xc3 17 bxc3 tbfS with a win- ning game for Black, Draeger-Bellmann, corr. 1999. b22) 6 c4 ~fS (6 ... ~aS+ 7 ~d2 ~fS {not the only move} 8 ~e3 transposes to 6 ... ~fS without allowing 7 O-O, and other 8th moves have not been effective; if nothing else, 8 ~c3 ~xf3 9 ~xf3 tbxd4 transposes to the 7 ~e3 main line) and now 7 ~e3 (after 7 O-O, Black has equalized with both 7 ... tbxd4 8 tbxd4 ~xe2 9 ~xe2 l:txd4, which requires some care, and 7 ... tbf6 8 ~e3 eS; by using 6 ... ~aS+, Black by- passes the issue entirely) induces Black to com- bine by 7 ... ~xf3 8 ~xf3 tbxd4! 9 ~xd4 (9 ~g4 tbc2+ 10 ~xc2 ~xg4) 9 ... ~e6+! 10 ~e2

Now: b221) Curiously, iO ... cS hasn't been played much, but my engines approve, and White hasn't won any of the games I've found. Keilhack and Schlenker suggest 11 ~a4 cxd4 12 ~xa7, but instead of their 12 ... d3 13 tbc3, either 12 ... ~eS

or 12 ... ttJf6 13 ttJa3 ~a6 should favour Black. My guess is that this would be an easy way for Black to play the position, with the proviso that it is relatively untested. b222) 10 ... ~e4 11 O-O ~xd4 (even 11....l:txd4 12 ttJd2 ~e6 13 ~a4!, previously thought to give White good chances, only draws after the forcing 13 ... .l:txd2! 14 .l:tad1 .l:txd1 15 .l:txd1 ttJf6 16 ~xa7 ~a6 17 ~d4 ~d6 18 flia7 Wia6, etc., D.Boskovic-Savic, Vrnjacka Banja 2009) 12 ~a4 e6 13 ttJc3 .Bd6!

The line with 6 c4 ~f5 7 .Be3 has been part of White's claim to advantage after 3 exd5, but it now appears harmless for more than one rea- son. We now return to 3 ttJc3 (D): 3 ... dxe4 This is the main move, but White apparently comes away with some advantage, so Black's alternatives are noteworthy: a) 3 ... e6 transposes into a line of the French Defence, 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ttJc3 ttJc6, that has been played regularly and accumulated a great deal of theory over the last decade. I'll leave it to the reader to research the details, but its current reputation is good, and, for example,

1...ttJc6 specialist Wisnewski builds his reper-

toire around 3 ... e6. b) 3 ... e5!? (D) is a bold attempt to clear out the centre. w White's best reply seems to be 4 dxe5 (4 exd5 ttJxd4 and 4 .Bb5 dxe4 5 d5 a6 6 .Ba4 b5 7 ttJxb5 axb5 8 .Bxb5 ttJe7 are not serious threats to Black's position) 4 ... d4 and then: b1) After 5 ttJce2!?, 5 ... f6 is recommended by Keilhack and Schlenker, perhaps not so convincingly after 6 exf6 ttJxf6 7 ttJf3. In- stead, 5 ... .Bc5 could be considered, with the idea 6 c3 .Bg4 7 f3 dxc3!, which is lively, if hardly forced. Black threatens ... .Bf2+, and af- ter 8 ~xd8+?! .l:txd8 9 fxg4? ttJb4 he wins ma- terial. b2) 5 ttJd5! and now Keilhack and Schlen- ker put loads of engrossing analysis into the amazing 5 ... f5 (5 ... ttJge7 6 .Bg5 .Be6 might be objectively superior), which has been played surprisingly often (perhaps as a consequence). 6 exf6 ttJxf6 (D) and now:

Specialized Black Debuts Apart from these universal first moves, Black has other irregular first moves designed for use against specific White debuts:

1 e4 a6, usually called the St George De-

fence, was famously employed by Tony Miles to beat Karpov in Skara 1980. Were it not for the fact that Black has kept his disadvantage down to manageable proportions in practice (as indicated by White's lead of only 100 points or so in performance rating), I'd call1...a6 outright 'bad'. It is at least substandard, and very risky, as indicated by this game fragment and notes:

4 .•• ltJf6?! An important juncture. Although it has been played in many games, this move-order has grave drawbacks. 4 ... e6 would transpose after S Vie2, but White is more likely to play S O-O or, still better, S a4!, which leaves Black with noth- ing but undesirable options. S ... M may be best, but then 6 c4! is strong, among others. I think that this simple and neglected point puts 1. .. a6, already marginal, into serious doubt. S'iYe2 There are two good alternatives to commit- ting the queen: a) After S ltJbd2 e6 6 O-O, several games have continued 6 ... cS (everything else is de- pressing) 7 dxcS! i.xcS 8 eS ltJdS 9 ltJe4 (or 9 a4 first) 9 ... i.e7 10 a4 M, and 11 c4 bxc3 12 bxc3 with the idea i.a3 is good, while 11ltJfd2 with the idea ltJc4 yields a large advantage. But the most fun line is 11 i.gS f6 12 exf6ltJxf6 13 ltJeS!!, with the idea 13 ... O-O 14ltJxf6+ i.xf6 IS VihS g6 16 i.xg6 hxg6 17 'iYxg6+ 'it>h8, and after the remarkably slow 18 .:tadl! (intending .l:td3-h3#) 18 ... i.xgS 19 .l:td3 i.M 20 .l::.h3, White will mop up. b) S eS!, though seldom played, also casts 4 ... ltJf6 into doubt: S. .. ltJdS 6 a4! b4?! (but the alternatives are miserable), and now 7 c4 bxc3 8 bxc3 is certainly difficult for Black, but 7 ltJgS! is much more fun: 7 ... g6? (the cutest line after 7 ... h6? is 8ltJxf7!

14 ... gxf6? 14 ... ltJxf6! is unclear. After 14 ... gxf6?, White played the inspired IS ltJeS?! and won, but that would only have drawn if Black had defended correctly. The right move was IS 'iVe4! fS 16 ~eS with domi- nation of the dark squares. lltJf3 b5 has a decent reputation (the related I d4 bS gives White extra options; for example,

(2 ... a6 3 d4 i.b7 4 i.d3 takes us back to the St George) 3 i.xbS! i.xe4 4 O-O is a full tempo down for Black compared to the Sokolsky/Pol- ish main line 1 b4 eS 2 i.b2 i.xb4 3 i.xeS ltJf6. Even the reversed 1 b4 eS version is difficult for White to negotiate, and adding a tempo here makes Black's task much harder. 2 ... h6 is slow, and White can pick a comfort- able route to advantage via most common-sense moves; for example, 3 h4 (or 3 ltJc3 i.g7 4 h4 with the idea 4 ... cS S e3 or 4 ... g4 S e4, transpos- ing) 3 ... g4 4 e4 i.g7 SltJc3 d6 (S ... cS 6 i.e3!) 6 ltJge2 and now 6 ... ltJf6 7 i.e3 or 6 ... ltJc6 7 i.e3 eS 8 dSltJce7 9ltJg3!. A 'theoretical' line goes 3 e4 i.g7 4ltJc3 cS, and now SltJge2 is a good al- ternative to S dxcS i.xc3+ 6 bxc3 'iYaS 7 ltJe2 ltJf6 (7 .. :~xcS s 'iVd4!), when at least Black has something to play for. 3ltJc3 Or: a) 3 i.xgS cS (D) is Black's point, although if White gives the pawn back he should emerge with the advantage.

1...gS is a horrible choice versus 1 e4 (when 2 W

d4 is a tempo-up version of 1 g4) and even worse against 1 d4 (2 i.xgS !), but it makes some sense versus 1 c4, and 1 c4 g5 (D) has actually been played in over 400 games in my database. w The idea is that White can no longer defend his long al-h8 diagonal by c3, as he did with ... c6 versus I g4. Nevertheless, Black's kingside is weakened, and pawns can't move backwards. I'll settle for 'substandard' here, because the su- perior positions that White gets aren't devastat- ing ones. Here's an example: Mednis - Hodgson New York 1990

I'm afraid that L.g5 is just too much to ask of Black. Hopefully it's been both enlightening and fun to examine these irregular openings and tackle the most difficult ones. Remember that they are an authentic part of opening theory, not merely an afterthought, and should be studied in order to round out your general knowledge of the game.

9 Choosing and Preparing Openings

Every student eventually comes up against the issue of how to select and prepare openings. As it turns out, the problem never completely goes away, not even for the strongest players in the world. Teachers and writers express various opinions about how to choose openings, but they disagree firmly with each other and haven't even begun to arrive at a consensus. Some fun- damental questions arise: whether to specialize in one opening, whether to pick extremely the- matic or open-ended openings, how to match openings with your style and predilections, and how much time to devote to opening study. On a concrete level, we have questions about how to organize and record a specific repertoire, how to learn it, how to get practice with your chosen openings, how to improve your play in a certain opening, and so forth. In my opinion, some of the most common answers to these questions fall short in that they don't distinguish students by their level of strength and experience. In reviewing the liter- ature, I find that most of the books are written from the standpoint of grandmaster needs and circumstances; for their examples they use the experiences of some titled player or other and explain how they prepared their openings or solved their opening problems. Of course, what the near-beginner needs out of his chess open- ings is quite a different matter from what the average club player requires, or the casual Internet Chess Club aficionado, or the profes- sional tournament player. In what follows, I'll try to draw upon my experience as a teacher to accommodate that factor. How Important is Opening Study? We hear it again and again: players spend too much time studying the openings. Variations upon this theme abound, and the issue takes on particular significance because of the limited number of hours the average person has for chess. In lieu of so much attention to openings, would our time be better spent on, e.g., middle- games, endgames or tactics? Naturally these are all interrelated areas and, in varying de- grees, essential for improvement. Still, I think you'll find that the much-maligned emphasis on opening study isn't such a bad thing after all. In fact, it's probably no coincidence that in the real world, most experienced players from lower master level all the way up to World Champion spend/ar more of their time studying openings than all the aforementioned options put to- gether! I don't think that we can write this off as a mass delusion among players (and their coaches), or as something that is fundamentally against their best interests. For one thing, open- ing study provides a disciplined entrance into the broader area of middlegame study. It's also interesting to see what other areas of the game our top players study away from the board. After years of being around masters and professional players, I would say that review- ing, studying and writing about their own games consumes the second largest amount of time af- ter opening preparation. As far as I know, every top-level teacher recommends self-critical anal- ysis of your games, and it should be given high priority for anyone seeking to improve. But even that process includes in-depth consider- ation of the openings in those games and the typical positions arising from them. Actually, my own teaching priorities in this respect are somewhat different where the average player is concerned. Apart from openings, I think that exercise with tactical problems is the other most valuable use of study time, especially right be- fore a tournament. Incidentally, tactics can be usefully connected with openings that typically generate them, and I try to construct exercises that do that. What about other areas of the game? Let's look at some of the alternatives to investigating

290 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

openings. One is to study the middlegame. But in modern chess, as has been pointed out by many writers, the middlegame is very often subsumed within the opening. That is, when players study the opening, they are in part studying what we used to call the middlegame, and in some cases beyond that. The most useful kind of middlegame know ledge, and the easiest to retain, has to do with frequently-arising, the- matic structures. It's difficult enough to know where your pieces should go and what their fu- ture might be, the more so when you haven't seen the structure before, or something similar. This knowledge can be picked up by investiga- tion of particular openings, and enhanced by playing over exemplary games (preferably an- notated), comparing different interpretations and absorbing specific theory. Important tacti- cal devices and attacking schemes will recur, very often also applying to tactics that arise in unrelated situations. Naturally, the study of a finite set of openings can't cover the broad di- versity of possible middlegames, and it's help- ful to read books which talk about strategies in the abstract. However, middlegame theory that is too general tends to be of little use in over- the-board situations. Apart from openings and middlegames, the student is commonly advised to study the end- game, sometimes with an admonition to stay away from serious opening preparation until an unspecified 'later'. When I was beginning to play chess four decades ago, this advice was ubiquitous, accompanied by the 'fact' that all the Soviet children learned endings in depth be- fore they were allowed to play any games. That turned out to be an utter myth, but there's no doubt that learning a limited set of basic end- ings is absolutely essential for your develop- ment as a player. What's less certain is how many endings this involves, at what stage you need to learn them, and how many of them you will absorb by experience, just as you do with openings. Students to whom I assign endgame study constantly point out that they seldom get as far as the ending, at least not to one that doesn't already have a clear result; and when they do, it is usually decided by tactical means. Part of this has to do with the level of play, but grandmasters say the same thing, attributing it to the complex and often sharp openings played at their level. For the majority of us, the dearth of challenging endings may also come from the short time-controls that are now customary. Taken as a whole, I think that there's much wis- dom in most players' intuitive feeling that openings and middlegames can take priority without damaging their long-term prospects. Fortunately, the majority of ending types, apart from a set of standard and recurring elementary ones that everyone should know (and periodi- cally refresh their knowledge of), are those that you will commonly get from the openings you play. In most mainstream openings, there are characteristic endgames that arise repeatedly from the structure of that opening. If you think about your own favourite openings, you'll prob- ably recognize connections to representative endings. In fact, speciality books upon particu- lar openings will very often include an explicit discussion of the typically-occurring endings. So a serious study of complete games in your opening will go a long way towards improving your practical endgame results, as well as de- veloping your ability to think about endgames in general, which is the most important skill in the long run. Let's face it: it would be ideal to have time to study middlegames, endings and openings, along with the great games of masters; and it's also hard to argue with doing tactical exercises and problems, annotating your own games, and playing as much as possible. To the extent that you can do so, explore all of these options. In the context of this book, however, I would ar- gue that the tremendous amount of time spent upon the openings by leading players young and old reflects the importance of such study. While other types of knowledge are necessary if you are to become a complete player, opening study is the single most practical and efficient means of improving your mastery of the game as a whole. Openings Selection Before moving on to suggest methods of study and preparation, I'll make a stab at the most dif- ficult question to answer with any kind of spec- ificity: what openings should I play? Once a player decides upon an actual set of openings to

CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 291

play, however provisionally, the subsequent sections about how to study and prepare them will take on a concrete significance. Of course, there are myriad openings with countless varia- tions, and any suggestions that I make will be fundamentally arbitrary. Nevertheless, I'd like to give some concrete examples so as to make a general point: your choice of openings should be based upon your level of playing strength. With that in mind, I'll separate advice into broad sections, distinguishing choices and ob- jectives that apply to players of various strengths who wish to improve their opening preparation. Within each general section, I shall break down the material on the basis of playing level. Of course, given sufficient knowledge, a player can succeed with any conventional chess opening. Nevertheless, you can improve your play more quickly and less painfully by tailoring your openings to the development of needed skills. With that in mind, I'll talk on a broader level for the less experienced player, whereas for more advanced players, discuss mainly the prac- tical implications of opening choices. In gen- eral, I suggest learning a wide variety of posi- tion-types in order to become a stronger player. Assessing your own level and degree of so- phistication in handling opening situations is difficult. Rather than get too picky, I've divided players into four very broadly defined skill cat- egories, from the lowest, D, through to the highest, A (these are chosen to minimize confu- sion with the many other standard divisions of chess strength by letter). Naturally, these are approximations and my advice will significantly overlap between them, so your precise category isn't crucial: Category D: beginners, near-beginners and relatively inexperienced players (e.g., the latter might have three years or fewer of playing reg- ularly, and not necessarily devotedly). Category C: players with a moderate level of experience and some opening competence. This broad group might include club players, inter- mittent tournament players and consistent on- line players. People in this category probably lack sufficient free time for intensive study and play, or they may be stuck in a rut, have bad habits, etc. Category B: players of considerable strength (say, 1700 Elo and above) who already have a fairly stable repertoire and have looked into at least some of their openings in depth. But the general level of their openings is clearly below someone rated a few hundred points above them, and that is demonstrated by the inferior posi- tions they often fall into. Category A: Players above 2000 Elo up to about 2300 Elo with the typical problems that arise in finding openings that combine the am- bition for opening advantage with some degree of safety. I won't presume to give professionals, who exceed this level, advice about their open- ing choices, so this section applies to advanced amateurs who are, for example, regular tourna- ment players, rapidly-improving juniors, and/or devoted online activists. The advice and potential repertoire choices that I'll suggest next are necessarily broad, if only because they don't take into account the distinctive traits of individuals. For fine tuning, or to decide which pieces of advice given below apply, you may want to consult a chess teacher. Alternatively, a disciplined, self-aware student can make those decisions based upon an analy- sis of his own games and some study. I'd be a little careful about plunging into complicated opening variations that just happen to present themselves to you because of, for example, a recent grandmaster game or a friend's enthusi- asm. Study of any sort can only help one im- prove, of course, but this might not be the most efficient use of your time. Regardless of your category, the most basic goals will be obvious: to survive the opening without serious disadvantage; and to gain an advantage sufficient to discomfit your oppo- nent. Beyond that, always pay attention to the typical middlegames and endgames that your opening produces. Finally, remember that I am only indicating some personal thoughts on how to make prog- ress with openings. You should follow your in- stincts, especially if you find a method that works for and motivates you.

1. Choose openings corresponding to your

skill level and available study time This is fairly obvious, but some teachers will entice you into playing their own, sometimes too sophisticated, openings. It's important to

292 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

stick within your capabilities, and at the same time master traditional concepts before taking on exotic piece and pawn deployments. Let me explain this by means of specific examples. I won't build a complete repertoire for you, of course, but I'll try to indicate what would be in- volved in doing so. Category D Openings For players with very limited experience, I rec- ommend using openings in which the play can be clarified at an early stage, often with a de- gree of simplification. To accomplish this safely will take a little study, because you will have to get used to playing with open lines for both sides' pieces, but you can't eliminate risk en- tirely in the opening anyway. If that approach doesn't appeal to you, you should at least try to occupy the centre and bring your pieces out quickly, aiming them at central squares if possi- ble. I think that it's best to avoid manoeuvring games in which most of the pieces remain on the board for a long time and don't come into contact with each other. At this level, you should be studying tactics independently, and it's good practice to play openings of at least a partially tactical nature. There's nothing new about this advice. For example, teachers all over the world suggest that inexperienced players begin with 1 e4. Ad- vancing your e-pawn may be unoriginal, but it allows you to control the direction of the game to a greater degree than other first moves. You will undoubtedly see the reply 1 ... e5 most often when playing at or near a beginner's level, when I recommend using some system with an early d4 to at least partially clear out the centre and give your pieces room. In that context, the most common move 2 lbf3 is a good one. For example, if Black plays 2 ... d6, you can get practice playing with extra space by 3 d4. Black may not often answer 2 lbf3 with 2 ... lbf6 (the Petroff) at this level, but again, 3 d4 is a straight- forward answer for the inexperienced player, intending 3 ... exd4 4 e5 (and if Black plays 4 ... lbe4 or 4 ... lbd5, 5 "iYxd4) or 3 ... lbxe4 4 iLd3, to get developed quickly. Another choice is 2 lbf3 lbf6 3 lbc3, and if 3 ... lbc6 (the Four Knights Game), 4 iLb5 or 4 d4. One advantage of this latter choice is that you can also play 2 lbf3 lbc6 3 lbc3, when 3 ... lbf6 will transpose. The Four Knights is a sensible opening choice as you start out. After 2 lbf3, 2 ... lbc6 will occur in the bulk of your games. Then the Scotch Game, 3 d4 (in- tending 3 ... exd4 4 lbxd4) is a possible first opening, but I recommend taking up the classi- cal and instructive move 3 iLc4 at an early stage. Then, against 3 ... iLc5, it's thematic to try to establish the ideal centre by 4 c3 and 5 d4; af- ter that, things can get complicated enough that you need to take a look at some theory and learn the basics; for example, you could use Chapter 5 of Volume 1 (or any standard source). Versus

3. .. lbf6, you might pick 4 d3 as a solid begin-

ning point, and be sure to get castled and bring your pieces out quickly. Both 4 d4 and 4 lbg5 are more adventurous, but they absolutely re- quire serious hours of study, as you will see by glancing at Volume 1, Chapter 6. The Sicilian Defence, 1 e4 c5, is the most popular grandmaster opening, but when lower players use it, they usually do so with some memorized systems in mind. I recommend play- ing simple, principled moves against it; for ex- ample, 2 c3 makes sense, intending to capture the centre with 3 d4, which is what you should do versus most slow moves anyway. A typical line is 2 ... lbf6 3 e5 lbd5 4 d4, when after 4 ... cxd4, 5 "iYxd4 is a handy first system with open lines and quick development. You can fol- low with lbf3, iLd3/c4 and O-O, moving your queen to e4 if attacked by ... lbc6. If Black plays 2 ... d5 in response to 2 c3, then 3 exd5 ~xd5 4 d4 will also open up lines; generally lbf3, .te2 and O-O follow, with iLe3 if necessary. A slightly more advanced possibility against the Sicilian Defence would be to clear out the centre with the Morra Gambit: 2 d4 cxd4 3 c3 dxc3 4 lbxc3, as described in Chapter 5 of this volume; begin- ners should delay taking this up, however, as it's important to learn the value of material be- fore experimenting with openings that sacrifice it for other gains. Against the French Defence and Caro-Kann Defence, the easiest way to stick to the open- lines policy is to avoid e5 and develop quickly. In the French, for example, a possibility is 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 exd5 4 iLd3, followed by lbf3 (or lbe2) and O-O. Or you can do something similar starting with 3 lbc3, playing 3 ... iLb4 4

CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 293

exd5 or 3 ... ttJf6 4 exd5 (in the latter case, expe- rienced players may wince at allowing theoreti- cal equality so early on, but at a lower level such moves can be recommended as both sound and instructive). Versus the Caro-Kann, the exchanging pol- icy of 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 iLd3, again intending ttJf3 and O-O, is a good starting point, with the same philosophy that we applied to the French Defence. You won't see the Alekhine Defence, 1 e4 ttJf6, very often. But if you do, you might want to play 2 e5 ttJd5 3 d4 d6 4 ttJf3, usually followed by iLe2 and O-O. Most other moves, such as 1...g6, 1...d6 or 1...b6, can nor- mally be met by 2 d4, 3 ttJc3 and 4 ttJf3, fol- lowed by a move by the fl-bishop and O-O. Of course, you can also play 1 d4, the other central move, but then you probably want to keep the position fairly quiet, because it takes a longer time to castle to safety than it does with 1 e4. A solid and more-or-less universal set-up is 2 ttJf3 and 3 iLf4, followed in most cases by 4 e3, 5 iLe2 and 6 O-O. I'd rather see my students fight their way through open positions instead; however, if you're not getting out of the open- ing alive after 1 e4, this method of playing 1 d4 deserves consideration. A word of advice: notice that a commonly suggested 'easy' repertoire for White with 1 ttJf3 and the King's Indian Attack (that is 2 g3, 3 iLg2, 4 O-O and 5 d3, with ttJbd2 and e4 to fol- low) doesn't lead to an open game, or one with a clear plan for White. Furthermore, it encour- ages mechanical play. Similarly, teachers some- times recommend the Colle System (with I d4, 2 ttJf3, 3 e3 and usually iLd3, O-O, c3 and ttJbd2), which can also be played too automati- cally, and usually doesn't lead to an open posi- tion. For true beginners, the King's Indian Attack and Colle System have the benefit of of- fering a safe position that nearly guarantees passage to some kind of playable middlegame; they may be a reasonable alternative if other openings are too intimidating. But having gained even a small amount of experience, you really should switch to more open and less au- tomatic play. As Black, I think that a Category D player would do well to proceed classically. That means playing 1. .. e5 versus I e4 and 1. .. d5 ver- sus 1 d4. In this, again, I am repeating the advice of teachers since time immemorial. The idea is similar to that behind White's 1 e4: you are guaranteed a strong presence in the centre and relatively quick development. When start- ing out, it's useful to play positions in which you control space. After I e4, 1...e5 serves that purpose. By contrast, the Sicilian Defence (1 e4 c5) normally leaves you with little room to ma- noeuvre and is best left until your positional skills develop. If you don't take to 1...e5, you can also consider answering I e4 with the Caro-Kann Defence (1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5) or the French Defence (1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5), both of which put the d-pawn on the 4th rank and stake a claim on the centre. They have the advantage of being slightly less expected at this level, but they have the drawback of allowing your oppo- nent to create fairly closed positions if they choose to play e5. Versus 1 d4, 1...d5 achieves similar results in terms of central control. It's true that 1... ttJf6 also stops 2 e4 and introduces a number of established defences. The latter tend to require some sophistication, however, and it's easy for the inexperienced player to end up facing a large and dangerous white centre. In more specific terms, let's assume that you've decided upon 1 e4 e5. It will involve a fair amount of preparation even on a low level. In chess, playing Black tends to require more study, since you are at more risk of serious dis- advantage when moving second. I'm not going to go into detail, but you'll need answers to var- ious less common but perfectly legitimate open- ings such as 2 f4 (the King's Gambit), 2 d4 exd4

3 c3 (the Danish Gambit), as well as 2 ttJc3 (the

Vienna Game) and 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 ttJc3 ttJf6 (the Four Knights Game). This is easier than it sounds, because there are fairly simple ways to proceed against them. In Volume I of this se- ries, for example, I examined some fairly easy responses to the King's Gambit, and in this vol- ume you'll find suggestions against the Danish Gambit and Four Knights Game. If you don't see something that appeals to you or I haven't mentioned something, you can look for master games in a database or use an opening ency- clopaedia. Just be aware that all of these moves are perfectly playable for White and you can't force your way to an advantage against them. Assuming that you narrow your difficulties down to 2 ttJf3, one option is to conserve your

294 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

study time, and play something relatively sim- ple like the Philidor Defence (2 ... d6). It's a le- gitimate choice, but gives you a cramped game, so as early as possible you should take the plunge with 2 ... lbc6. Doing so requires more work, but it will teach you more. By now you may be familiar with 3 i.c4, and you'll have a good idea what to do about it. Again, refer to Volume 1 of this series and/or outside sources. White's most respected line is 3 i.b5 (the Ruy Lopez), when it's a lot easier to avoid the com- plications of 3 ... a6 and play 3 ... lbf6. Then after

4 O-O, you can opt for a move with familiar

themes like 4 ... i..c5. You won't be seeing 1 d4 too often from in- experienced players. As mentioned, 1...d5 gives you a flrm central presence, and you can bring your pieces out relatively quickly to establish some central control. If White plays the most important move, 2 c4, inexperienced players might want to begin classically with 2 ... e6 fol- lowed by ... lbf6 and ... i.e7 (see Volume 2, Chapter 2). Slower moves such as 2lbf3 or 2 e3 are less challenging. It's logical and safe to start out with 2 ... lbf6 and 3 ... e6 (although if you can play ... i.f5 before ... e6, it makes your develop- ment even easier). Then you can set up a forma- tion with ... c5, ... lbc6, ... i.e7 and ... O-O. If you feel confldent about your handling of open po- sitions, you can play ... c5 on your 3rd or 4th move and create some open lines. Finally, it's important to use the 'What if?' procedure that I recommend below. That is, as you study openings, ask yourself why moves other than the ones listed aren't played. In do- ing so, watch for basic captures and tactics. At this level, it doesn't help you to win games if you memorize certain moves and then drop a pawn or piece the minute the opponent plays something different. On the other hand, that will inevitably happen - it has happened to all of us - so don't become discouraged. You'll be surprised how studying chess in any form will improve your visualization and reduce errors. Category C Openings At this level, the beneflts derived from playing with space and open lines still take priority, but it's also a good point to begin including varia- tions which can yield other types of positions. For most players, 1 e4 will probably still be the most attractive move, especially if you have al- ready played it while at a Category D level. On the other hand, there are practical beneflts to taking up 1 d4 - namely, your opponents will have seen it less and you will expand your bank of familiar positions. The English Opening with

1 c4 is a different matter. It tends to put oppo-

nents of equal strength on their own, which is good, but requires sophisticated positional han- dling, and unless you are conversant with spe- cifics, it may not yield enough open positions to provide the valuable training such positions offer. Similar considerations apply to 1 lbf3. Nevertheless, these openings are acceptable as long as you determinedly look for active play with parts of your repertoire. There's always time to emphasize slow positional systems as you improve. You can play solidly at this level, of course, but you might also begin to incorporate the ideas of setting initiative off against material. As White, along with some main lines. you might want to incorporate a gambit line, or even two. As a 1 e4 player facing 1. .. e5 (which is still the most likely response at this level), 2 d4 exd4

3 c3 dxc3 4 lbxc3 is a type of Danish Gambit

that will often transpose via 4 ... lbc6 5 lbf3 to the Goring Gambit. One advantage of playing this way (with the 2 d4 move-order) is that you bypass Black's second-move alternatives that follow 2lbf3 (such as 2 ... lbf6 and 2 ... d6). This is described in Chapter 5. The Goring Gambit is a good practical attacking system, in that Black's position can easily come under flre, while White retains a lead in development in any case. If nothing else, you can have it as a surprise weapon to supplement something less adventurous. Understandably, giving up material may not appeal to everyone, and you should try to bal- ance that activist tendency with learning classic variations as well. Unless you have a lot of study time and motivation, it's best to do so without being laden with too many double- edged and/or heavily analysed positions. After

1 e4 e5 2 lbf3 lbc6, 3 i.c4 is a conventional

choice - you can utilize and expand upon the knowledge that you gained if you played this move as a Category D player. Or you might pre- fer to play 3 i.b5 (the Ruy Lopez), but stick to

CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 295

lines which steer clear of the heaviest theory; for example, 3 ... a6 4 i.xc6 (the Exchange Vari- ation), or 3 ... ttJf6 4 'ife2. Versus the Sicilian Defence, which you will be seeing increasingly often, you might also consider playing a gambit. Specifically, 1 e4 cS

2 d4 cxd4 3 c3 (the Morra Gambit) offers a

pawn for initiative. Following 3 ... dxc3 4 ttJxc3, White's most common attacking set-up is ttJf3, i.c4, O-O and 'ife2, with the idea of bringing a bishop to e3, f4 or gS, and a rook to the open d- file. This sort of thing can be fun, and has no simple solution that negates your chances. See Chapter S on gambits. Assuming that you don't want to playa gam- bit (or want to have options), you could explore your first fianchetto system with 2 ttJc3, 3 g3 and 4 i.g2 (the Closed Sicilian). Alternatively, you can construct a repertoire around 2 ttJf3, picking and choosing which main lines, if any, are worth embarking upon. Some strong grand- masters, for example, have made a lifelong liv- ing off moves such as 1 e4 cS 2 ttJf3 d6 3 i.bS+ and 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 i.bS, which are relatively safe systems. For the most part, however, 1 e4 players eventually seem to settle upon the lines involving 2 ttJf3 and 3 d4 (the Open Sicilian). If that's your inclination, you still needn't commit yourself to heavy theoretical study. For exam- ple, versus the move 2 ... d6 (most common at this level, because your opponents will want to get to the Dragon Variation or the NajdorfVari- ation), 3 d4 cxd4 4 'ifxd4 is a perfectly respect- able line (the idea is 4 ... ttJc6 S i.bS, when White maintains a lead in development). Or, af- ter 3 d4 cxd4 4 ttJxd4 ttJf6 S ttJc3, you can play slightly less critical variations. For instance, versus S ... a6, the ever-popular Najdorf Varia- tion, you can begin by playing classically with 6 i.e2 and O-O, when understanding will be more important than memorization; see Vol- ume 1. There are also a number of sound but slightly offbeat lines such as 6 h3, 6 g3 and 6 'iff3. The same classical approach can be em- ployed against the Dragon Sicilian: S ... g6 6 i.e2. Then, slowly but surely, you can build a repertoire which includes more critical, tacti- cally-oriented variations. At this stage, you will begin to see openings such as the French Defence and Caro-Kann De- fence more often. It's still reasonable to play the Exchange Variations mentioned above, but at some point you'll probably want to try to cre- ate more problems for your opponent. With some study, 1 e4 e6 2 d4 dS 3 eS can be a nice weapon, and has the additional benefit of intro- ducing you to the theory of pawn-chains. Ver- sus the Caro-Kann, you can begin to build a classical repertoire with 3 ttJc3 (or 3 tiJd2) 3 ... dxe4 4 ttJxe4, but it's even easier to learn some basic lines after 3 eS; for example, 3 ... i.fS 4 ttJf3 followed by i.e2 and O-O, with the pawn- chain move c3 in most cases. As Black, 1. .. eS is still a good answer to 1 e4, of course, but this time you should seriously consider other defences such as 1...c6 and 1.. .e6, which allow for both open and closed positions. They also involve some recurring structures which will serve the student throughout his playing days. I'm still not excited about my students playing the Sicilian Defence at this stage, because it almost always means playing with less space and development, and in some cases with exotic and not particularly instruc- tive pawn-structures. The Pirc (1...d6), Modem (l...g6) and Alekhine (l...ttJf6) Defences are perfectly logical and sound openings, but I think they have practical drawbacks for the player be- low 1600, in that they concede space and don't generally yield as free piece-play. But if you have a strong affinity for any of them, that could outweigh other factors. Personal enjoy- ment should definitely be a consideration when you're deciding what to play. Versus 1 d4, you can always stick with

1...dS, as above. If you haven't already commit-

ted to too many gambit lines, the Albin Coun- ter-Gambit, 1 d4 dS 2 c4 eS (with the idea of 3 dxeS d4) has a decent reputation, and is a good alternative to the more conservative play with 2 ... e6 above. Another respectable gambit is the Budapest, which goes 1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 eS 3 dxeS ttJg4 (or the more speculative 3 ... ttJe4); you'll usually recover the pawn on eS. For those who follow grandmaster fashion, I should add that the currently popular Slav Defence, 1 d4 dS 2 c4 c6, is sound and effective. However, it can lead to rather slow development, and my feel- ing is that it's better suited at the higher levels. Finally, you can try a quick-developing 1...ttJf6 system; for example, the Nimzo-Indian, which goes 1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 e6 3 ttJc3 i.b4 often

296 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

followed by ... O-O, gets your pieces out rapidly, and the Bogo-Indian, 3 lDf3 i.b4+, does the same. Category B Openings At this point you should be ready to tackle posi- tions of most types, so the number of appropri- ate opening choices increases dramatically. Still, players with limited time for competition and study have to consider the practical drawbacks of using too many variations which entail a large initial time investment, and then require continual updating of theory to avoid unpleas- ant surprises. It's valuable to playa couple of theoretical 'main lines', even if you need to use your understanding and instincts as well as your memory to tackle them; you might even essay upon one highly tactical variation that is at the height of fashion. However, you will want to mix any such complex lines with systems that require less study and offer reasonably clear strategies versus normal play. The latter will often be positional or slightly slower open- ings, but can also include attacking and gambit lines, particularly if the main attacking meth- ods are thematic, and a new discovery by your opponent won't be of fatal consequence. This is also a good point to include some 'irregu- lar' /experimental variations into your play. They can be great fun, and you may find that several such lines are just as sound as the conventional ones. See Chapter 8. At this level, you will be advanced enough to play any logical first move, especially since, by virtue of moving first, White runs less risk of falling into trouble. This is also the time to in- troduce some specialization, regardless of the lines you choose. Most serious 1 e4 players tend to gravitate towards 1 e4 e5 2 lDf3 lDc6 3 i.b5 at some point or other, but remember that you can make a lifetime system out of 3 Sl.c4 if you like. Al- ternatives for the slightly eccentric player in- clude the King's Gambit with 2 f4 (be careful not to get your king in trouble), and the Bishop's Opening with 1 e4 e5 2 Sl.c4, followed in most cases by d3 (rather than trying to force through the move d4). Versus the Sicilian Defence, as mentioned, most players will be using the 2 lDf3 and 3 d4 main lines at least some of the time, although it's easy to get in positional trouble doing so against top players. I'd still try to mix in some of the systems without d4 that I listed for the Category C player. Versus the French Defence, you're on solid ground with any of 3 lDc3, 3 lDd2 or 3 e5; unfortu- nately, there's no escaping some theory if you want to use pawn-chain lines involving the move e5 (which you should, if you want both to learn about the opening and to maximize your chances). The main thing about all of your choices at this stage is that you would like to keep them in your repertoire for at least a few years. With luck, you will have them for the rest of your life, at least as a second or third weapon if you find something more attractive later on. Against the Pirc and Modem De- fences, I would still recommend staying with a simple lDc3/lDf3 system, but you can also start to play aggressive lines with f4 if you're will- ing to study theory, and early moves of the queen's bishop to e3 and g5 (normally fol- lowed by ~d2) are not that hard to learn. This is a great point for White to incorporate

1 d4 or 1 c4, excellent lifetime weapons which

have the further advantage that most of your peers will have spent less time preparing to play against them than versus 1 e4. Without going into detail, I'd recommend that after 1 d4, you go into lines involving 2 c4, and pick variations with clear-cut themes. For example, 1. .. d5 2 c4 e6 3 lDc3 followed by cxd5 is one of the more instructive openings in all of classical chess, and 1. .. d5 2 c4 c6 3lDf3 can be followed by any of several systems with e3 and lDc3 in one or another order. Those are safe and yet have plenty of impact. Against the King's Indian De- fence (l d4lDf6 2 c4 g6 with ... i.g7 and ... d6), players of a positional bent might want to head for a Fianchetto Variation (3 lDf3 i.g7 4 g3), and attackers will prefer 3 lDc3 i.g7 4 e4. But systems like 3lDc3 i.g7 4 i.g5 (or 4lDf3 d65 Sl.g5) are good compromises. Similarly, versus the Griinfeld Defence, 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 g6 3 lDc3 d5, you may want to bypass the volumes of the- ory on 4 cxd5 lDxd5 5 e4 for a while and try 4 i.g5 or 4 i.f4 (or 4 lDf3 followed by those moves), provided that you study them enough to avoid tricks and violent counterattacks. The point is that you're not obliged to take up main lines and may very well want to wait with those

CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 297

until you become a little more experienced. Similarly, versus 1 d4 l2Jf6 2 c4 e6, 3 l2Jf3 is positionally less committal than 3 l2Jc3 .ltb4, and a good choice. Nevertheless, you can learn a great deal by allowing 3 l2Jc3 .ltb4 and then accepting doubled pawns in return for poten- tially strong bishops by 4 a3, or by 4 e3 and, de- pending upon Black's response, 5 .ltd3 or 5 a3. At this stage such decisions become a matter of taste, and you can hardly go wrong in investi- gating all of these types of positions. 1 c4, the English Opening, is a first move that you can use for any occasion and indeed, some grandmasters play nothing else. A simple way to get started is to play 2 g3 against all of Black's normal moves 1...e5, 1...c5 and 1...l2Jf6. Later you'll almost certainly want to add in variations beginning with 2 l2Jc3 (or 2 l2Jf3), and be able to switch into some 1 d4 openings (for example, 1 c4 e6 2 d4 d5, 1 c4 c6 2 d4 d5 or 1 c4l2Jf6 2l2Jc3 g6 3 d4). Just don't think that you can go on autopilot after I c4. You need to have a specific answer to every major black set-up (and there are quite a few of these, be- cause 1 c4 doesn't limit Black's structural op- tions as much as 1 e4 and 1 d4 do). On the other hand, playing I c4 will expose you to a range of positions and structures that you can use in other openings. As Black in Category B, you should defi- nitely incorporate one or more major defences into your stock of weapons; hopefully you'll stick with these and learn them in considerable detail through practice and study. Within the major openings, some variations are clearly more manageable than others, so keep your eye out for those. Obviously I can't set forth a rep- ertoire for each major opening, but you should try to work with basic structures. If you're go- ing to play the Sicilian Defence at this stage, for example, you can consistently aim for ... d6 and ... e5 in most variations, or choose lines with ... d6 and ... e6 in every variation, or play ... g6 and ... d6 whenever you can. Keep in mind that, because the Sicilian is the most popular open- ing in chess, no opening has less surprise value. You'll be running into opponents who have been playing sharp lines against it for 20 years. So if you're taking the Sicilian up at this stage, you should put in a lot of serious study time, as well as commit to playing it for a few years. One way of doing this relatively painlessly would be to start with irregular variations of the Sicilian, some of which I mentioned in Chapter 8, and move to mainstream lines later. In the French Defence, Black Can steer the major variations into similar structures involv- ing d4 and e5 by White, unless White chooses to concede equality (i.e., by choosing exd5). The French is a good lifetime opening, either as a main defence or a back-up, because Black has so many sound ways to play and can shift from system to system when necessary. That is cer- tainly true of the Sicilian Defence, but perhaps less so with other major defences to 1 e4. The Caro-Kann Defence isn't as flexible; however, it is so inherently solid that it's hard to imagine any of the basic main lines proving unplayable, or even unpleasant enough to reduce the open- ing to an outsider status. It also requires less concrete study than most major openings. The Pirc Defence is an excellent choice for players who want to be able to switch between posi- tional play and dynamically-charged lines. I think that it is underrated as a defence and ap- propriate for any strength level. However, some players will get discouraged because they often end up having to play with less territory under their command than with many other openings. All of these choices include an element of per- sonal taste. Against 1 d4, this is a good point to pick up an Indian Defence. Like so many teachers, I would recommend the 1 ... l2Jf6, 2 ... e6 complex, because it's both solid and instructive. Versus the conventional 2 c4 lines, you would use the Nimzo-Indian (l d4l2Jf6 2 c4 e6 3l2Jc3 .ltb4), and either the Queen's Indian (l d4l2Jf6 2 c4 e6 3l2Jf3 b6) or the easier-to-learn Bogo-Indian (l d4l2Jf6 2 c4 e6 3l2Jf3 .ltb4+). Those inclined to sharper and somewhat riskier struggles might choose the King's Indian Defence (l d4l2Jf6 2 c4 g6 followed by ... .ltg7 and ... d6) or the Benoni (l d4l2Jf6 2 c4 c5). Of course, any other major defence is also playable. The one thing you want to be careful about versus 1 d4 is con- ceding too much space without knowing ex- actly why you're doing so. It would be nice to have something simple to play against 1 c4 and 1 l2Jf3; unfortunately, since White hasn't fully disclosed his inten- tions with these moves, Black has to be able to

298 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

respond to multiple set-ups. One way to ap- proach I c4 is to limit the number of reasonable options for White. For example, you can begin with 1...e5, and then if 2 lbc3, play 2 ... d6 or 2 ... ..Itb4, either of which limits White's choice of moves if he's genuinely trying for an advan- tage. For example, after I c4 e5 2 lbc3 d6, White ordinarily chooses between 3 d4, leading to 3 ... exd4 4 'iVxd4 lbc6, whereas against 3 lbf3 or 3 g3, 3 .. .f5 narrows White's options and keeps surprises to a minimum. After 2 g3, the variations 2 ... c6 and 2 ... lbf6 3 ..Itg2 c6 are positionally forcing. You can see how these strategies play out by referring to Volume 3 of this series. Versus I lbf3, someone who plays the Sicilian Defence might choose 1...c5 (al- lowing 2 e4), and then learn a system versus 2 c4, a Symmetrical English in which White has committed to 2 lbf3; the latter task isn't so hard. A Queen's Gambit defender might be happy to play I lbf3 d5, since 2 d4 will nor- mally transpose to that opening. And so forth. At the risk of boring the reader, I should em- phasize again that the suggestions above are merely a small subset of reasonable variations, selected to give you a feel for how you might choose openings at various levels. They are mainly given so that you have concrete advice to go by, rather than some airy generalities. But any time that you are strongly attracted to a cer- tain opening and have fun playing and studying it, that trumps other arguments. There is no sub- stitute for enjoyment when you're trying to learn something. Category A Openings Here we arrive at a point where overly-specific advice isn't very useful. At this level of strength, you can play any respectable opening without fear, and your repertoire can carry a theoretical load that would be unwieldy for a Category B player. In large part that's because a stronger player has a better understanding of and famil- iarity with chess positions, so he can absorb opening ideas and variations more quickly. Still, you won't want to beat your head against a wall by using what you thought were the lat- est discoveries in too many critical variations and then finding out that even your lower-rated opponents have played the same variations in dozens ofInternet games. My advice would be to play only a few fashionable main lines (three at most, fewer if you're so inclined), and fill in your repertoire with variations designed to make your opponent think on his own. You should also take into account whether you are good at retaining material that you have memorized; there's nothing worse than studying a line for days and then mixing up the moves when you finally get it over the board! At this level, a couple of irregular openings can be of value to counterbalance the detailed theoretical knowledge possessed by many ad- vanced opponents. In fact, many strong grand- masters benefit by judicious use of openings that are out of the mainstream. You can even implement this on move one; for example, I b3, I f4 and I lbc3 are candidates for White. As Black, you can save some time and playa 'uni- versal' system against 1 e4, 1 d4, 1 c4 and 1 lbf3; for example, l...g6, l...d6 or l...lbc6. However, be sure to employ these as secondary weapons for now. Using such moves exclu- sively can limit your general chess understand- ing; I have seen players damage their chess skills, and their long-term results, by never varying from 'safe' openings such as 1...g6 or, as White, the King's Indian Attack, Colle Sys- tem or 1 b3. Even a blind use of 1 c4 can be counterproductive (for example, using 2 g3 with studied avoidance of any central confron- tation). You simply have to keep the play sharp in a reasonable percentage of your openings if you want to improve. Unsound or merely 'tricky' openings are an- other problem. Since you will probably want to drop such openings from your repertoire later, they can represent a poor investment of study time now. In principle, you should never have to completely abandon the openings that you are playing at this stage, unless they are too de- manding to keep up with. That is, you should be able to employ them again from time to time. A few solid, less volatile, variations will serve you well in this respect; even if you're bored with them now, you'll inevitably find new ways to interpret them later. Many authors make the point that you should adjust your opening repertoire to your style of play. That's a tricky proposition, however, for several reasons. First, you may not have a

CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 299

discernible style; most players don't have one until they become skilled at the game. Second, the openings that you use have already partially defined how you play, but that doesn't neces- sarily reveal a true 'style'. Furthermore, by studying openings of another character, you may find that you enjoy a different type of chess entirely, and that you play it well. At any rate, I don't think this advice would apply until you have reached at least master strength and have a true understanding of your strengths and weaknesses. Finally, as indicated above, it would be pre- sumptuous to give masters concrete sugges- tions about which openings to play; they have their own ideas and tastes. But in general, I be- lieve that strong players should try to have a flexible repertoire, broad enough to adjust to different opponents and different tournament situations.

2. Choose openings that will improve your play

On the face of it, this piece of advice may seem silly. Of course you want to improve your play, but can one opening really teach you more than another? I think that the answer is yes, even up to a fairly high level of player. For example, openings which lead towards 'automatic' play can retard your progress in terms of under- standing, and demand less in terms of creative thought. It's a bad sign when you find yourself going on autopilot. If you want to investigate certain structures more deeply, you might use two or more open- ings that are related. For example, you can get standard isolated d-pawn positions as White in certain lines of the Queen's Gambit, Nimzo- Indian, c3 Sicilian, and Panov Caro-Kann; and as Black in the Tarrasch Variation of the Queen's Gambit, the Tarrasch Variation of the French Defence, and other defences. Alternatively, you might want to adopt what I call the 'restraint structure', that is, ... c6/. .. e6 structures without a d-pawn (see the introductory chapters of Vol- ume 1). These can be found in a number of defences such as the Caro-Kann, the Slav and the Scandinavian. Many 1 e4 e5 openings fea- ture Black upholding a 'strong point' on e5 with a ... d6/ ... e5 structure, and the King's Indian De- fence often does the same, so it might provide a complementary defence to 1 d4. Sometimes there's a general resemblance between open- ings; for example, the moves ... e6 and ... .Bb4 are common to the Nirnzo-Indian Defence, the Ragozin Variation of the Queen's Gambit De- clined, the Winawer and McCutcheon Varia- tions of the French Defence, and a couple of variations of the English Opening (including the English Defence). You probably won't want to play all of these lines at once, but it doesn't hurt to consider similar piece placements when trying to find openings to your taste. Naturally, you should be careful not to over- indulge in this practice. After all, as I'm con- stantly saying, it's also important to learn as many structures as you can and expand your chess knowledge in the process. So, while you will do well to learn a few structures deeply, don't limit yourself by trying to force your rep- ertoire down a single path.

3. Be daring and play new openings

The legendary Viktor Korchnoi has said, bluntly, that if you want to improve your chess, you should play a new opening. I guess this is a variation on a theme that I'm starting to bore everyone with. But it's a controversial point of view, and one that not all coaches agree with. One traditional philosophy has it that you should specialize in your openings in order to under- stand them on a deep level. For one thing, by doing so, you can reasonably expect to avoid serious trouble early on. The more modem view, however, tends to be that it's important to learn about the game as a whole, and since different openings lead to distinct kinds of play, you will become a more complete player by exposing yourself to a wide range of positions. More- over, the freshness and creativity that you bring to the board will often compensate for lesser fa- miliarity, even to the extent of avoiding or set- ting early traps. Not surprisingly, a combination of these two approaches will probably serve you best, and in fact most strong players have a wide repertoire, but also a few favourite openings that they play more than the others. In any case, you shouldn't abandon any well-established opening based upon one loss. At the very least, you should re- search the opening to find out where you went

300 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

wrong (or where theory can be improved upon). And if you take up a new opening as your main weapon, play the old one from time to time, es- pecially if you can limit yourself to variations in which one new move by the opponent won't be likely to lead you into a bad position. After all, you've invested time into the first opening and it's foolish to waste it. In practice, I think that the tendency to cling to your habitual openings and be afraid to ex- periment is a greater danger than the disadvan- tages of superficially jumping around from opening to opening. Many of you will recog- nize that the more you play an opening, the more stale your thinking can become, leading to dogmatic moves and a tendency to miss un- usual ideas. Also, with the advent of databases and an explosion of resources for opening re- search, it doesn't take anywhere near as long as it did two decades ago to become quite familiar with the variations and ideas of a new opening. Granted, a panicky switch to a something new may not be a good idea against high-level oppo- nents. You should have a safe fallback opening in case of emergency. Similarly, if you know that your opponent, however strong, plays a certain variation against your favourite opening and you want to avoid it, be careful about con- cocting something too rapidly (for example, in the 10 minutes between the posting of the pair- ings and the beginning of the game!). The odds are that he is at least as familiar as you are with something that you've never played before. Furthermore, playing an opening for which you know all the themes and ideas is probably safer than trying to wing it. Naturally, if you think that your chosen variation will give you a sig- nificant disadvantage, see if you can play an- other variation within the same overall opening complex, or something as safe as you can find. Given time, adjusting to your opponent isn't a bad idea; maybe you know that you're playing him tomorrow, for example, or in a weekly tournament. Just be careful of precipitously abandoning what you're familiar with. Regardless of your circumstances, playing and studying even a limited number of games with a particular opening will probably teach you about kinds of positions that you hadn't previously encountered. That includes various positional ideas and tactics which will apply to other openings and middlegames. Furthermore, new positions are very helpful in improving your sense of timing, that is, how much you can sacrifice in one domain (for example, de- velopment) to gain in another (for example, structure). Finally, there's the obvious point that if you become disillusioned with a particu- lar opening, you may have an opportunity to play it from the other side of the board.

4. Don'tf eel constrained by the latest fashion

Just because leading grandmasters are playing something, that doesn't mean that it is 'best'; often their choice of openings is based upon practical considerations. For example, they may be intent upon causing specialized types of problems for their elite opponents, or even pro- tecting their ratings by finding drawish varia- tions for Black. It's amazing how many players tell me that they don't play some opening be- cause it's 'inferior' or 'unsound', when that opinion is based solely upon the fact that the top grandmasters aren't currently playing it, or that there was a single high-profile game in which one side got the better game and won. Keep in mind that all major openings are playable. To me, in addition, there is something slightly de- pressing about playing the same openings as elite grandmasters. Inevitably, those profes- sionals will be coming up with new ideas and working out the details faster than you could ever dream of doing yourself, so you're always in the role of a follower instead of a creator. Improving Your Opening Play After all is said and done, you want to improve your opening play. There are no magic tricks for doing that, but I'll give some advice and point to a number of training techniques for getting opening ideas to work in practice. Prep- aration and practice are obviously crucial, but the best ways to do so are not self-evident. To what extent you use computers to study and prepare, for example, is a much-debated ques- tion among chess teachers.

CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 301

The most common questions from students have to do with how to go about learning open- ings. Naturally, that relates to how to play them well. First, understand that there are no magic shortcuts. If you read through chess literature or go to instructional sites on the web, you'll soon realize that no one can possibly imple- ment all of the various tips and strategies that are supposed to lead to improvement. Too much advice is probably worse than no advice at all unless you drastically narrow it down. I find it slightly irritating when authors and teachers come up with these lengthy lists of what to think about during a chess game; after their first 15 items to 'always keep in mind', they flood you with other 'common mental mistakes' and then start all over again in the next chapter or article! If you've read enough golf and tennis magazines, you'll recognize the problem: we can't play with more than a few tips in our minds at once. In fact, the most useful pieces of advice for the average chess-player to con- sciously refer to in the midst of battle are proba- bly simple reminders such as 'Pay attention to captures and checks' or 'When you're just about to make your move, take one more look at the most obvious replies'! The rest should become part of an organic thinking process. In the case of openings and early middlegames, crowding your thought-process with maxims is particu- larly ridiculous; if you want to escape the con- crete for a while, it's much better to step back from the position and consider what strategies go with the particular pawn-structure on the board, including the optimal spots for each piece. This can be done on your opponent's thinking time. Something similar applies with respect to the ubiquitous advice about opening play and study techniques: there are too many considerations for anyone to handle, and too many hypotheti- cal goals to achieve. What's more frustrating, I don't think that any such advice is universal; whether it works depends upon the individual and what chess skills they've acquired. More- over, some questions have no correct answers. For example: should you memorize openings or learn their ideas? That varies according to cir- cumstance, skill level, and inclination. In this section, I'll be setting forth a wide variety of methods for preparing and studying openings, which taken together would overwhelm their purpose. So by all means look over this ad- vice, but then pick and choose what seems useful for you, and don't try to do too much at once.

1. Committing to and recording a repertoire

Let's assume that you've chosen your major openings and top-level variations according to the guidelines described above (or not). You probably won't be sure about what to do against all or even most of the subvariations. It's even more likely that you won't know how to answer the wide variety of individual lines that your opponent can throw at you. Therefore, as you proceed, you'll need to arrive at a more detailed provisional repertoire, which will almost cer- tainly be adjusted as time passes. The process of filling out details in a reper- toire is in itself a means of learning and im- provement. To do this, you first need to see how the opening breaks down into variations and subvariations. Books are helpful in that regard; for example, an encyclopaedic openings com- pendium should make it clear what the main variations of an opening are. You might also skim through the Contents list of a book special- izing in a particular opening or set of openings, and use the Index of Variations if it has one. Still another method is to use a database to find a large set of games with the opening to see how frequently various lines occur. In fact, most da- tabases have an option of ordering games by opening, to any desired level of subvariations. Then it's time to pick the lines you wish to play. For now, choose one line versus any varia- tion that you need to have an answer for. Later you will be adding options, but at this point we'll take a linear approach. Take your time and find something compatible with your tastes, testing a few lines on the Internet or at the club. Speciality books and repertoire books will sug- gest certain variations and provide good refer- ences as you continue to play the opening. Alternatively, you may adopt a variation that a friend plays, or choose to try out some line that you saw in a game in a magazine. If you have a teacher, he can recommend openings and varia- tions; just be wary of any teacher who tries to foist most of his own repertoire on you, in

302 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

particular if it means discarding what you cur- rently play. In each case, ask if an opening is too complex or theoretical to use at your cur- rent playing strength. Some players like to look at what variations the specialists in certain openings are choosing, on the grounds that they know what they're doing. Copying a grand- master's entire repertoire isn't good, in my opinion. You'll tend to end up with too 'profes- sional' a repertoire, constructed for another player's purposes (for example, a top player may only want to draw with Black). Having decided upon a set of opening varia- tions to start out with, it is essential to docu- ment what you've chosen, including the main lines and however many provisional variations that you are willing to commit to. This abso- lutely requires that you chart out your new rep- ertoire in some handy format. There are several ways of doing so, but whatever method you use, save copies of your older repertoires even when you move on to revised ones. The first option is rather primitive, but may appeal to those who still prefer physical media such as paper over electrons. It consists of man- ually written charts, possibly in tree form, which list the chosen variations and subvariations. This corresponds with the famous 'notebooks' that the great masters of old used to carry around with them. Another common method is (was) to use index cards. On a slightly higher level of sophistication, you can enter the same information into a word-processing program on a computer. Then it can be either printed out or read on the screen. One benefit of doing it this way is that the chart can be modified and edited with a few key- strokes. The most sophisticated and best way to re- cord a repertoire is to use a chess database pro- gram such as ChessBase or Chess Assistant. Using ChessBase, for example, you can create a single game with an overall tree of the main moves of each opening you use. Then you can create 'games' containing each variation (or subvariation), doing so to whatever degree of detail you desire. Here are just a few advan- tages of this approach:

1. You can play over every move of the rep-

ertoire on the screen, going back and forth through the variations.

2. You can change the moves whenever you

want to without having to rewrite.

3. You can include verbal commentary,

cross references, and printable diagrams wher- ever you choose.

4. You can take relevant games from other

databases and merge in the ones that you think will be helpful.

5. You can tum on an analytical engine and

have it assess positions in your repertoire, as well as suggesting alternate moves.

6. You can always look at and/or print out

the repertoire in chart form, or game form if you prefer that.

7. You can catch transpositions more easily.

These days, not surprisingly, just about ev- ery serious player uses a database program to construct their repertoire. It doesn't take much computer literacy to learn how to get your moves entered, after which they are automati- cally ready to replay. The actual information that you use in your files needn't come solely from databases; in fact, opening books are still by far the best source for most players, and you will want to input analysis from them into the repertoire file in your chess program. In fact, the process of keying in moves from books is an excellent way to fix them in your mind. I rec- ommend it for everyone from beginner on up. Having recorded everything in orderly form, you can and should periodically review your repertoire to see which variations aren't work- ing well, which need more study, and which you find unpleasant to play. These can be replaced, but only after a good-faith effort to solve the problem by making minor adjustments, picking different subvariations, and looking for different ways to play the same basic positions. Of course, you can always expand the repertoire at any juncture and have two options available.

2. Strategy, tactics and memorization

After some study of an opening, and perhaps experience with it, I strongly recommend ex- plicitly writing down the typical strategies and themes that go with a variation. This includes basic goals, tactical motifs, opening traps, typi- cal piece positions, standard manoeuvres, po- tential pawn-breaks, common pawn-structures

CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 303

(perhaps with a few characteristic endings), and probable middlegame plans (including po- tential weaknesses to attack). You should make up an ordered list of these ideas; it's helpful if you yourself decide how you want to organize such a list, and what should be included in it. How complete or even accurate your list is doesn't matter as much as getting it down on paper to refer to. Also, don't forget to go through this process for both White and Black! That is, you need to be aware of your oppo- nent's ideas as well as your own. This task should be done early on in your repertoire-creation process, and not put off. De- pending upon your outlook, such careful chart- ing might be slightly boring, certainly more so than playing, but in that case you can make the list fairly quickly and then come back to it later in order to add to, modify or delete items, based upon the games that you play and books that you read. I'd be sure to keep an eye out for typi- cal tricks and tactics in your openings; if you fall for one of these, everything else is irrele- vant, at least for that particular game. At the same time, don't undervalue straight- forward memorization of opening moves. Most players will find that, as they memorize open- ings, they will absorb by osmosis most of the typical themes and structures. After all, memo- rization in chess is a method of acquiring real knowledge, just as it is in the sciences, crafts, and most fields. The more that you play over opening moves, even by rote, the better they will be absorbed and some of the wisdom be- hind them will inevitably sink into your con- sciousness. Naturally, memorization isn't suf- ficient to make you a strong player; indeed, there's a kind of overdependence on it that can lead to the common mistake of playing the same move in a completely inappropriate posi- tion. So you need perspective, and becoming aware of why you're making particular moves has to be combined with blunt memorization; fortunately, these are not exclusive processes. You'll also want to start thinking about move- order issues, which I have strongly emphasized in this series. As you develop your openings, think about how you will concretely answer each order in which your opponent can play his moves, and how you might adjust your own move-order to your advantage. This can be decided upon gradually, and may even take years to pin down completely.

3. Study model games interactively

The best teachers universally recommend study- ing master games to improve your play. In the case of opening study, an obvious method is to choose games directly from an opening book, ideally finding copies of them in your database and collecting them in one place. You can also collect a series of games from a database with the desired opening variation, and then sort them according to rating, so that you see how the best players handle the positions first. If you have narrowed down the variation to a particu- lar line, you may even be able to play through every game with it. Still another useful technique for gathering samples is to use the games of a specialist in each line. This is also easy to do with a database - by examining the openings key, you will soon recognize who has played the variation for the longest time (in certain contexts, there may be a function informing you directly about who the most frequent practitioners are). The same goes for reading opening books with an eye towards the opponents in relevant games. Often a partic- ular player is closely associated with an opening variation, either as Black or White, although it makes for a more productive experience to pick at least two or more players, in order to com- pare treatments and find lines where you can implement your own ideas. Having located games, the way in which you study them will depend upon your time and en- ergy, but most teachers will recommend that you participate actively in the learning pro- cess. Rather than simply playing the moves over, try predicting (or guessing at) them your- self. Ideally you will take enough time thinking about them that you get a good grip on the rele- vant positions. The traditional way to do this is to set up a board and place a book in front of you, or use a paper copy of the game. You can generate a printed copy of games with any seri- ous database program, and include diagrams if that works for you. Cover up the moves (with, e.g., a piece of paper, ruler or index card) while analysing the position. With the right physical set-up, you will be able to uncover one move at

304 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

a time. The truly dedicated student can try to predict both sides' moves, but it's probably more realistic to analyse continuations from 'your' side of the board, and you can get through more material if you do so. Not surprisingly, you can also go through this process with a da- tabase program. ChessBase, for example, has a 'Training mode' that reveals only one move at a time as you work out the next move. Some very strong players have emphasized that it helps to periodically use a physical board to play over games (rather than the computer monitor), because that's how you will be seeing things at a tournament. You will always benefit most from analysing a position deeply, but realistically, studying opening theory involves a lot of material and you probably won't get to enough games or variations if you worry over each move in every game. As time progresses, you will be able to identify one or two positions from the opening of each game that require the most serious con- sideration. If you only have time to spend a minute or so on a move, at least this approxi- mates the time you might actually get in a real game! Some teachers recommend using a clock to discipline your time management. With respect to available study time, you have one more decision to make. For your gen- eral chess education, there's nothing better than analysing the whole game using the cover-up method. But if your goal is to study openings, you simply won't get through enough helpful material unless you cut the process short as the middlegame begins, and stop there or quickly play through the remaining moves, by hand or on a screen. Of course, it's hard to assess where the border between opening and middlegame is, so you'll have to get a feel for where to stop as you play over more games. In this respect, it's probably easier to use the games in an opening book (or DVD) than in a games collection, but you can do both. See the next section for further thoughts on how to improve this procedure. I suggest using a mix of annotated and un- annotated games. The former allow you to com- pare the thoughts of a strong player with your own. The latter force you to think more about a position, and accustom you to playing more creatively without an ever-present authority lurking in your mind.

4. Creative learning: what if ... ?

As mentioned, you can apply the active method above to opening books and articles as well as games collections. But I didn't explicitly men- tion what is perhaps the most important part of the process: asking the question 'What if he [your opponent] plays move X? What happens then?'. If you do this consistently for most of the moves that you're looking at, and answer the questions as you go along, you will improve at an accelerated rate and greatly broaden your perspective on anything you study. Further- more, you'll find that sometimes there's no clear answer to your question about a proposed move, or perhaps no good reply at all. That means that you've come up with a worthwhile new move. It turns out that there are plenty of them; every player, once he's learned the rules and played some games, can find moves that haven't been tried before (at least moves that aren't in the books or generally known). Some- times, in fact, the less you know the better. When I began to play chess, the books available to me were mostly games collections, and I was already a passably competent player before I ran into opening pamphlets and the like. So I became my own main source of ideas for the opening, taking the first moves of a game from a collection and using the 'What if. .. ?' method. After a while, it wasn't that difficult to put my own stamp on the variations I played. That still holds true today. You should be able to personalize your repertoire with a small improvement here or there, a change of move- orders, or even a new strategy entirely. If you play very sharp lines, you may find a block- buster novelty in a tactical situation; of course, that is much more likely if you stay away from the most popular lines of the day. Even if you don't introduce new moves, ask- ing the 'What if. .. ?' question can lead you to understand the subtleties of a variation, which might result in taking up some move that has previously been regarded as inferior, or aban- doning a variation that is supposed to be good for you (and doing so before you lose a game with it!). Sometimes you may decide that you'd like to incorporate the line into your repertoire, but only when you're playing with the opposite colour!

CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 305

Players everywhere will tell you that finding new opening moves or charting new territory in the opening is among the most rewarding expe- riences that comes from study. For some, it is their proudest achievement in chess.

5. Practice makes perfect

Not surprisingly, it is vital to play your openings as often as possible. This can be done in casual play and tournaments, against computers, or in online playing situations. These days, most se- rious players take advantage of the latter possi- bility, and there are numerous playing sites on which to do so. In general, inexperienced play- ers can get by using a free or inexpensive site, and that may be the proper budgetary decision. But as you get more serious, the major pay sites such as Internet Chess Club or Playchess offer the strongest opposition and the chance to sit in on grandmaster games, along with many fea- tures that other sites don't offer. You should do your own investigation before deciding what fits your needs. There are other ways to make your practice more efficient and rewarding. For example, if you're trying to learn an opening as Black, practice playing it from the white side, and vice-versa. You can even set up a series of games with a partner and agree to play the same variation again and again. Such practice is ide- ally suited for online play, and this is one situa- tion in which I can recommend blitz games (in sensible, non-addictive, quantities). Otherwise, for the sake of opening practice, try to make your online games at a lO-minute or preferably IS-minute time-control (or longer, if it's possi- ble to find an opponent). In that way, you get to reflect a little about the opening and early middlegame issues before descending into a time-scramble. It's even worth sacrificing some rating points by taking an impractical amount of time to emphasize opening accuracy instead of results; after all, it doesn't take too long to get your online rating back to its natural level. Finally, many players test their openings by playing against a computer program. That's an excellent way to gain experience, and puts the learning process under your control; for exam- ple, you can pause the play and contemplate the position, look up the line in a book, jot down what's happening, or take a break to eat some- thing. One drawback to this kind of study is that it takes place in a less competitive atmosphere than online play, and might make your transi- tion to over-the-board games more difficult. In addition, you might find that you miss the so- cial element of the game; of course, that might be an improvement when you consider some online behaviour!

6. Over the board

This chapter isn't about psychological issues, but let me devote a few words to playing open- ings in real, over-the-board situations (for ex- ample, at tournaments). Right away, I believe that it's a mistake to blitz out opening moves at a rapid-fire pace. For one thing, it's rather ob- noxious, and may unnecessarily provoke more determined play from your opponent. More im- portantly (for most players, anyway), you will probably play an unintended move from time to time. This can happen even if you're familiar with an opening and wide awake. For example, you might be prepared to make a certain stan- dard move in any case, but then fail to adjust to your opponent's unexpected move. Or you play your moves in the wrong order, which is, inci- dentally, a common time-trouble slip. Probably the most frequent mistake when slamming out the opening moves is to playa customary move automatically, and then suddenly remember that you had actually decided to play something different if you ever reached the position. All these possibilities are very unlikely to happen if you take more than five seconds per move. And pressing the clock with normal force goes a long way towards establishing your maturity. Next, you have to realize and accept that you'll seldom get the exact subvariation that you're hoping for, that you'll often not get the exact variation, and sometimes, you won't even end up in the right opening! The bald fact is that there are two of you playing, and your oppo- nent has his own preparation as well as limits on his theoretical knowledge. So he may devi- ate into a sideline, use a move-order that you hadn't anticipated, or playa new move, whether intentionally or not. How should you react when you are sur- prised by an unexpected opening move, and are

306 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

unsure of whether you're facing something new? The obvious answer, one given by some books and teachers, is that you should avoid speculating about your opponent's knowledge and play the position objectively, at normal speed, just as you would any random middle- game position. After all, unexpected moves are commonplace throughout a game. But in fact, it's absolutely justified to hit the reset button and take an unusual amount of time to think. After all, your opponent hasn't studied that ran- dom middlegame position, but there's a good possibility that he has studied this particular opening and therefore a chance, although hardly a certainty, that his last move is a prepared novelty. If so, then there are more likely to be different kinds of issues in the position, and possibly tricks for you to negotiate. What's more, small mistakes are more likely to be pun- ished when your opponent has had time to re- flect about the possibilities away from the board. So additional caution is desirable. It's also pos- sible that the surprise move is an inferior one, or an outright mistake (after all, there may be a good reason why you haven't seen it before). In that case, taking extra time to check for a possi- ble flaw is also worthwhile. In either case, don't feel intimidated into making a quick re- sponse. While it may be more macho to throw down a 'You-don't-scare-me', Try-that-out- for-size' move, you really should expend some resources at this first critical juncture of the game. Finally, a time-honoured question in chess is whether to 'play the board' or 'play the oppo- nent'. My general inclination in the middle- game is to play the board, which means to make your moves without taking the tastes or foibles of your specific opponent into account. That doesn't eliminate speculation, or playing dif- ferently against different strength opponents, or even making objectively inferior moves in the hope of causing your opponents more prob- lems. Rather, it means that you make most de- cisions independent of an assessment of the id- iosyncrasies of opponents, or of their perceived tendencies to play weakly in certain types of positions and strongly in others. In choosing your openings, however, both before and during the game, I think that you have your best opportunity to 'play the opponent', that is, if you're quite sure that you're familiar with someone's style and preferences, it makes sense to guide the play away from those. For example, many wild attacking players don't like simplified positions, especially with the queens off. Other positionally-oriented players become uncomfortable in out-of-control tacti- cal positions. I think that it's too risky and diffi- cult to try to channel the direction of the play in the middlegame or endgame; for one thing, their assessments will be approximate and the final positions fuzzy. But in the opening, be- cause of previous and fixed knowledge, you can be almost sure whether a certain kind of po- sition can be forced, and what the evaluations of the resulting variations are. Therefore you'll know what, if anything, you are sacrificing in objective terms by forcing the play in a certain direction. Putting this together, I'd say that it's all right to play opening variations that take into account your opponent's style, but be care- ful not to lean too heavily upon the practice.

7. Chess information and the openings

In today's chess world, there are more sources of information and analysis about openings than can possibly be kept track of. Here's a brief guide to what's out there:

1. For starters, you can find multiple open-

ing books about every conventional opening, as well as books about most of their variations, and even some about subvariations. If you include books written in various languages, literally hundreds of opening books by master-strength players appear each year. Some of these are ap- pearing in e-book form as well. One enormous advantage of opening books is that you have a strong player (usually an expert in the line) sorting through hundreds of variations to show you the important and recommended ones. The author of an opening book also organizes the important material in an opening by filtering out the vast numbers of games with which the reader needn't be concerned in practical play. In addition, most books these days have a great many recommendations for how to improve upon current theory. Remarkably, these recom- mendations sometimes go years before they seep into top-level play and become the main moves.

CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 307

2. The most significant longstanding periodic

publications with an emphasis on openings are the Informator series, which has annotations by strong and elite grandmasters, and the New in Chess Yearbooks, which consist of opening ar- ticles by leading experts. ChessBase Magazine, an electronic magazine on DVD, publishes nu- merous opening surveys in each issue.

3. In electronic form, DVDs about chess

openings have expanded. Be warned that these are mostly of poor quality, but there are notable exceptions, primarily in the series of high- quality DVD videos from ChessBase.

4. Many websites are loaded with informa-

tion about openings. Every year, the website ChessPublishing produces the equivalent of many books' worth of opening material, all an- notated by grandmasters, along with e-books summarizing the information. Elsewhere on the Web, innumerable teaching sites, blogs, and players' home pages have opening analysis.

5. Chess magazines not only have many

games annotated in detail by leading players, but they often contain separate opening articles. Almost every country has a national publica- tion, and many other wonderful magazines are published around the world. It wouldn't be fair for me to recommend particular ones, but you can combine the recommendations of friends and use web searches to pick out some, perhaps on a trial basis.

6. Finally, we have the amazing world of da-

tabase programs, which can organize millions of games according to opening, instantly pull up all games in a certain position, search for struc- tures, and save these in an accessible format. Increasingly, players (especially already-knowl- edgeable professionals) use database programs to research the latest games and improve their own repertoires. With their years of exposure to opening ideas and large blocks of available time, some grandmasters practically live off databases to satisfy their opening theory needs. That isn't realistic or even desirable for the non-professional, however. For the majority of us, an opening book is still the best way to un- derstand a variation's positional and tactical ideas, and to pick up intelligent suggestions. One reason for this is that it's difficult to assess the worth of the moves that you find from data- bases. When doing searches, I sometimes filter out all games below a certain rating level, and I also try to include all the annotated games that I can find; nevertheless, I'm continually sur- prised by how often this gives a wrong impres- sion about what the best lines really are. In ad- dition, with the arm's-length view that comes from a database search, it's not easy to decide which variations are practical or which move- order problems will prevent you from getting the positions that you're after. By contrast, when a titled author has reviewed, thought about, and (ideally) played an opening, he will have insights and explanations that the average player can't generate on his own. In conclusion, there's a lot to consider when choosing and preparing your openings. In this chapter I've attempted to provide a basis for do- ing so, as well as address the issue of how best to study openings. You by no means need to ap- ply everything or even most of what I've rec- ommended; in fact, it's probably best to keep your mind focused and apply only one or two things at a time! But regardless of its immediate value, I hope that this chapter provides a refer- ence when you're in doubt about how to proceed with your chess openings and your develop- ment as a player.

10 The Future of Openings

Having described the range of openings used in contemporary chess, I don't think there's much doubt about their vitality in the immediate fu- ture. These days, it's hard for us to imagine that in the 1920s, Capablanca and Lasker were fret- ting about how opening theory had progressed to such an extreme that chess had become fun- damentally limited. At the time, it was sug- gested that no one could win against a skilled master if he chose certain openings (the Caro- Kann was a particular worry, leading Reti to re- ject 1 e4 altogether, and the Queen's Gambit Declined seemed an insurmountable barrier versus 1 d4). That being the case, the percent- age of draws would increase dramatically until we reached a state called 'the death of chess'. Capablanca even proposed a change of rules to counteract this perceived problem. We occasionally hear mutterings to this ef- fect today, but I think that the current situation is similar to what it actually was in those times. Ever since this concern surfaced, the number of legitimate openings, variations, and subvariations used by grandmasters has ex- ploded without pause, and 80 years later that process is accelerating. There are more unan- swered questions in the entire set of practical openings today, and more difficulties in play- ing them, than could have been imagined by the grandmasters in the 1970s and 1980s, much less those from Capablanca's time. When it comes to computers, another source of concern, you could argue that the death of chess by endgames is more likely than its death by openings! At least the complexity of end- games, as demonstrated by the development of comprehensive endgame tablebases, is limited enough to be handled with perfect play for up to 6 pieces (4, excluding the kings). By contrast, chess programs are at their worst in the open- ing, as long as they are 'out of book'; by defini- tion, the opening is the most complicated part of the game in terms of the number of possible future continuations. Granted, it is often more manageable for us as humans than a random middle game since we have a body of accumu- lated knowledge and recognize recurring struc- tures. But the number of opening permutations is so great, and the difficulties of assessment so far beyond the grasp of the most powerful com- puter ever contemplated, that we can be confi- dent about the game's longevity in that respect. When we get to specifics, the issues are more involved, and vary sharply from group to group. Even professional players use different approaches to their choice of openings based upon their strategies regarding both competi- tion and rating. Let's begin at the very top, with World Champions and their top-ten peers. To the dismay of many fans, some elite players employ a 'win-as-White, hold-as-Black' strat- egy, a policy reflected in their opening choices. That is not a bad way to win closed tourna- ments; and equally importantly, to avoid rating disasters. Thus we see some of the top-ten play- ers resorting to similar variations over many years. Ex-World Champion Vladimir Kramnik, for example, has used a number of solid open- ings as Black versus 1 e4, such as the Petroff Defence, Sveshnikov Sicilian (which has be- come notoriously drawish at the top levels, de- spite its aggressive and dynamic nature), and famously, the Berlin Defence to the Ruy Lopez. His drawing percentage as Black is a rather hefty 56%. Supergrandmaster Peter Leko plays some of the same openings, as well as the Mar- shall Attack, an aggressive gambit which pro- duces very forcing play that often ends in a draw. His drawing percentage as Black is 60%. Anatoly Karpov, a World Champion famous for his conservative style, has used the Caro-Kann Defence and various 1 e4 e5 defences induding the Petroff. He sports a 54% drawing ratio as Black. You will find that these same opening variations are used disproportionately by several other supergrandmasters (in comparison to the practice of professional players in general). A somewhat different situation arises versus I d4.

THE FUTURE OF OPENINGS 309

The leading players exhibit more variety, al- though almost everyone includes the super-solid l...liJf6 and 2 ... e6 (the Nimzo-Indian/Queen's Indian complex) in their repertoires, sometimes exclusively, as well as a large number of games with 1...d5, the other most conservative first move. To the extent that 1 d4 play sometimes tums wild, it usually does so because White feels obliged to try to win against an inherently solid opening such as the Slav or Queen's In- dian, and is even willing to sacrifice a pawn or two in that effort. By contrast, it's worth noting how World Champions Bobby Fischer and Garry Kaspar- ov, the two most prominent players of the mod- em era, made winning as Black an integral part of their approach. Fischer drew only 37% of his games as Black and won 51 % (versus consider- ably lower average opposition, to be sure); whereas Kasparov drew only 48% of his games with Black and won 40%, far ahead of his con- temporaries. They both specialized in the dy- namic Sicilian Defence, and both initially used the double-edged King's Indian and Griinfeld Defences as Black, turning to more solid ap- proaches later in their careers. Kasparov ulti- mately went through every major system versus 1 d4, and naturally played them all well. We also find a contemporary set of top play- ers who lean in the Fischer/Kasparov direction, and take many more forays in experimental di- rections. It will surprise no one who follows their games, for example, that Veselin Topalov and Alexei Shirov, who boast of wide reper- toires filled with active openings, have had un- usually low drawing percentages with both White and Black; nor that the eccentric Alexan- der Morozevich and aggressive Judit Polgar have Fischer-like drawing percentages. So even the accelerated growth of professionalism at the top hasn't taken the life out of the game. The up-and-coming younger stars have, as a rule, very wide repertoires, which is promising, and engage willingly in complicated fights. However, it's too early to say whether that will translate into low drawing percentages as they assume the ranks of the world's best. Perhaps faster time-controls will have their effect as well. I do think that courageous play will con- tinue to be rewarded, as it has for most of chess history. At the current time, I find that the most inter- esting opening play (and games, for that mat- ter) tends to come from the next couple of tiers of players. Most professionals below a certain world rank, perhaps 15-20, don't have enough invitations to support themselves, and so they play extensively in leagues, team events, and Swiss System tournaments. Under these cir- cumstances, a higher proportion of wins is nec- essary for success, and the 'hold as Black' philosophy is much less prominent. Thus, every month, we see an amazing array of openings used by extremely strong players (including those on their way up or down in the rankings). To be more precise, every major opening dis- cussed in this series gets tested in numerous subvariations, and even very minor openings are consistently represented at the level of mas- ters, albeit somewhat less as the competition stiffens. You can explore this on your own by downloading games from a number of promi- nent websites. Is this set of players using a wider variety of openings since, at 50-100 points below supergrandmaster levels, they can count on their opponents' less precise play? That is extremely unlikely, especially since theory is spread and devoured at outrageous speed these days, and every grandmaster has his own pre- pared ideas versus every opening. Then what's the difference? For one thing, a very limited number of openings are being played consis- tently by the highest-rated players at anyone time, because in exclusive tournaments they tend to dispute the latest fashionable openings. Nevertheless, those openings are changing on a regular basis, if sluggishly, as they have in ev- ery period of modem chess history, especially post-WWII. So the idea that openings are 'infe- rior' because they aren't consistently played at supertournaments is simply misguided. Right now the French Defence (the third most popu- lar e-pawn defence by quite a margin) is only played on a frequent basis by two of the world's top ten players, but I'd be surprised if anyone, with plenty of time on their hands, could show me how to get a forced advantage versus the French. Openings such as the Pirc Defence, the Dutch Defence and the King's Indian Defence are in good theoretical shape at the moment, and who can say that, objectively, they give Black a greater disadvantage than, say, any of a

310 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

number of Closed Ruy Lopez lines? Yet right at the moment you won't see them played much until you drop below the top ten. Even the most maligned of openings may ultimately equalize; out of the blue, for example, Carlsen and others began to play the Alekhine Defence with suc- cess, and a variety of lesser 1 e4 e5 variations appear to be perfectly sound. If you look at the actual theory as well as practice, it seems as though, played accurately, almost any major e- pawn or d-pawn defence will achieve a de facto equality at a certain point of the game. This leads to two main questions: how early does that ulti- mate equality express itself and, on a related note, how hard is it to reach a level game in over-the-board play? These are practical mat- ters. It would be great if we could evaluate openings these days by including a number or designation reflecting how difficult each open- ing is to handle! That degree of difficulty trans- lates directly into how likely it is that you'll make a mistake or, if not, run into time-pressure. It's not always important in practice whether you stand equal, or slightly better, or slightly worse in theory, if on every move you're con- fronted with problems that are especially hard to solve. I could probably make a good theoretical case for the objective equality of the Modem Benoni after many accurate moves. But the dif- ficulty of finding those moves is arguably much higher than finding the right moves in the Nimzo-Indian Defence or Queen's Gambit De- clined. Clearly, that will be reflected on the play- ers' clocks. From White's viewpoint, the same consideration applies: versus accurate play by Blaek, no opening is likely to give him a forced advantage in the long run. But the mainstream ones tend to retain some edge into the early middlegame, and continue to pose nontrivial problems for Black thereafter. I discussed this in Chapter 6, where I suggested that White's pref- erence for 'mainstream' openings such as the Ruy Lopez and Queen's Gambit over the Scotch Game or London System has more to do with the first two's ability to pose lasting difficulties than to any abstract theoretical superiority. But whether a certain opening tends to equal- ize more easily than another has limited rele- vance for the average player. In general, the words 'draw' and 'drawish' have become outra- geously overused. In middlegames with two vulnerable kings and a material imbalance, even grandmasters commentating live on websites will say 'The position is drawn now' , or 'draw- ish', although a 2700+ player then manages to lose it after errors by both players have given them alternately winning positions! One diffi- culty here is the reliance on computer assess- ments: a '-0.10', even if accurate, doesn't distinguish between easily drawn king-and- pawn endings and complex positions with a high probability of a decisive result. The other problem is the egoism of annotators and com- mentators, who want to show how easy chess is for them, and act as though they're shocked when great players make minor errors (some- times given '??' for dramatic effect) which re- sult in one side being able to win a complex position with perfect play. In view of this, imag- ine how far away from a draw you must be in the opening! Barring cases of a particular varia- tion or subvariation that leads to a draw by rep- etition, that should be your last worry. To be sure, aiming for complex and/or dynamic posi- tions in at least some of your games is generally good for your chess, but not for the sake of avoiding draws. You can confirm that by exam- ining the allegedly drawish symmetrical lines that I've written about in this series; they may seem dull, but they almost always afford real- istic winning chances. So be sceptical when someone tells you that one opening or another is 'drawish'; arguably, none are. Returning to high-level play, I think that the general positional character of the opening is a major determinant of its appeal. For example, throughout the history of chess, the best players have unquestionably preferred having positions with more space (that is, with control over more territory). Arguably, all of the World Cham- pions have been partial to space, excepting pos- sibly Steinitz and Petrosian at certain times during their careers. While modem masters have incorporated quite a few more restricted positions into their repertoires (for one thing, the Sicilian Defence is currently played in 20- 25% of all games), I'd say that this preference persists, albeit in diminished form. Quite apart from the objective worth of openings in which Black controls less space, they tend to be more difficult to play, at least for the majority of play- ers. Furthermore, in master play, there seems to

THE FUTURE OF OPENINGS 311

be a practical differentiation (if not a clear one) between defences involving fianchettoes and those without. The fonner, even when sound and objectively worthwhile, seem to require greater accuracy. The Modem Defence (l...g6) and l...b6 are the most obvious examples, and some grandmasters would say the same about the Modem Benoni and the King's Indian De- fence. Still, there are prominent exceptions; for example, the Queen's Indian Defence isn't usu- ally looked upon in this fashion, nor is the Grtinfeld; and the Sicilian Dragon rolls merrily along. So there are no hard-and-fast rules. And naturally, these considerations are much less meaningful at a lower level, where games are seldom decided upon the basis of territorial control. In fact, defending territory is often harder for the lower-level player than playing with less of it! Nevertheless, along the same lines, most strong players seem to have found that, in re- sponse to I e4, l...e5, the French Defence, and the Caro-Kann Defence are easier to handle in practice than most other systems. Both l...e5 and the French Defence establish an actual stake in the centre, and the Caro-Kann, while surrendering the centre by ... dxe4 in the main lines, opens the d-file and creates room for cen- tral piece activity. The latter is missing in most variations of the Sicilian, Pirc and Alekhine Defences, and that can make them more difficult to handle in practice. Perhaps as players be- come more proficient at managing positions with less space, variations involving spatial deficits will acquire a status of practical as well as theoretical equality. That is already the case with well-established variations of the Sicilian Defence which were looked upon unfavourably in earlier times. If this increased skilfulness proves to be the general case, a positive conse- quence would be the expansion of creative pos- sibilities in the opening. That is certainly the current trend, considering how many new early moves are suddenly becoming respectable. One happy side-effect already is that Internet play- ers and club players, who are experimenting constantly, have become important contribu- tors to the discovery process. As an amateur, you can have an independent say about opening theory and more importantly, feel free of its constraints. I won't need to convince most ac- tive players of this, certainly not my students and friends, who are both extending established lines and trying out new ones. How long will all this last? There's no way of telling. But I wouldn't argue with the con- tinuation of the current direction of events, particularly since the scope of opening theory has expanded steadily for 150 years. In any case, you should take advantage of the oppor- tunity to go in new directions with your own play. Index of Openings for Volume 4 Numbers refer to pages. Codes are from the ECO system. Misc.
