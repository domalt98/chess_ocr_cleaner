1. Where are the weaknesses?

2. Which is the worst-placed piece?

3. What is your opponents idea?

I have since used these questions in training with club players of average level (and below) and strong grandmasters. They are equally useful for all levels for a simple reason: Hie purpose of the three questions is to direct your focus Whether we are talking about a strong grandmaster with a great international reputation as a dangerous attacker or a junior with no reputation at all, both need to focus on the same things in order to make better decisions on the board. After all, the pieces move in the same way for everybody, even Kasparov (despite Bareev's claim to the contrary). We will look at the three questions one by one and look at positions in each section. But as always in my books, what I am looking for is not that you understand the theory, but that you can drive the vehicle. Theoretical comprehension is not enough; you need to be able to do it, before you can fully understand it. Hie difference between theory and practice is that in theory there is no difference, but in practice there inevitably is True knowledge is skill - all other types of knowledge are fakes. As an example, I am quite well- read in nutrition, but my severe addiction to chocolate meant that no one would ever have paid any attention to what I said, had I decided to lecture about it. (Now that I have rid myself of this addiction and look more like a man than a balloon again, I no longer feel any pressure to lecture. Funny that, but that is another story, of course.) So what I wish for you to get from this book is the practical ability to make better decisions at the board, so that you can play better moves. This on its own does not separate my approach from many others. What makes this book a bit different from most of the other books on the market is that the emphasis is on the decision, more than on the understanding behind it The prevailing view in Anglo-Saxon chess literature is that good chess comes from calculation, opening preparation and good intuition; the latter clearly being the factor dealing with positional judgement. This is a model that sums up the practice of already strong players in action. Those of us who focus more on general principles as a model for explaining chess and what is going on, are searching for a model that can replicate good play consistently. By breaking wins at the board down into a high number of small skills or principles, we feel that we can communicate and replicate the process that leads to strong moves at the board with a higher frequency. While the first model has a Western bias, the second used to have an East European bias. I would claim that the Soviet domination of chess in the 20th century would be a strong endorsement for the idea of a "classical chess education" with lots of general principles and division of chess skill into small chunks that can easily be explained. Modern examples of this are the books by Mark Dvoretsky and Artur Yusupov. But you do not have to agree with this stance in order to get the full benefit from this book. This book is not seeking to theorize chess, but to make it practical. And for those interested in the argument for general principles, I recommend reading Thinking Inside the Box, which is the theoretical arm of this project. My Intentions with this Book 9 To make chess practical we need to make it simple This is my number one teaching principle. This does not mean that the exercises cannot be painstakingly difficult for some people. Chess is like that - it is difficult to find the various connections in a position when we look at it, tactical, positional and otherwise. But once we know what the best move is, we cannot turn it off and somehow it is easy to understand. This is certainly one of my goals with the solutions written in this book: to give you exactly what you need to know to understand the position after you have struggled to solve it. Another goal is to make the process as simple as possible. You would think that it would be easy to remember three small questions, but experience tells me otherwise. And even if a pupil is able to remember the three questions, he is often unable to remember the bigger question, which should spark these three questions in his mind: What am I looking for in this position? Instead, most players and students will just start calculating. Calculation is a very important skill, but still, it's only one of the analysis tools available The purpose with the three questions is for you to look at the positions in front of you differently. I want you to start looking at the pawn and pieces differently. It is a process and there are a few things I want to state about this that might be obvious, but none the less are good to keep in mind (because have you noticed how often we do not pay attention to obvious things, despite being highly intelligent creatures?). In order to get the most out of this book I would like you to focus on style over speed. Please take the time to ask yourself the three questions, answer them out loud (or maybe even better, on paper) before you start applying the knowledge by looking for the best move. If you do this, you will soon see how focusing your mind on the three important parts of chess that these questions relate to, makes a big difference. Doing it right is more important than getting it right Please remember that although we want to solve the positions, what we are doing here is building your intuition, by repeating these questions to your subconscious so frequently that it will pay attention to these three aspects of chess and their nuances. What level is this book supposed to be aiming at? This book is a part of the Grandmaster Preparation series and therefore aims at developing the skills needed for grandmaster performance. However, the level of the chess is not extensively difficult in this book. The positions in Strategic Play are more elaborate and will probably be more suited for players over 2300. Having said this, some of the positions in this book do offer grandmasters a bit of resistance. One interesting experiment I did with a GM who at the time was rated 2625 or thereabouts, was to give him 12 of these positions and use half an hour on them. He scored 9/12. He did not want any feedback or help with his own play, so the knowledge that the three exercises he had failed at were quite similar from where I was standing did not impress him. However it does underline an important benefit you can get from this book, even if you have reached a high level of positional play already. Pay attention to the exercises you fail to solve As the exercises in this book to a great extent are constructed with the idea of there being a simple solution, failure to solve an exercise will give you important feedback about your own positional judgement. I would encourage you to write down the mistakes you make and when you repeat them (as we all do), note it down as well. In general I do not believe we pay enough attention to our mistakes if we keep the realization of them purely in our heads. Visualizing the Three Questions Throughout this book I shall use a simple graphical system to illustrate the three questions. I shall use circles to identify weaknesses and dotted circles to identify potential weaknesses. I shall use squares to identify the worst-placed pieces and dotted squares to identify pieces that might have problems later on. Finally, I shall use arrows to illustrate the opponents ideas and dotted lines to illustrate potential ideas that may lie far into the future. Let us look at an example. Hikaru Nakamura - Vladimir Kramnik Istanbul (ol) 2012

[diagram]
The circles indicate that c3 and g5 are immediate weaknesses, while it is easy to believe that the f6-square and the king will be weak later on (hence the dotted circles). Whites worst-placed piece is the bishop on g2, but because this is not especially relevant here, I have chosen not to give it a square. Black's pieces are all fighting for the "honour" of being worst-placed, so again I have chosen not to give a square to one (or all) of them, as it would just be confusing. Finally, Black's idea in this position definitely has to be ...h6 to protect his biggest weakness; hence the arrow. Obviously he has other ideas in the position - 99.9% of all positions will contain a multitude of ideas -but what we are looking for is the idea, the one that we should take most seriously. In fact, Black would have a decent position with reasonable compensation for the exchange if he had time to play a couple of useful moves, ...^c4 and ...h6. The latter can be prevented with a nice little move:

32.H6! Bxh6

Black cannot live with the white pawn placed here.

33.Qh5 Ng7 34.Rxg5 Nc6 35.Ng4±

White won on move 80 after various adventures on the way. Let us take another example. Anish Giri - Levon Aronian Istanbul (ol) 2012

[diagram]
The pawn on d4 is weak and the pawns on b2 and c5 are potential weaknesses later on. White is intending ftc3-e4-d6. Blacks worst piece by far is the bishop on c8 (and White's the knight on bl). All of this inspires Black to strike at the main weakness with a pawn sacrifice that opens up the position before White has managed to get his pieces out. From looking passive and about to be behind in development, Black becomes very active and solves the problems with his pawn structure that were making the c8-bishop bad. The pawn will be regained soon enough.

[diagram]
19.dxe5 Qe7 20.f4 Sd8! and it is hard for White to make progress. 20.5^c3 is possibly better,

but Black has solved all his problems and should be looking for a way to play for an advantage.

[diagram]
Stronger is 19...cxd5 followed by ...Qe7, when White would find the both c5-pawn and the b2-pawn to be unpleasantly weak.

20.dxc6 e4 21.cxb7 Jlxb7 22.c6 Jla6 23.Qb3?!

Passive play is not a good idea in a position like this, where your opponent seems to be holding all the trumps. Visualizing the Three Questions 13 It seems that 23.c7!? was better.
[diagram]
 After 23...Qe7 24.Qc6 e3 25.^hl exf2 26.5}c3 the position is desperately unclear.

23...Sc8l 24.Nc3 Sxc6 25.Nd5 lc5!+ 26j.fl f4 27.Nxf4 Axfif 28.<&hl Sb6 29.Hc2 e3

[diagram]
 Black's advantage is colossal and led to a victory on move 48.

[diagram]
The Three Questions in Action Please have a look at the following five positions for 5-10 minutes each and decide what you would do. Remember to ask yourself the following questions: 1) Where are the weaknesses? 2) Which is the worst-placed piece? 3) What is my opponent's idea?

[diagram]
These five positions all come from one of my own games. The game is in no way a pretty sight: two active players decided to use the other player's weaknesses by playing a technical game. While the game is lacking in the beauty of its ideas, it is rich in instructional potential. It is a game revolving around the basics and how things destabilize when the players make simple mistakes. I had played against Surya once before, in 2008 in the Spanish league. I had pleasant memories of this game, not least because I made my only draw in an otherwise abysmal five rounds. At the closing dinner my team captain expressed deep sympathy for my Vi/5 against five 2600+ grandmasters. He knew how it felt, having made the same score on Board Four. At the end of the evening I was fired with a toast, a handshake and the trophy for worst score as a souvenir. I was very pleased; it is maybe the prettiest of my trophies and no one checks the plaque anyway! Surya Shekhar Ganguly - Jacob Aagaard Helsingor 2010 l.d4!? I was expecting l.e4, which suits his style better. My plan was to aim for solidity.

1...6

Okay, missed solidity on move one. At the moment I am playing the Leningrad.

2.&B 3.g3

I recalled that the Leningrad sucks, so time for a change of heart.

3...e6 4.Ng2 d5

The Stonewall. I wrote a book on it in 2000 and updated it for the German edition in

2007. This is solid.

5.O-O JU6 6.c4 c6 7.Qfc2

I got a bit nervous. Surya might actually have done his homework - in this case I am about to play against my own creation, as White's only real try for an advantage at this point is probably to follow Grandmaster Repertoire 2: l.d4 - Volume Two by Boris Avrukh.

7...O-O

[diagram]
8.b3?!

This is what I call an aesthetic move. And that is not a compliment. To me, aesthetic moves are moves that look good, but are played without an idea. Obviously White is intending to put his bishop on b2; which is sort of what White usually does in this kind of position, right? The problem is, once you have put your bishop on b2 and your knight on d2, then what? These sort of "good-looking" moves without a plan are what aspiring players' games are full of until they learn to analyse a position through other prisms than "I go there and he goes there". The worrisome line starts with: 8.Nc3 Qe7

9.Rbl! with the idea of b4-b5 with lots of play

on the queenside. In this set-up the queen has a function on c2 - it protects the knight and plans to invade the c-file. It is not so easy for The Three Questions in Action 17 Black to continue with a sensible move and White is happy to follow up with at an opportune moment.

8...Qe7 9.Bb2

I took some time to look at the position and my opponent's body language. He did not look at home in the position (nor did he look nervous) and his set-up did not look threatening. Standard play would be 9...Ne4 followed by

10...b6 or ..Bd7-e8-h5. But his feeble set-up

inspired me to try a more ambitious plan I had seen in some of Artur Yusupov's games.

9...b5!? 10.Nbd2 a5

Black is seeking to dominate the queenside and get the bishop active on a6. Il.Ne5 a4 12.cxb5 Hilariously, the computer thinks White is a bit better after 12.Bad a3 13.J,al b4!.
[diagram]
 Ask the bishop on al what he really thinks about this evaluation!

12...a3

Here I offered a draw. I thought I was maybe already better, but I really had these warm feelings towards Surya because of this draw in

2008. I owed him. However, he did not want

to draw with me quickly again and decided to face the music.

[diagram]
13 J,cl cxb5 I4.Nd6

[diagram]
Here I was thinking: Just don't allow Bg5, just don't allow jkg5... The bishop is decreasing in value and White has a serious problem with the c3-square; especially once I play ...b5-b4. It would be moronic to let him prevent me from bringing a knight to e4. I4...b4? Okay, so I am a moron. It will now take forever to fight for the c3-square. This is how it goes; understanding what you need to do is not enough, you actually have to do it. Practice beats theory once again... I4...Ne4! 15.^,f4 b4

and either ...^,b7 or ...^,a6 leads to at least even chances for Black.

15.1g5!

Now there is a long way from b8 to c3. Against normal play it should be impossible to make it so far without being stopped, blocked or shot down; even if you are a fine prize- winning stallion.

19.Qxd3 5^a6

It might seem ridiculous, but the position is of such a slow nature that the knight is heading for c3. If it gets there, I will be okay.

20.e3 Sfc8 21 Jtfl 4k7

15..JU6 16.Sfcl 7

This move is explained by the realization that 16...Sc8? 17.Qxc8| is not best.

17 Axis gxfi6!?

This decision might look sound, but fracturing my pawn structure is a long-term annoyance. That's the negative. The positive is that it fights convincingly for the e5- square. I instinctively felt compelled to play this, because my development is lacking and because the rook would be misplaced on f6. Specifically I was worried about 17...Rxf6

18.e3! Bf8 19.ik,fl±, when White is able to

exchange the right bishops.

[diagram]
The position is only a bit better for White, but still felt uncomfortable. I think a different player might have avoided accepting the extra weakness, and been equally right to do so.

18.Nd3 Nxd3

18...Qe7!? 19.£k5 Mh5 was possible, but

again I was not happy with e2-e3 and "S,g2-fl.

[diagram]
22.Sc2?

This is the second moment where Black's strategy of choosing a mud-fight is rewarded. Black is planning ...^c7-e8-d6-e4-c3. White can of course stop this with f2-f3 when we get that far, but he would prefer not to commit his pawns in any way, and not to weaken his dark squares. Obviously I expected Surya to play f3 at some point, but here I really expected him to find

22.Nel! Be7 23.Qd2 Ne8 24.Nd3±

[diagram]
The Three Questions in Action 19 Here I cannot play ...ftd6 for a number of reasons. White can then start his regrouping and look forward to some active play. This is elementary positional play and, like me, he sort of understood it, but his thought process did not support him ending up playing it! A clear example of excessive calculation. 22 ...Be7?! Making space for the knight; however, the choice of square, at the beginning of time trouble, is wrong. I wanted to protect f6, which is too abstract. The option of playing ..Jkh6 is much more important, as I quickly realized. 22..Jkf8! is thus right.

23.Sacl Ne8 24.Nh4 Nd6

[diagram]
25.Ng2?

This was actually the move I expected, but it is a serious mistake. Obviously the knight is well-placed on f4, but we should not forget that the black knight is on its way to c3. This is the most important single aspect of the position and White should be very sure that the knight is not well placed on e4 before he allows it to go there. But as can be understood, we both missed that I could play 25...Ne4!.

[diagram]
We thought that 26.Qb5 was a major problem, but 26...Qxb5 27.Sxc8f Qe8! is equal. The power of the c3-square and the weakness of the a2-pawn are very important. As so often in chess, this is a positional mistake based on a tactical oversight. White can also try 26.^f4, but it is not a serious problem: 26...Rxc2 27.Sxc2 Qd7

28.Qb5!? (28.Ne2 Sc8) 28...Qxb5 29.Bxb5

Nf7

[diagram]
30Ae2 Nc3! 31.Qxc3 Rc8 and the ending is drawn. For this reason, it was time to play 25.f3 to keep a slight edge. The e3-pawn is weakened, but this is far less serious than the alternative.

25..Jfd7?

I understood the demands of the position; I was just in poor form. Practice over theory...

26.5}f4 Rxc2 27.Rxc2 Sc8

I would of course like to play 27...Ne4, but after 28.Qb5 Qxb5 29.Bxb5 Nf7 30j,d7 Ba6 I would not have time to play 31...Nc3. After

31.fce2 Sa7 32.Ac6! Bd6 333

[diagram]
White is a bit better. Thus I preferred to keep the queens on the board for the moment.

[diagram]
28.ffdl?

This is absolutely incredible. Who would have thought that a player of this level, who works for the world champion, would allow a knight to come from b8 to c3 in such a position?

28.f3± was perpetually better for White,

although it would of course not be so easy to actually win it.

28...Sxc2 29.Rxc2 Ne4 30.Nd3 Nc3

Yes! I made it. I sort of relaxed here, with very little time on the clock.

31.Ne2

White does not have any tactical options here. After 31.g4? Black will reply 31...Nd6! with the following lines:

[diagram]
32.Nh5 Qf7! and Black is already much better.

I will play ...<^>f8-e7, ...fxg4 and ...f5.

32.gxf5 jbcf4 33.exf4 Qg7t 34.^hl exf5

35 Jxf5 Qh6+ and White will not benefit a

lot from winning the h7-pawn; the queen and bishop are the wrong way around. However, the exchange of queens (h6-f4-f3-dl) would mean the immediate end of the game, as the a2-pawn falls.

[diagram]
31...51xe2t?

This does not make a lot of sense. I did not play ...5}b8-a6-c7-e8-d6-e4-c3 simply to exchange the knight and give away all of my counterplay.

31...Qc6 was a good deal better. I am not

aiming to do anything at all, except take back on c3 with the pawn. He of course will put the bishop on c2, but it will be sort of occupied, and the position is a dead draw.

32.Qxe2 IflB 33.&A Rc7 34.Ng2 Ad6

35JfB

35.. Jfg7?? 36.Nxf5!

Which instantly worked. Here I lost on time, unable to find a move. After 36...^f7

37.Qh5t Ne7 38.Qxh7 Qxh7 39.Nxh7 there

is no hope. For example: 39...f5 40.^g8! and the bishop is not trapped, but rather ideally placed. 1-0 Not pretty, but very instructive. Chess is far easier to understand than it is to play, so please do go through the exercises and get these simple things under control!
[diagram]
 4 3 2 l During the game and in the post mortem analysis, I was of the opinion that White had good chances to win this ending, and I managed to convince Surya and some other strong players. But a technically inclined player like Sabino Brunello was much better at evaluating this position than I. With precise defensive moves (with the queen) he proved that it was impossible for White to penetrate to the weaknesses on e6 and h7, and thus a not too difficult draw, had I only made it past the time control... So, Surya's belief during the game that the position was a draw was accurate, and it was entirely justified to simply play for tricks.

[diagram]
Chapter 1 Weaknesses Baskaran Adhiban - S.P. Sethuraman World U-16, VungTau 2008

[diagram]
White to play White has a lead in development; in return for this Black has the two bishops. White has several tempting options, but which one will allow him to fully exploit Black's weaknesses: his pawns, the king and the hook created by the pawn on f6? If I had to point to one part of positional chess that is essential, it would be having a reasonable understanding of weaknesses. When I went to a lecture by Mark Dvoretsky in 2000 I was already a reasonable player. My highest rating had been 2445 and I had been one game away from a grandmaster norm. Still, looking back to some discussions he had there, it was clear that I had the energy of a young man and decent tactical skills, but no understanding of weaknesses and the consequences of them. If you fear this might be you, then hopefully this book will be fantastic for you. Obviously we are not starting from scratch, but if you have reached a level where you think a book called "Grandmaster Preparation" might work for you, maybe what you need is to get some practical dimensions added to your understanding of weaknesses. Before we go through the basic forms of weaknesses like a firestorm, I would like to share a simple game where the result is decided by small weaknesses escalating over time. What I intend to show with this game is how simple the positional aspects really are - and how difficult they are to handle. Aronian does not make any obvious positional mistakes. What happens is that he takes a few liberties to make the game a bit more lively (7...g6), then he finds himself in a slightly unpleasant position and needs to find a way to solve his problems. This is not so easy and in the end it all falls down because of a tactical oversight. But the beginning of all the problems came from the weakening of the queenside (6...a6), which was fully justified, but came with some obligations. These increased until eventually Black had more problems than he could handle. Vladimir Kramnik - Levon Aronian Istanbul (ol) 2012 l.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3&c3 4.cxd5 This game was played on Board One in the Olympiad between the two favourites and later joint winners (with Armenia taking gold on tie-break). Kramnik seems to think that a 2-2 result would not be a disaster and that Russia are favourites on the last three boards. In reality the 2-2 was only achieved by Kramnik's win in this game, but the players had no way of knowing this at this point.

4...cxd5 5 Jkf4 Nc6 6.e3 a6 7.M,d3

[diagram]
7... g6

A bit too creative for my taste. The bishop is just not well placed on g7 in this system, where it can only come alive if Black plays ...e5 later on. The plus side is of course that this move prepares the exchange of the light- squared bishops. 7..Jtg4 is the main line with a sound score here. I do not follow the theory, but nor do I think that Kramnik had anything seriously venomous ready here.

8.h3

Kramnik clearly wants to put the knight on f3 without allowing ..Bg4. Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 25

8...1B 9.&B

I wonder if Aronian was intending to play

9.ibcf5 gxf5 10.^f3 Bg8!? and leave the king

in the centre? This is the only reason I can find for taking on d3 on the next move - barring indecision. I am not sure this would be fully sound, but in any case I already prefer White ever so slightly.

9.. Jbtd3

9...^g7 10Jbcf5 gxf5 would not give Black

control of the g-file immediately, but ...O-O, ...^hS and ...Rg8 could be considered. However, I am not sure Kramnik would have taken on f5. 10Jfxd3 Bg7 11.O-O O-O 12.Sfcl e6 It is fair to say that the opening is over. The minor pieces are out and the kings are safe. A long-term strategy for the middlegame should be devised. To be able to do so successfully, we need to take into consideration the weaknesses in the position. Despite some artificial debate relating to the e4- and e5-squares, it is my opinion that the real weaknesses are the following:

[diagram]
The reason for the c7-square being weak and not the c2-square is obvious - the bishop on f4 and the slight lead in development White possesses. Also, the c5-square is weaker than the c4-square, simply because White can get there faster. The b2-pawn is undefended, but it is not easy for Black to deliver a serious attack on it at the moment. The b6-square is slightly weakened by the advance of the a-pawn, but it is not high on our current list of priorities, even if it does come into play in some variations. Whites plan is to aim at the b7- and c7-weaknesses by moving his pieces in that direction.

13.Na4 $Se4 14.4&c5 5}xc5 15.Sxc5

[diagram]
White might not have an advantage, but his position is visibly more active. He arrives first to the c-file and his minor pieces are well placed. At the moment the only real weakness in the black position is the c7-square, but there is also the b7/a6-constellation, which it is terribly difficult for Black to deal with.

15..Jfd7

Black is preparing to fight for the c-file.

15...Qb6 would threaten the trick ...e5!, but

White has 16.@c2!±.

16.Bad Sfc8

The first phase of the mobilization has ended. Now White needs to pay attention to the idea of ...J,f8 followed by ...Nb4.

17.a3! 18.S5c2

[diagram]
18...K

In the press conference right after the game, Kramnik said that maybe this move was partly to blame for Blacks downfall. I think this is too harsh. Certainly this move (intended to reinforce the e5-square) weakens the pawn on e6, adding some responsibilities for Black. However, the benefits are worth it. These extra responsibilities needed to be dealt with rapidly and with accuracy; and it seems that Black did not find the right way to do so in the game. This is always the case with positions that are under a bit of pressure. You need to play accurately at some moments, and if you don't, your position can rapidly become worse and worse.

18...^,d6 was an alternative.

[diagram]
In this case we see that the b6-square is a weakness, and Black is under a bit of pressure after 19.Jbcd6 Qxd6 20.Qb3! Sab8 (20...b5 21.Sc5 Ne7 22.Qc3± is also unpleasant) 21.Qb6±.
[diagram]
 Can Black hold after 21...Qc7 or 21...Qd8, you might ask? I would think so, but the pressure would continue. White has ideas like Qf3-e5-d3, waiting for the right moment to jump to c5. Black is never fully forgiven for playing ...a6 early on!

19.Nd2

[diagram]
This move works poorly in combination with ...f6. Black's positional problems required a more radical solution, which he might not have felt entirely happy with during the game

[diagram]
Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 27 - or dare I suggest - he may not even have seen. The right way to play was to fight for the c-file immediately, like a boxer attacking with his head first: 19...5W!! If Black has time to play ...Rxc2, he will be fine. So the only danger is

20.Rc7 Qe8.

[diagram]
 But White has no strong follow-up. Black will play ...Nb5 on almost anything, with or without taking on c7 first. For example:

21.£}b3 ftb5 22.87c2 Rxc2 23.Qxc2 £}d6

and Black has managed to coordinate his pieces and defend his weaknesses successfully.

20.ilxd613fxd6 21.5}b3

We can see how the exchange of the dark- squared bishops has increased the weakness of the dark squares in the black position. Black has to do something about this quickly.

[diagram]
21...Ec7?

Quite a natural move, which would have been successful had White not had a tactical way to punish it. It is understandable that Aronian did not want to play 21...b6, when you look at the way it weakens the a6- pawn and in the case of a later ...a5, the b5- square. However, the prospect of the white knight coming in to pressurize the a6/b7/c6- constellation should have spooked him. White is still better of course, but the advantage is long-term and only small. White can play something like 22.£}d2± and then try to create further weaknesses elsewhere on the board.

22.Na5! Sac8

This is probably a bit naive of Black. He may have been expecting White to take a zillion times on c6 and then shake hands at move 30.

22...Qd7 was necessary, but after something

like 23.Sc5 Sac8 24.Qc3± White's advantage is serious. We have reached a typical moment in chess strategy. White has mobilized all of his forces. It is time to look for a revolution (a violent change of the status quo) as he is perfectly placed for it. If it does not exist, he will have to manoeuvre and try to outplay his opponent slowly. But if it exists, it is most likely to exist right here, right now.

[diagram]
23.Nxb711 Sxb7 24.Qxa6 Sbc7 25.b4

Black is tied up completely.

25...Qd7 26.Qb6!

Accurate, although White should also win after 26.b5 ^e7 27.Sxc7 Sxc7 28.Sxc7 Rxc7

29.Qxe6t ^g7 30.a4 with best play. This line

indicates that Aronian failed to see the knight sacrifice completely (and thus was expecting the game to just end in a draw), as he would never have allowed this either, had he seen it. And there is no subtlety to miss in this line at all.

26..Jfe8

Black is just lost.

26...Qd6 is best met with 27.Rc3! followed by

b4-b5.

26...6.7 is objectively best according to my

PC, but Black will not hold a draw after: 27.b5 Sb7
[diagram]
28.Qxc6! Qxc6 29.Hxc6 Rxc6 30.bxc6

White will break through on the kingside while pushing the two pawns forward on the queenside to distract his opponent. Still, Black could have tried this, with the idea of e7-d8 and then ...Ha7 - but it should never ever work.

1-0 Everyone knows what a weakness is, but it is not so easy to define. My attempt at a definition would be: A square of importance, which is poorly defended (if at all), and which can be exploited. This square can be unoccupied, or occupied by a pawn or piece.

[diagram]
27.b5

Forcing a win. Let us look at some examples of this. Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 29 Alexander Grischuk - Dimitrios Mastrovasilis Istanbul (ol) 2012

[diagram]
The c5-pawn is a serious weakness in the black position, and after 35.^e3! Black was in trouble. The pawns on a7, c6, f5 and h7 are also a bit weak, but in reality they are much harder to attack and therefore of less importance. And that is what is important about weaknesses - the ease or difficulty of defending them in the short term and in the long term. Pawns In the next example we see Kramnik in a different scenario; this time he is under pressure. His way to deal with it is, however, rather unfortunate. He tries to get active, at the cost of weakening his pawns on the queenside. Unfortunately, because of the long-term weakness of his kingside, eventually it becomes clear that this is a very dangerous strategy. What I want you to pay attention to is the combination of short-term and long-term pawn weaknesses and how they affect each other; and how together they create extra problems. Vladimir Kramnik - Vassily Ivanchuk Istanbul (ol) 2012

[diagram]
White came out of the opening in poor but not desperate shape. He has a weak square on d3 and is under pressure down the long diagonal. We also see that the pawns on e4 and h4 are seriously limiting the white pawns, leading f2 and g2 to be long-term weaknesses. But the big problem at the moment is that Black is planning to exploit the hook (more about this later) on b3 to open up the a-file to come in and attack f2, which can easily become weak; and indeed this is what happened in the game. White needs to solve these issues, and preferably sooner rather than later. He could try 23.&fl simply to improve the king, although there are some moves that would give White problems.

23.Na4?

Kramnik certainly had a tactical idea behind this move. The problem is that the weakening of the a-pawns is considerable and no amount of calculation can make up for this subsequently. So why did Kramnik play this? Did he go insanely deep and decide that he could draw the ending? Or more realistically, did he have a bad day and overlook something? I believe the latter.

23.i^a3 would not fully work: 23...£}xb3

24.^xe4 £}a5 25.c5 Qc4 26.Sd3 Jke5?

So for this reason 23.Sdl!? is a decent move. The main point behind this move is that the rook is no longer in the way of J,a3xf8. The idea is that after 23...a5 White can play

24..1,a3! Jbcc3 25 Jbcc5 with full equality.

Thus 23...Nfe6 seems to be the strongest option. Black is certainly a little more comfortable after 24.£}xe6 Nxe6 25.^a4 ibcb2 26.£}xb2 ^f8?. Black has more space and White will have to use a few moves to bring the knight back into the game.

23.Ndl is better than the game, if nothing

else. After 23..Jkxb2 24.Nxb2 a5? we have a position that Ivanchuk could have chosen in the game (after 23.Na4 Jbtb2 White could not play 24.ftxc5? "i,a3!). I guess that Kramnik wanted his knight to be on a4 in other lines, but the value of this is seriously in doubt.

23...4}xa4 24.ilxg7 Nxg7 25.bxa4 Se8

[diagram]
26.a5

I think this is the best option. Kramnik had probably found that there was something

[diagram]
wrong with what he had intended, and decided to go for a dangerous, though not hopeless, ending.

26.^fl

This was the alternative. Best play might look something like this:

26...Se5 27.Ne2 Sc5 28.Sd4 f5

[diagram]
Black is threatening ...Nf6 followed by ...£}e6, when he would win a pawn, so White has to act immediately.

29.f3exf3 30.gxf3g5 31.f4

Forced again, to avoid ...Nf6 and ...fte6.

31...6e6 32.Sd6 Nf7 33.Sd7t

33.fxg5 Ne7 34.Hd2 £}xg5+ looks very

dangerous.

34.Rc6 thd7 35.Hc7 Ne5 does not save the

34...Rxc4 35.&gl

In Chess Today, Alexander Baburin called this a "winnable ending". I am not entirely certain about this, but it is clear that Black is very close to the full point with his extra pawn. In the end Ivanchuk could not find a plan to create the greatest difficulties for his opponent, and the game was drawn on move 77. The next example is also somewhat dynamic, but then most high-level chess is. It illustrates the weakness of the c5-pawn in combination with the weakening of the b6- and e6-squares, created by the advance of the pawns (once again those moves had good functions; all moves will weaken the control over at least one square). Baskaran Adhiban - S.P. Sethuraman World U-16, VungTau 2008

[diagram]
Black has the two bishops, but has paid a high price for them. His knight is still stuck on g8 and his c-pawn is weak. It was these factors that inspired White to go for a creative idea based on attacking the c5-pawn as well as exploiting the weakened squares discussed above. Il.Na4!? c4 12.Nb6 White is continuing with his idea. 12.Nc5= was also reasonable.

12...Sd8 13.Nd4!

[diagram]
This was the point. Everything is hanging and Black has problems defending the c4- pawn. This loses a pawn without a fight; there was only one way to battle on.

[diagram]
Black wins an important tempo, making it possible to take the knight on b6 and save the pawn on c4. I4.f3 cxb6 15.fxg4 j^,c5! This pin is essential to slow White down.

16.Nf5

This is the only consistent move, although Black is also fighting for equality after I6.c3 b5 17.Nc2Ne7 18.g5±.

16...jbce3t 17.Nxe3 b5 18.£}f5

[diagram]
 White's position is apparently overwhelming, but if you look at the basic elements (the worst-placed piece is the g8-knight, the g4- pawn is weak and White is planning to win a pawn) we can see that Black can fight back with an active move:

18...fth6! 19.Sxd8t

White goes for a better rook ending. Black would also have reasonable drawing chances after 19.£}xg7t 20.^h5 ^xg4

21.Sdfl Sd6±.

^...^xdS 20.Hdlt Nc7 21.^xh6 gxh6 22.h3 Sg8 23.Sd2!±

Once again exploiting the overloading of the c7-pawn. This time Black is thoroughly forked.

I4...fth6 does not work here. Simplest is probably 15.^xg7t Ne7 I6.^d5t ibcd5

17.Bxd5 £"g4 18.Nf5t 7 19.Shdl and the

extra pawn should be enough.

15.^xg7t

15.^xd6t cxd6 \6.kf4 would have won a

pawn, but White did not want to exchange knights after I6...Nc8!?, when there might later be technical difficulties because of the opposite-coloured bishops.

Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 33

15...Nf8 16.iLh6 Ng8 17.Na4±

[diagram]
White won on move 38. Squares We have already touched a little on weakened squares with the above example. The main difference between weak pawns and weak squares (looking beyond the price tag here) is probably that weakened pawns are generally static in nature, while weakened squares usually create dynamic possibilities. This is well illustrated in the following example: Peter Heine Nielsen - Alexander Areshchenko Germany 2011

[diagram]
White has succeeded greatly on the queenside, while Black has not established more than a threat to f2 on the kingside. If White now had played 29.f3!, he would have left Black with great problems and more or less no counterplay; the g3-pawn is slightly weakened, but this is in the long term as there is no quick way to get to it. Instead he weakened the f3-square (as well as the d3- pawn) in his efforts to defend f2, giving Black the counterplay necessary to survive. Moving the f-pawn might at first feel a bit artificial, but once you start looking at it seriously, it becomes very attractive. Therefore I suspect that Peter did not seriously look at this non-standard move. If he had, he probably would have played it. Chess is like that sometimes, you decide to save time for later decisions (unless you have already spent it on prior ones), not suspecting that this was the right moment. Getting better at understanding when we have to make a serious choice is one of the most elusive, but at the same time most important, skills for a strong chess player to develop.

29.e4? W(5l

There is an immediate threat to the d3-pawn.

[diagram]
30.1el

After 30.Qd2?! Black has a fantastic idea:

30...Sf7!! (Instead, 30...^xb6 31.Baxb6 Sxb6

32.Sxb6 Sd8 33.Sb7! offers White enough

counterplay to draw, although even this might have been disappointing for him after being so much better.)
[diagram]
 Black's idea is either ...?}f8-e6-g5 with a strong attack, or taking twice on b6 and playing ...Sd7.

30...Nxb6 31.Sbxb6 Hxb6

[diagram]
32.Sxb6?

It was essential to force the exchange of rooks in order to survive. 32.Qxb6 Bf6 33.Qa7 Sxa6

34.Qxa6 Qxd3 35.Qb5 would have been the

right way to play, as after 35...Qxe4 36.Nd2 White can still hold the balance. We could look at this conceptually and say

[diagram]
that the f2-pawn and the white king are only weak if the rooks remain on the board. Without them the white bishop has more potential and White will make the draw. But this is rationalizing after the fact; something that is really useful to do when we analyse games - to develop our understanding/intuition - but not of much help when you have a few minutes to choose between two seemingly unattractive options.

32.. Jfxd3 33.Sb7?!

A better chance to defend would have been

33.Qbl Qxc4 34.5=?b7?, but once things start

going against you, it is very hard to find the best chances.

33...Qxe4+

Black is in full control. He won on move 55. The next example is really interesting when it comes to discussing the weakness of squares and to what extent this can help you find the right plan. Garry Kasparov - Francisco Vallejo Pons Linares 2004

[diagram]
There are a few weaknesses in the black position (and an obvious weakness on d5 Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 35 in the white position). The weakness of the constellation b6/c5/d6 is in my opinion rather obvious, but of course there is also the slight weakening of the black kingside through the ...h7-h6 advance. I seriously doubt whether I would have believed the latter to be the more important before I saw this game, but reading Dokhoian's variations (the words below are mine, the lines his) in New in Chess Magazine actually convinced me that this was the case. 22Jfcl Dokhoian was full of praise for this move. The idea is quite stunning - White spends time rearranging his queen and light-squared bishop to give the duo a bit more bite. As things transpire in the game, it seems as if Black cannot get his defence organized in time.

22...bxc5 23.1b 1 Ra7

23...^,f6? 24.Qc2 g6 might look like a

natural way to defend against the threat of mate. But once again we see the effect of the slight weakening of the kingside by the initial advance of the h-pawn. The e6/f7/g6- constellation sorely lacks the support of the h-pawn.

[diagram]
White strikes with 25.Rxe6!, when Black's various options do not work. He cannot accept the sacrifice as White brings in reinforcements after the initial checks (as always, the concept of evolution/revolution/evolution must be understood in order to play attacking chess) with Nh4-g6. So, if Black is not to end up with a pawn less, he needs to try 25...cxd4. Here White establishes his superiority with:

26.Bd6 Qa7 27.Nxd4 ge8 28.Sxe8t Sxe8

29.Nf5!±

24 JTc2 fof6 25.Ne5 Sd5

The white knight is obviously heading for g4, but this is not the only bad thing that can happen to the black position. Knights can go backwards, but in the hands of great attackers, they usually go forwards:

25...Nf8

[diagram]
26.ftxf7! Nxf7 27.Qg6t Nf8

The king has to retreat to this square to support the bishop. After 27...^8 28.Sxe6 Black can only resign. White has ideas with jbcc5 followed by Sxf6, with mate. Also Sdel is on the way.

[diagram]
28.Bf5!! Ba6

If Black were to accept this second sacrifice, he would find that after 28...exf5 29.Sxe7 ^xe7, White does not rush to take on c5, but plays more brutally with 30.@xg7t Ne6 31.Selt ^e4 32Jkxc5, with a winning attack.

29.Jbce6 Jkd6 30.dxc5 Mb8 31 Jkb2

Black has not succumbed immediately, but he will not last forever either.

25...^,d6 also fails to solve all of Blacks

problems, but maybe it was the lesser evil. White can play 26.£k4 M,e7 27.Jbcc5 ibcc5

28.dxc5 Qxc5 29.^d6±.

But he can also be more adventurous:

26.Nxf7!? Nxf7 27.Qg6t Nf8 28.Sxe6 Ba6

29.Sxf6t gxf6

[diagram]
30.j^cl! Again the revolution/evolution thing!

26.Ng4 SB 27.5ixft>t gxft>

Forced. 27..Jbcf6 is refuted by 28.g4 and 29ikxc5.

28.h4!?

White still has a considerable advantage after this move, but as Dokhoian points out, White had a convincing and direct way to end the game in: 28.g4! Sg5 29.Qh7t &f<8

[diagram]
30.Bf5!! Bd6 (30...exf5 31.Sxe7) 31 JTxh6t

Sg7 32.Rxe6 6ce6 33.Jbce6 and wins. In addition to this, engines now point out the more brutal and less intuitive 28.Bxe6! fxe6 29.Qe2!. Black seems unable to defend himself, even with an extra rook; the position of the pieces on the queenside is too poor. A possible line is 29. ..Nf8 30.@xe6 Rg5 31 Jbcc5 Bxc5 32.Qxf6t Ng8 33.Qe6t Nf8 34.dxc5 and there is no real defence against the rook coming to d7. In the game Black had some chances to defend a little better, for example by putting the king on f8 rather than h8.

1-0 Does this mean that our first impressions were wrong? I believed so initially and gave the position to Sabino Brunello to solve, telling him that it was "special". However, he did not find anything special about it, but rather emphasized the weakness of the b6/c5/d6- constellation.

22.Nd2

[diagram]
In order to take advantage of the weak squares, Sabino transfers the most inactive piece towards squares where it can control two of them, either e4 (c5/d6) or c4 (b6/d6).

22...bxc5

This feels like a good test of Whites plan, and as this was the move Vallejo played in the game, I decided that this should be the right way of dealing with my positionally-inclined student's reluctance to play for mate. But this weakens the b6-square and thus allows White to demonstrate his advantage.

23.Nc4 Nd7 24Jfc3 Bf8

24...bxc5 25.Qxa5 is also good for White.

The c5-pawn is immune due to Nb6 tricks. White now has a considerable number of options, all of them leaving Black in big trouble. Another reasonable move is:

22..MG

Maybe, at the end of the day, Black would be relatively better off after 22...b5±, although this would leave him with various positional defects. A logical way of continuing is: 23.J,cl la6 24.Nf3 Ifb7

[diagram]
25.Qe2! Sa8 26.Ne5 Nxe5 27.Qxe5 b4

23.Ne4 fo(6

23..Jkf8 24.dxc5 is awful for Black.

24.jbcc5 Rc7 25Jxe7 Qxe7 26.5} c5

[diagram]
White has a great advantage; it is very difficult for Black to get rid of the knight from c5 and the c6- and a5-pawns are perpetual problems. I agreed that White's play was indeed quite convincing at this point. Returning to the game continuation, I realized that Black's 23rd move was rather artificial. What is the queen meant to be doing on a7? Dokhoian does not discuss the natural

23. ..£ff6!, when the knight immediately

defends the h7-square, as well as clearing the way for the other pieces.
[diagram]
 White cannot attack in the same way as in the game. Black will play ...jhd6 after putting the rook on d5, and compared to the game the black king will have an escape square on e7, eliminating the Ng4-ideas. And if White tries to occupy the dark squares on the queenside he will find that he has wasted important time. After something like

24.jbcc5 ikxc5 25.dxc5 Jka6 White's advantage

is less dramatic, if it is there at all. The knight will not make it to d6, as it did in Sabino's variation. So, although Kasparov's play was majestic indeed, his 22nd move was probably more interesting than great. A plan based on taking advantage of the biggest weaknesses was objectively more justified. Hooks The concept of hooks is something that even some grandmasters have not come across, but which still constitutes an important part of the understanding of what a weakness is.

[diagram]
Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 39 A hook is a pawn, usually advanced, which can be challenged. An example is the Kramnik - Ivanchuk game from above.

[diagram]
By advancing his a-pawn, Black will be able to create a weakness out of the b3-pawn. Taking on a4 would not reduce this effect. As another example, here is a more tactical situation, in which the hook is the h6-pawn. Heiner Matthias - Davit Shengelia Germany 2005

[diagram]
White has no advantage whatsoever. The weakness of the d6-pawn is not detrimental and is easily balanced by the possibility of counterplay with ...d5 and down the c-file. On the other hand, White has no reason to be worse either. He is fairly active and Black has no obvious way to bring his knight to c3. There is one other defect in the black position, the advanced h-pawn. This has the advantage of providing the king with an escape route, in the event of a revolt, but has at the same time weakened the foundations of his castle. In the game, White was successful in exploiting this in classic style.

28.g4 Rc5 29.Nb5 Sac6 30.Scl Sb8?!

This seems a bit planless; Black is not realistically going to sacrifice on b5. Shengelia was probably looking for a way to complicate matters, in order to outplay his lower-rated opponent.

30...d5 was sensible. Black is not worse.

[diagram]
31.h4!±

White takes a serious step forward towards exploiting the h6-hook. We can now see that the pawn would have been better on h7 as things have turned out. As always, the problem is not that Black played ...h6 once upon a time, but that he did not meet the challenges that followed from there.

31...%3 32.Sd3 Sbb6?!

This is a bit artificial. Better was 32...fte8±, when Black can consider taking the h4-pawn, if allowed.

Blacks kingside has been slightly weakened by the exchange of his h-pawn for the white e-pawn. After the advance of the white h-pawn, Black will have significant problems with his structure, which would not be the case if the pawn was still on g7.

I would guess that Giorgadze failed to see this option simply because the idea of leaving the white rook unchallenged on the 7th rank seemed dangerous. And certainly it is dangerous, but the dangers connected with doing nothing are considerable too.

34.S7a6!

With this move, White keeps control over the a-file, leaves Black with the poorly-placed rook on e7 and delays/p revents the bishop on f6 making it to b6 in the (near) future.

34...Qd7 35.&fl±

35.ibcf5!? was perhaps stronger at this point.

Black would have more difficulties defending the pawn on f5 than he would have on g6. But Adams prefers to keep the control that comes with having a good knight against a bad bishop.

35...5.7 36.Ng3 Be7

36..JUi4 is refuted by 37.J,xf5 gxf5 38.Ba7!

Sfxa7 39.Hxa7 Hxa7 40.Qxf5, and next the queen comes in to finish off the weakened black king.

36.. Jbce4 37.£"xe4 jke7 was probably the best

chance, but this is of course quite desperate.

37.Sa7 Sb7

A final small tactical mistake in a bad position.

37...Qc8 was necessary. However, White has a

great advantage after 38.Qd2, while it is even stronger to force matters with 38.jbcf5 gxf5

winning attack.

1-0 Let's now return to a position from earlier in the chapter. Baskaran Adhiban - S.P. Sethuraman World U-16, VungTau 2008

[diagram]
This time around we shall concentrate a bit more on the weak king in the centre (despite the exchange of queens, the king is still unsafe), and the hook that the pawn on f6 represents. Looking at these we can see that there is a much more aggressive continuation: 11 .e5!! fice5 The computer recommends that Black should play ll..Jbce5 12.£}xe5 fxe5, when after 13.Jbcc5 it has no real defence against Shelxe5 (or f2-f4xe5). Maybe this is Black's best option, but in that case White's strategy is definitely right!

12.^e4

With the idea of ikxc5 should Black defend the bishop, which would lead to a quick deterioration of the black position.

12...Be7 13.ftxe5

[diagram]
 Black is still struggling desperately with his development. The next moves are likely to be Shel and jkf4, after which it will be very difficult for Black to avoid losing something. King's position We all play for mate; some just do it in a more indirect way than others - Peter Heine Nielsen We have a tendency to focus on static factors when we talk about positional play, but we must not neglect dynamic factors. The safety of the king is always a factor, and when we talk about weaknesses it would make no sense not to include weaknesses around the king.

[diagram]
Take the following example: N.N. - Finn Nohr Aarhus 1992

[diagram]
White is of course unpleasantly pinned on f2, which makes the defence of the g2-square more difficult. In a chaotic position like this, with pins from d4 to gl and e2 to a2, an X-ray from c8 to g4, and where Black has sacrificed material, it is hard to think about positional factors; but they are still there. In this case the weakest square in the vicinity of the white king is not h2, although that is the least defended square, because we also need to take into account the potential of the attacking pieces. Here only the black queen can reasonably reach h2. On the other hand, all of the black pieces can attack the g2-square, and on top of this the bishop on d4 is tying White down and eliminating the planned defence along the second rank. Black managed to exploit this quite beautifully in the game. l..Jfc6!! Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 43

[diagram]
The weakness of the g2-square suddenly becomes very pressing. Black is threatening ...Ne3.

2.Qg5

2.Qxe2 £}h4! with mate on the way, is the

nice point to Black's combination.

2...*g7

0-1 There was actually a less natural but equally good way of winning the game. I...Qb7!! would have the same main point and threats, but after 2.Qg5 an additional way to win the game exists:

[diagram]
2.. Jbcf2t 3.Sxf2 Qblf Black exploits that the

rook on a2 is unprotected. Although spectacular, this example was not conceptually challenging in any way. The next one is a bit more complex. Ivan Cheparinov - Stelios Halkias Helsingor 2012

[diagram]
While it may not be realistic to expect White's attack to be successful against the best defence, it is possible to use the weakness of the h7-pawn (only defended by the king, who does not really count) and the long-term weakness of the a7-pawn to create serious threats. In the game White focused exclusively on the queenside and had only a modest advantage:

32 J.c6?!± Nh8 33.Rh5 Qb4 34.Q6 Nd7

35Jfe6 Nfi> 36.Rd8 h6 37.Rxf8f Qxf8

38.Qd6 W£7 39.Rd2 Se7 40.Qd8t *h7

4l.Qd3t Vl-Vl The correct continuation, on the basis of the weaknesses mentioned, would have been:

32.!c2!

This would have created the strong threat of

33.Qc4t Ng8 34.Qh4 h6 35.Sd8.

[diagram]
White is winning on account of 35...Sc8

36.Rxf8 Rxf8 37.Qe7! Qc8 38.Sd6! and

there is no defence against 5=?xh6.

32.1b 1?! is a weaker version of this idea, as

there will be checks on el to look out for, as well as the knight coming to c3. The bishop is simply not well placed here.

32...Qe8

An undesirable move, but unfortunately also the only move.

So remember to take notice of the weakness of your own and the opponents kings position. Creating weaknesses Accountancy - this is what a friend of mine calls a certain style of chess, one to which he subscribes personally. What he specifically likes to do is to create and fix weaknesses in his opponents' positions, manoeuvre around a bit, and eventually win something. We do not have to play like this of course, but it makes lots of sense to create a weakness and then exploit it later on. Here are two examples of the creation of weaknesses. Magnus Carlsen - Boris Gelfand Moscow 2006

[diagram]
12..Jfd5!

This creates a weakness on the dark squares in the constellation f2/e3/d4. While this is by no means decisive, it still causes problems that White must pay attention to for a long time.

13.6 Qa5 I4.Bg2 c5!

Black puts extra pressure on the weakened dark squares.

15.dxc5 16.O-O O-O

Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 45 Black was slightly better and won the game on move 38. In the next example it is clear that White is better, but he can improve his position considerably by weakening the opponent's structure. Ruslan Ponomariov - Viktor Korchnoi Donetsk (3) 2001

[diagram]
White has a fine position with a good knight against a very bad bishop, though it is not obvious that this is enough to win. With his next move he provokes a weakening in the black king's position that soon leads to further problems for Black. Although the attack may not be decisive, it will demand much of Black's attention, meaning that he will find it difficult to defend other aspects of his position, such as the queenside. 27Jfd4!

27.Nd4 Hf6 28.Qd2± is less clear.

27...g6

A painful move to play, but what else should Black do? After 27..Jkg6? 28.Nh4 it is already time to consider resignation. And after 27.. J,e6 28.Sel Re8 29.a3± Black is in a bad way.

28 Jfd2 Se8 29.Nd4 Sfe5

The most active move. After both 29...Rh5

30.Scl± and 29...Sf6 30.Scl±, White would

be able to put pressure on the queenside more or less undisturbed.
[diagram]
30.f4!

White is able to exploit the weakening of the black kingside with this pawn advance.

32Jfh6Qe7 The only move; 32...Sg8 33.Nf3! and White wins.

33.&B Sfffi 34Jfg5 Qg7 35.f6?!

This succeeds in the long term, but in the shorter term it blocks the open files that White is attacking along. 35.fxg6 jbcg6 (35...Qxg6

36.Qcl! and White wins material) 36.@xd5

Qxb2 37.Qxd6± with an extra pawn was stronger.

35..JNB 36.Scl H6 37Jfd2 g5?

1-0 Fixing weaknesses Usually when we talk about fixing weaknesses, it refers to a situation like this:

[diagram]
White moves the a-pawn to a5, in order to fix the weakness on b7 and create a long-term issue with the a6-pawn as well. In the following example, the weakness is fixed through constant pressure on it, and then devoured! Boris Spassky - Jan Hein Donner Leiden 1970

[diagram]
Black has a weak pawn on e6, but at the moment it seems that it can be protected without any significant concessions. However, the weakness is all the way down the a2- g8 diagonal and White can make use of this by transferring his bishop. As a result, Black will find it very difficult to ever get rid of the weakness.

21.&fl!±

The bishop is strong at h3, but on c4 it has the potential to be deadly.

21...Sd6

Black could have tried 21...<^>h8 22.jLc4 Qd7 23.Qe3 He8, which would have solved one big problem. But White would get free rein to advance his pawns on the kingside and probably win the game in a brutal attack. Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 47

21...a5!? would make some sense, planning to

advance his pawns and at the same time kick the white bishop. However, after 22.jk.c4 b5

23.1d3 Rac8 24.&bl±, Blacks position has

not really been improved by the advance of the pawns on the queenside.

22.1c4 Bad8?!

22...f5 was better, but White has a serious

advantage anyway.

23.6 Sxd4

This loses by force, but by this stage probably everything does.

23...b5 would be an attempt to avoid Qa3

tricks: 24.Nb3 Be8 (24...Rxd4 25.Sxd4 Rxd4 26.Sxe6! ^h8 27.Sd6 and White wins material) 25.fxe6 Nxe6 26.d5 This break in the centre wins. 26...cxd5 27.Sxd5 Sb6

28.Rd2 There is no defence against Sde2 and

Qd5, winning the knight.

23...8.8 24.Qa3! and White wins.

After 25.Qa3! Black loses something.

25.Sxdl Sxdlf 26.Qxdl

Donner resigned, realizing that 26...Qe7 is met conclusively with:

[diagram]
27.Qd8!!

1-0 Having a keen sense of weaknesses is important for your development as a player, both before and after you become a grandmaster.

24.fxe6 Sxdlt

The "only" move was 24...Qe7, but here White can win the game with a simple double threat:

1. Salov- Karpov

Alma-Ata blitz (1) 1995

[diagram]
This position is of course essentially equal, but quite often equal positions are won with good moves, so it is important to play the best moves for Black. Here the only reason why White should have any problems is that the b2-pawn is a bit weak, and that he has advanced the a-pawn. Were the a-pawn on a2, Black would not have the chance to make the advances he did in the game.

16...Sfb8!

The correct rook, as the other rook needs to keep an eye on the a-pawn.

17.Sael

17.c4 will lead to a knight being established

on d5 once Black deflects the c4-pawn. White might have a temporary initiative, but long term the d5-square will mean that the position is a bit more pleasant for Black.

17...a6! On the next move comes 18...b5!,

and although the position is not terribly frightening for White, it is certainly not entirely equal.

17...d5?! would be risky. White suddenly

has three pieces attacking on the kingside. After 18.^e5 Qe8 19.Hg4! Black has to play non-script moves such as 19...f6!?, when the position is simply unclear.

17.^el! as suggested by Andrew Greet was

probably the most prudent move. White manoeuvres the knight to d3 in order to keep all his pieces covered. In this case White probably holds equality without too much trouble.

...0-1

2. Pogonina - E. Paehtz

Krasnoturinsk 2007

[diagram]
White has a pleasant position after various decent moves, but the clearest plan by far is to transfer a knight to the weak e6-square. This is what White did in the game.

21.Nb5! g5

21...Sfe8 22.^bd4 Qf7 has the idea of

replying to 23.£"e6 with 23...^c5!, when Black would be okay, but it can be met with either Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 53 the greedy 23.Qxa5!? or the more restrained

23.b4, in each case with a great advantage.

22.&bd4 Qg6 23.£}e6

We could actually stop here. When you play positional chess, you do not have to be able to see anything beyond transferring the ineffective knight from c3 to e6. White has many ways to follow up, with some probably better than others, but it is not something we gain a practical advantage out of determining in advance.

23...Bf7 24.Qxa5?

This move looks very tempting, but it allows Black to come back into the game with counterplay on the kingside. The correct way to play was to make the most out of the remaining inactive pieces. After 24.Hbel! White's advantage is very clear.
[diagram]
 It has to be the b 1 -rook, as it was under threat from the queen, and so moving the other rook would deny White the option of doubling on the e-file. If Black plays 24...^c5, the knight can be exchanged and then the rook enters the position on e6 with a clear superiority. And if Black plays 24...g4 White can play 25.hxg4 Sxg4 26.Se4! with Sfel on the way. The black position is full of weaknesses and White's dominating pieces will secure her a clear edge in all lines. In the game, matters were less clear.

[diagram]
24...g4 25.hxg4 Qxg4

The g-file is opened and the position is not as clear as it once was. 26Jfel! The queen is urgently needed on the kingside. The computer thinks White also can win with

26.b4?!, with the idea that 26...^h8 27.b5

Sg8 28.bxa6 jkd4 29.Qel f3 allows White to play 30.Qd2!. This is a very complicated line, and an example of a machine not being able to do a human's job. After 30...^,e5! Black has enough counterplay and it is White who has to look for a draw: 31.g3 bxa6 32.4}xf3 Qxf3

33.^d4 Rxg3t 34.fxg3 Qxg3t 35.Qg2 jkxd4t

36.&hlQh4t 37.Qh2 Qe4t=

26.Qb5?! is another computer favourite.

It takes a human to discover the correct riposte: 26...<^>h8! 27.Qxb7 Hg8 Black has some counterplay here. The critical line starts

28.Qh2! (28.Qxa6? Bd4! and White is mated)

28...Qg6 29.Qb3 f3! 30.g3 ^c5 31.5^xc5

kd4\ 32.^hl Bxf2! 33.g4 Bxc5 34.Qc3t Nh7

35.Hbel f2 with chances for both sides.

[diagram]
Black misses her opponent's defensive resource. 26...£\c5! was much better, and after 27.^xc5 dxc5 28.b4! cxb4 29.axb4 Rf6

30.Qe4 Sg6 Black has a lot of counterplay.

I would guess that White is still minimally better with correct play, but it is definitely easier to play the black position, making the result rather unpredictable.

27.Qdl! Sg8 28.Nfg5! 29.Nxf7t Qxf7

30JTB

And White won.

3. Klinova - Ferguson

Isle of Man 2007

[diagram]
White's weaknesses are h3 and e4. Black can organize an attack on both of these quite easily. The thing to look out for is how to increase the pressure on the white position without giving White any counterplay.

28..Jfd7!

The obvious first move. White only has one reply.

29.g4 h5!

This is the key move. The white pawns are put under increased pressure as the pawn joins in the attack. The common mistake here is to think that Black has a decisive double attack with

29...Qd3?!, but actually, because of the slightly

exposed nature of the rook on d8, White can repulse the attack with 30.Se3!. It should be said that 29...^e6!?+ would also give Black a great game.

30.Ne3

White can also call in reinforcements from his own pawn base, but it would weaken the king's position on the second rank, which can be seen from the line: 30.f3 Qd3! 31.Se3 Qc2f with a winning attack.

30.Ng3 would lose to 30...Qd3t 31.Be3 Qdl!

with a decisive attack.

[diagram]
30..Jfd3!

The e-pawn falls with check. The game is decided.

34.&fl

0-1

4. Leko - Khalifman

Budapest rapid (4) 2000

[diagram]
Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 55

18.Ne4!

This move is the best for two reasons, and should thus be relatively easy to find. First of all it prevents Black from playing 18...e4 and activating the black bishop on f6. Secondly, it exchanges the knight on c5, giving White the advantage of good knight against somewhat inactive bishop. There is of course a lot of play in the position, but this still secures a slight plus.

18...6xe4

After this normal-looking move Black is entirely without counterplay. However, it is not easy to cook up something better. Maybe it was necessary to play 18..."S,e7, when White is still happy after 19.g4±, but his queen is not nearly as dominant as in the game.

19.@xe4

White is ready for g2-g4-g5; Black has no counterplay.

19...g6

19...h5 20.Rhgl! would give White a strong

initiative on the kingside.

[diagram]
20.g4

This move does not make a lot of sense to me. It seems more natural to play 20.h5± and keep the future of the g-pawn open.

20...Jtg7 21.H5 22.hxg6 hxg6 23.Nd2±

White could have tried a lot of other moves here, but nothing was really clear-cut.

[diagram]
White's only problem is the d-pawn. Exchanging it does not open a file for attack against the white king, it merely exchanges this weakness.

23...Qxf2? would allow White to start a

winning attack with 24.Rdfl, and then: a) 24...Qg3 is somewhat complicated, but clear enough once you see the idea: 25.^c4!! Sad8 26.£k3 and the threat of 2f3 is devastating. Black can try 26...Bd6 27.Rf3 f5!?, but it is not enough. 28.^xf5! gxf5 (28...@g2

29.Ng3! with Sf8f coming.) 29.Qxf5 and the

queen is lost. b) 24...Qc5 25.Qf3! Qe7 26.Ne4 Sed8 (26...^fS 27.Rh7! followed by Qh3 is equally decisive) 27.Qh3 and Black cannot survive. For example: 27...Rxd5 28.Qh7t ^f8 29.g5 Sd6 30.Nf6 Sxf6 31.gxf6 lxf6 32.Sxf6! Qxf6

33.Qh8t Qxh8 34.Sxh8t Ne7 35.Sxa8 and

the ending is won.

23...Rad8!± was natural and sensible. White

plays something like 24.f3 and prepares to put the knight on e4 with a slight but enduring edge.

24.dxc6 Sac8 25.6 Sxc6 26.Re2 Qe6

[diagram]
White's pieces are basically placed as he would like them to be. Both players have unsafe kings, but that cannot be exploited immediately.

29.h4!±

White's only asset is his potential passed pawn. In order for it to have any value, it must be pushed immediately. The alternatives do not offer White any advantage. 29.Qd6 Sd8 30.Qe5 O-O gives White little. Black is ready to play ...Qf2 or ...Bfe8. White can of course force a draw, but nothing more is available.

29.Qe5 can again be answered with castling,

but it is also possible to play 29...Nd7!?, when the black king looks safe as houses in the middle.

29.Rel can also be answered with a king

move, or 29...O-O!?, as White has no particular compensation after 30.Rxe6 fxe6 31.Sxg6f <Nf7.

29...Nd7!? 30.h5 Sbg8± looks a more natural

6. Horn - Howell

Stockholm 2006

[diagram]
Whites centre looks great, but it is not stable. Black can with a few good moves create some attractive squares for his pieces. One of the surprises to some is that Black does not have to worry too much about the safety of his king in this position. The way the white bishops are pointing, they are a danger to no one. The essence of the position is the way White is clinging on to the light squares, only supporting those in the centre with the knight on c3. It is for this reason that Black can undermine the centre.

[diagram]
This is very compliant. Black now has three pieces that are thriving, while the bishop on g7 is not significantly worse than the bishop on e3, and despite everything has a long-term future.

12.d5! was a natural move. White is fighting

for the light squares as well.
[diagram]
 After 12...fxe4 White can either choose the calm line with 13.dxe6 exf3 I4.exd7t Qxd7 15.Jbcf3 ibd\3 16.Sxf3 O-O with more or less even chances, or he can try the more aggressive 13.^d4!? Nxd5 I4.^xd5 Jbcd5

15.f5!?. However, I think Black is not worse

after 15...O-O, although nothing is certain, of course.

[diagram]
I find it difficult to suggest a plan for White here. Black is very solid and the white pieces are poor, yet not easy to improve.

13...Qd7 I4.a4 b4 15.Na2 a5 I6.c3 bxc3

Black is better and won on move 54.

7. Kramnik - Carlsen

Dortmund 2007

[diagram]
This is an example of opening preparation gone completely wrong. Carlsen must have thought that he was in time to challenge the bind on the black position created by the pawn on d4, before the weakness of the c6- square and the problems with the backward pawn started to emerge. Kramnik must have wanted his knight on d2 to do something. Both his rooks are inactive, but they cannot assist in the fight for c6 easily. So, once again, the solution is to play the piece which is prime for improvement towards the weakness.

17.Nb3!

The computer points out that there is a more tactical solution to the position. White is also much better after 17.e4!? ftb6 18.ftb3! axb4 19.axb4±, based on the following tactical point: 19...ibcb4 20.Sa7 Jka8 21.Sxa8! Bxa8

22.^c6 and the bishop is lost as well. This

is objectively neither better nor worse than Kramnik's solution, but I have to say that I like the clarity of Kramnik's play more.

17...axb4 18.Na5 Jla8 19.£\ac6 M,xc6

After this move, all hope is gone. Black should not exchange this bishop, after which he is forced to accept a bad bishop versus good knight position. Instead he should have hoped that the bishop on a8, however ineffectual it is at the moment, could one day make something of itself.

20.5Bxc6 Rd7

8. Adams - Cheparinov

Baku 2008

[diagram]
Black's weaknesses are all on the kingside. As the centre is very stable there is plenty of time for White to start a kingside attack.

32.h4! d5

This loses by force, but the position is not tenable.

32...h5

This weakens the kingside. Among other possibilities, White might consider the following direct approach:

33.g4! hxg4 34.h5! gxh5 35.Qg5t ^f8

36.Qh6t!

An important check. If the king goes to g8, White takes time to take on h5, planning further attacks on the black king. The critical line is thus:

36...6.7 37.1ff6t Nd7

37.38.Rd5! is a neat finish. After

38...Qxe3 39.fxe3 exd5 40.exd6 ^g8 4l.d7

White wins.

38 Jfxf7t Se7 39.Qxh5

White should win this position, where he will soon be a pawn up with a great attack.

32...Qc7 33.h5 Qd8 looks like it should be the

best defence.

[diagram]
But after 34.Qf3!, preventing ...d5 and continuing to set up an attacking position, Black is not going to survive anyway.

9. Adams - Koneru

Merida 2008

[diagram]
The great weakness in the black position is the c6-square, which White would love to dominate. For this reason the knight belongs on a5. It is actually no more difficult than that in this case.

20.Nb3! fod7 21.^a5 Nb6 22.1b3 h6

21...Nc8 22.h4?!±

11. Grebionkin - Kirusha

St Petersburg 2001

[diagram]
White has achieved quite a promising position from the opening and could even consider sacrificing the exchange with 16.Jbcd5 Jlh3 17.^xc6 bxc6 18.Sxc6 ibcfl 19-^xfl. However, I do not think Black would be too unhappy about this turn of events, as he has rid himself of his weaknesses, and has some chances of proving that the exchange is more important than the two pawns. Another interesting move is 16.Bel, simply defending the e2-pawn and stepping out of the ...JUi3 shot. But here I am not so sure about the consequences of dynamic play with

16...@e7!?, intending to meet 17.Jbcd5 with

17...5ad8, when the position has become a

bit more complicated than I would like. It is possible that this is objectively as strong as the game continuation (although I doubt it), but from a practical point of view, it definitely makes less sense. The correct move was played by Grebionkin.

16.Sc5!

The attack on d5 with the rook forces Black to clarify his position in the centre. Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 61 l6..Jfe7!? Black gives up a pawn in the hope that he will get some activity. If Black plays simple chess, such as 16...ibcd4 17Jbcd4 Ne6 18.e3 or 16...^xd4 17Jtxd4 kc6 18.e3, then White has a clear edge, with a permanent target on d5. With the exchange of a pair of minor pieces, the activity of the black position has disappeared. Black could try the sneaky 16...^,e6!?. White does not have any clear way to put Black away, but the position after 17.£^xc6 bxc6 18.Bxc6 ibtb2 19.Qd3, with ideas such as Sa6, Sdl or Rc5, is still very uncomfortable for Black.

17.Sxd5 Bxd4

17...Rad8 18.5^xc6 Jbcc6 19.Sxd8 Hxd8

20Mc2 appears to be a pawn up for nothing.

18.Bxd4 !e6 19.Bc5! 7 20.Sd2 Qa5

[diagram]
2lJbtc6! bxc6 22.b4 White should be winning here. The extra pawn and the brilliant position of the bishop on c5 are enough to win. It is true that opposite-coloured bishops can be a strong drawing factor, but in certain positions, such as this one, they can actually make matters worse. The fact that White did not win the game is down to poor technique, or perhaps simply a bad day.

12. Razuvaev - Klinger

Palma de Mallorca 1989

[diagram]
White has a weakness on b3 and Black has weaknesses in the centre. Black is able to take advantage of the white weakness, rid himself of his own weaknesses and exchange the bishop on g2 - creating new weaknesses on the light squares around the white king - all with a simple move.

19...d4! 20.exd4

White has no choice.

20..Jbcg2 21.^xg2 Qb7t 22.&gl Sxb3

13. Hess - Postny

Ningbo 2011

[diagram]
Black has two sets of weaknesses: the f7/e6 pawn constellation and his king, which is being threatened by the advancing white pawns. The weakness in the white camp is obviously the d-pawn, which would be apparent after

27.bxc6?! Rxd4! with an unclear position.

Putting these facts together, it is not difficult to come up with the strong move Hess played in the game. Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 63

27.d5! Nb8?!

This just loses, but Black's position is poor in any case.

27...cxd5?! 28.cxd5 Nb8 is not really different.

(28...Sxd5 29.Sac 1 Sxd3 is obviously good for White if he takes the queen, but even stronger is 30.Sxe6! with a direct win.) 29.Sac 1 Taking the pawn on e6 next will lead to a winning endgame.

27...g4? 28.Qh4 and White wins.

27...ftg6! was the only move. Black is still

under great pressure, but at least he does not lose directly. Probably White is best off playing

28.bxc6 g4 29.Qh2 bxc6 and now either

30.Nb4 or 30.Sabi with great pressure on the

black position.

28.dxe6! Sxd3 29.exf7 Sgd8 30.Qe6

White wins back the piece and is easily winning.

30...&eg8 31.fitg8=Q> 5Bxg8 32.5}e4 g4

14. Tomashevsky - Svidler

Moscow 2007

[diagram]
Black has a weakness on d5 and is under pressure on f7. At the same time Black is not really able to put pressure on e3, where the bad bishop is defending a good pawn, as Suba would say. The main reason for this is of course that Black's minor pieces are rather out of play. White is able to increase his advantage by putting further pressure on the black position and creating an additional weakness.

26.a4!

After both 26.Qa3 Se6!± and 26.Scl Se6

27.a4 Sb7± Black is of course worse, but his

position can still be defended.

26...bxa4

A sad decision, but it was very difficult to find the only chance available to Black:

26...ffb8 27.axb5 axb5 28.Scl Sb7!

28...5e6 is met with 29.ftc5 ikxc5 30.Sxc5

and White wins a pawn.

29.Sc5! Qc8!

29...b4 30.Qa4 and Black will soon lose the

b4-pawn. Against this tactically-based defence, White can play 30.Sc3 with a solid advantage, or enter the tactics with:

30.Sxb5!? Sxd4! 31.fcb4! Rc4 32.Sxd5 Sc5

33.Sxd7 Qxd7 34.Qd3

Where White has an extra pawn, but the technical job is quite complicated. After 26...Na5? White has a simple but attractive combination: 27.Jbca5 @xa5

28.Rxf7! (28.Ne5! is more human, and also

wins.) 28...Hxf7 29.Sxf7 Nxf7 30.Qxd5t Se6 31.Qe5t! and White wins on account of

31...Nf6 32.Qf3t with mate to follow.

27.Qxa4±

[diagram]
27...Se6 28.Scl

Black cannot avoid losing material, the a6- pawn being most likely to fall.

28...Rc7?

[diagram]
29.Nf4! Sd6 30.1a5!

White wins the exchange and duly won the game on move 45.

15. Nakamura - Sasikiran

Malmo/Copenhagen 2005

[diagram]
Nakamura missed his chance when he played 23.g4?!± and later on lost in 87 moves. Instead White had the chance to exploit the X-ray from d4-g7 and the pressure down the d- and e-files with:

23.e5! dxe5

23...^h5 24.g4 and White wins material.

24.Ba7t!

It is quite often good to either push the king into the corner or create an entry point on a7 for the queen

24...Na8 25.±c5

White wins the exchange and would probably have won the game as well. Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 65

16. Lysyj - Wells

Plovdiv 2008

[diagram]
The weakness of the c6-square is the dominant feature of this position. If Black had time to play ...c7-c5 he would be absolutely okay, but by reacting quickly White can condemn him to passivity.

18.Bb5!

This is the best way to exploit the weakness. The queen is a poorer blockader and after

1 SMc6 a6! it is not so easy for White to improve

his position. Black will continue with ...^hS and ...Bg8 in order to get White to declare his intentions. White still has compensation for the pawn, but Black is starting to free himself and should not be significantly worse, if at all. A point worth noticing is 19.Qg2 g6 20.e4 c5!, when the white centre is being undermined. This is what can happen if Black is given the space he would like. Here White has to enter terrible complications with 21.jbce6! fxe6

22.Rxg6t, which should end in a draw with

best play.

18...Bg6

It is difficult for Black to find a move. A tactical point is that 18...c5? loses instantly to 19.ibtd7 Qxd7 20.ibd:6.

18...Qc8 19.Jb:6 a6 is met with 20.e4! and

White dominates. Obviously winning the exchange is less attractive than keeping control. 19Jk,c6 a6 20.e4 This is an even worse version for Black than after 18...Qc8. White is just winning.

20...b5

[diagram]
21.Qdl?

This natural move throws away a lot of the advantage. After 21.Qb3! Black does not have any defence against e4-e5. For example

21...Qc8 22.e5 ^h5 23.Rxg6! and after

23...fxg6 24Jfxe6t Sf7 25.^d5 White

eventually wins material.

21.. Jfc8! 22.W6?!

It was time for White to cash in his advantage and take the exchange. Now Black develops counterplay; but probably Pete was already in serious time trouble.

22...5.8 23.e5 Nh5 24.Sg4 b4?

24...Qe8! is a very difficult move to find.

Black wants to play ...b5-b4, but has to prevent the h4-bishop from joining the game via e7. Had Black played this, he would have been more or less okay.

25.axb4 Hb6

25...5.b4 26.jk.e7 is hopeless. Probably

Black only now realized that after 26...Rxb2 White wins with 27.ibcd7 Qxd7 28.jbcf8 ^xfS 29.Sxg6.

26.O-O-O?

26.J,e7 Se8 27 Jkc5 and White wins.

26...Nb8?

26...Qe8! would have equalized here too.

27.1e4! Sxb4

27...Qe8 comes too late now. White wins

after 28.Rdgl Nc6 29.Qh3! with serious threats to the black king.

28.1e7

17. Kramnik - Leko

Brissago (14) 2004

[diagram]
In the long term White will have no advantage on the kingside. Black will play ...g6, after which his structure cannot be penetrated easily - the f7-pawn is too easy to defend. All of Whites advantage is therefore on the queenside.

21.b4!

The weakness is the c7-square, and White needs to get his rook in there in order to attack all the other weaknesses on the 7th rank.

21...a6 22.a4 Nd8?

22...jbca4 23.Sc7 favours White. He will

win back the pawn immediately. For example:

23.. J^c6?! 24.Ng5 Sf8? 25.^xf7! and White

wins. Kramnik gave a way for Black to handle the pressure: 22...Ne7!

[diagram]
23.b5 axb5 24.axb5 Jkd7 25.Rc7 b6 White of

course has some advantage here, for example

26.Sb7 Shb8 27.Sxb8 Sxb8 28.Sal, but it is

not a great deal. Black should be able to defend this and take the crown; but alas, it was not to be...

23.Ng5 Be8 24.b5± Nf4

Kramnik's point is that after 24...axb5 White will play 25.ikxb5!± and Black cannot defend the f7-square in any suitable way. An illustration of this is 25...Sf8? 26.jbce8 ^xe8

27.Rc7 Sxa4 28.Sb 1! and White has a winning

attack. Therefore 25...b6 26.jbce8 Rxe8 would be the best defence, when Black can still fight.

19. Leko - Ki. Georgiev

Dubai 2002

White has a very decent move in I4.jkg5, seeking to exchange the strong bishop on e7. However, Leko found a stronger and even more natural move. I4.e6! Qxe6 I4...fxe6 allows 15.^e5 followed by Qh5t and White wins.

15.Sel Rd6 I6.iia3

wins material.

17.dxc5 bxc5 18.jbcb4 cxb4 19.Qxd5!

20. Leko - Bormida

Black has a weakness on the b6-square, which allows White to force the rook on a8 to a poor square before then taking action on the kingside.

16...1.8 17.Ng5 Ng7 18.f4!±

16...Nf8

his bishop to the a3-f8 diagonal.

17.ilcl! Sd8

Black tries to hold on to his material, but it cannot be.

This strong move exploits the weakness of the f4-square to take control of the dark squares. White will forever struggle against the power of the black pieces as they transfer through the e5-square. The g4-pawn will always be weak.

Black won the ending. Chapter 2 Pieces One poorly-placed piece makes your whole position bad - Dr Siegbert Tarrasch Jakob Aabling-Thomsen - Jacob Aagaard Helsingor 2012

[diagram]
Black to play Black can probably equalize by exchanging weaknesses, but he seeks a long game, where the d4-pawn might be a bit more exposed than the pawn on c6. How should he play in order to get the most out of his pieces? If pawns are the skeleton of a position, or "the soul of the game", then the pieces must be the flesh and blood, with the king being the heart and brains of the operation. Yet how well do most chess players really know their pieces? And how well do they treat them? Pieces certainly work like bees for the sake of the hive, but they are not workers like the pawns; staying with the terminology of the beehive, they are the drones. I personally like to think of the dynamics in a position as being a measurable quantity, where a piece can have a rather low value if it is poorly placed, while it can have quite a high value if it is excellently placed. Likewise, a piece can have low or high potential, based on the pawn structure and other factors. No doubt computer programmers work hard at refining these evaluations, though my limited knowledge suggests that they are at least equally interested in making the most out of the extra cores our computers are starting to have. The worst-placed piece While a programmer has to work out a quantifiable value to attribute to the pieces, in order to communicate with the machine, the human brain works in a more intuitive way. Looking at our pieces, it should not be too difficult to work out which of our pieces is worst placed. Ideal squares In Excelling at Chess, I introduced the idea of Looking for ideal squares for our pieces. Here we are not talking about their current dynamic value, but about their potential value. At times a poorly-placed piece will not have an obvious ideal square. The piece can be said to have low potential, at least for the time being. But at other times the ideal square can be quite attractive, although quite far away. As one of my three questions is "Which is the worst-placed piece?", the concept of ideal squares is certainly an important one to assimilate (and the way we do this is by paying attention to it again and again in training, or when we feel lost during a game). Here is a simple example of looking for the worst-placed piece and manoeuvring it to a decent square. Alexander Vaulin - Eduard Prandstetter Pardubice 1996

[diagram]
It is quite obvious to me that the bishop on c8 is the worst-placed piece; it is not only devoid of any positive function, it is also in the way of the rook on a8! The ideal square for the bishop is in my opinion e4. Prandstetter clearly agreed with me, as he decided to manoeuvre it there.

17..JU7

White is in a similar situation, looking at his pieces and trying to find out which ones should be performing much better. At the moment the knight on c2 looks more active Chapter 2 - Pieces 73 than the rook on al, but it is an illusion. The rook on al is only one move away from a good square (fl), while the knight is painfully far from a good square. As nothing concrete is happening at the moment, Vaulin decided to put his knight on its ideal square.

18.£el ±e8 19.Nd3 !g6 20.Ne5 kc4

Both players have achieved their aim and the position can be said to be in balance.

21.Sf4 Jlxg2 22.Nxg2 $Sd7

Black decides to neutralize the strong white knight instead of having a strong knight of his own. Maybe this is slightly inaccurate, but in practice it does not make a great deal of difference. Most natural to me would have been 22...g5!?

23.Sf3 Qe4 24.Safi Sxf3 25.Sxf3 Sffi and the

position is completely level.

23.5}xd7 Qxd7 24.Safl Sxf4 25.Sxf4

The only consequence of having played

22...ftd7 is that Black has to find the correct

plan here. If White were given the chance to play e3-e4 he would have a slight edge. However, Black is focused and creates a good square for his queen on d5:

25...dxc4! 26.bxc4 b5! 27.Qb3

27.Qc3!? has the idea of continuing

27...bxc4 28.e4!. It should instead be met with

27...Rc8!=, preparing ...c5 and making use of

the rook.

Black's rook will come to c3 like a rocket, so he has no reasons to worry.

V2-V2

This example of a bad bishop becoming good is of course very simple. Most people would have played this manoeuvre without thinking; if nothing else then because that is what you are supposed to do in the Stonewall. But the bishop manoeuvre makes sense also in more complicated scenarios, still based on the principle of putting the worst-placed piece on the ideal square. The following game is far from flawless, which just shows how difficult chess is, but Black's positional ideas are quite clear and powerful, when faced with an inconsequent opponent. Mikhail Kozakov - Zlatko Topalovic Varazdin 2003

[diagram]
In this position it looks natural to put a rook on c8, and maybe to repel the white knight from its advanced position on b5 with ...fta7 at some point - White then replies ftc3 and Black probably returns his knight to c6, inviting a draw. But the question is what this actually does to help Black with his real problem, which is what to do with his bishops and rooks. In the game Topalovic decided on a more active plan, which proved successful in practice. Whether it is stronger is hard to say, but it certainly makes a lot of sense.

[diagram]
This move has two purposes. First of all it aims to open the f-file (or at least to have this possibility available). But it is the second option which is really attractive: the inactive bishop on d7, which has little prospect of coming alive by being the key player behind a ...b5-break, is offered a route to freedom. The downside to playing ...f6 is the weakening of the e6-square. White should definitely have tried to use this more forcefully than he did in the game. The outcome would then have been significantly in doubt.

18.Qd2

It is always worth considering whether White should take on f6. Black can consider taking back with the rook (most natural) or with the g-pawn (somewhat risky in my opinion). In general, White plays this phase of the game as if he has no idea what the function of his pieces should be.

18...1e8 19.Sacl

[diagram]
Chapter 2 - Pieces 75

[diagram]
Black gives the impression of thinking that White will not do anything active - and he is right. I have the feeling that sometimes there are signs in our body language that are picked up subconsciously by our opponents and which help determine the direction of the game. If a player feels indecisive and uncertain, he will pass this impression on to his opponent, who will then naturally be more confident. This can in turn lead to increased uncertainty for the first player. (If you want to turn this into something more than pop psychology, the advice would be to be confident at the board and hope that this gives you a small extra edge. Obviously, if your moves are bad, this may not do you much good!)

19...fxe5! seems more accurate. After 20.fxe5

kg6 Black has fully equalized.

20.&el?!

This passive move is hopefully better explained by my dodgy psychology than by Kozakov's understanding of chess. The intention is to attack the e6-pawn, but very little is achieved by this; and in turn the knight is poorly placed on el.

20.exf6!

This was the correct move.

[diagram]
Black should play 20...gxf6 21.Qe3 "S,e4 followed by ...f5, with perhaps a slightly inferior position. Otherwise he could quickly find himself in a worse situation:

20...5xf6?21.Ne5!

Black has to defend against ^d7, either with the passive .. Jke8 or with:

21...^xe5 22.dxe5!

Freeing the d4-square for the knight and queen.

22...5flF8 23.Bg4 Sae8 24.Qd4 Qxd4 25.Nxd4

27.^xe6!

White is close to winning in these complications.

20..JU4?!

20...fxe5! was stronger. It will be a very long

time before White can compete for the f-file, so opening it is in Black's interest. 21.fxe5 Sxflt 22.&xfl

[diagram]
White is rather passive. After 23.,fi,e2 Sf8 it is very hard to arrange to play Jkg4 while the knight is poorly placed on el, weakening the first rank (allowing mate, for example).

21.!g4?

It was the last chance for 21.exf6!, when White would still not be worse.

21...6

Having established the bishop on e4, it is quite natural to fix the pawns on light squares behind it. The only possible objection is that there was another interesting possibility here, which may be even stronger.

21...fxe5! was attractive; after all, the pin down

the f-file means that the pawn is hanging. White would probably have to play something along the lines of 22.jbce6t Nh8 23.dxe5 £}xe5?.

22.ile2

[diagram]
 At this point Black clearly looked for a way to bring the rooks into the game. The most natural way is to play on the side of the board where he is stronger, which is the kingside. However, this entails weakening the king and should not really work against the best defence. But with an opponent who is

[diagram]
simply waiting for you to advance, we often see that the strongest continuation is to play as aggressively as possible.

[diagram]
22..Aa7 23.^c3 Rac8T was more standard,

and would not have involved the risks Black took in the game.

23.Sc3!

The rook is well placed here, looking towards both sides of the board.

[diagram]
24.h3?

This is a horrible move in many ways. First of all it does very little for the white position; you can only surmise that White may have thought he would have to play ^hl-h2 soon. One better option was to carry out a little prophylaxis against Blacks plan with 24.5}f3 h6 25.Sfcl, when Black is prevented from playing ...g5 and the white pieces are back in the game. The tactical point behind these moves is that 25...Sg8?? is punished with

26.?}g5!, when Black is in deep trouble. But

if Black does not commit suicide then the position is just equal.

[diagram]
Chapter 2 - Pieces 77

24.^d3! was possibly even stronger. The

knight is going to c5, exploiting that the d4- pawn is immune because of Qe3 tricks. The board catches fire after: 24...g5 25.5^c5 gxf4

26.^xe6 Nxe5, when I assess the complications

as leading to a strange form of balance.

24...Sg8

White is no longer able to stop ...g5 and his position must be worse. But this does not justify his reaction, where he eliminates the e4-bishop with devastating structural consequences. "Lost for moves" are the words that spring to mind.

25.1B g5+

Black won the game without much difficulty. White could maybe have offered more resistance, but his position is quite bad already.

But games are won by the player with the best plan and the best moves, not by the analyst. By first putting his bishop on the best possible square and then launching an attack, Black won the game. White had the chance to fight against these ideas all the way, but failed to do so. We refer him to the chapter on prophylaxis. Let us have a look at a different manoeuvre, this time with the author on the receiving end. Daniel V. Pedersen - Jacob Aagaard Denmark 2012

[diagram]
Somehow I had messed up the opening horribly. Basically I had been daydreaming rather than thinking. The big weakness in the black position is the c5-square, prompting my opponent to play a logical move. I4.Nbl! Not the only good move in the position, but its simplicity only increases my admiration for it.

14...e6

Eventually I felt I had to play this unpleasant move. I4...Bh6 15.g3 Ng7 was the other way of playing I considered, but I6.ftbd2 £\e6

17.4^1 would have been very unpleasant for

Black. The ideas f4-f5 and 5Bd2-b3-a5/c5 are debilitating.

15.&bd21H6 16.g3c5?

I offered a draw, which to my surprise was accepted. I was hoping to generate counterplay, but do not believe I would have succeeded, had the game continued. A short and relatively painless off-day.

V2-V2

The final example in this section could have been solved if I had only paid attention to my worst-placed piece. However, I did not think along those lines at all. Jacob Aagaard - David Isonzo Arco 2005

[diagram]
Black is threatening the e4-pawn, but White should protect it in a way that makes sense. As Black's active options are ...d5 and ...f5, the white bishop is ideally placed on the passive looking f3-square. Another classic case of a bad bishop defending good pawns (Suba). The difference from a truly bad bishop is that this one has prospects, while a really bad bishop would have none.

20.16!

20.f3? would allow Black to play 20..Jkh6!

with almost immediate equality.

20.Qd3?! would allow Black to play 20...Sfd8.

A key idea is 21.J,f3 d5 22.exd5 Qxb4, when Black is in the game. And after 21.!Rc7 d5 22.Rxb7 d4 23.J,d2 Sab8 Black has some counter-chances, though White is still better because of his passed pawn on the queenside. Chapter 2 - Pieces 79

20...Sfd8

20...jUi6? would now drop a piece to 21.g3!.

21.Bc7 Sab8

[diagram]
This is the critical position (in the sense that I got it wrong!). Basically Whites poorly- placed piece is the rook on fl. My main cop¬ out is that I was a considerably weaker player back then and did not pay as much attention to my poorly-placed pieces as I should have. Even in my notes to the game in my private files, I do not pay any special attention to the inactive rook. The correct continuation was therefore: 22jfd2! The immediate threat of winning the queen wins valuable time. In the game I played weakly with:

22.g3?! Qf6 23.h4 h6±

[diagram]
This was what I was hoping for, and I assumed that my next move would be really strong. However, it does nothing about bringing my worst-placed piece into the game.

24.h5?

I am not sure if I am going too far when I say that this is a positional blunder. But it is certainly not a good move.

24.Ng2 would still have kept a real

advantage.

24...gxh5!

Somehow I had not considered this natural move. I have to recapture or Black will play ...h4.

25 Jbch5 d5

Black has counterplay. White is maybe a bit better, but there is a lot of work needed to win this game, and it took until move 64 to do so.

[diagram]
Prophylaxis against the ...d5-break.

23.Sal?

[diagram]
23...d5! would give Black a lot of unnecessary

counterplay, based on the point that 24.exd5? e4 not only wins back the d-pawn, but also creates a double threat to al and f3. White could struggle on with 25.Qcl+, but it would hardly be fun.

23..Jffc 24.Bg2

[diagram]
The bishop returns to safety, allowing White to follow up with Ral-a7 with a close to decisive advantage. Black will not be able to play ...d5 in a meaningful way, as the ...e5-e4 tricks are gone. Creating squares for the pieces The purpose of pawn play is to a great degree to create good squares and possibilities for our pieces. This is a huge part of chess and something we think about all the time. Chess strategy is very preoccupied with pawn play. Here I just want to give a simple example of how pawn play can benefit the pieces - nothing too fancy. The first example includes a pawn sacrifice, but if we disregard this, we can see that it is really all about finding good squares for the pieces, or in making the most of them in other ways. Boris Gelfand - Tomasz Markowski Polanica Zdroj 1998 l.d4 d6 2.&B 3.c4 g6 4.Nc3 Bg7 5.e4 O-O 6.1e2 Na6 7.O-O e5 8.Sel c6 9.ifl exd4 10.5^xd4 5^g4 11.H3 1=fb6 12.hxg4 Qxd4 13MB Qe5 I4.g5 Qe7 15.Qg3 Nc5 16.Bf4 Ac5 17.Sadl 16 18.gxf6 Sxffc 19Jbce5 Qxe5 20.b4

[diagram]
Black's weakest square is certainly the d6- square, at the moment occupied by a pawn, which in turn is a bit weak. White's worst- placed piece is the knight on c3, which obviously would like to be on e4. On top of this, White is leading in development and would like to use this actively.

20..Jfxg3?!

Markowski is doubling White's pawns and preparing to put his knight on e5. When you look at how the game went, this might seem foolhardy, but it was not at this point that the big mistake occurred. Still, I find it a bit risky. It was quite natural to play 20...Nd7, but White would then have a chance to play

21.Qe3, when after 21...a5 22.b5 Nc5, the

position would be unclear.

21.feg3 Nd7

Naturally, if Black were given an extra move to play 22...Ne5, he would be on top of the world. With the queens gone, it would be no problem moving the king to e7 to defend the d6-pawn and White would have to spend half the game bringing his knight to a decent square. Chapter 2 - Pieces 81

[diagram]
An example of this can be found should White play 22.c5, when Black manages to get all his pieces out with 22...Ne5! 23.cxd6 and then the rook to d8. White is clearly fighting for equality in that case, not having solved his problem with the c3-knight. Faced with this prospect, White has no choice but to sacrifice a pawn:

22.e5!

The pawn is let go so that the knight will have a future.

22...dxe5

22...^xe5? 23.Ne4 would allow White to

win the pawn back without giving up any of his advantages.

23.Ne4 Bf7

Black has to play passively. If he tries to get his pieces out with something like 23...Rf8

24.£\d6 £}f6, then after 25.Sxe5 he has no real

way to deal with the invasion on e7. The game is not lost, but it is certainly unpleasant.

24.c5

Another benefit of the pawn sacrifice is that White has time to activate the bishop. White's advantage would be decisive if he could either win his pawn back or bring the queens back onto the board. But in this slightly simplified position he lacks targets to some degree.

24...Ng7 25.ik.c4 Se7 26.a4

[diagram]
The crucial moment of the game and closely related to our topic. What should Black focus on? Making something of his bishop and rook certainly. In his book Gelfand proposed that Black should play 26...b6, when after 27.Sd6 bxc5 28.bxc5 Nf8 29.Sxc6 Nh7 30.Sd6 Sc8 31.Bd5 Bxd5

32.Sxd5± he quite clearly favours White in the

endgame. This is undeniably better than what was played in the game:

26...Se8??

I am not quite sure what the idea is behind this move, but I am sure that Markowski had one. Unfortunately there is a big downside to this move; White now finds a target to aim for with his active pieces. The correct move is 26...a5!, which challenges the white pawns and makes something out of the rook on a8. The critical line goes like this:

27.b5 cxb5 28.axb5 a4 29.Sfl a3

[diagram]
How should this position be evaluated? I am honestly not certain. White has a strong knight on e4 and bishop on c4, but as said before, he lacks targets. Black on the other hand has managed to get a passed pawn and activate the rook on a8. I have analysed the active 30.Bd5, where Black ends up fine in the following complicated line:

30...Nf8! 31.Nd6 Ne6 32.c6 Nd4!?

[diagram]
33.cxb7 Bxb7 34.Nxb7 Ne2t 35.Nh2 Sk3

36.£k5 Sd8 37.Sd3 £}xd5 38.Rxa3 e4 A draw

is the most likely outcome. So I think White should follow my more human thinking and play 30."i,a2. I find White's position more attractive, but that said, I am not really sure what I am intending to do with it. In a practical game this would no doubt be felt as pressure by the black player, but I am not sure it is anything significant objectively. No matter what, it is clear that this is the way Black should have played.

27.Sfl Se7 28.Sd2!

1-0 In the following game we shall see that creating a square for a piece does not necessarily mean that you have to occupy it. At times the threat of using the square is enough to secure certain advantages, in this case tying down Chapter 2 - Pieces 83 the opponent's pieces to the defence of the c4-square. Lajos Portisch - Jens Kristiansen Skopje (ol) 1972

[diagram]
I6.a4! This strong move fixes the pawn structure on the queenside to White's advantage.

16...b4 17.&bl a5

In general Black would love to play 17...c4, but White has 18.a5! in reply, giving Black no compensation for the pawn whatsoever.

18.&bd2

White has control over the c4-square, but he will not rush to play his knight there and allow exchanges. In the game Black neglects his kingside and White launches an attack there, meaning that he never gets round to occupying the c4-square. Still the usefulness of the square is dominant in many lines, as Black has to defend it vigorously.

Perhaps Black considered ...f5, but this would only leave his position with multiple weaknesses.

1-0 Exchanges Hopefully all readers of this book will know that you should exchange your bad bishop for the opponent's good bishop and that you should focus on which pieces remain after exchanges more than on the ones you exchange. But beyond these basic ideas, exchanges in chess is a theme that deserves Chapter 2 - Pieces 85 a longer investigation than I am able to give it right here. My only angle on this occasion will be related to the worst-placed piece, as I think this is a good way of looking at things. The following game illustrates this nicely. Jacob Aagaard - Enamul Hossain Dresden (ol) 2008 l.e4 c5 2.£}f3 5Bc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.5Bxd4

5.5}c3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6

[diagram]
Preparing for this game I saw that my opponent had played a number of games in long theoretical lines and done well out of them. The prospect of having to find a novelty on move 32 of the Sveshnikov was not appealing to me, so I decided to play a less critical move, which would quickly lead to an independent game. 7&d5 5Bxd5 8.exd5 9.a4 This line is not especially dangerous for Black. The idea is 5^b5-a3-c4-b6, but this rarely happens in practice; and if it does, then only after Black has made great gains on the kingside. On the other hand the move is not bad and White is not worse.

9...Ne7 10.1e2 O-O 11.O-O ftd7 12.Be3 a6

13.Na3

[diagram]
This is the critical position of the game. Black needs to find his path forward. Most of his pieces are not well placed and need to find a function (note that finding a function/future is not necessarily the same as moving!). A good strategy for this position would include a vision for all of the black pieces. This is what you would usually expect from a strong grandmaster.

13...tg5?

If you think too superficially, this is a great- looking move. Black seeks to exchange his bad bishop before developing his queenside. But as you have probably gathered, the problem is not in the first part of this sentence, but in the second part. Beyond the exchange of bishops, Black has no plan for the rest of his pieces, nor any idea of what will happen after the exchange. I was quite pleasantly surprised by this move, as it gives me extra time to expand on the queenside.

13...f5 has been played in a number of games,

with Black starting action on the kingside. This is certainly the right way to play. The bishop is likely to stay on c8 for a very long time, until a good square is available for it. However, it would have a future. As the game goes, there is no function available for the bishop until eventually it is exchanged for Whites bad bishop. I4.1xg5! Apparently this was a novelty, but it is the only move that makes sense. I4.f4?exf4 15.ikxf4He8 16.^c4Bxf4 17.Sxf4 Ne5= was played in Muhren - Kalinitschew, Dieren 2004. I4...Qxg5 15.5^c4

 Black has not managed to do anything to get the c8-bishop into play and is now faced with an attack on the d6-pawn. Already things are getting more difficult for Black and the right move is no longer easy to find.

15...Qe7?!

Black is playing as if he has achieved something and has all the time in the world, but the contrary is the case. He has no active counterplay and White is progressing rapidly on the queenside. The white knight will land on b6 and the pawns will come rolling forward to support it. The more active 15...^f6! was the right way to play, whether or not it is entirely correct. The

[diagram]
point is I6.Nxd6 Rd8 17.Nxc8 ^xd5!, when in order to keep the advantage, White has to play:

Black resigned without giving me the chance to play 31...Hc8 32.Qxc8!?, when the pawns will win. 1-0 The following game illustrates how we can improve our position by exchanging our most weakly-placed piece, thus staying within the theme of this chapter. Alexander Khalifinan - Judit Polgar Las Vegas (5.1) 1999

[diagram]
Black's king is unsafe, no matter where she decides to put it. This factor causes the computer to wildly overestimate White's advantage, even if he does nothing.

22.h3!=

This excellent move prepares to exchange the strong defender on e6 for the inactive bishop on e2. Black will either have to weaken her kingside further (...fxe6) or the d5-square.

22...O-O

22 ...Ne7 was suggested by Ribli. This changes things greatly and should encourage White to open the queenside immediately to take advantage of the exposed position of the king in the centre: 23.b4! axb4

24.gxb4 b5 (24...Sc7 25.Sdbl and the

b7-pawn seems to be impossible to defend.)

25.Sdbl kdl 26.Qf3 bxc4 27.Bxc4 Black is

I am not really sure that transferring the queen to h4 improves Whites position. I rather like 23.Bg4 Hfd8 24.Qf3 Ng7

25.Jkxe6 fxe6 26.Sbcl Re7 27.Hc3=, though

in other lines Black is under pressure as well.

26.Sd3!?

Khalifman is deliberately waiting before taking on e6; maybe he can avoid ...fxe6.

26.ibce6 fxe6 27.Sd3 Hcd8± does not seem

too dangerous for Black.

26...Rg5?!

Polgar is dreaming of action on the g-file, when neutralizing the pressure down the d-file should have been her priority. From here on things go downhill.

26...5cd8± was necessary, with the point

27.Hbdl Hxd3 28.Hxd3 Jbcg4 (But not

be okay.

28.Sbdl± Ecg8?

Black continues her "attack" on the kingside. Better was 28...Qb6! although Black's position is still extremely shaky.

29.Sd6 Rc8

Black does not have time to take on g2, which exposes the flaws with her strategy:

Rc7 33.Sld7 Qe6 34.Sd6 Qe7 35.S8d7 Rf8

36.Qxf6t and White will win the subsequent

ending.

30.g3&g7 31.Sld5

White is winning no matter what. His domination is total and Black's position is riddled with weaknesses. If Polgar now intended to let the pawn go, I do not know, but it does not increase her chances.

Chapter 2 - Pieces 89 Sacrifices to improve certain pieces (positional sacrifices) The positional sacrifice is a big theme and requires more than one book to cover it fully. I have already given one example above (Gelfand - Markowski), but I would like to give a few more. If this does not satisfy your hunger, I would refer you to Mihai Suba's book on this theme, Positional Chess Sacrifices. Vadim Milov - Alexander Yermolinsky Las Vegas 2006

[diagram]
ll.e5! A typical pawn sacrifice. White loses a pawn, but the control over the e4-square and the death of the dynamics of the black position are more than worth it. Il...Nxe5?! Black has to accept the sacrifice, as 11...5}g4

12.Bg5! followed by Nb5 would be a disaster.

But maybe Black should have aimed for more murky waters with ll...dxe5!?, when the knight on d7 could become active. For example: 12.jkc2 e4 13.^g5 £^e5 I4.Qe2 £k6! 15."S,e3 e5
[diagram]
 Black is planning to occupy the d4-square and is not significantly worse.

12.5^xe5 dxe5 13.Qe2 Jtd7 I4.jR,g5!

White is ensuring that he keeps control of the e4-square. I4...Qe8 15.Sadl Bc6 16.b4 a6 17.ilxfi6 Sxffi
[diagram]
Another useful exchange, securing the e4-square for the knight. Black's position is somewhat worse objectively, and incredibly hard to defend in practice.

After this passive move Black is pushed over the edge.

27...Qd5 was better, although White keeps

an edge after 28.Qbl @c4 29.5=?e3±. But the fact that he has not managed to stabilize his queenside makes the outcome uncertain.

28.Qb3 m 29.a4 h6 30.Qc4

m 34.Sd7 SafS 35.Qd6 Sxd7 36Jfxd7 cxb5 37.axb5 Nh8 38.Sdl Qa7 39Jfe7 1-0 The following example touches on this issue from a different angle. Teimour Radjabov - Vladimir Kramnik Istanbul (ol) 2012

[diagram]
One matter I will not delve too far into in this book is the dynamic exchange of values that takes place when we sacrifice a piece or the exchange. What usually happens is that a structural improvement is exchanged for material investment, as in the following example. Here Kramnik gives up the exchange in order to take control of the c6-square. This time around the sacrifice does not come with any active possibilities, but as the position is fairly closed, it is hard for White to do anything with his rooks and for this reason the game was agreed drawn almost immediately.

V2-V2

Loose pieces drop off I am not going to go deeply into this concept, but just mention it briefly. The phrase was first used in print by John Nunn. The idea is pretty simple - undefended pieces are weaknesses, just as undefended pawns are. Usually we would put this theme under tactics, but we should also remember that basically all positions have some tactical element. So rather than go into a long speech about this, I will show a simple example and ask you to get used to being aware of which pieces are undefended from time to time. Who knows, maybe you will get a chance like the following and not let it pass? Murtal Kazhgaleyev - Yaroslav Zherebukh Cappelle la Grande 2010

[diagram]
In this complicated middlegame position, White played 22.Hd3?, after which the position was unclear and the game was won on move 39 by Black. Usually we would put a position like this in a book on tactics or calculation (candidate moves), but it illustrates our example quite well. Because of the undefended nature of the bishop on b7 and the pawn on h7, White could have taken a big step towards winning the game with a nice little tactic:

22.Qe4!

As the queen is immune, Black has to defend the bishop on b7, allowing White to take on h7 with a decisive advantage. Final note - a practical example The key thing I want you to take away from this chapter is the power of the question: "Which is the worst-placed piece?" Even with such a simplistic tool you can play quite reasonable chess. Here is a recent example from one of my own games. My opponent will no doubt be an IM within a few years and has already beaten several strong grandmasters with his aggressive style. Jakob Aabling-Hiomsen - Jacob Aagaard Helsingor 2012 l.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 fofGl With a dangerous book just out, there was no way I was going to take the risk of accepting the Morra!

4.e5 5^d5 5.£\B d6 6.ilc4 5}b6 7Ab3 dxe5

8.5^xe5 e6 9.O-O Nc6

Black gets an isolated pawn as well as White, but rids himself of the only attacking asset that White has. The future is quite safe now! Besides, Black's isolated pawn is not as weak as White's at the moment, as Black can force an exchange of them with ...c5, a possibility White does not have.

10.5^xc6 bxc6 ll.cxd4 ile7

[diagram]
 The opening is over and it is time to lay out a plan for the middlegame. From Black's perspective, it is all about solving problems one by one. Putting it simply, he wants to obtain good squares for the bishop on c8 and the knight on b6, and to put pressure on the d4-pawn. I decided to put the bishop on d5 and the knight on f5 (I was already anticipating that I would have to play ...g6 to defend my king). 1 quickly rejected all ideas of an early ...c5. The main downside I could find to this plan was that the bishop on d5 could be slightly in the way; but then I was not trying to prove anything, just to put my pieces on decent squares and see how my opponent decided to react. I am happy if this sounds like very simplistic thinking, because then it can be replicated. Good positions are generally built on a foundation of staying friends with all of your pieces, as well as keeping an eye on what is important and what the opponent might be up to.

12.Nc3

White had the chance to play 12.Qf3, leading to an exchange of the isolated pawns after 12...O-O. The position is equal, and White would have to give up all ambition to play like this. Maybe it was something he should have considered!?

[diagram]
12...O-O 13.Q6

[diagram]
 White is heading for h3 with the queen, wanting to checkmate me. Unfortunately he has lost his strategic argument for this plan - the knight on e5. Against best play the attack should not be dangerous for Black. So instead of worrying about getting mated, I wondered about how to put my inactive pieces on the right squares. I saw no reason not to progress with the plan I had laid down a few moves previously and went for the first obvious step.

13..Jka6

Having castled, Black has this extra option. The regrouping starts. l4.Sdl l4.Sel was more logical in some ways, aiming to place the other rook on dl, but the computer points out that I4...Qxd4 15.Qxc6 5=Sac8 I6.Qf3 Sfd8 is pleasant for Black.

14...5c8 15.1c2 tc4

Strategically this was the only move; the bishop transfers to d5 before White has time to play b2-b3, preventing it. I6.b3

[diagram]
Chapter 2 - Pieces 93 Played to dominate the b6-knight, but it also weakens some squares. All moves are a bit like that.

16...Bd5

[diagram]
The first step of the plan has been accomplished. I could not really work out how strong the bishop was on d5. As mentioned, it does feel like it is a bit in the way and not so easy to move. But at the same time it does control a lot of the board, and even though there are no serious weaknesses there now, there is no guarantee for White that these will not appear in the future. White continued with his plan, not yet doubting its validity.

17 Jfh3 g6 18.1h6 Se8 19.Sd3

[diagram]
After a few forced moves it was finally time for me to return to my own plan. 1 wanted to put pressure on the d4-pawn and bring the knight in from the cold on b6 and put it on the highest tower (f5) like a beacon, visible at the edge of the board (h6, for example) and in control of the centre (d4, for sure!). In order to do so 1 had to reorganize my pieces in a sensible way.

[diagram]
The rook is going to d7 to put pressure on the d4-pawn, as well as freeing the c8-square for the knight.

20.Sadl

Jakob is starting to lose his way. It was time to play 20.^,f4 jkd6 21.jke5! forcing some kind of concession. In this way the struggle would have remained tense, though Blacks chances should not be worse.

20...5d7 2lJfg4

To deliver mate you usually need something extra - a very solid centre, a good knight or pawn on e5, or maybe a serious weakness on the kingside. Here there are none of those things, so White's attacking pose is over-optimistic.

21...Nc8

The knight is coming to f5.

22.Rg3

[diagram]
It is good to have a simple plan, but you should implement it with a certain level of intelligence and attention to the opponent's options. Here I wanted to put the knight on f5, without having to think about the pawn structure which would arise after 22...^d6

23.Nxd5 cxd5. This is probably good for

Black, but I wanted to keep the advantages I had, rather than exchange them for different ones - especially since my opponent was doing so poorly in dealing with the problems he had.

23.Ne2?!

Clearly White is losing his grip. After 23.ilf4 Ne7 24Jie5 Nf5 25.Sh3 Bg7 I like my position, but I am not sure if I am objectively better. But now White's position disintegrates.

23...Nd6? 24.Nf4?

24.,S,g5 was the last chance.

[diagram]
25.SH3

After 25Jbcf5 exf5 26.Qxf5 I was planning the simple 26.. Jke4, followed by taking on d4. But even more accurate is 26...jbcd4! with a winning position. The obvious threat is ...Be4 followed by ...jbtf2*|\ but we should also notice what the idea is against 27.Rfl:

[diagram]
27..Jbcf2t! and White can only resign.

Now we had a moment where it clearly makes sense to calculate. Black can take on h6 and have a nice and safe advantage - but there is also the pawn on d4. From afar I was sure that I could take it, yet I still checked everything carefully, looking for plausible faults, but found none.

27.Hxd4 Jbcd4 28.Qxd4, which initially looks

plausible, but where Black can win either by taking on g2 or with the move I had planned:

28..J,e4!

26...fxg6 27.5Bxg6 hxg6

Simplest, eliminating the attacker. Chapter 2 - Pieces 95

27.M3 28.gxf3 fte2t 29.Ng2 Sxdl also

looked promising, but unlike computers, I find the position to be quite unclear! 28Jfxg6tlg7

[diagram]
29.1g5

Jakob was running out of time and could find nothing. This was actually a good day for me, and right back at move 23 I had seen how to deal with:

29.Sxd4

Indeed, the only winning move is:

29...Be4!

29...e5 30.Rxd5 cxd5 31 J^g5 and White has

a real attack going. Black will have to defend accurately to survive.

[diagram]
30.ffg3

I found this to be the most challenging and it took me some time to find the right answer.

30.Rxd7 is objectively better, but it leads by

force to an endgame where Black has a great bishop against two weak pawns.

It will always be important information, although it will not always be something you can use actively on the next move. M. Rasmussen - Ziska, Helsingor 2007 Vallejo Pons - Leko, Monte Carlo 2004

Blacks worst-placed piece is the knight on a6. He is able to bring it into play by a simple tactic.

double-edged. After 21.Nxd4 cxd4 22.^dl £k5 23.b4 ^e4 24JLel both players can find good things to say about their position, and it is not obvious which side to support. 2lJfdl?

23.bxc3 @c7^.

In the long term the a-pawn and the c5- square are great assets for Black.

may prefer the more positional 21...^xd3!?

position is collapsing because of 24.cxb5 Rxe2

25.^xe2 Jbcb5 26.£\cl Se8! with a strong

attack. The latter line is the one I came up with in order to answer a pupil who asked why the queen move was no good. However, had I spotted the hanging d-pawn, I would not have gone into such elaborate measures. That said, I still like the positional line because it shows the potential in the black pieces, and objectively it is at least as strong as simply grabbing the pawn.

21...Nxd3 22.Sxd3 Qa6! 23.b3 b5+

Black has a fantastic attack on the light squares and won in 51 moves.

2. Shaw - Hebden

Liverpool 2006

White wants to play Sgl and g4-g5, in the long term, to cramp the black pieces. He might also want to exchange the light-squared bishops at some point with ^g4. Black's worst Chapter 2 - Pieces 101 pieces are the h7-knight and g7-bishop. Both have been moved, but are unhappy where they are. The weakness in the white position is the dark squares, especially f4, so it is natural to seek an influence there, which is exactly what Black did.

White is of course better, but the e5-bishop is strong, so proving this advantage will not be altogether easy.

14.Nh4 is a funny move, but it does not really

solve the issue with the dark squares. Black has several tempting replies, for example: I4...^e5 15Jbce5 Qxe5 16.Qxh5 gxh4 17.Qxh4 jbd7 with the idea of ...b5 with counterplay. Again the extra pawn counts for something, but how much is hard to tell.

14...dxe5

Forced. I4...5^f4 does not work. White plays 15.exd6, when Black cannot recapture. And after 15...Qf6 16.Ne4 Qxb2 17.Rbl Sfa3 White can choose between 18.jkc4 and

18.jbcf4 gxf4 19.5^eg5 h6 20.5^e6!, in both

cases with a winning position.

disintegration of the black position.

6. Roiz - Piscopo

Trieste 2010

[diagram]
Black's last move, 4...^d7, has left the bishop a bit exposed on g4. It seems innocuous, as an escape square can be arranged rather quickly. But the problem is that White will enjoy having his knight on g5 just fine, while Black has to place his pieces awkwardly.

5.Ng5!

Not the ideal square for the knight, but the alternatives 5...Qb6 6.h3 Jkc8 7.e4 and 5...h6

6.Nxf7! Nxf7 7.h3 are even more awkward.

White won on move 29.

7. Roiz - Bobras

Germany 2010

[diagram]
12.e5!

With this simple move White dominates all of the black minor pieces. The remainder of the game should have been Black suffocating slowly (or quickly), but instead he got off the hook when White misplayed a pawn-up endgame in very uncharacteristic fashion.

12...Sb8

12...b6 is the only move requiring a bit

of calculation. Even after exchanging on b6 or playing 13.a6 White is better, but the refutation is quite something: 13.Qa4! ?Bxa5 I4.b4 Nb7 15.^,a6 Hb8 16.Qc6 and White wins material. The pawns take care of the dark squares and the queen and bishop wins material on the light ones.

13.f4 e6 I4.d5?!

l4JLg2! made more sense; there is no great need for White to hurry. The proof of the pudding comes after eating the a7-pawn:

14...Ne7 15.d5 exd5 16.Nxa7±

14...exd5 15.£}xd5 b6 I6.axb6

8. Jakovenko - Eljanov

[diagram]
 White's position looks visually better. He has two bishops and his pieces are active. On top of this his king is safer - slightly passive, but safer. Of course, if the queens were exchanged, Black's king position would change from exposed to active. And the three slightly exposed pawns on a3, d4 and h4 would become more important. This is the reason for Eljanov's next move.

27..Jfe7!

Preparing ...^f5 and the exchange of queens. This will not solve all of Black's problems at once, but it goes a long way towards making Black's position playable.

28.g3

Not the most dangerous; White can retain a slight edge, though it is not easy to see how.

28.jk.d3 Nf5 29.Qa4! produces some problems

for Black, but they can all be solved. Wijk aan Zee 2007

[diagram]
 First he neutralizes the pressure down the c-file with 29...Rc8! and after the only dangerous idea 30.Sel he then plays:

30...^xh4 31."i,g3 Rc3! (An important move.

After 31...^g6? White gains an advantage with 32.f4!± with a strong attack. The main tactical point is 32...Qd7 33.f5!! Jbcf5 34Jkb5 and White wins the exchange after 34...Qb7

35."i,a6 with serious winning chances in the

resulting endgame. The weakness of the a7- pawn is a crucial factor.) 32.Qb5 (White has nothing after 32.j^,e2 ftf5 33.il,xh5t g6=)

32...Qxa3 33.ibch4 Qxb3 34.Qxb3 Rxb3

White has a tiny edge in this ending, but with decent play Black should hold comfortably. A very natural idea is 28.^e2 g6 29.Qa4 to get the queen to an active square with tempo. But there are downsides too - it does not solve the problem with the pawns, and the bishop is a bit exposed on e2. 29...ftf5 looks almost equalizing to me. 30.Hc7 and now:

[diagram]
a) 30...Bd7?! is punished by 31.@xa7! and the ghost of the passed a-pawn will haunt Black for a long time. A possible line is: 31...£}xd4

32.ifl Sxc7 33.1xc7 <Sxb3 34.Qxb6 Rc5

(34...Nd2? 35.il,d8!± and the f6-square/pawn is a target.) 35.a4± Maybe Black can draw this, but it is certainly uncomfortable, and White has other options on the way. b) 30...j^d7! A nice tactic based on the ...^xd4-e6 threat. White has only one reasonable way to react: 31.Jk.b5! (31.Qxa7? Nxd4+) 31...Qelt 32jkfl Ne8 33.Qa6 (33.Qxa7 Nxd4 34.Qa6! ^,b5 35.Qxb6 Wxflf 36.^h2 Qxf2 37.Qxf6 £}f3t 38.^h3 miraculously offers White a draw!) 33...Nxd4

34.Scl Qe4 35.^e3 £k6°°

28.jbcd6! is a very clever idea.

[diagram]
 The main point is that the exchange of queens would be followed by jkb5! and the rook entering the game on c7, when Black would be under some technical pressure.

28...Rxd6 29.Qd2± White manages to hold

on to some of his advantages, mainly the more active rook and better king position. Black should be able to defend successfully, but had this happened, there would definitely have been scope for another exercise!

10. Gashimov - Mamedyarov

Elista 2008

[diagram]
White has an inactive bishop on d3. The great weakness in the black position is the pawn on e6 (and the light squares in general as a consequence of the earlier exchange of White's dark-squared bishop for the f6- knight). So the solution is to bring the bishop to b3, from where it can put pressure on e6. Simple chess, but very effective.

White needs to sort out the problem with the knight on a4. This piece would be well placed on d3, which explains Adams' play.

19.Be4!± Sb8

Black is freeing the queen by protecting the bishop once more.

20.Nb2?!

This is maybe a bit too rushed, as Black has a reasonable counter available.

20.Hadl!± is more flexible. White retains the

option of ^b2-d3, but prefers to wait for Black to play ...^b6 first. And in the case of

20...Qa5 White can switch his play to the

other side of the board with 21.h4!->.

20..Jfd8?!

20...ibce4 21.Bxc4 Qa5! looks like a better

defensive try. After 22.Qcl Qa3! Black would be ready for ...a6-a5-a4 with counterplay, so White should instead return to a4 with the knight, but clearly time has been lost.

12. Razuvaev - Stohl

Germany 1992

This position is relatively easy to understand. Black has a bad bishop on d6. White secures an advantage by taking control of the light Chapter 2 - Pieces 109 squares around it, and condemns the black pieces to passivity.

23.b5!=

Had it been Black to play, maybe ...b5 would have been his move.

23...axb5 24.Qxb5 b6

Other moves are possible, but it is clear that White's little operation has been a success.

13. Zvjaginsev - Wang Hao

Taiyuan 2007

[diagram]
White has achieved quite a comfortable position out of the opening, but needs to breathe more life into his pieces in order to make something of it. To do so he will have to advance his pawns on the queenside eventually, while also putting some pressure on Black in the centre and making it hard for him to mobilize his forces. Looking at the black position, we can see that the bishops are a bit exposed. Combine these factors and we have an obvious candidate.

15.Ne2!±

A nice multipurpose move that aims to harass the black bishops, at the same time clearing the way to reinforce the d4-pawn with j|,d2-c3 and preparing to advance with b2-b4.

15...Nbd7

In a bad position there are no good moves. Black decides to give up his bishop in order to get his pieces out. Had he chosen otherwise, he might have been criticised for neglecting his development. The fact of the matter is that he was facing an unpleasant choice.

15...1kf8 is probably best answered by the

simple I6.h3 followed by Nf4 with a serious advantage. I6.Nf4 17.iLc3 ild6 18.Nxe6 5^xe6

14. Shomoev - Sebag

Moscow 2010

[diagram]
This position could be a little controversial. The computers I have asked do not fully agree about the power of Shomoev's move. Hopefully I will be able to explain it convincingly. I4.±b4! The point of this move is two-fold. First of all White is ridding himself of his bad bishop, a general positional idea. Secondly, by exchanging it for the knight, he is creating a position where the bishop on c8 will always be bad. This is a simple case of good pieces and bad pieces. I do not want to make it any more complicated than this, though of course it is more complicated than this in practice. l4...Se8 15.1xe7Qxe7 16.Nc5 Sd8 17.Scl Sb8 18.b3 kb7 19.2c4± White won on move 45. My evaluation here is "close to winning", albeit with a lot of practical problems to overcome.

15. Anand - Wang Hao

Wijk aan Zee 2011

[diagram]
This theoretical position was considered decent for Black until this game. But actually Anand s novelty is not so difficult to work out. Black has sacrificed a pawn in order to split White's pawns and get active play against them. The hint as to the solution to this position is the lame goat on e2. It is almost impossible to find a good square for this knight, no matter how far you manoeuvre it around, so the idea of just giving it up should pop into your mind sooner or later - it just takes a little imagination. l6Ad4! exd4 17.cxd4 fibc6 This leaves the knight on a5 out on a limb to some extent, but there is not really any alternative - Black needs to get into the game quickly and must be prepared to give back the piece.

18 Jfc3 Ne7

A necessity. 18...Had8 19.d5 ibcd5 20.exd5 Hxd5 21.Sadi is poor for Black. The two bishops are simply too much for Black to deal with over time.

19.Sfdl Sad8

20.1E2!

The bishop is heading for greener pastures. The lack of his dark-squared bishop is deeply damaging for Black.

16. Carlsen - Anand

Monaco (blindfold) 2011 Black is offered the chance to give White tripled pawns. The question is whether this is a good thing or not - and the answer is yes, although it is quite double-edged. The main swaying factors are that the bishop on d7/c6 will find little resistance on the light squares and that the white bishop will find it difficult to live up to its full potential, as the pawns on c3 and c5 prevent it using the long diagonal. f g h It is apparent that White will have to exchange his bishop in a moment. The question is of course for which minor piece. The easiest way for us to determine this is to investigate the positions arising from the various options and look at their positional features one by one. This can be time-consuming and grandmasters will not do this consciously, but they will do it subconsciously.

19.ibcc5!

19.ibtg5? Qxg5 gives White nothing. For

example, 20.Qg3 Qxg3 21.^xg3 f4 22.?}fl a5 and Black is by no means worse.

18. Aagaard -1. Almasi

Budapest 1996

Chapter 2 - Pieces 113 The worst-placed piece is the rook on a 1, so we need to find a square for it.

Whites main superiority as far as I could see was on the kingside and for this reason I decided to double on the e-file.

17.Se2!

17.Ne5 a5!?

17...a6

A rather passive move with no plan at all. Istvan had seen a game where Black played very similarly to our game, but this is not enough. You have to react to your opponents moves and intentions; playing according to general ideas without understanding the undercurrent of positional considerations and ideas is a poor strategy.

17..Jkc6± was probably the best move. White

will take the bishop (to prevent it from coming to d5 and offering Black enough defensive resources) and have a slight edge in a rather technical position. Now he has time enough to generate an attack.

18.Rael Nh8?

Black felt forced to play this because of the threat of ^xe6. But it is really an ugly move and he should not have allowed himself to play it.

of course, as the a-pawn might have preferred to be on a7 in many lines, but nevertheless this was necessary. I9±c5 Sffi

Also after 20...Bc8 White will win. This time with 21.Qh3 h6 22.g4! and there is too much pressure on the kingside. For example:

White is not happy in the middlegame where his exposed king is a problem.

has several good moves, for example 23.Qc5! attacking the e5-pawn. 23...Q8d7 24.Qc7 Black is tied down, making it only a matter of time before he loses material.

17.±h4!

This strong move exploits the lack of good squares for the black queen as well as the main problem behind Blacks last move (l6...Sb8?). Maybe the best reply would be to return with

17...Ra8, but this is hardly inspiring, of course.

[diagram]
17...Nd5 18.iLg3 £\f4 19.Ne5+ is bad.

18.1g3

[diagram]
Usually in this variation Black equalizes quite easily by exchanging his c-pawn, but here, because of Black's unfortunate 16th move, White has gained enough time to put strong pressure on the pawns. Here 21...c5? is met with 22.£}xd7 and dxc5, winning a decisive amount of material.

[diagram]
It is understandable that Wells could not resist forcing the black rook to a5, but the simple 22.£}xd7 Rxd7 23.Qxa6 Sa5 24.Qe2 with an extra pawn and the two bishops should also give White fantastic winning chances.

22...5a5 23.Qc2 c5 24.d5 la4?!

It is as if White is moving the pieces for both players here. With this move Black is trapping his own rook, a factor that decides the game in just a few moves time. The best move was 24...Ra3, even though White would still have a clear advantage after

25.Sael. It is because of this variation that I

believe 22.£}xd7 was more convincing. Chapter 2 - Pieces 117

25.Qe2 Jlft) 26.dxe6 fxe6 27.Sab 1+-

White won the game on move 44.

23. Danstrup - Aabling-Hiomsen

20...£\xd4 21 Jbicd4 Jlxd4t

A typical idea. Besides getting rid of White's good bishop and his bishop pair at the same time, his only knight is also exchanged, which allows Black to commit what might superficially appear to be a strategic "blunder".

22.1efxd4 e5!

The d5-square is not weak, because it cannot be occupied. However, the d4-square really is weak, because it can be occupied! Black's play is easier because his knight is superior to the bishop, but the advantage is slight at this point, of course.

23.Qe3 Ne6? 24.b4 Rc7 25.a3 Re7

The game would be hard for Black to win against good defence, but now White blunders.

dropping his queen, White would have to resort to the rather ridiculous 28.Nf2.

Chapter 3 Prophylaxis Nadezhda Kosintseva - Lilit Mkrtchian Jcrmuk 2012

[diagram]
Black to play In a game between two of the top women players in the world, White is looking for an attack on the kingside as well as a small positional trick. How should Black address this? Chess is played with pieces, and games are won by attacking the opponent's weaknesses. But it is not enough to focus on our own ambitions; we have to remember that our opponent has every second move. This is why it is important for us to include prophylactic thinking in our arsenal of thinking tools. In this chapter we will look at some of the most common aspects of prophylactic thinking. Hie idea behind the last move Prophylactic thinking is best described as attention to the opponents ideas. It is not the reaction to them or the prevention of them; it is simply taking them into account. One of the ways to do this is to think about the point of your opponent's last move. Jacob Aagaard - Davit Shengelia Porto Carras 2011

[diagram]
With my last move, 12.j|,cl-d2?!, I had anticipated my opponent's obvious break, but had not seen far enough. It transpires that the bishop needed to be on f4, when White was probably a bit better.

12...dxc4! 13.ilxc4 c5!

After he played this, I sank into deep, desperate thought. My opponent had anticipated my planned reply to this break,

14.d5 exd5 15Jbcd5, which gave him the

chance to look deeper and see that 15...Nxe5! would give him^a significant advantage. So instead I decided to complete my development with the aid of a tactical idea. l4.Scl? In retrospect, it would have been better to fight for equality with I4.dxc5 Nxc5 15.£}xc5 Jbcc5 I6.a6b6 17.Scl, when White is probably still sort of okay.

[diagram]
Again it makes sense for Black to ask himself what White intended with his last move. It appears that taking twice on d4 and then e5 is not possible, as White can then play 17.^xe6! with an advantage. Armed with this knowledge, my opponent looked for a flaw in my thinking - and found it. I4...Nxd4! I now played 15."fi,c3 and managed to create some resistance before I blundered again at move 40. The main point of my opponent's play becomes visible only after: Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 121

15.^bxd4 cxd4 16.^xd4

[diagram]
As said, Black will not fall for 16...^xe5?

17.^xe6! when White has the advantage. He

no doubt intended to play:

16...Sxc4! 17.Sxc4 Jld3

And the e5-pawn will be lost. But of course prophylaxis can at times be far more basic. In the following example Black failed to look for his opponent's idea carefully enough, and went down in a very painful way. Karen Grigoryan - Yaroslav Zherebukh Athens 2012

[diagram]
Prophylaxis exists in tactics as well, of course. The following is a good example of how we need to look a bit deeper into our opponent's thoughts and ideas. Seemingly a winning attempt, but actually it loses directly. After 29.. Jbce6 30.Qxe6t Nh7 31 .Qh3 Sc8!? White would struggle to prove compensation for his sacrificed piece.

30.6 iR,xe6

30...g5 was not the intention, of course.

White wins after 31 .Jbcg5 Bxe6 32.fxe6f ^g8

33.e7 Qc8 34.Qg3 Qe6 35.ikf6 Sf7 36.Qxd6

with total domination.

31.fxg6f!

[diagram]
This must have come as a complete shock to poor Zherebukh. White would much rather have a pawn on g6 than on e6. But in reality it was not so difficult to predict this move if you took the time to look carefully for it.

31...Ng8 32.1fxe6t &I18 33.1ff5

White does not close the deal in the most effective way, but wins anyway.

33.Hf5! was immediately decisive.

33...Sb5 34Jfh3 Sh5 35.%4 Sh6 36 Jfe6

Rb8 37.1g5! Nd4

37...Qg8 38.Qxd6 Bh5 39.1f6 gives White

a winning attack, but it takes a bit of effort. For example: 39...^e5 40.g4! Nxg4 4l.lxg7t <^?xg7 42.Rf7t and White wins.

38.fff7 Sh5 39.kf6

1-0 What would your opponent do now if he was to move? (What are his short-term goals?) One of the questions you might find useful is: What would my opponent do if he was to move? Looking at the position from the other side of the board (though not physically - that would be weird!) can help you to understand the position better; or at least to avoid accidents like the following... Nasir Ahmed - John Shaw Edinburgh 2003

[diagram]
Had John looked for his opponent's threat, he would have seen it quite quickly and played

29...Rbe8!, when he probably would have won

the game. However, John focused only on his own threats and ideas and tried to provoke White into advancing his g-pawn, so that he could put a knight on f5 with complete domination. The punishment was swift and brutal.

29...1d7? 30 Jfe3!±

We now see that White wants to play f4-f5 to activate his bishop and maybe improve things with f5-f6f npct. This is possible because of the threat down the e-file. Had Black placed his rook on e8, ideas like this would not have worked.

30...1xg4?

This is rubbish, but John is in trouble anyway. Necessary was 30...Qdf5 31.gxf5 ^xf5 32.Qf3 RLc6, when Black has some compensation for the piece and practical chances (to swindle).

31.6 &ex6 32.1e5t

This is good enough, but even stronger was

32.ibcd6 Nxe3 33.1e5t ^f8 34.Bxe3 and

Black is losing everything.

32...fS 33.Jhcd6 Nxe3 34.Sxe3 ^6 35.5x6

1x6 36.1xb8 d4 37.Se7t Nh6 38.1f4t g5

39.1d2 dxc3 40.itxc3

1-0 Your opponent's long-term goals Prophylaxis can be quite deep, of course, but it is always a question of style. For example, Petrosian was famous for preventing his opponents' ideas long before they ever got the chance to have them. And Karpov probably spent more of his time looking for ways to eliminate his opponent's possible desires than any other World Champion, which explains why he drew so often with Black. With White, he would prevent his opponent from equalizing and keep the pressure on, until a Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 123 pleasant ending would arise. With Black, he would prevent the opponent from gaining an advantage, rather than looking for ways to gain one himself. Is this you? If you are an attacking player, then probably not. On the other hand, if you are more like an accountant than an axe- wielding madman, maybe this is you. In general, prophylaxis becomes more important when you have a static advantage. In endgames, following the advice, "Do not hurry!" and preventing counterplay are the key technical tools. But the principle seems sound in all phases of the game. Here is a good example straight out of the opening. Pavel Eljanov - Gata Kamsky Kallithea 2008

[diagram]
Black is under slight pressure down the long diagonal and will have to free himself with ...Hc8 and ...d6, as after 14...d5? 15.cxd5 cxd5 I6.^xd5! White wins material. Blacks weakness is the h5-pawn, so Eljanov decided to prepare the Ne5-d3-f4 manoeuvre to put pressure on it. I4.e3! Defending the d4-pawn in advance. White could have reversed his 14th and 15th moves, but this is more human and maybe a bit more flexible.

14...Sc8 15.Sacl!

Eljanov again prevents his opponent's idea. It is slightly less important that White also would be much better after 15.£}d3 d5, because of I6.cxd5 Jbcd3 17.Sxd3 (Eljanov only considers 17.d6, which also gives White some advantage.) 17...cxd5
[diagram]
18.^xd5! exd5 19.9xd5 Qd7 20.Qxh5±

White will also grab the g4-pawn with a huge advantage, as Black would shed more material after 20...^f6 21.@e5!. The game is of course not decided yet, but Black is going to struggle to prove his compensation. Still Eljanov's solution is simply better; it involves no risk and leaves Black with no easy choices.

15...d6 16.Nd3 kh6

I do not particularly like this move; it relies too much on White putting his knight on f4, as the bishop will otherwise be entirely out of play. After 16...SW 17.fcf4 QfiS 18.Ne4± Black would find defending the h5-pawn very difficult.

[diagram]
17.Qa4!?

Again a beautiful practical decision by Eljanov. White is preparing d4-d5 and an assault on the light squares, now that the dark- squared bishop is out of play on h6. Having said that, we should note that 17.Nf4 was perfectly fine as well: 17...iLxf4 18.exf4 <5W 19.Sel!
[diagram]
 There is no way for Black to defend against the threats of f4-f5 and d4-d5, as White is planning to play Qa3 or Qa4, forking important squares. I think White is more or less winning already.

17...Ab7 18.d5

White continues with his plan. Putting the knight on f4 was still a serious option.

18...b5

Desperation. 18...cxd5 19.cxd5 e5 also does not work. White would play 20.^b4!± and Jke4-f5 with close to complete domination.

[diagram]
19.dxc6!

A nice little tactic that effectively wins the game. Again there was a plausible alternative:

19.cxb5 cxd5 20.ibcd5! Sxc3 2ljbcb7 Sxcl

22.iixa8 Sxdlt 23.Qxdl and White has an

extra pawn. On the other hand, Black has managed to solve some of his problems and he might have a chance of saving the ending.

19..Jbtc6 20.^xb5 a6 21.ilxc6 Nxc6

22.Nc3

White has won a pawn and won the game on move 53. Good prophylactic play by Eljanov in a position where many would have looked too soon for a dynamic way to exploit the advantage. The next example shows how we should be careful not to allow our opponents even small improvements; something we can only do if we pay sufficient attention to their intentions. In this example we shall discuss various aspects of prophylactic thinking - armed with the power of hindsight.

[diagram]
Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 125 Svetozar Gligoric - Wolfgang Unzicker Bath 1973

[diagram]
We join the game in the middle of the middlegame, in a position where White is evidently better. His pawn structure is preferable and his pieces are better placed. Still, it is no catastrophe, and Black should be able to save the game with good play.

27.b3

Played for several reasons, but primarily in order to regroup the bishop from e3 to b2, to take control of the e5-square, which will enable White to gain the two bishops, and put pressure on the black kingside down the long diagonal.

27...5fd8 28.1cl

This is the critical moment where Black does not have an easy move, but has to think hard about how to counter his opponent's idea.

28...5MS?

At first I was not entirely sure what the idea was behind this move. Usually grandmasters have an idea behind their moves (always, according to Mark Dvoretsky), but here it took me a long time to see it. It seems that Black is clearing the e7-square to create a route for his knight to get to c6/d4 to fight for the dark squares. This manoeuvre takes a lot of time and not surprisingly fails by a tempo. 29±b2 h6
[diagram]
30.Ng2!

Fabulous technique by Gligoric. He saw the possibility of 30.fte5 being met with

30...ibce5 3lJbce5 c4!?, and decided not to

allow unnecessary counterplay.
[diagram]
 Whether or not this actually works is beside the point. Calculating long lines here would not be practical, while the move in the game can be played without calculation. Anyway, the consequences of the sacrifice are: 32.Qxc4 Sc8 33.Qa6 Qc5t 34.Ng2 Scd8 35.Bxf6 gxf6 36.1e2 Sd2 37.Sxd2 Sxd2 38.Sdl Sb2

39.^fl!± White has won a pawn and the black

king is somewhat exposed. But the position

[diagram]
still has some random character, and it was entirely unnecessary to allow that.

30...Ng8 31.Ne5!

Relying on the coming tactics. 31.J.e5!? was also possible, but Gligoric certainly had everything mapped out at this point.

31..Jbce5 32.Bxe5 Sk7 33.1b5!

[diagram]
Otherwise Black would come to c6 and d4 with the knight and have a respectable position. But Un/icker had planned a tactic.

33...£}d5!? 34.Qcl 5Be3t 35.Qxe3 Sxdl

36.Sxdl Sxdl 37.Qxh6f Jth7 38.jtc4

Gligoric had correctly assessed this position. Black has won an exchange but is entirely lost.

38..Jff7

38...Qe7 39.g4 Sd8

[diagram]
40.g5 Qf7 41 Jkxe6 Qg6 42."S,c4 White keeps

the pressure on and will win the game. Black has no reasonable defence against the advance of the h-pawn.

39.1xe6 %6 40.Qf4 Sd8 4l.lf7!

4l...Qc6 42.Qg5 wins the house. 1-0 So, with the benefit of hindsight, we can see that Black should have fought against the occupation of the e5-square with all his might. This would have been a difficult task, but I think it was possible with 28...Nh5!?=

[diagram]
White plays 29.^g2 with some advantage, and eventually Black will feel that the knight is poorly placed on h5. But in the meantime White finds it difficult to occupy the e5- square, and his king is a bit iffy. The key point is the line:

29.Bb2?! Qg5!

Black suddenly has threats against the white king. Now 30.^,cl £tf4\ secures Black even chances, And otherwise Black may be able to sacrifice:

30.gf2 Nxg3!? 31.hxg3 Qxg3t 32.<&fl Bh5

32...Bf8 33.ike2 Bdf7oo is risky, but may be

playable.

33 J,e2 Qh3t 34.^gl Qg3t 35.&fl

With perpetual check. Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 127 The next example could just as well have been placed in the weaknesses chapter; but then almost every interesting position could be explained in terms of that paradigm! Nadezhda Kosintseva - Lilit Mkrtchian Jermuk 2012

[diagram]
If this position had been in Chapter 1, it would have been under the headline of Eliminating your own weaknesses. At the moment White has no problems with the c2-pawn, but Black is planning ...Nc8 to eliminate the disturbing knight and bring the f8-rook into play. For this reason the best move here is 21.c4!, after which Black keeps even chances with accurate play. Instead she played:

21.SB? Rc6l

The ideas above are pretty simple and Kosintseva of course understood them perfectly. She was no doubt planning to meet 21 ,..^c8 with

22.c4, taking advantage of the misplacement of

the black knight. By first attacking the c-pawn, all ideas with c2-c4 die, and White has to do more to get rid of her weakness.

22.c3 Nc8 23.Sh3?!

This is a shot in the dark. Black easily defends her kingside. It was necessary to change the course of the game, and this could have been done with

23.f5!? Nxd6 24.exd6 9xd6 25.c4!56, when I

think White would still have managed to keep the balance more or less; even if it is less fun to have compensation for the pawn here, than it is to have the extra pawn.

[diagram]
Black has a better structure and won the game on move 44. Prophylactic thinking in action - combine it with your own ideas Up to this point we have repeatedly seen how sound prophylactic thinking can be combined with achieving our own goals. In the following position Black is looking for ways to complete his development and get rid of his potentially weak pawn on d7 (as well as take control over the d-file). At the same time he managed to look out for his opponent's ideas. Ed Ferry - Jacob Aagaard Bearsden 2007

[diagram]
White is struggling a bit. His pieces are not well placed and Black has managed to obtain the two bishops. However, if he can play Nd3 and either £}f4 or Jkb4, things would change quite quickly and the advantage Black has at the moment could quickly disappear. To counter this plan is Blacks main objective in this position. I managed to do so by assaulting the centre at the same time.

[diagram]
Lines I looked at during the game were

16..Jfb6 17.Nd3 Sc2 18.Sfcl gfc8 19!b4!=

and 16...f6 17.^d3 fxe5 18.dxe5 Hc4 19.f3°°, although not with the detail, accuracy and confidence I can attach now after looking at the game with computer assistance. My main idea with the game move is that

17.^d3 dxe5 would force White to play

18.ftxe5, because of 18.dxe5? M,c4.

17.1b4

This is of coursc the apparent problem with my move. But I had something special planned here.

17...dxe5

17...a5+ was also very strong, but I like my

move best.

18.ilxe7 Qxe7 19.dxe5 Bc4 20.^d3

[diagram]
This is the second moment of prophylaxis in the game. I correctly evaluated the "main" defensive option, the one he went for in the game. But we both missed that he had another option that would have held his position together.

20...5fd8?

The game was played with only one hour for the first thirty moves, which is the excuse for this inaccuracy.

20...Qd7! 21.Sfdl Sfd8 would transpose to

the game.

21.Sfdl?

White misses a great tactical defence. He should have played 21.Bfcl!, when Black only has traces of an advantage due to the exploitation of the back rank.

[diagram]
The best try is probably 21..Jbcd3 22.Hxc8 Bxc8 23.Qxd3 Qg5 24.Hel Sd8 25.Qc3 Qd2

26.QclT, but it is not much.

21..Jfd7 22.Sd2

This looks like the best chance, but I was ready for it. Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 129

[diagram]
22..Jfd4!!

I cannot force the win of a piece, but I can create a pawn weakness in the white position.

23.Radl Qxe3 24.fxe3 jbcd3?

This is entirely unnecessary. The bishop outshines the knight in each and every way. Somehow I had the idea that the rook ending was just winning, which is more than a bit optimistic.

25.Sxd3 Sxd3 26.Sxd3 g5!/+

White might still have some fighting chances in the endgame, especially if he manages to keep out the black king on the kingside by putting a pawn on g4. However, this is not the only problem in the position. If Black manages to play ...a5 and ...2c5, it seems very unlikely that White will be able to hold. For this reason the only move was 27.Sa3!?.

27.Sd6?

After this the ending is lost.

27...a5 28.2a6 a4 29.b3 axb3 30.axb3 2c3

The most important feature of this position is that Black has not yet managed to develop his pieces and bring his king to safety. With a simple move White makes this very difficult to accomplish, and he has already half won the game. I4.Bd4!± Simple, but deeply annoying. I4.f5 Be7 gives Black decent counterplay. The two bishops will have an effcct in the long run.

14...ftS

What else should Black play? I4...d6 leaves White with many tempting moves - such as

15."Ne5!? - but probably it is best to play 15.f5!

with various threats to the black kingside.

2. Ivanchuk - L.B. Hansen

Skanderborg 2005

[diagram]
White needs to make the most out of the pin and to rid himself of his worthless pawn on c2. This can be done with simple moves:

16.&hl! N7c6

I6...f6 17.c4± does not look much of an improvement to me.

17.c4! dxc4?!

This is a bit compliant, although it is fair to say that Black had no easy solutions available to him. After 17...Sfd8 18.Hel f6 19.cxd5 Hxd5 20.Qb3 he finds himself pinned in three directions. The best option should be to run from the pin, but after 17...Qd8! 18.iixc6 ftxc6 19.b5
[diagram]
 White keeps the initiative, having taken the chance to advance on the queenside. Best play seems to be: 19...^a5 20.cxd5 Qxd5 21.Qxd5 exd5 22.Rfdl Sfd8 23Jkd6± I am not sure how difficult it will be for White to untangle his pieces after he wins the d5-pawn, so I don't want to call it a clear advantage just yet, but it is fair to say that we are closer to that than to equality.

18.Qe2 fG 19.ilxc4±

White has a very big advantage; there is not much positive to say about the black position.

3. Schwing - Becking

Merzig 1996

[diagram]
In the game White played 14.O-O? and after I4...iic6= Black did not face any problems. In his book Grandmaster Repertoire 1 - l.d.4 Volume One, Israeli Grandmaster Boris Avrukh points out that White could have prevented his opponent's rather obvious idea with I4.b5!, when it is much harder for Black to complete his development. It seems that the only move with a fighting chance is I4...a6, when White can play 15.O-O with a slight edge, or be more optimistic and play 15.b6! Qc8 I6.Na5 Nc6

17.N3c4±.

[diagram]
 It is clear that Black will have problems with the b7-pawn for a very long time; his position is truly unpleasant.

4. Skripchenko - Benmesbah

[diagram]
Pau 2008

[diagram]
Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 137 Black wishes to finish her development with ...b6, when the disadvantage of having played ...f6 is more or less cancelled out by the two bishops. The other manoeuvre to be considered is ...Qe5-c6, with a tenable position. In the game White prevented this by simple means.

13.Qa7!

The most precise move. White is not only preventing Blacks two main ideas, but may also carry out plans involving !b6.

13.a5= would not really prevent Black from

advancing the b-pawn, although that would make a weakness out of the a6-pawn. And 13.Qd2 Qe5 14.f4 Qc6 15.Qb6 ld8

16.Qxc7 ikxc7 17.Qc4 Ne7 18.a5± is of

course unpleasant for Black, however it is by no means terminal.

13...O-O

13...b6 is prevented, and 13...Qe5?? would

simply lose a rook. "

13...1.8! was the best defensive try. White is

better, but there is no overwhelming advantage after I4.a5 b6 15.axb6 Qxb6 I6.Qxc7 Jbcc7

17.b3=, although the position is definitely

unpleasant for Black.

14.a5±

l4.Sd2± followed by Sadi was also very strong.

14..JU8

This move arrives too late and offers fewer chances than on the previous move.

14...Qc5!? may be Blacks best try, though

15.Sa3± preparing 16.b4 is promising for

White.

15.ilb6 Qc6 I6.jbtd8 Sxd8

17.^d4 Qc4 18.Qa4

5. P. Carlsson - A. Smith

Stockholm 2007

[diagram]
The black king is obviously weak in the centre, but it will take some time for White to get through to it. In the meantime Black is threatening to break through on the kingside, specifically on g4 and g2. White found a simple and elegant way to keep the g-file closed, turning the immediate mess into a long-term initiative without significant counterplay.

29.h3! fxg4 30.h4!

White has successfully closed the g-file and is simply winning.

30...Qd5 31.axb6?!

Probably 31.e6! was even stronger, as it would be hard for Black to become active.
[diagram]
 For example: 31...O-O-O 32.j^c7!, with the idea 32...Rde8 33.axb6 Rxe6 34.Sxe6 Qxe6

35.itd8! and White wins.

31...axb6 32.Sxb6 Sa2?!

I think that 32...2a3 33.Rb3 Sxb3 34.cxb3 Rg7 was the correct way to play. White is probably winning, but the threat to g2 makes the conversion a bit less smooth than White might have hoped a few moves back.

33.Sebl Sg7

33...ikc8 34.e6! would lead to similar

devastation.

34.e6!

Closing in on the king and threatening things such as Sfl.

34...5xc2 35.Rxb7!

The final combination.

35...5xb7 36.2xb7 Qxb7 37.Qxg4

6. Anand - Morozevich

World Championship, Mexico City 2007

[diagram]
White has a very pleasant position from a static point of view. His knight will make it to d5 and control the position, while he will be able to put pressure on the black queenside once he is fully organized. The only thing to watch out for is that Black should not be allowed to create counterplay.

27.Qg2!

After 27.£k3?! Black would be able to push White backwards with 27...Rh4 28.Bg2 Sh3. White still has the better chances after 29.^d5 Bh4 30.Bb3±, but the game has entered a more random phase that might very well include a pawn race towards the end.

27.h3?! also allows Black to solve one of

his problems, the backward pawn on d6.

27...d5! This pawn is immune because of

28.Bxd5 iUi4 or 28.exd5? e4. So White has

to play 28.Nc3 d4 29.Nd5 S4f7 30.Qg2±. Obviously it is still a bit more pleasant to be White, but the change in the pawn structure is a definite improvement for Black.

27.Nb4 Sh4 28.Sg2 h6±

Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 139 Black no longer has any great breaks.

28.h3 Qh6 29.Sb3! b5 30.Nb4±

Black is about to exchange his weak bishop on f8 for Whites bishop on d2 in order to gain control of the f4-square. If Black is successful in this, he will be okay and not suffer too badly from the pressure he is feeling down the half¬ open files. White therefore has to take control of the f4-square urgently.

38.5}gl! Jji6 39.ilxh6 Nxh6 40.N h3

40.£}e2!? is also a reasonable move, but the

knight is very well placed on h3. To decide between them is quite hard.

8. Gelfand - Leko

Miskolc (rapid) 2010
[diagram]
 If White is given time to play Jkf4-e3 and maybe b2-b3, breaking up the strong black pawn chain, he will be clearly better. Black must therefore find an immediate way to make the threat to the bishop on f4 real.

20...6!

The only move - the other options are worse:

20...Sxc5? is quite optimistic, but after

21.Qxc5 Qxf4 22.Qxa6± Black does not have

enough targets and activity to compensate for the exchange.

[diagram]
20...f6?! 21.Be3 fee5 22.b3 cxb3 23.axb3 kc7

24.Qd6t Bxd6 25.Sxd6±

Slow play also fails to solve Blacks problems. The moment White is organized, Black's position becomes too fragile: 20 ...Ne7?

9. Karjakin - Kramnik

Dortmund 2004

[diagram]
Black looks a little worse, mainly because he is not able to make anything out of his dark- squared bishop. You could easily imagine that the evaluation would be entirely different if the bishop was on e5! If we look carefully we will see that Black's only route for the bishop is from e7 to g7 via f8. By energetic play White was able to prevent this.

20.h4!!

A great move for a 14-year-old to play. Maybe he was lucky and just found move 22 when he got there? Probably not; players this great do not rely on luck and neither should you.

20. JUfc 21.h5 g6 22.h6±

Black is left in a very passive situation. Kramnik survived only by a miracle and because of his opponent's youth and inexperience.

10. Razuvaev - Sveshnikov

Moscow 1995

[diagram]
If White were able to complete his development he would be strategically winning. The b6-pawn is fantastic and the c6-pawn is likely to come under a devastating attack.

17.h4!

This prepares the development of the bishop to the obvious square d3 after which White is just much better.

17.<4,d3?! J^h3! would be irritating, and reduce

White's advantage to not very much. There was a serious alternative for White in

17.Jkd4!? Se8 18.^d 1, which looks decidedly

odti, but the white king is not especially exposed. You can believe that 18...^d7 19.<^e2 jkf6 20.Qd2 Nb7 21.Sel

[diagram]
would give White great winning chances. But why have the king on dl, when you can hide it in safety on gl?

17.Nd4 Qe8 18j,e2,Nh3!^

[diagram]
Now the bishop can come to c4 instead of d3.

17...5.8 18.,S,e2 Nd7 was more normal, but

White has a great advantage. For example:

22.Qxe2 Sxe2 23.Bd4 Sa2 24.Sel Nf8 25.Be3!

Ne5 26.Ng2 f6 27.Nd4 and it feels as if the black position is on the verge of a collapse.

From this point Black can try a lot of things, but essentially he is outplayed.

23...Qa4

23...Sxdlt 24.Hxdl Se8 25.1d6 is a typical

horror scenario. * After 25...Qxa2 26.h6 MM8 27.Rcl White dominates completely. And after 25...gxh5 26.Rcl Rc8 27.2xc8t Qxc8 28.Ng5 Qe8 the weakness of the h7- square is used to penetrate Black's position.

29.Qe4 f5 30.Qb7 Bh6 31.Nf3 Black is

13. Gasanov - Lastin

Dagomys 2009

[diagram]
The weakness in the black position is the pawn on f7, White's worst-placed piece is probably the bishop on fl and Black's idea is to play ...c5. All this spells only one solution:

20.c5!

20.Qce4 jkf8 21.c5 is too slow. Black has

time to play 21...Qxe4 22.Qxe4 h6, when White has only a slight advantage. Black is completely fine after 20 Jd3 h6!

21.Qce4 kcl 22.Qxf6t Nxf6 23.Qe4 Qxe4

24 Jxe4 jkc8 with more or less even chances.

14. Leko - Korchnoi

Black's idea is to play ...Qe4! to simplify the position and immediately solve the problems of his exposed queen. I do not think White

Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 145 can count on any real pressure in the endgame resulting from this. I4.gfel! Combining development and prophylaxis.

14...Nd7

The only move. A tactical error that comes close to losing the game all on its own.

15...Nb6!? was best, though White can claim a

slight edge with I6.b3, when the knight on b6 is out of play. This is not a great problem for Black of course, but at times all we can hope for is to cause the opponent minor inconvenience. I6.Radl Qc6

15. Volokitin - Eljanov

Foros 2008

[diagram]
In this typical Berlin-structure White usually achieves his aims by playing g3-g4, but this time around that is not going to work out. Instead it is Black that is planning to advance on the kingside with ...g5.

29.Nb5?!

White could kill all Black's play on the kingside with 29.h4!. A possible continuation could be 29...b6 30.Nb5 Se8, when I do not see any easy way for White to make progress, but in this rather stale position at least he can manoeuvre with more ease than Black. Although a draw is likely, that is certainly a great improvement on the game. Sometimes we need to avoid losing first of all!

20...Sad8 21.Sxd8 Sxd8 22.&el Ad4 29...g5+ 30.g4?!

Clearly Volokitin was relying on this idea - unfortunately it leads nowhere. 30.Bd8 Sxd8

31.Sxd8 gxf4 32.gxf4 fth4f and ...Ng6 also

leads to an advantage for Black.

30...gxf4 31.^13 Nh4t

It was even more decisive to flick in ...hxg4f first, but Black is on his way to winning the game anyway.

32.<Ne4 b6

Black won on move 48.

16. Van Wely - Wade

London 2008

[diagram]
White has a typical good knight against bad bishop, but he is lacking in targets and Black has decent pressure down the e-file, which occupies one of the white rooks. The only real weakness in the black camp is the g6-pawn, but rather than attacking this immediately, White should use the fact that Black is not planning anything active to improve his position first of all.

25.Nd3!

The knight goes to e5 where it is more active and blocks Blacks counterplay on the e-file. Only after this should White consider active options.

[diagram]
25...b6 26.Eg2 Ng7 27.Ne5 c5 28.bxc5

bxc5 29.Nxf7 *xf7 30.dxc5 favours White.

26.Ne5 Nf6 27.e4!?

It is not necessary to make this active decision yet, but it is not a poor choice either.

[diagram]
This weakens the black pawn structure unnecessarily Better was 27...Sd8 28.Sdl Bb3 29.Sd3 Be6 when Black is just waiting. White has a slight edge, but will it be enough to win the game?

28.Sg2 Sg8 29.Ne3 ±e6 30.Sh2

Having fulfilled its function on e5, the knight returns to f4.

33...6e7 34.^f4lf7

[diagram]
35.e5!?

To me this is a strange decision. Black can be happy that the pressure on his pawn structure is reduced.

35.exf5 gxf5 36.Bxf5 was tempting, although

opening the position up does give Black some activity as well. Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 147

35...Ne6?

This allows a nice sequence. The more natural 35...g5! was the right move: 36.hxg5 hxg5 37.Qe2 f4f 38.Nf2 Sd8 and Black looks fully okay.

36.d5! Ixd5 37.Nxd5t cxd5 38.Rc7t!

11.O-O-O, but the idea of h4-h5 does not work

so well when time has been invested in placing the pawn on h3 in the first place. The way for White to secure a small plus is by playing:

34.&gl Ne3 is immediately decisive. Instead

he made it all complicated and delayed the victory until move 102. Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 149

20. Kramnik - Ivanchuk

[diagram]
 White's big threat is f3-f4 followed by e4-e5, which could quickly bring Black to his knees. Black is able to reduce the impact of this.

[diagram]
30...Ng7 31.f4 g5 would be worse. After

32.fxg5 Se8!? 33.gxf6t Nxf6 34.Sflt Ne5

35.Sh3!± Black is under great pressure.

31.e5?!

This move throws away all chances of an advantage.

31.iLc4! Ne7 32.Ab5± is a safe way to retain a

small plus. 31 .g3!? is of course possible, but reveals another point to Blacks last move - the opening of the g-file will let Black show his positions potential: 31...^e8 32.f4?! White should go back to Jkc4-b5 and fight for an edge. 32...gxf4

33.gxf4 Sg8t 34.Nf2

34...f5! 35.e5 Sh6! 36.h3 Shg6 The ending is

very sharp, with chances for both sides.

31...fxe5 32.Sxe5 h6 33.Sbel Ng7 34.Se7t

Although the position is about equal here, Blacks task is easier in the endgame, and he eventually won on move 73.

21. Wells - P. Littlewood

Canterbury 2010
[diagram]
 We join this game in what I assume is a standard Pete Wells time scramble. White is awfully close to delivering mate, but he fails to take into account Black's defence. The solution is 37.ilf5!!, when there is no good defence against Qe7. The closest Black

[diagram]
has to a defence is 37...Nf7 (37...Se8 38.Qf6 and White wins), but White is winning after

38.jR,e6t Ne8 39.Qg4!, with the threat of

mate in four starting with 40.j^f7t- The game went less successfully for White: 3 7.Qe7??

37.^h2? is also a worse version. After

37...Qf2 38.Bf5 Black can play 38...Re8!= on

account of: 39.Qf6

[diagram]
39...Qg3t'!^

The following long and complicated line is truly breathtaking: 37.ile6t? Qxc6 38.dxe6 Qf2t 39.Nh2 Se8 40.h5 <Nh8! 4l.hxg6 hxg6

42.e7 b4 43.Bf8 Qf7

50.Qf6t Nxg7 51.e8=@ and it ends in

perpetual check.

37..Mm 38.Nh2

[diagram]
Here Black gave White extra chances with

38...@f6?! and the game was eventually drawn

on move 59 after further mistakes from both players. I he correct move would have been

38...Qf7!?, defusing all threats to the king.

22. Topalov - Kamsky

Kazan (1.4) 2011

[diagram]
Blacks weakness is obviously his king and the main threat against it is seemingly Qd8-f8#. Black has to defend against this, but must do so intelligently. However, we should check whether the main threat is Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 151 genuinely threatening! Here @d8 can be met with ...Qc8 and Black is fine. Rather White is really threatening Qdl or d4, both leading to desperate problems for Black. Kamsky defended against both of these, but opened up another avenue of attack for White.

38...N7c6?

The solution is: 38...jkb3!!

[diagram]
The main point of this move is simple. Black wants to be able to meet 39.Jkd4 with

39...Qd3!= without the bishop hanging on a2.

Note that as mentioned above, 39.Qd8 is not a problem; Black has 39...Qc8t forcing the exchange of queens.

38...^bl? is refuted by 39.Qdl!.

39.Qd6! Ne8 40.Nc7t?!

40.^,d4! was stronger. After 40...Qd3

4l.Qf8t Nd7 42.Qxf6

[diagram]
Black is totally lost. For example: 42...Qf3t

43.Bxf3 Qxf3 44.Qf7t Ne7 45.Nf8t Nd8

46.Qxa2! and White wins.

40...6f7 4l.Nd5

Repeating the position with 4l.^e6! was best, but Topalov is looking elsewhere for the win.

23. Sargissian - E. Berg

Rijeka 2010

24. Roiz - Rodshtein

Beersheba (rapid) 2007 White has been playing with his back against the wall for a while and has now decided to put all his hope in the Sa3-g3 manoeuvre. Unfortunately there is a move he did not anticipate:

[diagram]
A nice pawn sacrifice that improves Blacks coordination.

39.J,xe3

The main point is of course that after

39.Rxe3 Sxd4 40.Hg3 Rg4 Black is able to

block the pin and win the game.

39.Jlc3 e2 is equally hopeless, even though the

game would continue for a bit longer.

39..Jfxfi6 40.1f4 Bf7

White resigned. I am sure that there are those that would have put this position in the Calculation book in the section on Intermediate Moves, but this only underlines the fact that often there are many ways to solve a chess problem and that the definitions are only useful to us as ways to organize our thinking. 0-1

[diagram]
White is on top. He has a fantastic knight on d6 and the black pieces are almost as poorly placed as they could be. However, even winning positions need to be won. In this case there are two easy ways arrive at the solution. The first is to aim to restrict Black's play. Black would like to get his knight into play - he wants to play ...a5, ...Qc7 and ...Na6, when he would be fine, the knight soon making it to d5. White can of course prevent this plan. The other way to find the right move is to focus on penetrating along the b-file. In the game White did not find the right way to do this, playing 24.Sdbl?, and after

24...a5!± Black was suddenly in with a shout. It

should be mentioned that Black actually made a strong comeback and even won the game some 60 moves later. If White had looked for a way to take this resource away from Black, he would have found the right move as well. The correct move is of course 24.a5I, when Black is completely paralysed and will lose material quite soon. Chapter 4 Exercises In this chapter you will find 150 exercises with a positional slant. In all of them it will make sense to ask the three questions to direct your focus and to make sure you do not rush into assumptions. You will find all sorts of positions here, but all of them are to some extent simple, even though in some cases strong grandmasters got them wrong, either over the board or when trying to solve them in training sessions that I have organized. But as always, chess is simple to understand, just as music is. But that does not mean that you can listen to a tune, hum it and then just sit down and play it on the piano. Chess is about skill; it is about practice more than it is about understanding, although of course understanding is needed as well. How often have we heard our friends complaining about losing to someone who "understood nothing"? I am as guilty of uttering those words as anyone else. But in the end it is the strength of the moves we play that matters. It is for this reason I hope that you will go through these 150 exercises seriously. Aim to solve them all, of course, but also train yourself in making decisions. If your rating is above 2200, do not invest more than 10 minutes in a position; if your rating is below 2200, make it 15 minutes. If you like to challenge yourself, take 35 minutes to solve 6 exercises. (First look quickly at them, to see if you can pin one or two of them down quickly.) If your rating is below 2200, make it 45 minutes. If you want a suggested training plan, I would propose that you do six pages of exercises a week, allowing yourself one day of rest. This means it will take you a month to go through this section. If you follow the training program and ask the three questions religiously, you will arrive at the other end with a transformed intuition and feeling for positional play.

1. Wislez - Tiviakov

Eupen 2000

[diagram]
It should be quite obvious that Black has done okay out of the opening. White is not about to launch an offensive anywhere, and he has some pawn weaknesses on the queenside. However, Black also needs to form a plan to seize the initiative. The way to play this position is to realize that White has a weak square on c4 along with the weak pawns on a3 and b4, and that the knight on a6 is out of play and could do much better. By transferring this knight to c4, Black makes Whites existence very difficult.

14...Nc7! 15.e3 Ne8 I6.1fe2 Nd6 17.Sfcl

5Bc4+ Black is better, but White has played sensibly, so he retains drawing chances.

18.1el!

The bishop is bad in the short term, but later in the game can become active again. White realizes that although it looks poor at the moment, the bishop is protecting important squares.

[diagram]
The rook on f8 is inactive and needs to join in; I see no other way of doing this.

19.Qa2

2. V. Kovacevic - Pinter

Plovdiv 1983

[diagram]
The weakest point in the black position must be the f6-square, though one could argue for the f7-pawn to be included on the list of weaknesses. Black also has a traditional bad bishop on d7 and a misplaced queen on b6. His main ideas are to play ...f5 or ...dxe4, in both cases solving some of the problems with his pawn structure as well as aiming to activate the bishop. White wants to find something for his knights to do, as well as keep his advantages. For this reason the correct move is to advance the e-pawn.

[diagram]
After this move White's advantage is obvious, as his pieces flow easily to e5 and other attractive squares. I was more interested in what would have happened had Black decided to play on the queenside, where he is stronger. The best move is:

18..Jfd8!

Besides clearing the way for the b-pawn, the queen is ready to come to g5 and h4 in many lines involving the thrust f2-f4. It took us some time to work out the correct plan for White to prove an advantage, and even after this work, it feels as if the resources of the position have by no means been exhausted. The following is certainly not something you would need to see in order to solve the original problem, but it is very interesting and instructive.
[diagram]
19.Ng4!

After trying various plans, we decided to rely on this one, which tries to make use of the poorly placed knight in an active capacity. This is a rather slow plan, but White has a head start on the kingside, so he can afford the slow manoeuvring.

19...b5

The most natural move. It turns out that 19...5^f5 is premature. Rather than being active on f5, the knight is a target there. White plays 20.Rfel b5

21.^fl b4 22.^fe3± and now Black is in a

tight squeeze. Either he allows White to take on f5 and play ^e3, which is very dangerous for him, or he exchanges the knights,

[diagram]
allowing White to start an attack on the kingside: 22...^xe3 23.Rxe3 Sb8 24.Sf3! bxc3 25.bxc3 @b6 It might look as if Black will be just in time with ...Qb2, but the counterplay fails to a nice tactic: 26Jbcf7t!! Sxf7 27.Qg6 Rxf3 28.^f6f+-
[diagram]
20.a3!!

This deep move was found by John Shaw. The idea was at first to make Black play ...a5 to support the advance of the b-pawn, because ...Qa5 had been irritating us in several lines. Analysis then suggested other, unforeseen advantages of this move.

20.Sfel b4! turns out to give Black enough

counterplay. After 21 .^fl Sb8 22.Nfe3 ^c6

23.2fl Nh8! it is not easy to make progress

with White. The last move is important because of these jbcf7t combinations which keep popping up all over the place.

20...a5 21 .Bfel Nh8

The immediate push on the queenside falls prey to another tactic. After 21...b4 22.axb4 axb4 23.ftf6| ibcf6 24.Bxa8 Qxa8 25.exf6 Whites advantage is obvious. Black has several ways to play, but none of them satisfactory. The key point is that he cannot play 25...^c6

26.ftf3 Qd8, which would otherwise be

the logical thing to do, as White once again wins with: 27Jbcf7t!l Rxf7 28.Qg6t Nf8

White has an edge. He is intending to play Sfl and f2-f4 with action on the kingside. There is still a lot to play for, but the general outlook for Black is not great. Here is one possible line:

Black does not have time to play 21...b4, as the e-pawn is hanging.

21..JU6 22j,a5!?

I like this move a lot. White is intending to exchange his so-called good bishop for the apparently very poor knight on d8. However, in only two moves the knight can be on d4, whereas the bishop has no real targets in the long term. It was of course also possible to play 22.cxb5. After 22.. Jbcb5 I rather like the idea 23.^f5!?±, although it is by no means the only good move in the position.

4. Leko - Mamedyarov

The weaknesses in the black position are all on the queenside, and the advantage of the white position naturally has to do with the two bishops, especially the one on b3. However, at the moment this piece is a bit passive.

15.a5!=

This move fulfils two objectives. It brings the bishop to c6, from where it will disrupt Blacks coordination, and it splits the black pawns on the queenside into effectively three pawn islands, all of them vulnerable.

15...Nc5 l6.1a4Sb8

Black cannot take the bishop. After

White is of course better. He has won a pawn and has no great problems beyond the doubled pawns on the g-file, which can hardly be called weak. However, his position is not entirely stable. Black is about to play ...Rc2 and ...Sac8, creating counterplay against the b2-pawn and on the second rank in general. It is important for White to first minimize this counterplay, before he thinks about how to convert his advantage.

25.±d2!

Chapter 5 - Solutions 185 And this is the way to do it. Once the bishop is on c3, it will achieve the double whammy of blocking the c-file and stabilizing the position.

26.ilc3 27.Sd2 Sc8 28.Sadl Ne7

30...1f5 31.Shl g6

In opposite-coloured bishop endings it is common for the player without ambitions to put his pawns on the same-coloured squares as his bishop, as this makes them easy to defend, though impossible to advance. For the player wanting to win, the opposite is usually the case. He will try to challenge the opponent's bishop and seek to advance his pawns, so he has to fight for the squares that his own bishop does not control.

32.Sh4

White offers an exchange of rooks, which is attractive to Black, but also unravels Whites doubled pawns.

32...Sxh4 33.gxh4 a6 34.Nd4 Nd7 35.Nc5

Nc7 36.a4 Black is almost in zugzwang. He could exchange rooks on d2, but probably felt that his chances to draw this ending would be slim. White can aim to obtain a passed pawn on b6. Then he will put his king on g5 or f6 and play g2-g4. This will either create a weakness on h5, or it will force Black to play ...hxg4, when after fxg4, White is ready to advance the h-pawn to create a second passed pawn and claim the bishop for it. From a practical point of view, this ending did not attract Shirov, but maybe it was the best chance.

[diagram]
36...Scl?

Black should have played 36...Hxd2

37.ibcd2 RLd7U making it very difficult for

White to advance his b-pawn. Remember, if White plays 38.a5? Black can always defend his queenside with the bishop on the b5- fl diagonal, and the king can rush to the kingside and prevent any concessions there. White can try 38.^b4!?, but after 38...<£^6

39.Be3t Nc6 40.*a5 Nd5 4l.b3 Bc8 the

game is sharper than White would want it to be. Although it is obvious that it is White who is trying to win here, I think Black should draw. This does not necessarily mean that White has done anything wrong up to this point, or that the initial evaluation needs to be revised. To be better simply means that if you make a small mistake, or if the opponent defends perfectly, the game is likely to revert to equilibrium. And to be worse simply means that you have to defend well not to lose, that the margin for error is limited. In this game Shirov did not defend perfectly. I believe that this move was the critical mistake, but these endings are very difficult to understand, so I shall not feign certainty.

37.g4!

White is now able to free himself of all the issues haunting him, as they all involved the d-pawn.

19...il,xe2

19...dxc5? 20.cS.xa6 Qxa6 21.dxe5 would be

 Up to this point White has managed to change the position through his aggressive positional operation and now he had to find a way to exploit the weaknesses created in the black position. He did not do a great job of this in the game; after 23.Sc4?! Nb6 his advantage was minimal. A better option would have been 23.h4! (or 23.^d3 first, as the mysterious computer suggests). The big positional threat is ^g5, which would undermine the defence of the d6-square. This encourages Black to play

23..."S.h6, but after 24.Hd3± he is badly

coordinated. White will play ^f3-d2-c4, or h4-h5 and after ...gxh5 then 5^f3-h4-f5, in both cases with a big advantage.

 White decided to repeat the position with

16.Sb3 and Black cannot defend the queenside.

14.e5 e6 15.Sbl Qe7 16.cxd5 exd5 17.ild3

Whites initiative should be decisive. Black cannot easily get his bits out, and White is attacking on both flanks with a fully mobilized army. Obviously the game has a long way to go, and Black does have an extra pawn, but the chances are still entirely with White at this stage. Moscow 2008

9. Hammes - Akopian

[diagram]
 The position seems relatively quiet and Blacks next move might seem obvious to most, as I am sure it was to Akopian. However, we might not necessarily be talking about the same move. The solution to this position is the move that combines the necessary defensive obligations (avoiding mate in one) and active possibilities.

15...6!

The reason some might hold back from this move is that it weakens the e6- pawn. However, that is not relevant in this position. After the advance of the f-pawn, the black king is absolutely safe and White is likely to have to play a more defensive role than he would wish, due to the weakness of the d4-pawn. The other automatic move was 15...h6?!. After

16.O-O the position is roughly balanced, but

it would be Black who had to play accurately over the next ten moves.

16.O-O

This aggression on the kingside is of course very attractive, but it was not the only way Kallithea 2008

[diagram]
Chapter 5 - Solutions 189 to play the position. Black could also have improved his standing in the centre first, by ...Rc8 or by rerouting the d7-knight.

[diagram]
17.1d2

White is struggling for a plan and thus falls down quickly. The idea of this move is to prevent ...Sh6, but in itself that might not be devastating. He should of course avoid automatic moves such as 17.Radl?, because after 17...Sh6

18.Qe3 Qh4 19.Qg3 Sg6! Black is already

winning.

17.Bfel also looks a bit suspicious. Black

plays 17...Sg6 18.^fl Qg5 followed by ...Sf8, ...ftf6 or ...f4, with a terrible attack. The best option might be to play 17.Qe3!? to bring the queen into the game. Black would of course have options such as the most flexible

17...Rh6, and 17...f4!? 18.Qd2 f3, in both

cases with an initiative for Black. However, I do not see why White should not be able to hold his position together.

17...5g6 18.B Nb8

A very natural regrouping of the knight. However, the more creative 18...^b7!? was worth considering. The main ideas are ...^c5! or ...Ne5!?, though playing ...Nf6-d5 also becomes an option. The thinking behind the retreat is that the bishop is less useful on d5 once White has closed the long diagonal, whereas a knight on that square may demonstrate that f2-f3 has compromised the white position.

19.Sacl?

This simply blunders a pawn. After the correct 19.^,e3 £\c6 20.Sadi the position remains complex. I would consider Black's chances to be slightly better and his position easier to play, with ideas such as ...@f6, ...Hc8 and ...Qa5. But with accurate play, there is no doubt that White will be able to neutralize this slight pull.

19...Nc6

White cannot easily defend the d-pawn.

The bishop on b7 looks good, as bishops on long diagonals usually do. However, because of the way the game has evolved, there is nothing of great importance on that diagonal; it is all on the other long diagonal. Black realized this and exchanged the "good" light-squared bishop for the great dark-squared diagonal.

17...ilxS! 18.1x6 Be5!

The bishop is obviously immune, and now combines defending the black kingside with attacking the white queenside. The position is essentially winning.

19.Qc4 hxg5 20.hxg5

After 20.Bxg5 Black can take it easy with

25.Rbd4!? is better for Black, but seems

unnecessarily complicated.) 23.Rg4 Hxg4

24.jbcg4 Qd6 and Black is a pawn up with a

safer king. Although the position may not be completely winning, it can be said to be close.

20...a5 21.g6

The best way to fight back was: 21.a3! jtxb2 (21...b3 22.jkc3 would do a lot to relieve the pressure on White's position, although there would still be some problems to solve along the way.) 22.axb4! jbcal 23.bxc5 Qblt 24.jkdl Jke5 Black is decidedly better, but White has serious prospects for counterplay, both through the passed pawn and against the open black king.

19. Aronian - Gelfand

Dresden (ol) 2008

[diagram]
Black correctly decided to fight for the d5- square with:

17...dxc4! 18.dxc4 b5 19.d5!?

This is the standard positional decision. Rather than having his bishop floating in the air on e5> exposed to all kinds of tricks, and giving Black the control over c4 and d5, Aronian decides to give up a pawn.

19.cxb5 cxb5 20.Qd2 (20.Sxc8 9xc8 21.jbcf6

Morelia/Linares 2007

The three weaknesses in the black position are d6, f6 and g6. White's worst-placed piece is the knight on f3, even though it is of course possible to improve the rooks placement as well.

55.Sh6?

55.^d21 would have won the game quickly.

The knight will arrive at d6 with check almost immediately. A possible line is 55...e5 56.Ne4 Ne6 57.Nd6 Re7 58.Qg6. White threatens Sh7 followed by either ^f5 or Qg4f. For example: 58...Rg8 59.Qg4f f5 60.5^xf5! and White wins.

Chapter 5 - Solutions 199

20.1xc5!

After 20.ibcg7 Nxg7 21.Sbl Whites advantage would have been minimal. The d6- pawn is a bit weak, but Black's knight on c5 is strong, so he would not fear this development greatly.

20...dxc5 21.Sbl±

White's advantage is maybe not earth- shattering, but if we look at all of the elements individually, we can see that the black position is quite unpleasant. First of all, he has three weak pawns on the queenside, which are all unable to improve themselves greatly. White may consider Nb3 with an attack on the c5- pawn and there will be no convenient way to defend it. Then there is the bishop currently on b7. Although it can be activated, this will take time and simultaneously leave the c6-pawn more exposed. Finally, what should have been an asset for Black, the g7-bishop, is shooting into a complete void. There is nothing of interest to anyone on the al-h8 diagonal. The game is simply decided elsewhere.

21...5bd8 22.1h3!?

13...cxd5?

Black was no doubt planning to follow up with ...ftc5, when he would have a decent position, but White can attack the weaknesses on c7 and d6 immediately.

13...ftc5! is the move Black wants to play for

positional reasons. Here White may be able to put Black under a small degree of pressure with I4.dxc6 bxc6 15.^el, when Black has to organize the defence of the d6-pawn.This would be acceptable to Black, as long as White cannot just take on d6. Indeed, this would be ill-advised, as after

15.Sxd6?! £}cxe4 I6.4^xe4 £}xe4 17.Bxc6

Black has the nice blow 17...^xf2!, when the position becomes very sharp and complicated - and probably also slightly favourable for Black. The e-pawn looks very strong and all the black pieces are coming to life quite effortlessly.

14.Nb5! dxe4?!

Black's best chance was probably I4...d4

15.^c7 Sb8 16.^xe8 ^xe8, when he does not

have enough compensation for the exchange, but the closed nature of the position would make it tough for White to convert his plus in practice.

23. Bosboom - Timmerman

Netherlands 1992

[diagram]
Coming from a Leningrad Dutch, we have a very fluid pawn structure in the centre, which can be transformed at any moment. Black's structure is slightly weakened on the dark squares, and it is underpinned mainly by the queen and is under some pressure from the white pieces. White managed to secure himself an edge by undermining the defence of the e5-pawn.

13.c5!=

White needed to take some action in order to claim anything significant. After 13.Bfel Black would play 13...exd4 I4.^xd4 fxe4 15.^xe4 Qxe4 l6.Sxe4 Sxe4 17.Qxe4 Qf7 followed by ...^c5, when he would have nothing to fear. Chapter 5 - Solutions 201
[diagram]
13...4i}xe4?

Not the most successful decision, but Black's position was under a lot of pressure. The necessary evil was 13...dxc5, when I4.dxc5 Qe7 might not be too bad for Black. White would instead opt for I4.dxe5 <5}xe4 (I4...^g4 15.Nc4 is good for White too) 15.^xe4 fxe4 I6.Qxe4 jke6 17.Qe3± with a firm grip on the centre. The position is still quite dynamic, but White's structural advantage cannot be denied. I4.^xe4 fxe4 15.cxd6 Qxd6 I6.^xe5 White wins a pawn and on move 41 he also won the game.

24. Ponomariov - Kramnik

[diagram]
Wijk aan Zee 2003

[diagram]
This is a simple question of good pieces and bad pieces. The bishop on d2 is not very useful and the bishop on d6 is rather decent. An exchange of the two is in White's favour.

[diagram]
It is of course important to work out that

16...c5? 17.dxc5 bxc5 18.,S,el± is undesirable

for Black. White will play Nc3 and Qb3, when the pressure against the black centre will be very unpleasant.

16...jbcb4 17.axb4 would benefit White. The

doubling of the pawns is not a great problem, but the pressure down the a- and c-files would be a permanent nuisance for Black.

17.Nc3

Another interesting approach would be

17.Nf4!?, when Black might consider 17...c5

18.dxc5 Jbcc5, although White is obviously to be

preferred after a simple move such as 19.Qb3=.

17...^xc3 18.1ofxc3

Ponomariov is quite happy to head for a rather stale technical position. Taking with the pawn in order to play c3-c4 was a serious alternative.

18...c6 19Jbcd6 Qxd6 20.b4 Sc7 21.a4

Sfc8 22.a5! Creating further weaknesses in the black camp by opening the a-file.

[diagram]
22...c5? is simply not possible. White would

win by force with 23.bxc5 bxc5 24.Qa3!, when ideas such as e3-e4 will come in many variations. Ponomariov gave 24...Qf8 as a Black try, as well as the refutation: 25.dxc5 Sxc5 26.Rxc5 Sxc5 (26...Qxc5 27.Qb3! and White wins a pawn) 27.Qb3 Qa8 28.e4! Exploiting potential back-rank problems. Now after 28...Sxa5 he only considered taking the pawn on d5, which is very strong, but simpler is 29.Hbl! and White just wins a piece.

25. Firat-Yalim

Kemer 2011

[diagram]
In positions with compensation for a material deficit, it is often a great advantage for the player who has given up material to have opposite-coloured bishops. This position is no exception. Black is doing well on the dark squares, but still needs to find a way to activate his bishop. This is achieved with a standard pawn sacrifice.

[diagram]
Black's position is generally excellent and so other moves, such as 37...Sa2 or 37...^g7, would win as well. But these moves are really just delaying the main idea of ...e4, which should definitely be played at some point.

38.fre4

White has to take the pawn to prevent it becoming a decisive factor: 38.Qd2 e3 39.Qe2 jkd4 and it is time to resign.

26. Gashimov - Giri

Monaco (blindfold) 2011

[diagram]
Black is under pressure and needs to find a way to deal with it. If he does so successfully, then White will have to force a draw quickly before his initiative evaporates and he finds himself in an ending a pawn down.

[diagram]
This passive move immediately runs into great difficulties. After 20...a5?! 21 .f5 Sa6 22.gc3t Nb8 23.ifl Sb6 24.Rc5± Black should probably be able to hold the position with decent play, but it is inconvenient and holds certain risks. Certainly this should be avoided.

[diagram]
 The difference to the game is that White does not get full control over the d5-square and the freedom to swing the bishop around. Another structural point is that the f4-pawn is fixed as a weakness. This might sound irrelevant when we are in a defensive position, but it is not so. We should always aim to create weaknesses in our opponent's position; even for defensive purposes. After 21.gxf5 exf5 White should already think about repeating the position with 22.Sc3t Nb8 23.Bcd3. Notice that

22.j^el does not work this time around, as the

bishop needs to hold on to the f-pawn.

27. Karpov - Anand

Leon Man+Computer (5) 1999

[diagram]
The centre is stable and White has no active plans on the queenside. It is therefore logical that Black should start an offensive on the kingside, where he has more influence and a chance to include more pieces in the attack.

[diagram]
This weakens both players' king positions, but only Black can bring pieces quickly to the kingside. When this match was played, the computers did not appreciate this move - today they do.

36.hxg5 Qxg5 37.^6 Qg4 38.Qcl

White is not seriously bothered about the prospect of losing the exchange. Why should he be? Anything to support the dark squares would offer him some chances to resist.

38...6RS

Black prepares ...h5-h4, further opening the kingside.

28. Zhu Chen - Korchnoi

Marbella 1999

[diagram]
White has a number of things going for her. She has the two bishops, pressure against the black king and open files for her rooks. Black has to deal with all of these as well as finding an orderly way to complete his development. It transpires that all he has to do is to exchange queens, after which White will have no targets (as the black king is then fully safe) and is left with a poor structure with weak pawns and an inactive bishop on g2.

White practically never takes the knight on c5 in the King's Indian, even though it doubles Black's pawns. Basically the control over the dark squares is more important and Black's dark-squared bishop is liable to become good in the long run. However, this position is an exception because White is able to push his pawn to d6 and obtain a fantastic square on d5 for his knight. Even if it is taken, a lot of light squares will remain weak in the black position.

White s idea is to take on h7 with check. It is not an effective offensive idea, as he can do nothing to make it happen; but as a defensive idea it is valid. For this reason, Blacks worst-placed piece is his king. Ernst solved this elegantly.

33...&ffi!!

Besides reducing the impact of Qxh7 (no longer check) this also defends against the back rank mate. White now has a serious problem with his weakness on c4.

34.1a2 Ne5

Black could also take the activity out of the white position with 34...Be8!?, when the ensuing endgame is very advantageous. 35Jfe4? This loses material by force. Necessary was 35.^xe5 ibce5 36.g3 Qf2 37.Qe2 Qxe2

fight in this horrible ending where he is a pawn down and everything is misplaced.

37. Chibukhchian - Gvetadze

Jermuk 201 1

[diagram]
White is about to play e4-e5, c2-c4 and Ne4 with a nice advantage. Black needs to get a square of her own. She ensured this with an excellent move in the game:

[diagram]
A standard move like I4...Qc7 would land Black in a worse situation after: 15.e5 ^d5 I6.c4 ^5b6 17.Qe2± The e4-square is a pleasant possession for White.

15.e5?

White is overstretching and the weakness of the c2-pawn becomes a real problem. Better was something like 15.Qe2 Sc8

16.^xc4 jkxe4 17.Sfdl Qc7 18.fte3 with

fairly even chances. Here Black has the c5- square, whereas White does not have the e4- square. Still, White is not suffering from any great problems.

15...£\d5 I6.Nxc4

Black won the game in 74 moves after lots of twist and turns. At this point her best option was to bring in the rook with:

[diagram]
16...5c8! 17.Qe2 &7b6 18.Nfd2

18.^xb6? Rxc2

18...51xc4 19.5^xc4 Qd 7+

White's position is close to a complete collapse.

38. Kulon - Kazimova

Chennai 2011

[diagram]
A fairly standard-looking Sicilian position where the engines probably overestimate White's chances on principle because the b5- pawn would be better placed on b7. This is indeed the main problem in the black position and White should target this immediately:

23.a4!± b4?!

This allows White to execute her idea and is therefore a bit compliant.

23...bxa4 24.£}xa4 Qb4 is not something

anyone would want to play, but here it was necessary. White can now play 25.£k3 and keep the pressure on, or she can win a pawn with 25.^bc5!? Qxel 26.Nxd7t ^c7

27.Sxel Nxd7 28.Hc3 and Black cannot save

her a-pawn. White should win, but some complications remain.

24.a5!

A typical idea. White uses the extra tempo to open lines to the black king (or to gain access to the a4-square).

24...£}xa5

24...Qb7 25.Na4 is also devastating. White

will most likely just play £}b6, Nd4 and Hb3. But she has all kinds of ideas, for example:

dxc5 29.Nxc5! Qc8 30.Qxe5t ^a8 31.Nxa6 and White's position looks winning.

27...Qb6 28.Sxa6 Qc5

28...Qb7 is a bit more resistant, but after

39. Goganov - Khismatullin

Moscow 2012

[diagram]
26...Nb6??

A horrible move by an otherwise very strong grandmaster. This knight is Blacks best piece and he should never allow White to get rid of it. The weakness in the white position was definitely the light squares and the removal of the knight makes protecting them quite a bit easier. Of the light squares, it is the d3-square that is weakest of them all. For this reason, Black should have taken the chance to play

26...Nb2!+.

[diagram]
The threats of ...^d3 and ...^,d3 are very real. If Black wins back the exchange then material will be equal, but Black will then enjoy his better pawn structure and the chances he has on the kingside by advancing the pawns there. Should White try to save the exchange, he can land in big problems: 27.a4 (27.Sal 5^d3

28.Sedl does not save anything. Black wins

with 28...f5, trapping the queen.) 27..Bd3! Here White should give up the knight on e5 with a bit of counterplay. If he moves out of the way, he will soon be overrun. 28.Qg4 f5

I am sure Goganov did not take too long to make this exchange. Sure, it is a bishop for a knight, but it is a dubious bishop against a Derby-winning stallion!

40. E. Atalik - Krasenkova

[diagram]
34.dxc5?!

Missing the two biggest weaknesses in the black position - the f7-square and the knights' reliance on each other. White could have won immediately with 34.g4!, when there is no way for Black to deal with the further advance of the g-pawn. For example: 34...h6 35.h4 g5 36.hxg5 hxg5 37.Qf5 and Black loses something big.

34...Qxc5 35.Nd3

White has an extra pawn and should still win with optimal play. But this is hardly ever what happens and in this game White made additional mistakes and had to console herself with a half point after 140 moves.

41. Ziaziulkina - Severina

Moscow 2012

[diagram]
White is obviously threatening £}f6f. Black needs to decide how to deal with this. As it forks the whole family there are really only two possible moves. If this was a book on calculation I would put this exercise under Elimination, which is another way of saying "Pay attention to your opponent's ideas." Black apparently did not do so in this game and was quickly taken down.

[diagram]
26..Jke7! was the right move. The position

would be quite unclear, with both players needing to be careful. This is illustrated by the following "natural" moves by White, which lead straight to a 0-1 result: 27.^f6t?! ikxf6

28.Qxf6? Se6 and the e-pawn is lost.

27.1h6!

White wins material as Black has to contend with both Nf6f and Nd6, and she cannot defend against both.

27...B

Not the best move, but Black should lose no matter what. Chapter 5 - Solutions 215

28.Nxc5

White won on move 45.

42. Aagaard - A. Rasmussen

Odense 2011

[diagram]
Here White incorrectly assumed that Black did not have any good positional ideas and that for this reason there was time to improve the position of the king.

17.&bl?!

Actually this was the first independent move out of preparation. During the game I considered what would happen after the fairly natural 17.Qxc6! j^xc6 18.ikd4. I believed that Black should play something like 18...f6, but in fact it is stronger to play 18...^f3!? with a sharp position with even chances. The main point is 19.Jke2 jkd6 20.jke3 Jkd5 and Black is certainly not worse - but neither is White.

17...fcb4!l

Suddenly it is obvious that Black did have a plan and that after ...£}d5 he will have the advantage.

[diagram]
18.Nb3?

The second move out of preparation is also a mistake. I believe that I did play a lot of good moves in the remainder of this event, but this was horrible.

18...&3

Another deeply unpleasant move to face, and from here on it just got worse until I managed to set a great trap for my opponent and steal half a point from him on move 49.

43. Ding Liren - Ezat

44. Pavasovic - S. Atalik

Valjevo 2007

[diagram]
Unless something happens, White will have quite a clear advantage due to his better structure. Blacks c-pawns are permanently weak and White's presence in the centre is powerful. But this is all static thinking. If we look at the dynamics, we can see White is struggling a bit with his development. Usually this would encourage Black to attack, but it is quite limited what he can do - he lacks targets and active pieces. Surprisingly, matters look better for Black the moment he forces the exchange of queens.

15...Qf3! 16.Qxf5

I6.Qd2? would be a desirable move, were it not for the reply I6...Qe4f, winning something.

16...11xc3t 17.bxc3 Jlxf5

The dust has cleared and we can see clear improvements for Black. The c-pawns are still weak, but it is now very difficult to attack Chapter 5 - Solutions 217 them. Black can instead get some benefits from the open files, especially the b-file, where Black is controlling White's entry square.

Black has an excellent chance to take control of the dark squares in the white position by exchanging the dark-squared bishops. Of course the c8-bishop is not a strong piece, but the fl-bishop is even worse. This combined with the weakening of the e3- square makes this operation highly desirable for Black.

This loses a lot of control over the dark squares. But modest play has its problems too: I4.jkc3 Jbcc3 15.Qxc3 Be8t 16.J,e2 If White were given a couple of moves to complete his development he would be happy, but he is suffering after both 16...Qd6!? and

There are many factors that can cloud our minds when we sit at the board. I felt that I had done okay out of the opening and I really wanted to win the game, but these are just emotions.

Black has a strong dark-squared bishop and certainly no long-term problems.

The endgame is in Blacks favour, though it ended in a draw on move 47.

It is easy to stare yourself blind down the f-file in this position, but if you ask the three questions, you will inevitably ask yourself how to make more use of your rook on bl. Having already moved four steps closer, the idea of swinging your rook to the a-file is now much easier.

30.Sal! Sxal

30...Bb8? would lose immediately to 31 -fxg6

hxg6 32Jbcf7t and 33.^e5t.

31.Sxal

Blacks only chance was to see if he could generate enough counterplay with his queenside pawns in the ending arising after

31...gxf5 32.Sa7 Ne6 33.Sa8t Nd8 34.Bxe6t

Sxe6 35.Sxd8f Nf7, although I am doubtful whether he can. Still, chess is not decided by evaluations, but by the best moves. And here White will still have to make a number of those before he can win the game.

60. Spitz - Chambers

Black is relying on tactics. If the knight retreats he will play ...f6 and then take on e4. White's position would be in ruins. But White can win time in order to get the knight to a decent square.

22. Jkxe7 Qxe7

22...exd4 23.f6! is an important move. Black

is in terrible trouble on the dark squares and should not be able to hold the game.

23.fi6!

The point. The knight will now appear on f5 and go from being downtrodden and banished to jumping over fences and walls in search of plunder.

23.^b3 Bxh4 would see White fighting for

equality.

23.. Jfxfc 24.m WdS

Black's situation is very serious, which can best be illustrated by the fact that his only chance was 24...9h6 25.Qf2 O-O, although he loses material after 26.^f5 Qe6 27.Bxd6 Rc4 (27...Qe8 28.^xg7! and wins) 28.^e7t (28.^xg7? does not work here on account Chapter 5 - Solutions 227 of 28...jbce4!+) 28...&I18 29.^xc8 Rxc8±, though he can continue to fight.

25.&B O-O 26.ffe2! Rc7 27.h5 Sfd8

27...Scd8 relieves the pressure against

the c2-pawn, and allows 28.^xg7 Nxg7

29.Qxg4f Nh7 30.Sf6 with a winning attack.

For example: 30...Sg8 31.Qf5t Ng7 32.h6t ^f8 33.Sfl Sd7 34.h7 Sh8 35.Qg6 and so

25.Bc4 Jkxc4 26.Qxc4 Ne5 27.Qa6±

I do not think Black has enough counterplay. But from a human perspective it is much nicer to keep control than to win a pawn.

23...Sd8

Black absolutely had to play: 23...Jbca2

24.Sal !e6 25.Sxa6±

Although White won the game on move 41, at this point he missed the best continuation. He should either keep the pressure with

24.Bdl!? or be adventurous with: 24.jbca6!,

when play may continue: 24...jbca2 25.Sdl Sb8 26.Qxd4±

62. Rowson - Motwani

Edinburgh 1999

[diagram]
Black's idea is ...ibtd4. Besides that he wants to develop the knight from b8 and play either ...c5 or ...e5.

12.e5!

Black is missing his light-squared bishop, so White is happy enough to make this concession. His next target is an attack on the light squares.

12.jke3 Nc4 13.e5 would simply be a worse

version of the game.

[diagram]
After 12...f6!? White can take the pawn with an edge, although he has the additional option: 13.^e4! fxe5 I4.£}g5 Qe7 15.ikg4 exd4 I6.ftxe6 ft8d7 17.£^xf8 Sxf8 and Black's compensation for the exchange does not look sufficient. I think 12...f5 is more accurate. White should probably exchange pawns: 13.exf6 Qxf6 Black has solved some of his problems, but White looks better all the same. For example:

14.jke3± with the intention of Ne4 and Qb3.

13.5}e4 Qc7

13...Nd5± was a better defence.

I4.Bg5! Threatening to go to e7.

63. W. Schmidt - Portisch

There is not anything structurally wrong with the white position, so as long as nothing happens over the next few moves, he should be absolutely okay. However, Black can react immediately and secure a preferable structure.

Black's structure is now slightly favourable; White is the one with problems to solve. Chapter 5 - Solutions 229

21.e3 Na3¥ and it is by no means easy for

Black has some pressure, though White managed to untangle himself eventually, drawing the game on move 41.

65. Gheorghiu - Joita

Romania 1972

[diagram]
Black's idea is evidently ...d6 to let the bishop into the game.

18.d6!

18.^g4? is very tempting, as Black has only

one move to survive. For example, 18...d6?

19.^f6t *d8 20Jfh6! or 18...Qf3 19.Qxg5,

in both cases with a ravenous attack. But Black can defend with 18...b6!!.

[diagram]
The position is just wildly unclear after something like 19.Qh6!?. The main point is of course that White does not win quickly with 19.^f6t ^d8 20.@h6 (20.Qxg5? would be winning if Black did not have 20...^6+ creating space for the king)

20...5e8 21.^xe8 on account of 21..J^a6,

when it would be sensible for White to force a draw with 22.Qxg5t Nxe8 23.Qg8f Ne7

24.ffg5t.

18...cxd6

18...Qe4 was perhaps the best try. Still,

White's attack is enduring. 19.Qxg5 leaves Black with no ideas other than 19...Qbit

20.^e2 f6. Here White forces an advantage

with 21.Qh5t <^8 22.^d3 Qb6 (22...cxd6

23.Rb2 Qal 24.Qh6 <Ne7 25.Bg2 with the

idea of jkd5 leaves Black defenceless.) 23.f4 cxd6 24.Qxh7, when White should win the game. Black is nowhere near to getting his pieces into the game; White will have plenty of time to generate threats before this happens.

19.^c4

Obviously it is the knight which heads to d6.

Black. Checks on bl and b4 should secure a draw.

Lund 2010

[diagram]
If Black were given all the time in the world he would play ...@c5 and ...£}d7-b6-c4 (maybe with ...b7-b5 included) with a great game. The problem is that White can fight this set-up of the black knights by taking control of their two ideal squares, c4 and d5, with some simple moves.

20.c4!

The apparent weakening of the king's position is an illusion. Black is not able to use it in any way. Even if he were given time to play ...a6 and ...b5, the white king would not face serious threats for many moves to come. Meanwhile White would have time for g2- g4-g5 and so on.

20.g4 would allow Black to fight for the

important squares with 20...Qc5! 21.c3 f6.

[diagram]
White may have the easier play, but he has no clear way to continue his attack quickly, on account of 22.f4?! e5! 23.^b3 Qc6t, energizing the black pieces.

20...5^5f6± was probably more prudent.

Here White can choose to consolidate his position first with 2lJkcl! or go on the immediate attack with: 21.g4!? 9c5 22.g5 Qxd4 (22...hxg5?! is weaker because of

23.ibcg5 Qxc4 24.Qf3 with threats of h5-h6

67. Berg - Almeida Quintana

Montcada 2009

[diagram]
All of White's dreams of counterplay are associated with a break on the light squares on the kingside. This means that Black should fight for the control of e6/f5/g4 immediately.

[diagram]
The position has changed since the bishop was developed on b7 - it no longer has a function there and so returns to c8. Other options are weaker:

16...O-O?! 17.^,d2 prepares an opening of the

kingside with Jle2 and g2-g4. I prefer White here.

16...a5 17.exd6 exd6 18.f5!= also looks great

for White.

17.g3lB

17...a5! seems to be more accurate,

anticipating that White might want to play Jkh3. It is harder for him to find a good waiting move than it is for Black, so the stand¬ off is likely to end with White playing jkg2 and Black replying ...J,f5. Chapter 5 - Solutions 233

68. Dubov - Potkin

[diagram]
 Whites two inactive pieces are the rook on el and especially the bishop on d2. He therefore improves them both quickly:

18.Se2! Ng5

The former European Champion was clearly struggling for a plan here. So is the annotator!

18...^,d6 19."i,el Mb8 20.jkh4 Qd6 looks like

an obvious way for Black to activate his bishop and invite White to exchange it with lg3. But White can act with great vigour here and claim a great advantage after 21.g4!!±, when the pressure against d5 pays off in full.

19.±el Ne6?!

19...Qd7 has the intention of meeting

20.jkh4 with 20...Sg4, and would probably

limit White's advantage. However, Black would still have to face enduring pressure after a continuation such as: 20.Qb5 Qxb5

21.ftxb5 Sc6 22.Nc3 Sd8 23.Bh4± The two

bishops and the weaknesses in the black camp ensures White's advantage.

20.1h4±

This causes further weakening of the black position, but 20...ftc7 would not be a pleasant move to play.

21.1g3 g6 22.Se£2 Ng7 23.h3

White prepares his next move by preventing ...Ng4, although there was actually no need for this; 23.Jke5 5^g4 19.ibcd5 would be crushing. Still, White's approach is very practical.

White has sacrificed an exchange to enjoy better piece placement. To be able to justify this he needs to continuously put his opponent under pressure with aggressive, accurate moves.

70. Svidler - Karjakin

Wijk aan Zee 2007

[diagram]
Obviously White is threatening to take on f6, and he also wants to play h2-h4 and Jkh3. Usually Black would decide between ...Nh5 and ...fad7 in such a position, but we should also ask if our opponent's threats can be met Chapter 5 - Solutions 235 with a more serious counter-threat. That is the case here:

19...5ab8!!

19...^d7 would give White time to organize

himself. Both 20.jUi3!? and 20.h4 Bab8

21.@e4°° do not look bad for White.

[diagram]
The bishop is acting solely as an aggressive unit from this square, which suggests that Svidler was too optimistic. According to Karjakin, 20.J,c4 was the best chance. Black can of course take on c4 and claim a slight edge. But I think Black can even play for more with 20...a5!? 2lJ,b3 Bb4 22.Qa3 Qd 1% and Black has a nice attacking position, even if there is no immediate breakthrough available.

20.gxf6? Bb4! is elementary.

White's pieces are not well placed to fight on the dark squares, or on the queenside in general.

22.Nxa6?!

This loses by force; Black does not have to waste time reorganizing his forces as most of his moves are made with gain of tempo. Anticipating the black attack with 22.b3 was possibly the last chance.

71. Karjakin - Van Wely

Foros 2007

[diagram]
Black is on his way with ...f5, which will pose some inconvenient questions to the white pieces. Obviously a further ...f4 would leave the f-pawn hanging, but after Jbcf4 Black would have ...,iLf5 with an attack on c2 (and b3), setting the board alight. White had better prepare himself rapidly to deal with such challenges.

22.Nd2 6 23.Nc4

This has the disadvantage of exchanging Blacks stupid knight on a5, but at the same time it gets rid of White's lame horse and secures the bishop a great square on c4, where it blocks counterplay down the c-file.

23.Qh5 Qf7 looks about even to me.

A bad blunder, allowing White to carry out a decisive attack.

23...?^xc4 24.jbcc4 Qf7 with chances for

26...jkd7± was a better fighting chance of

It is standard to focus on the development of the b8-knight, but we should also pay attention to our opponent's pieces. In this case the h5-knight is quite badly placed. Svidler took advantage of this with:

76. Pelletier - Sasikiran

Khanty-Mansiysk (ol) 2010

[diagram]
A logical decision. Black takes control of the b4-square, at the same time preventing the white knights getting into action via the b5-square. In the long term the a4-pawn is in more danger than the b6-pawn. The b7-bishop might look poor now, but it is not really worse than the bishop on g2. It will eventually come into the game on the c8-h3 diagonal.

80. Eljanov - Smeets

Germany 2011

[diagram]
Blacks weakness is the b7/c6 constellation. White is able to make use of his strong bishop on f3 to put these pawns under pressure. Obviously, the light squares are the weakness (and maybe to some extent the b7-pawn), with the c6-pawn being the hook.

13.b4!

Eljanov suspected that his opponent had missed this idea somehow. It is not completely standard, but when you look for weaknesses in the black position, it becomes very logical.

Black is under definite pressure, even if it is a good way from being decisive.

In theory this pawn is isolated; but to call it a weakness is a stretch. It is easier to defend than to attack and the real pressure is from f3 to b7.

81. Topalov - Aronian

Linares 2010

[diagram]
White has a slight edge because of his superior pieces, but the game still has to be won - and this can only be done by good moves. In positions like this where there is a small but clear structural advantage (passed pawn and better pieces), it is usually important to increase the number of advantages in order to get anywhere. Here this happens by creating additional weaknesses, as all of Whites pieces are already placed on good active squares.

24.h4!

White threatens to play h4-h5, taking advantage of the slight ways the black kingside has been compromised. Black may now play

24...h5, when White replies 25.g3, and the

weakness of the g5-square combined with the X-ray from b3 to f7 increases Black's discomfort a little. Or he can allow White to advance the pawn. Personally I would probably have played 24...h5, but the fact that Aronian, now the solid No. 2 in the world, chose not to, shows that the choice is by no means easy.

[diagram]
As mentioned, I do not fully trust this move.

24...f5?! would on the other hand be the wrong

track entirely. Black is passive and worse and will find that "active" lunges like this only create weaknesses. After the natural moves 25.?^xd6 Qxd6 26.h5 g5 27.Qc2! White is threatening to check on c7 as well as to take on f5. And after 27...Sf6 White can play either 28.Qd3!? or 28.d6, in both cases with a clear edge.

82. Erdos - Istratescu

Patras 2012

[diagram]
26.e5!

This would have been incredibly strong. The white king's position is quite open, but there is no way for Black to get his bishop to work together with the heavy artillery to take advantage of this. On the other hand it is quite easy to see that the white bishop on b2 will provide real support to the attack against g7. On top of this the black queenside will fracture, pawns will drop and weaknesses persist. If White is not winning after this, he is at least close. The game ended in a draw after: 26.Rd5?!= If7 27±B Ne6 28.Rxd7 Bxd7 29.Bdl (29.f5±)

29...5.dlt 30.ixdl Qd7 31.Nf2 h6 32.Be2

Jig4 White might have some reason to play on here, but he probably felt that the trend was moving against him.

26.jkf3!?± is also a decent move, but it only

postpones the decision time and gives Black a chance to try and prepare a little for White's imminent break.

26...fxe5 27.Bxc6!

This is the concept. You can maybe delay taking here, but there is no point in doing so.

27...bxc6 28.Rcxe5!

To me this is most natural, though 28.jbce5 is also decent, intending to continue with Rxc6. White has a significant advantage, for example: 28..Jkh5 29.Sc4f M,(7 30.Qxa6 Sdl

31.Bcl± and the extra pawn means a lot.

28...Qd6

Black has no good moves. 28...Qf8

29.Qxc6 j^d3 (White should be winning

after something like 29...Qd6 30.Qxd6 cxd6

31.Se7 d5 32.^d4, when he will get a strong

passed pawn and can dream about attacking g7 later on.) 30.a4 h6 31.^,c3 and White is ready to play Qc5 then, if allowed, Re7.

28...Qf7 29.Qxc6 Bd6 30.Qc5 lets White

stay in control as well. He is immediately threatening an invasion on e7.

29.Qc4t

29.Qc3!? is also very strong. White has f4-

f5 ideas as well as posing the simple question: what is Black going to play on the next move?

29...6fB 30.Qxa6

Black has hardly any compensation for the pawn. His only chance is to play 30...c5 and try to draw the ending. White can choose between several continuations, all of them featuring a passed pawn on the queenside and strong pressure against g7.

83. Berg - Almeida Quintana

[diagram]
A strange-looking move, which I reckon is absolutely correct. Although his king is in need of safety, Black does not want to give away the control of the h-file too soon. Berg speculates that his opponent was unhappy with 20...O-O on account of 21 Jke4!, which seems reasonable. Berg gives the following (computer-inspired) line: 21..Jkg4 Montcada 2009

[diagram]
22.jtf3 Bxf3 23.Qxf3 Qa7 24.Qe4 b3!? with

interesting play. But spending time to defend the d4-pawn makes little sense. White should attack on the kingside immediately with

24.g4!.

[diagram]
 Black needs to seek counterplay absolutely immediately, but I fear that it is already too late: 24...b3!? (24...hxg4 25.Qxg4 Qxd4 26.h5 b3 27.Qh3! also gives White a strong attack.)

25.gxh5 bxc2f 26.Nxc2 Qxd4 27.Shgl with

the idea 27...Sab8 28.Sg4!±. Maybe Black can sidestep a lot of this with

21...1e6!? and it will take White a bit more

time to break through on the light squares.

White's pieces are all well placed so she should attack now, otherwise she may see her slight dynamic advantage on the kingside evaporate quickly.

A very natural reply, but it should have lost quickly. Black's only option was I6...g6, when after 17.fxe6 fxe6 18.Qg4 £}f8± the position is holding, but all her pieces are poorly placed. White now has time to manoeuvre her bits into threatening positions, for example with £k3-dl-e3-g4, with Qg4-h3 included at some point.

17.Sx6??

A horrible move, allowing Black to come close to equalizing. Instead White should have exploited the weakness of the light squares with 17.e6!.
[diagram]
 After this Black will lose the d5-pawn and the f7-pawn's disappearance will lead to great problems on the light squares. 17...^f6 (17...RLf6 may be relatively the best option, but after 18.exf7t ^xf7 19.Qh5t White will take on h7 and the black king will be unhealthily exposed.

19...6e6 20.Sd2?

20.Sddl? would not leave the rook exposed

on d2 as in the game, but it would weaken the defence of the second rank. Black is strategically winning after 20...d4 21.jbcb7 Qxb7 22.exd4 4^f4 23.£3 ^6d5, when White has been completely outplayed. It was necessary to try 20.Bh4?, although that takes the rook to a silly square. But it would not be faced with an immediate refutation like in the game. Plovdiv 2010

[diagram]
White's pawns on the queenside are quite impressive and might in the long term give him the chance to create a passed pawn. But more important is the weakness of the d6- and b6-squares and the pressure the b7-pawn can come under.

31.&6!

Less energetic play, such as 31.Qb3, would allow Black to liquidate the pressure with

31...Nxe3?!

This is a very natural move to play, but not a fortunate one.

31...exf5 32.Bxd5 Bxd5 33.Bxd5 leads to an

obvious advantage for White.

 But Black can fight on with 33...Bxe3!

34.6ce3 Qxg3 35.Qf2 Qc7= and try to hold

this position through dynamic defence. This looks pretty desperate, but such is his position.

32.Nxe3 Sxd2 33.Sxd2 Sd8

33...b6 34.c6 also gives White a huge

advantage. Maybe it was best to get rid of the c8-bishop with 33...^,d7 34.£k4 jkc6, but White is still close to winning after 35.Jkxc6 Qxc6 36.@dl, when his control of the d-file is excellent.

[diagram]
33..Jkg5 34.f4 £te7 does not really succeed

35...5d8 36.Bxd8t Qxd8 37.Nb6 f5 38.Qc3

37.Qxd8t Jbcd8 38.Qb6! (38.^d6 b6 might

actually give Black real drawing chances), when White wins a pawn. The main point is of course that 38...j^c6 39.ibcc6 bxc6 40.5k8! would lead to the win of the c6-pawn.

34...1kd4 35.^d6 ikf6 was Black's best chance

18.b4?!

Not a pleasant move to play, but Jobava clearly did not like the alternative. Necessary was 18.Qxc5t bxc5 19.Sdl to try to hold the position through passive defence. This is quite foreign to Jobava, but none the less this was what he had to try. After 19...ibcb2

20.O-O, White has big problems of course,

but he will find the opposite-coloured bishops a drawing factor, rather than a further pressure factor. Still, I like Black after

White had no choice but to play 27.a7, with some chances. After 27...Qxa7 (27...b5!?+ is also interesting) 28.Qxg7 Sa2 29.Qf6 Sd2+ Black is well ahead, but the game is still a bit away from being decided.

94. Nyback -1. Schneider

Germany 2010

[diagram]
Coming from a modest variation of the Slav where White is aiming for a slight technical advantage, it is not always easy to create big problems for Black. Therefore it is necessary to create small but lasting problems! At this point White puts a bit of pressure on Black by forcing him to weaken his pawn structure a little. In the long term this is quite unpleasant, especially as the weakening is of the light squares, which Black must defend with a knight versus the white bishop.

This creates a further weakness in the black position. I think 19...Qd7 was slightly more accurate. White is still better after 20.Qc2! Bc8

21 Jtc3± with a long-term advantage, which is

certainly assisted by the slight weakening of the black queenside.

20 Jfc2 Sh3?!

20...Qb6 21.Hcl Bc8 was the best defence.

White has various plans from this point and would have to choose. One of these options is Qc2-dl-e2 followed by e3-e4 or Qg2 and playing on the kingside. White is still to be preferred of course, but his advantage is not too great yet.

97. E. Paehtz - Zawadzka

Antakya (1.3) 2010
[diagram]
 The weaknesses in the black position - the exposed nature of the e8-rook, the weakness of the light squares, such as f7, around the king, and the pressure on the c2-h7 diagonal - have quite a temporary nature. White has to react aggressively to ensure that these do not just disappear, for example after ...g6.

22.1xe5 Qxe5 23.Sfel?!

The second-best option, giving Black the chance to reach an endgame with a higher chance of survival than she deserves.

23.Rd7! immediately was the best move. Black

has virtually no choice, and after 23...Jkc6 24Jff7t *h8 25.Sxd8 Sxd8 26.Qxa7± she would be facing a horrible uphill struggle. I guess that the reason Paehtz did not choose this line is that she saw the double threat

Even after this inaccuracy White retains a slight advantage, and he still managed to win the game on move 49. However, his position would have been considerably more attractive had he played the simple manoeuvre 21.Qel! with the idea of ftc2- b4, with an obvious positional advantage.

If Black had time to play ...c6 he would be a bit worse, but solid. White would push his pawns forward on the queenside and try to create a weakness in typical style.

 The big weakness in the white position is of course the f4-square, but it seems that White has been able to push the knight backwards and will retain full control over the dark squares in his position (which are all weakened by implication). However, Black has a strong idea, which can be executed in two different ways, that takes advantage of these weaknesses.

The obvious weakness in the black position is the advanced b-pawn, which constitutes a hook. If we were looking at it solely from this point of view, we might be tempted to play

10.a4!?, which would give some advantage.

But we should not forget that Black has neglected his development and thus exposed his king to a quick attack. Combining these two features gives White access to a powerful idea. Obviously many GMs will choose the right move quite quickly, simply because this kind of thinking is automatic in their heads, though it may not even be conscious.

15...^xh6+ 16.h3 iLd7 17.^gl

White won this game on move 60 after Black spectacularly misplayed an equal ending. In this position I find it attractive to try to activate the knight on h6, rather than advancing the g-pawn as Black did in the game. The way I envisage this happening is 17...Ng7!? followed by ...Nh6-g8-f6-h5 and Blacks position is very pleasant to play. A follow-up could be ...Sf6 and ...c6!? to open a second front.

24.b4!± was in my opinion the best move.

[diagram]
The pawn is fixed on b5 as a target and Black will have to remain passive in order to defend it. White will put a knight on d5 and manoeuvre the other knight around via el- Chapter 5 - Solutions 267 c2-e3 or similar, securing a close to decisive advantage.

[diagram]
Black should always play this move if possible.

25.Nd2

This shows that Karjakin was unhappy with his own play. If he had intended to allow ...b4, then he would surely have prepared to answer it with 25.c4, which does seem better than the move played. But it is clear that Blacks existence has been made just a little bit easier by weakening of the d4-square, as well as the fact that it is easier to defend the b-pawn. Black could even consider playing 25...b3!?, making the position a little more double-edged. White is a good deal better, but he is not enjoying the level of control that he should have been.

Despite the reduction in his advantage, White still managed to win the game on move 57.

110. Van Kampen - Andriasian

Groningen 2010

[diagram]
15...Qxc5?

It is quite hard to explain how a strong grandmaster like Andriasian can play a move like this, but it is safe to say that he did not fully take his opponents ideas into account. After the forced 15...dxc5, White may play I6.e5 "S,e7, but because there is no pawn hanging on d6 and no tempo gained with ^c3-e4, it is by no means obvious that White has any advantage. I6.e5! If a GM sees a move like this, he will definitely decide not to allow it; the complications can only favour White.

[diagram]
I6...dxe5 The only move.

16...Qxc4 loses to 17.exf6. There is no real way

to avoid the pain coming from 5^e4 and Bxd6.

16...1Ui4 is refuted both by 17.g3, and

the more pleasingly direct 17.Qe4!? jbcel

18.Qxel Qc7 19.5}xd6t 20.il,b3, where

the exchange matters very little in comparison with the ease with which White will be able to generate threats against the black king. One line could be 20...g6 21.f5! gxf5 22.g4! fxg4 23.Qb4 a5 24.Qxg4 and Black collapses quickly on the dark squares.

17.Ne4 Wc 7?

A further sign that Black was having an off- day. White now wins easily.

17...Qe7 was necessary in order to defend

the f6-square so that he can later play ...f7-f5. White still has tempting options, but not a directly decisive one. 18.£}d6t (18.^,d5!? also leads to a clear edge, but in a more technical position where Black is under less practical pressure.) 18...^£8 19.fxe5 ^g5 20.Qc3 bxc4

Black has a lead in development, but should White manage to play jke3 and O-O, he would not be worse. Black therefore has to prevent this in order to play for an advantage.

15...Nb4! 16.Ne5?!

I6.a4?! j^c6 is also very pleasant for Black. However, White should have tried I6.a3! in order to get some counterplay. Black should of course play his trump card with I6...ikb5, though White surprisingly has a temporary pawn sacrifice: 17.Qf2 @xf2f 18.(^)xf2 £}xc2

Finally White feels compelled to prevent ...lb5, which would now be deadly.

19...Nc6 20.a5

20..Jfd8?

Missing the chance to take the full point immediately. The accurate move was 20...Qc7!, which gives a decisive attack. The main point of the move arises after 21.O-O ftd4 22.Qf2 £xBt 23.Qxf3 Bd4t 24.Nh2 Bc6 25.Qxf4 Jke5, and Black wins.

21.Sa4?

attack. Probably his best chance was 21.O-O Nd4 22.Qf2 Qg5?, when his position is uncomfortable, but everything is still up in the air.

112. Wang Hao - Shengelia

Rogaska Slatina 2011

[diagram]
Black has a poorly-placed knight on h8 and White is about to advance the g-pawn to put pressure on the e6/f5 constellation. Black has to be ready to defend against this and it is common sense that if you can use your worst- placed piece for this purpose, then that is indeed a very attractive option.

21.JU7?

This has an automatic feel to it - the bishop was on its original square and is therefore being included in the game. But the move is not pertinent to the circumstances on the board, and so constitutes poor positional play. Instead the correct move was 21...4}g6!, when after 22.g4 ^e7 the game is about equal.

White's attack is now quite serious, and it turns out that Shengelia had missed a simple tactic.

Black would love to have time to play ...a6 followed by ...^e8-c7 and ...Sb8, building up to an inevitable ...b5-break. Leko prevents this with simple play.

10.a5!

It is clear that without the a-pawns White can simply occupy the b5-square, so Black's main idea is dead and buried.

10...bxa5

After 10...a6 1 l.axb6 Qxb6 White needs to consider whether he is better off with 12.jkfl or with 12.ftd2!?, both of which lead to a pleasant position. Il.Nd2 Nb6 12.1b5 Ng4 13.h3 Nh6 White is close to being positionally winning and can play the position in many different ways. I would personally prefer the simplicity of I4.5^b3, but Leko was much better after a more complicated approach, though he later lost control and had to work until move 73 before finally winning the game.

114. Aagaard - Bjerring

Denmark 2004

[diagram]
22.b4?

The advance of the pawns on the queenside is the right positional idea. Unfortunately this move allows Black to play 22...j|a4!, when any further advance on the queenside would be nearly impossible, and White has no advantage at all. For this reason the correct move was 22.a4!, preventing Black's blockading idea and intending to play 23.b4 next. 22...^f6 (White is also better after 22...e5 23.b4 Be6 24.a5±)

23.b4± White is better and will put Black

under real pressure with his extra pawn on the queenside and his two bishops. The following variation shows how things could go: 23...ftd7

24.jte3 e5 (24...£\e5 25.f3!± and White

dominates the black pieces) 25.b5 axb5?! It is probably better to accept a weakness on a6, but Black is in trouble none the less. 26.axb5 Be4 27.f3 f4 28.Bf2 Bf5 29.Sa7 Sb8 30.c5 White should win.

115. Leko - Grischuk

Mexico City 2007

[diagram]
White should be a little better on account of his freer play and the pressure down the d-file. The safest way to secure this edge is by taking into account Blacks intentions. At this point his bishop on e7 is not very well placed and the knight on f6 is also somewhat restricted. Therefore his most natural plan is ...^g4, ...j^f6 and ...£}ge5. Leko prevents this with a simple move.

19.h3!

"Now Black's situation will automatically become very unpleasant, not because the position is so bad, but simply because White has a much easier game and can slowly build up the pressure." - Leko.

19.e5 does not look convincing. 19...^xe5

Black has a good structure, but he is about to be pushed backwards with 5^e2 or h2-h4-h5. The bishop on c8 is ineffective and the rook on a6 is simply badly placed. However, by obstructing White's development, Black can stay on top.

117. Blomqvist - Howell

Stockholm 2006

[diagram]
The most important thing for Black to do in this position is to get closer to completing his development. It is not always necessary to finish it at top speed, other things are important too, but you should at least leave flexibility to do so. The worst-placed piece is the knight on g8, as not only is it not taking part in the game, but it also prevents the king from getting to safety. The best square for this knight is f5, from where it can both attack the centre and irritate the misplaced bishop on h4.

7...Nh6!

This knight would have no function on the more "aesthetic" f6-square, but will be excellently placed on f5. When I have given this exercise to students they have far too often (80%) chosen an active plan in the centre, for which they were ill-prepared. The two standard ones are pushing the c- and e-pawns.

7...C5 is the lesser evil, as it does not open the

position fully. However, Black's pieces are not playing, and following 8.jke2 I think White is in general better mobilized. After 8...^c6

9.O-O! White is happy to give up the d-pawn

for the centre to be opened, and Black will not escape easily. Thus the best move is: 8...^h6 9.@b3! A strong exploitation of the bishops early deployment to g4. 9...Nd7 10.Qb5!±

7...e5? is even worse. White can ask Black what

he is up to: 8.h3! Jbcf3 9.Qxf3 exd4 10.exd4 ^,xd4 11.O-O-O J,xc3 12.Qxc3! Qxc3t

Too passive. Better was 8.j^d3 to give up the bishop for the knight.

8.e4 jbcf3 9.gxf3 Qb6°° feels uncomfortable

for White... but maybe I just don't like to lose pawns.

118.1. Sokolov - Mamedyarov

Villarrobledo 2008

[diagram]
White's set-up is a bit artificial; the bishop is not great on f3, and the bishop on b2 is worse than the one on g7, simply because it is unprotected and thus more likely to end up in an unpleasant pin. However, rather than just taking the bishop pair at once, although that is quite an attractive idea, Black decides to launch an attack in the centre, forcing White to put his pieces on inferior squares.

119. Aronian - Anand

Moscow 20 1 1

[diagram]
Whites pieces are not especially poorly placed, but if we look at them carefully, we can see that the queen is a bit uncomfortable in view of the possibility of ...d4. Obviously it has available squares and Aronian clearly was not worried about this. But once Anand made his move, the size of the problem became apparent.

16..Jfb8!+

This move has multiple functions. Besides protecting the bishop it reduces the value of White's escape squares for the queen. The threat of ...d4 is now very real. A standard developing move like I6...Rc8? would have led to a more or less equal game, but would not be reacting to the positional factors of the position.

17.Qft

17.Ne2 d4 18.Sf4 is no improvement.

17...Qxf4 18.exf4

It was of course tempting to play 18...d4, but then the white knight has the e2-square for the retreat. Now the threat of ...Nc5 is very strong and Whites opportunities seriously limited.

This does not really help White, but it probably no worse than any other move. Aronian is simply testing if Anand will be lazy and allow 19...b5? 20.^xb5!, when White has enough counterplay.

120. Vitiugov - Ganguly

[diagram]
 In slow, closed positions like this, computers are of little help. The point here is that with the centre almost hermetically sealed, all the play will happen on the kingside. Black is going to find himself in a minority there and should maybe have considered giving up the strong-looking but relatively ineffective bishop on a6 for the white knight. Instead White regroups it before going ahead with the planned kingside invasion.

20.Ngl! ftb8

Black plays like he has all the time in the world, but in reality he needed to try to do something quickly, before White is too well organized. 20...1c4 with the faint hope of provoking b2-b3 could be tried, but it is not apparent what he should do after 21.Sal!, delaying the decision for later.

121. P.H. Nielsen - Ivanchuk

Beijing (rapid) 2011

[diagram]
This is a horrible move, and it is difficult to understand how a player like Ivanchuk can make it - even in a rapid game. The bishop is left entirely out of play with a naive dream of assisting the promotion of the b-pawn. As White is much more actively placed, this is unrealistic. White is now able to push his own pawn with the assistance of all his pieces.

28...jkb3 is wholly unnatural and it is not

surprising that White has a simple way to an edge. Here both 29.Rc6 and 29.ihd5! Jbcd5

30.Qxd5 are good, when White will win the

b-pawn and hold on to the d-pawn. Winning will still not be trivial, but Black's defence will be very difficult.

28...jke6! was the correct move. The bishop

looks to support the b-pawn from a stable square and keeps an eye on the d-pawn at the same time. The threat to the d6-pawn is now very real. To be honest, nothing more is needed to make this decision, but it is nice to check a few lines anyway. 29.Rc6 (29.Rc7 b3 30."S,b7 is not dangerous. The easiest way to secure a draw is probably 30...b2 31.Qb6 Hd8 followed by ...Rxd6, although many other ideas are good enough as well.) 29...b3 30.Rb6 Qd8 The queen would also be decently placed on c8, but pinning the rook makes a lot of sense.

123. Chemiaev - Kotronias

Hastings 2003
[diagram]
 There are a few obvious features of this position - White is playing in the centre and on the queenside, whereas Black is aiming for a mating attack on the kingside, presumably by rolling the pawns forward. Because we have this contest between static play (slow pressure on the queenside and the hope of eliminating dynamics) and dynamic play (speed being of the essence in the attack), it is very important to take into account all aspects of the position, for example, the weakness of the e5-pawn and the need for White to reinforce his defence of the kingside with £\bd2. Combining all of these factors, Kotronias came up with a good way to inject energy into the attack.

17...g5? looks natural, but does not take

[diagram]
into account the important features of the position. White plays 18.jkc3!± with the idea of ^bd2-c4 (if allowed), when he hopes to tie White down before playing Ba6 and Efal. If Black plays 18...g4 19.hxg4 jbcg4 White has time for 20.5^bd2 with a very pleasant position. It will take Black quite some time to create a real attack.

18.5}xg5

Another advantage of Black's last move is that White has no choice but to exchange the knights. Instead of being passive on f7, the black knight has exchanged the only defender White has on the kingside.

18...Qxg5

The threat to the h3-pawn wins another tempo.

19.Nh2 Ef6

True to his style, Kotronias plays very aggressively. More moderate was 19...Sf7 with the idea of ...Saf8, ...Qh5 and ...g5-g4.

20.Shl

It is hard to say which is the best defensive try, but easy to determine that White has to be very careful. One lovely variation goes: 20.b5?
[diagram]
 Too nonchalant; White deserves to get punished for this. 20...9h4! 21 .Sxe5 The only critical try. 21...g5 Black is already threatening

[diagram]
...il,xh3 followed by ...Bh6. 22.j^,c3 Hg6

23.Qc7 Sc8 24.Qe7 And now that the white

queen can no longer go to the g3-square,

24...f3 just wins.

20.. JTh5 21.6 g5 22.&gl

Black's attack is very dangerous. For example,

22.jkc3?! g4! 23Jbce5 gxf3 24.jbcf6 fxg2 and

mate is not far away: 25.<Nxg2 Qe2t 26.^gl f3

[diagram]
Black prepares to open the g-file without allowing White to get the hi-rook into the game.
[diagram]
23.±el g4 24.fxg4 lxg4 25.Nd2 k(6l

I like this multi-purpose move more than the computer's preference, the committal

25...f3, which leads to lots of complications

and lots of chances to make mistakes. From f6 the bishop is ready to go to h4 when needed and Black is one step closer to putting the a8- rook on g8.

26.it f2

Objectively a mistake, but White's position is miserable. Maybe a better chance was

26.Sh2!? <Nh8 27.Nc4, though Black remains

much better after 27...ike6+.

A very understandable mistake to make. Black was just winning after the slightly unnatural 28...ike2t 29.^el Shg6, when the g2-pawn falls. It looks as if it is falling anyway because of ...Sxg2 and ...Jbch3, but the issue is that White can create counterplay against the bishop on e6.

29.&el?

White misses his chance. After 29.Qc3! he could fight on. The idea is to get the queen to c6, where she will cause enough annoyance to force a draw. So Black's best is perhaps

29...c5!?, but White can hang on with 30.bxc5

124. Leko - Khalifinan

Budapest (rapid) 2000

[diagram]
The opening has been just a modest success for White. He has gained the two bishops, but Black has a very powerful bishop on d4 and a solid pawn structure. Any advances have to be incremental and based on accuracy. The first thing to determine is that White should not go for any immediate action on the queenside with

18.cxb5. The second thing is to understand

that exchanging the bishop on d4 too quickly would weaken the dark squares throughout the white position, and even though we do not anticipate the knight making it to d4, we could imagine having to exchange our good bishop for the knight, and maybe a black rook reaching d4 eventually. Blacks only weakness is the b5-pawn (a hook) and the complex of pawn it fronts. The push a2-a4 will be in the air. Therefore the light-squared bishop belongs on b3, both because it is rather restrained where it is, and because we need this pawn push. But we also need to determine where the rooks belong. As the a 1-square is unavailable, the only open line where we can imagine having any fun is the c-file. The d-file is blocked and falls under our opponent's influence. We have two rooks and they should be doubled where they can do some good. However, doubling the rooks immediately would block the transfer of the bishop to b3, so the correct move order is to improve the bishop first.

18.±c2!

18.cxb5 cxb5 19.a4 bxa4 is too much too

early. White can have an interesting equal position after 20.b5 or 20.ikc2, but he should not be tempted by tactics. Black would win after 20.ibca6? Qxa6! 21.Qxa6 Rxa6 22.Rc8t Ne7 23.Sxh8 a3 24.jke3 a2 25.ibcd4 exd4

26.Sal Nxe4 and the forced sequence has

been bad for White indeed. You could imagine the game ending with 27.Sc8 Nc3 28.&fl Sa3 followed by the decisive 29...Hb3.

18...O-O 19.1b3 Sfd8 20.Sc2! Sd7 21.5fcl±

[diagram]
White has managed to put a little pressure on Black on the light squares. It is not a lot, but we have to make the most out of the positions we land in and then take it from there. I am sure that it was only when he got here that Leko spent any time thinking about what to do next.

21...Sc7 22.g3 h6 23.Ng2 Sac8 24.a4 Qe6

24...bxa4 does not work. White has 25.c5!

Qd7 26.Bxa4±.

25.axb5

This releases the tension and gives Black a chance to equalize. It was stronger to play

25.a5!=, when Black is still under a little bit

of pressure.

28.ile3 ibce3?

The pin down the c-file looks awful after

 But there is no way for White to exploit it. Did Khalifman reject this on principle, or did he just think there was no reason to allow such an uncomfortable pin, even if the discomfort is only optical?

29.Qxe3 Qe7 30.1a4

It is hard to guess what Khalifman overlooked. White wins a pawn and eventually the game.

125. Seirawan - Tal

Montpellier 1985

[diagram]
It is rather obvious that the rooks are going to be exchanged in the very near future. After this we will have a scenario where White dominates the dark squares and Black the light squares. It is also clear that Blacks king is more exposed and that a draw would be a satisfying result for Black. For this reason, White needs to think about his own king's protection, not from mate, but from perpetual check. The only place the king can hide is on h2, so this determines the recapture.

[diagram]
Chapter 5 - Solutions 283

25.fcg3!

This is the most dangerous approach. Black should be able to hold the game without too much trouble, but it requires some accuracy and as we shall see, this is not something that even such a great player as Mikhail Tal could manage over the board. After thinking about the probability of a perpetual check, it is useless to contemplate taking with the h-pawn. But it is worth having a quick look at the consequences of

25.Sxd5!? Axh2t 26.<^>xh2 cxd5 27.Qa4,

when White will win the pawn back shortly. But the problem is that after the exchange of pawns, the draw is closer and the white king is a bit less safe than in the game. I do not believe that the draw is too far away.

27...b6 28.Qd4 h5 29.Qxd5t Nh7 I find

it difficult to imagine that White would be able to overcome a reasonably played black defence.

25...5xdlt 26.Qxdl Qd7 27Jfel Ae6

The first inaccuracy I could detect. Tal is trying to be active on the queenside where he has a majority, but passive defence would have a far greater chance of success. The best move was 27...Qd6!

[diagram]
This anticipates White's plan of h3 and ^h2, and also prevents the white bishop from appearing on e5 too soon. After 28.h3 h5 there is no reason to believe that Black would not be able to conduct a successful defence.

28.b3 c5

I also do not like this move much. Black is being too active, when passive defence would be more appropriate. The main problem with this move is that it weakens the b5rsquare, which results in an entry point into the black position.

28...Qd3 29.h3 would also lead to an

advantage for White. You could imagine a line like 29...b6 30.jk,e5 h5 31.Qf2 !kf5 32.Qf4 with some advantage.

29.H3 b5?

This is too optimistic.

29...h5 also fails to work, for very similar

reasons to the game continuation: 30.Qfl! Qf7

31.Qb5! and Black is under a lot of pressure.

There are too many weaknesses in the black position for it to be anything but seriously unpleasant. The best defence was probably 29...Qd3 30jke5 h5, though White has a long-term edge.

[diagram]
30.Q fl!

White is probably winning now. The queen will penetrate the position, and Black is suffering from the weaknesses he has inflicted on himself.

30...b4 31.±e5 ffd8

31...@e7 32.Qb5 &£7 would offer a bit

more resistance, but after 33.Qb8 Black is still in serious trouble.

32 Jfb5! ffc8 33.Nh2 ld5

Black cannot defend this position in my opinion. 33..Jkf7 34.Qa5 a6 35.Qb6

36.Qa7 Bf7 (36...Qf8 37.Qxa6 and the

black pawns are all going down) 37.Qe7 Qc6

38 Jkd6 Qe8 39.Qc7 and so on.

34.1d6

White will win two pawns on the queenside and then obtain a passed pawn to push at the same time as he is creating threats to the black king.

126. Sedlak - Gustafsson

Aix-les-Bains 2011

[diagram]
This position is rather simple; Black needs to get the bishop on c8 into the game quickly so he can enjoy his bishop pair. In order to do this he needs to get the knight out of the way. But obviously he should not just mechanically put it on f6, where it would be going nowhere.

15...Nb8!

The other option was 15...Sd8 to play ...5^d7- f8-e6, but this has two minor downsides - it is a bit slower and the knight could easily be in the way of the c8-bishop again. Sure, you can bring the bishop out first, but this would decrease Blacks flexibility. From c6 the knight will shoot instantly at d4, causing White to have serious concerns straight away. I6.Ne5!? A radical move, following which it will be very difficult to hang on to the pawn, but what else should White play? After something like I6.h3^c6 17.Sadi Black will come out of the box in a very scary way: 17...Be6 18.Bfel a5+ and White's position is very difficult to keep together.

[diagram]
I6...1xe5!? The simplest solution. Black will attack the pawn immediately. Chapter 5 - Solutions 285

16...f6 would keep the tension and aim at a

long-term advantage, and was also good.

17.dxe5 18.Sael Se8 19.Qd2

19.Qc3 Jkd7 20.Nc5 Sad8+ is also deeply

problematic for White; the e5-pawn is very weak.

19...5xe5 20.Sxe5 Nxe5+

Black is a pawn up and won on move 37.

127. A. Kristjansson - Nataf

Reykjavik 2008

[diagram]
White has obvious pressure against d6 and Black has some counterplay down the g-file. However, Black can gain a winning advantage through giving up his knights for a white rook. We need to pay attention to this kind of tactic as well.

32...^de5t! 33.Nxe5 ^xe5t 34.Ne3

34.Ne2 Sg2t is even worse.

34...Nxc4t 35.&B Nxd2t 36.Sxd2

We can now see that White's minor pieces are rather poor with no scope, while the black rooks will penetrate the white position quickly.

[diagram]
This led to Black winning on move 49, but

36...Bg4!? followed by ...Sh4 is even stronger,

and is probably just winning for Black.

leads to a defendable position for Black:

White's advantage is considerable as Black cannot become active. If he did not have a weakness on d6, he would not be in such a bad situation, but it is there.

White has an excellent position with complete control, but in order to improve it, he needs to make the most of all of his pieces.

 White has no advantage to speak of on the queenside; nor does he have any real chance to develop one against decent play.

20.Sdl ^h7 21.?}xft>t gxft

[diagram]
White misses a direct win with: 22.jbcb7 Sa7 (22...Hb8 23.M,c6 Se7 is also awful. White can of course take on f6, but even clearer is the reintroduction of the queen into the action - which has now moved to the centre and queenside - with 24.Qa3!, when the black position simply collapses.) 23.Qb3 @e7

24.jkf2 White regains the exchange and will

have a great positional advantage as well as an extra pawn.

22...gg8 23.Qb3 Qe7?

23...5c8 was an improvement. White is

better after 24.c3, but not overwhelmingly so.

24.1xf7 Sgd8?!

24...5g7 25.Bg6t ^h8 26.Qxb7 also wins

for White, but it might take a while.

136. Van der Wiel - Portisch

Budapest 1986

17...c4! 18.Ne5

It is not entirely without value to spend a tempo provoking a weakness with 18.Ba5, though unlike elsewhere in this book, the weakening of the c6-square after 18...b6 is not so critical here. White no longer has his light-squared bishop and Black does not have any problems protecting the light squares in the short term. He might have some problems securing his king in the long term, but at the moment this would not extend to much more than a minor annoyance.

[diagram]
Black should of course not fall for 18...Rxd4?

19.Be3!, when White has a very strong attack

based on: 19...Sxdlt 20.Hxdl Bc5 21.ftd7t Nxd7 22.Sxd7 Qh2 23.Qb5 Ib6 24.a4±

19.1f4Bd6

Van der Wiel is not a great fan of technical positions, so here he took the rather unfortunate decision to unbalance the position.

[diagram]
Black has a potentially good square on d5, but at the moment White would be able to kick the knight away with c2-c4. As there are few things as wonderful as a stable knight in the centre, Blacks next move is almost automatic; I seriously doubt that Portisch hesitated before playing it.

137. Adams - Razuvaev

London 1997

[diagram]
White's worst-placed piece is beyond doubt the knight on a4, while the black knight on d5 is sensational. Exchanging the two makes perfect sense.

18.c4! bxc3

18...ffxc4? 19.Scl+-

19.Nxc3 Nxc3t 20.1xc3

White's pieces gravitate to great squares with tempo.

20..Jke7 21.5}d4?!

21.Qe2!± would have been absolutely

gruesome for Black. The point is tactical and arises after 21...Qf6 22.Nd4, when Black cannot continue as in the game with 22...Sc5?!

23."i,b4! Sc4? 24Jbce7+-. Black would

instead have to play something dubious like

22...Rb6 23.Scl kd7 24.Hhdl, where White's

advantage is considerable,

21...5.5 22.kb4 Sc4 23.1xe7 Qxe7 24.h3

24.Qe2 Qc5!= might be what Adams missed

when he made his 21st move?

26.b3 would of course be riskier. I expect that

Adams was unsure about 26...Sc3 (26...^.b7

27.bxc4 Jbcc6 28.jkxc6 Qxc6 29.@d4± on

the other hand probably did not worry him.)

27.Scl Sxclt 28.Sxcl Qa3, but after 29.Qb4

this results in a favourable endgame for White, very much to his taste.

26...Sa4

[diagram]
This leads to a position which I feel does not favour White much.

27.Shell? would have tried to take advantage

of the passivity of the black position. But there are still a lot of details to take care of.

27...Qb6! (27...Nd5 28.f5±) 28.Qd6 Sb4

29.Qxb6 Bxb6 30.Qc4 Hb4 31 Nd6± I should

think Adams would have been happy enough with this endgame.

27.Qd6! looks best though. After 27...Qxd6

28.Rxd6 Qe4 29.ibte4 Sxe4 30.Scl± White

has a fine game. For example: 30...f6 31.Qc6 Nb7 32.Ne7t Nh8 33.Sb6 Na8 34.Sxa6 e5

35.fxe5 Sxe5 36.Sa7± and it is hard for Black

to justify his pawn "sacrifice".

24..Nf6 25.Nc6 ffc5 26.Ne5!?

27...Sb4 28.Nd3 Sxb2t! 29.Qxb2 Qxc6

30.Ne5 Qa8s31.&al!

White has a very slight advantage on objective merits, but in practice the position is hard to play. Adams made some mistakes approaching the move 40 show-down, before securing a draw on move 44.

138. Bu Xiangzhi - Nijboer

Wijk aan Zee 2007

[diagram]
The two most important aspects of this position are the weakness of the d6-pawn and the poorly-placed knight on f5. Bu tried to trap the knight, but went completely astray, only winning the game due to a blunder by his opponent. I believe that he did not fully appreciate how weak d6 really is.

22.dxc6?

Although this does not lose all the advantage, it is decidedly inferior to the direct win with

22.g4!.

[diagram]
This has the simple idea 22...^d4 23.Qg3, and it is time to resign. Black can try something desperate, of course, but after

22...b5! 23.gxf5 Jbcf5, White will play 24.Re6!

and Black is simply a piece down. There are some complications, but the position is won for White.

22...bxc6 23.g4!

Belated, but not too late to be effective. The knight is after all trapped.

23...d5

After 23...Sxb2 24.gxf5 ikxf5 25.Re2± White is a piece up, though there are still some complications remaining.

[diagram]
24.cxd5?

This is truly feeble; Bu misses another great option. Here White could have invaded his opponent's position with 24.Se6!, leading to all kinds of threats. The forced line goes:

24...Nd4 25.Sxg6 Rxf4 26.£}xd4! and Black

cannot recapture on d4 because of 27.Qe5!, but has to play 26...Sxflt> when after 27.ibcfl the only move that keeps the game going is

27...Qf8!. Here White has many tempting

options, all leading to good winning chances. But after 15 minutes of probing, I still have not found a knock-out blow. Black seems to have many defensive resources. I allowed Fritz 12 to Chapter 5 - Solutions 295 speculate for a while; every minute it decided on another favourite, always claiming an advantage, but not a win, for White.

24...cxd5 25.Sa4?!

White is drifting badly. It was better to retreat with 25.Se2, when after 25...Nd4

26.ftxd4 Jbcd4t 27.M,e3 the position is quite

equal. A possible tactical end to the game would be: 27...ibce3t 28.Sxe3 Hxflt 29.Qxfl Sxb2 30Jbcd5t Qxd5 31.Se8t Nh7 32.Se7t ^g8 and so on.

25...Re8 26.Qcl

White is also a little worse after 26.Qa5 Qxa5 27.Sxa5 Rb4! 28.gxf5 Hxf4 29.fxg6 jkb7, when Black's bishops have come to life.

26...5xb2?

A completely needless sacrifice. After the simple 26...Qb6t 27.^hl ^e3! Black was simply a little better. I am not sure why Friso refrained from this pleasant option. It could be that he did not fully feel in control of the position after 28.jkxb8, but Black plays

28...6xfl 29.ibcfl Qxb8 with an edge, and

ideas such as 30.Qc6 Bb7! 31.Qxg6 d4, when White would be subjected to a fierce attack.

27.gxf5 kxf5 28.Nd4

White has many other options, but I am not sure if any are better.

[diagram]
28...Qd7??

A horrible move that is hard to explain. Black had several alternatives that would have kept him in the game.

28...Qb6 is playable, though it does not solve

all Blacks problems: 29.ibcd5t (29.ike3 Bd3! equalizes) 29...^h7 30.Qc7 Qxc7 3lJbcc7 Jke4! 32.Sel! Black cannot fully equalize, but after both 32...Sg2t 33.^fl Sf8t 34.£}f3 Jbcd5 35.Nxg2 Sxf3 36.^gl and 32..Jbcd4t

33.Sxd4 Sg2t 34.<&hl Se2t 35.Sxe4

S8xe4 36.Sxe2 Sxe2, Black has respectable drawing chances. I would personally hope to draw these endings about 80% of the time. The best option is the speculative sacrifice

28...5.g2t! 29.Nxg2 kxd4 30.Rxd4 Qxh4,

giving Black a lot of threats. I do not think White can gain a substantial advantage. For example: 31.Sf2 Qg4| 32.&fl g5! and a drawable ending is in the cards. Or 31.Qc3! Nh3t!? (31...g5 32.1g3 Ae4t 33.Sxe4 Qxe4f 34.Nh2 Rf8 is another good drawing chance. White should probably keep the rooks on and try to deliver mate, but it will not be so easy.) 32.Qxh3 Se2t 33.Nf3 Qxh3t 34.Nxe2 g5 and the pawns are probably strong enough to generate sufficient counterplay.

29.Nx6

White is winning.

29...Qxa4?!

29...See2 30.jkf3 Qxa4 may have been

Blacks intended idea, but White plays

31.Nxg7! and Black does not have an attack

without the all-important bishop.

139. Hillarp Persson - Stellwagen

Malmo 2006

[diagram]
Black has a lot of weaknesses on the light squares, but there is no easy way to exploit this. Tiger Hillarp found a fine tactical solution, with purely positional aims.

31.a4!!

White would like to make this advance if at all possible. Playing b4-b5 would give him a huge positional advantage, so Black has to take up the challenge.

31.Sc2± is a non-move.

31.b5 axb5 32.ibcb5 Hcc8 33.a4± is natural

enough, and White is a bit better. But Black still has the two bishops and a chance to fight for the light squares.

31.Qh7? cxb4 32.£\f6 simply does not work:

32...5xc4! 33.Qg8t Ne7 34.Qxg7 Sxcl

35.Sxcl b3!-+

31...cxb4

31...Bxd5 32jkxd5 Sc7 33.bxc5 dxc5

34.Bc4± gives White a more or less winning

positional advantage. Control of the light squares is a far more important factor than the opposite-coloured bishops. It is easy to imagine that Black will struggle greatly with his weak a- and c-pawns, as well as the permanently soft spot on f7.

32.5Bxb4 Bxb4 33.ibce6 7!

If White had time to consolidate with Qfl- e3 he would be very happy. For this reason, Black needs to react absolutely immediately.

[diagram]
18.Qg3

The only move, but hardly a refutation of the black advance!

18.Qxb5? would be a disaster. The knight

sacrifice on f3 looks strong, but even better is making some use of the passive bishop with

18...jbcg4!, when Black wins. For . example:

19.fxg4 Qxe4 20.Qf4 (20Jfc2 Qh4| 21.Qg3

Qf3t 22.^fl Qxh2f! and White will soon be sent to Sardinia in small tins.) 20...Qc3!! A fantastic move. (20...Qa5t 21.^dl Qxg4! also wins, but in a more complicated way.) 21.Qe3 Qxb5 Black is just winning.

18...b4 19.Qdl

19...Qexg4!?

This sacrifice borders on being too optimistic, but it is also characteristic of Zhao Juns love of complications. 19..Jk,a6! must be the correct move if you ask me - which in a way you did by buying this book! After 20.Qe3 Jbce2 21.(^)xe2 Qb6, the only thing that stops Black being better is that White can play 22.Qef5t! Ng8 23.Qh6. Then it is advisable for Black to immediately secure the draw with 23...Qa6t 24.^dl Qd3t

141. Morrison - Rowson

Edinburgh 1999

If Black does not do anything then White will have quite a nice position with his bishop pair. For this reason, Rowson decided to fully establish control over the d4-square.

[diagram]
20.bxc5 may have been better, but

20...Hxdlt 21.Hxdl ^xc5= would give Black

other advantages (the split white pawns), as a substitute for not getting the d4-square.

20...5.dlt 21.Sxdl Nd4

21...axb5!? 22.cxb5 ^e7 23.a4 would

be sharper. White obtains the c4-square, but has no target on a6 to play against. My engine prefers Black, but I really think the position is satisfactory for White.

22.1xd4?

A horrible move. After this White has no play and Black is well placed on the dark squares.

142. Morovic Fernandez - Seirawan

Novi Sad (ol) 1990

[diagram]
(Position after 16.,.e7-e5) Black would love to bring his pieces into play with ...exf4 and ...Ne5. He would not significantly mind if White played (the legal)

17.dxe6 fxe6, when ...d5 is in the air and the

e6-pawn is not really weak. And 17.g3?! exf4

18.gxf4 Sae8 would give Black a target for

counterplay.

17.6! cxd5

17...Sad8 18.Sd2 does not diminish the

white advantage. Eventually he will threaten dxc6 and Black will have to play ...cxd5 anyway.

18.Axb6?

This leads to an attack that is only good enough for a draw. Correct was 18.Nxd5! Nxd5 19.Rxd5.
[diagram]
 And now the best is probably 19...gxf5

20.exf5 Sfe8±, as after the natural 19...^f6

White has the powerful move 20.Sb5!, where the rook is looking at the important a5-, b7-, d5- and e5-squares. In such a scenario, White's advantage is probably quite close to being decisive.

18...Qxb6 19.£}xd5 Qxb2 20.fxg6 hxg6

21.Sabi Qa3 22.kg4 23.Sb3 Qxa4

24.5}e7t &H7 25.Sh3t 1H6

29.5}f5t with a perpetual.

143. Gheorghiu - Rajkovic

Lone Pine 1980

[diagram]
27.a4!

This is the correct move. White wants to put his pawn on a5 and is aided by tactics. In the game White played 27.Rb8?!, which threw his advantage away (although he won on move 47 anyway). After 27...Rd8! 28.Rxd8 Jbcd8 White would not manage to advance his a-pawn. For example: 29.Sal Qa4=

27...5da7

Black has to go into defensive mode.

27...Rxa4? 28.^b6 would give White a

technically winning endgame.

28.a5 ±d8 29.Sal±

Whether White can win this ending is not obvious, but he could certainly have a fair go.

 The weaknesses in the white camp are f4 and f2 (and to some extent also g4). In the black camp the weakness is g7. White intends to play Qa7 to generate counterplay, something that worked very well for him in the game! Black's worst piece is most certainly the queen!

31..Jfb8!!

145. Nyzhnyk - Werle

Groningen 2010

[diagram]
Black is under some pressure down the d-file and it would be quite natural to look mainly at defensive ideas. But if we do our three- point analysis we notice that there is indeed a weakness of importance in the white position and that our worst-placed piece can attack it in only two moves. Had Werle thought in terms of the three questions, he would probably have drawn this game quite easily. Instead he swam like an axe, to use a Russian idiom.

17...Nd7?

17...^c6! was the correct response. The

main line goes 18.e5 Na5! with counterplay.

[diagram]
In my opinion White does not have any advantage here. He has a few options, but really what we need to play like this with Black is only to check the absolutely concrete stuff: 19.exd6 Nxd6 20.ibcc5 ^xb3 21 Jbcd6 Nxd2 These kinds of desperado moves where you have to make the right captures with the right pieces can be a bit confusing, but here it works out beautifully. 22.ibce7 (22.^xd2? Sxd6 23Jbcb7 S=?ad8+ is all wrong) 22...Axf3

23.Bxd8 Sxd8 24.Bxf3 Nxf3t 25.Ng2 Sxdl

26.Nxdl Qe5 Black has no problems in this

ending. White can also try 18.h4, but it does not make any difference, Black will respond with the same idea of 18...^a5! with sufficient counterplay.

18.e5!

The decisive break, taking advantage of the lack of stability in the black pawn structure. Black's response is forced. 18".Nxe5 19.Nxe5 Nxg2 20.Nxg2 dxe5

21.Sxd8 Sxd8

21..Jbcd8 might have given a few more

practical chances, but White's pawn majority on the queenside would still give him a solid edge.

24.b4 axb4 25 Jhcb4 f5 26.c5 Nf7 27.c6 e4

28.Nb5 kb6U

Black should have tried 28...J,e7 29.jS,a5 jkf6 as a last practical chance. The ending arising after 30.c7, where Black has two pawns for the knight, is of course winning for White; but he would have to prove this in practice.

146. Zhu Chen - Koneru

Doha 2011

[diagram]
The most important factor in the position is the badly-placed knight on h5. White would love to push it with g2-g4, but at the moment Black can meet 24.g4? with 24...Qxb2!

25.£}e4 5}f4!, when she would have the

advantage. White's job is thus to prepare for this tactic - this can be by preventing it or through having a way to deal with it when it comes. An interesting move is 24.b3!?, simply preventing ...Qxb2. White should certainly have the advantage after this. But there is an even stronger way to deal with it, taking advantage of the weakness of the d6-pawn as well.

24.Sa3?

This move makes little sense beyond trapping the queen if it takes on b2. Black now has time to activate her queen.

24.e4! was the perfect way to take advantage

of Blacks problems; g2-g4 is now a huge threat.
[diagram]
 Black's only attempt to obtain play is to go through with her plan with 24...Qxb2, when the simplest is 25.^xd6. Black's pieces are all hanging, and it is hard to come up with a recommendation. The best try seems to be

25...Nf4, but White wins with accurate play:

26Axe8 Sxe8 27.Sfel £}fd3?! (27...f6 may be a more practical approach, but White has a winning advantage after 28.Sadi c4 29.Sbl!, when Black is missing her usual ...Qd4 resource.) 28.ibcd3 Qxf2f 29.Jbcf2 ^xd3

30.Sxe8t ibce8 31.Sbl b5 32.axb5 ikxb5

(32...axb5 33.Sal! and White wins) 33.d6 Nf8 34.jbcc5! and White wins on account of

34...^xc5 35.Scl and the endgame is trivially

won.

24.. Jfb4! 25.Sb3

25.g4 can be met with either 25...Qd4!,

where Black is probably a bit better, or with

[diagram]
25...Nf4 26.Qxf4 Qxb2 27.Qcl Nf3t and

the position is wildly unclear, with about even chances.

25...Qd4

Black has overcome her immediate problems with the knight and is now a little better. She won the game on move 49.

147. Shaw - Meier

Liverpool 2008

[diagram]
Black's weakness is the king. The weakest squares in his position are e6 and e8. It is too easy to get deluded into thinking that the pin is important, when in fact Black is very well placed to deal with it. For this reason, the worst-placed white piece is ironically the rook, which would be much better checkmating the black king, rather than hitting its head against a brick wall.

35.Sel!

Black is immediately done for. In the game John blew his chance, playing 35.^h2?, when Meier seized the advantage with 35...<Ng7? and won on move 48.

35...Ng7

35...Bb7 36.Se6 Qc5t 37.Nh2 Qf8 and

White wins after both 38.Hf6 and 38.Qe5 Sd8

39.Se7, with death and destruction.

Black would find no hope in 35...Re7

36.ibcd5t ibcd5 37.Rxe7 Qxe7 38.Qxd5t>

when White wins quickly with Qf7 on the next move.

35...Qc5t? 36.Nh2 Qxc4 leads directly to

mate: 37.Se8t Ng7 38 Jff8t Nxg6 39.Se6t and so on.

35...Rc7 prepares a check on c5 for real, but

White can sidestep it in many ways, including moving the b-pawn, the king or the bishop - all of them winning.

36.Se6 37.Qe5t

Exchanging the queens would also work.

37..At6 38.Sxc6

White wins.

148. Tikkanen - Leko

Malmo 2012

[diagram]
There are a few weaknesses in the white position - the a4-pawn, the d4-square, the f2- pawn and maybe even the d3-pawn, though it is hard to see how Black will be able to attack Chapter 5 - Solutions 305 it at the moment. Black would like to get more out of his bishops, without allowing too many exchanges, and relieve himself of the pressure against a5.

[diagram]
Using the attack on the a-pawn as a way to gain time. 28Jfal?!

28.h4! would have been a very interesting

defensive attempt. The main point is that White has some play on the light squares after

28..Jkxa4 29.Qa2 jkxb3 30.Qxb3, though

Black remains better with 30...,i,c5.

[diagram]
The bishop is on the way to e6, where it will have a real target in the b3-knight.

[diagram]
29.Nd2 Sxcl?

Leko misses the chance to win a pawn with

29..Jh:5 30.Sfl Qh6!+, which would have

fully crowned his strategy. 31.^c4 Jbch3

32.^xe5? is refuted by the immediate killer

32...1.f2t!!.

30.Sxcl ±c5 31.Sfl b3

31...Qh6 32.Nc4! is not the same anymore:

32...Jbch3 33.Qcl! @h5 34.Nxa5 leaves White

no worse. It was worth considering 31...J,e6!?, with the intention of 32.Nc4 Jbcc4 33.dxc4 Sd8?, but White's position should be defensible.

32.5} c4 Qc 7

[diagram]
33.ffdl?!

At this point White had an almost unbelievable resource in 33.Qel!! "i,b4 34.Qdl "S,xa4 35.^h2, when the black bishops find themselves tied down defending the queenside pawns and the advantage is elusive.

33...5b8 34Jfh5

34.Qd2 Sb4?

34...1d4 35.Sal Sb4 36 Jfdl Qc5 37.Qd2

g6 38.Ecl? This loses the game. White should have played 38.Jkfl!? and simply waited. The position looks very unpleasant, but there is no direct way for Black to do anything. If he plays .. Jkxa4, it is impossible for him to untangle his pieces, and the same goes for 38...Rxa4 39.Rxa4 jkxa4 40.Ng2!, when Black's advantage is close to gone. For example: 40...J,b5 4l.Qxa5 ibcf2

42.Qd8t Ng7 43.Qd6 f6 44.Qxc5 ±xc5

45.Jke2 J,d4 46Jkdl and White can hold a

draw in this marginally unpleasant ending. Instead of taking on a4 immediately, Black would need to get things going on the kingside and attempt to create a second weakness. This is not easy, but winning a game of chess against the best possible defence is quite difficult.

38...Rxa4 39.5}e3 Qb4 40.Qe2

40.Qxb4 axb4 4l.Sbl Sa2 42.5}dl would

not have held either, even though there is no immediate knock-out punch.

0-1

149. Karjakin - Inarkiev

Baku 2008

[diagram]
White should be better because of the pressure against the b5-pawn, but he has to decide how to deal with Black's two possible plans for improving his position: ...5}b6 and ...5}f8-e6. The correct move is based principally on meeting the second of these options.

37.Sa5!

37.Sa6!?± is weaker. Black can fight for

counterplay with 37...5}f8! 38.Qc5 5}d7 with the idea of 39.Qc2 5}b6!?. White has not managed to control the knight. The main point comes in the following line: 40.5}c3 5}c4 4l.jbcc4 bxc4 42.b5 Jk,b7 43.Sa4 @c7 44.5}e2 Qb6 45.Qxc4 lff2 46.Sal h5 47.Qc2 Nh7^ White still has some challenges in proving his advantage at this point.

37...Sd4

Black clearly found it hard to come up with a sensible move. 37...5}b6 is obviously out of the question, and Black is also in serious trouble after 37...5}f8 38.5}c3±, when White wins a pawn. The following line shows a plausible way for the game to continue: 38...Sd4 39.Jbcb5 Mb7 40.?}e2 White keeps his extra pawn, as Black cannot take the b4-pawn. 40...Sxb4?! 4l.Qa3 Sbl 42.£}c3 Sel 43.Qe7! The simple "S,e8! is threatened. 43...5}g6 44.Qd7! Now Qd2! is the threat. 44...Se3 45."i,c4! Black loses material and his structure fails. The key tactical point is 45...Sxc3 46.jbcf7t Nh7

47.ikxg6t Nxg6 48.Qf5#.

38.Qd2 Sd6

[diagram]
39.5}g3! 5}fS

39...g6 was the most stubborn defence, but

White has a great advantage after he wins the b5-pawn with 40.Qe2!±.

40.Qc3

40.5}f5 may be a bit more accurate, but

White is winning all the same.

40...Qb6 41.5}SSd7

Chapter 5 - Solutions 307 4l...He6 42.@c5 also wins for White. The main point is that Black's problems only accelerate after 42...Qxc5 43.bxc5 b4 44.Bc4.

[diagram]
42.1xb5! Sdl

42.. Jbcb5 43.Qxe5 and wins.

150. Roussel-Roozmon - Nakamura

Montreal 2008

[diagram]
It is not clear at first glance how to judge Black's unusual set-up with the pawn on h3 and knight on g2 - is it an effective invasion of the white position, or is the knight misplaced? This is a common phenomenon in modern chess. Being able to evaluate which factor is the most important is what many games are all about. Having said this, usually it is possible to cut complicated positional questions down to some simple basics. The white knight on dl and the rook on fl are poor. The knight on g2 may be good or bad, depending on circumstances. The f3-square is weak. The pawn on e6 is exposed. Black is able to solve all of these issues with a simple stroke.

25...e5!! 26.dxe5

White has no real alternatives. 26.Qxe5 Re8 followed by 27...Qf3 wins quickly.

26.f3 exd4 is also hopeless.

26..JT6

One of the main points becomes apparent after 27.@xf3 Rxf3 28.^gl d4!, when the white pieces are totally dominated.

In Positional Play Jacob Aagaard shares his simple three-step tool of positional analysis that he has used with club players and famous grandmasters to improve their positional decision¬ making. Working from the starting point that all players who aspire to play at international level have a certain amount of positional understanding, Aagaard lays out an easy-to-follow training plan that will improve everyone's intuition and positional decision-making. "The tools that Aagaard uses in this book look simple. But his method of three questions and his rather modest approach shouldn't deceive readers - if you follow the instructions carefully and concentrate on these important questions, you will most likely focus on the central elements of the position, which will help you to find the solutions of the exercises. Working with this book will train your positional judgement and develop your chess intuition. You will improve your decision-making process and learn some new practical skills. And maybe you will be able to make another step forwards..." From the foreword by Artur Yusupov The GRANDMASTER PREPARATION series is aimed at ambitious players.

1-0 Although I was only a small child, the style of play is not so different from today. I showed the game to Vladimir Kramnik and he felt the same way. And when he showed me a game of his from his early childhood, I could also recognize his trademark style in that game. Hard-to-get books The two most difficult books to get your hands on at that time were My Sixty Memorable Games by Bobby Fischer and 50 Selected Games by Bent Larsen. My father did incredible things in order to acquire these books. First he identified people who had these books. Then he harassed them endlessly to find out what they wanted for them. He managed to exchange his way to 50 Selected Games by providing the owner with a detective story he really wanted. And for My Sixty Memorable Games he paid his way - 25 Roubles. This may not sound of a lot today, but at the time his meagre salary was something like 1 20 Roubles a month. 20% of his monthly income for a chess book! Rubinstein - by Razuvaev and Murakhveri This book could not have been written without the work of one of the best chess writers, Yuri Razuvaev, and his book on Rubinstein's games, co-authored with Murakhveri. I will write more about this in the next chapter. Jacob and I had a number of conversations about what we wanted to get from our collaboration on this project. I would think like a chess player, eager to show my best games. Jacob would think

8 Positional Decision Making in Chess

like a writer, eager to teach and entertain the reader. As he is leading the pen, his vision will no doubt be the stronger, which is not necessarily a bad thing. There was one thing chat we agreed would make this book more interesting - to reflect on the influence Rubinstein's games have had on my own games. I am not sure the connection will always be as obvious co the reader as it is to me, but I have cried to explain it in the best way possible. Rubinstein everywhere I am not one of those people who feel a need to pretend chat I am a genius or chat I invented everything on my own. I am proud of my accomplishments and I am proud of my games. The fact chat I had great help and support from a lot of people, such as my father, my trainers Albert Kapengut and Aleksandr Huzman, and most of all from my beautiful wife Maya, is not something I think diminishes my accomplishments; rather I hope chat the fact that these people dear to me have supported me for decades cells something positive about my value as a human being. It is from this viewpoint I write this book. I am past the youthful need to prove co others chat I understand chess, and ready to explain how chess is understood instead. So we have focused on how I chink about chess, in the hope chat it will help aspiring young players to improve, as well as bring joy to chess fans who simply want to enjoy the game more. And the cornerstone of my thought process was laid down by my role model, Akiba Rubinstein. Obviously I always tried to learn from all the great masters, but it was Rubinstein who made the biggest impact on me, closely followed by the games and writing of Efim Geller and Lev Polugaevsky. For this reason we will return to Rubinstein's games - as well as other games that inspired me - throughout this book to explain what the reasoning was for my choices when taking the critical decisions. And from there comes the title - Decision Making in Chess. Judge us on this! Unlike my first book, My Most Memorable Games (Olms 2005), the intention of this book is not to focus on the accuracy of the moves I made at the board, as shown by subsequent analysis, but on the thought process chat led to me finding chem in the first place. Obviously we have analysed the games and in the process discovered things that made me re-evaluate some games entirely; bur throughout we have focused on the reasons for the decisions and plans I made, and also the limitations of my chinking during the game. I hope the reader will find this approach interesting and that it will help you with your own game. Boris Gelfand Rishon Le Zion, April 20 1 5 Foreword by Jacob Aagaard I am the ghost writer for this book, though the word writer does not fully explain what I have been doing. I have analysed positions, asked questions, recorded che answers, typed in everything and applied my moderate experience with chess writing to improve the structure and order of what had been said. Although this is all work that a writer does, the most important element is missing. The ideas in this book and che reasoning behind them comes from Boris and not me. If you want to know what I think, please buy my books (and I mean that, please buy my books!). I have dreamed about being involved in a project like this for a very long time. As a grandmaster I understand quite a bit of what is happening in top-level games, but obviously my understanding of the game is not at the same level as a World Championship challenger. I have wanted to be able to use my skills as an experienced writer and trainer to ask the right questions and obtain insights from him that you would not get if he was writing the book himself. Actually, it was especially the "obvious" things chat fascinated me about this process. Whenever something was obvious to Boris, I knew that it might not be obvious co many others; and that his explanation would be very instructive. 7he authors in conversation at the Tromso Olympiad in 2014 1 0 Positional Decision Making i n Chess This position is the cleanest example. Boris Gelfand - Daniel Campora Cesme 2004 Boris quickly and confidently made his next few moves, and would not have spent any time explaining chem had I not asked him why he played as he played. The explanation was short, clean and crisp. It was also incredibly illuminating. See more on page 1 1 6. This has been one of the most interesting projects in my career and I want to thank Boris from the bottom of my heart for agreeing to work with me on it. Jacob Aagaard Glasgow, April 20 1 5 Chapter 1 Playing in the Style of Al<llla Rubinstein 1 2 Positional Decision Making in Chess In the Soviet Union there was a series of books called the "Black Series" with the games of the best players, eventually spanning 32 volumes. When I was nine my father bought the volume on Rubinstein by Razuvaev and Murakhveri (probably Razuvaev did the chess and Murakhveri wrote the biographical parts) . When I came home from school I got so excited by this new book chat I went through it all the way wichour a board. And when I came co the end, I started reading it from the beginning again! I also did this with other books of this series, such as the books about Geller, Fischer and Larsen. Bue the book on Rubinstein made a profound impression on me. As you can see from the game in the Introduction, I was already playing in the style of Akiba without knowing it! Later on I forged a special connection with Yury Razuvaev based on the common love for Rubinstein. We had a lot of conversations about the way Akiba influenced modern chess thinking and opening theory. Whenever I won a game in Rubinstein's style he would call me up and congratulate me! He would call me the "Akiba of our time", which was a most pleasant compliment. Even Game Six against Grischuk in Kazan 20 1 1 (which can be found in a later volume of this series), he claimed belonged to Rubinstein. Razuvaev said chat I had a gift for spotting thematic ideas and using chem to my advantage. Sadly Razuvaev was already terminally ill at that time. Nevertheless he was able to give me a lot of moral support. I would call him up co see how he was doing and he would refuse co talk about his health, instead focusing on the Candidates, emphasizing chat I had a good chance to win and so on. Razuvaev had a gift of explaining things deeply and at the same time using simple words. He was truly one of the greatest chess writers and thinkers we have ever been blessed with. As a trainer he worked with many of today's top players, such as Topalov, Tomashevsky, Laucier and former Women's World Champion Alexandra Kosteniuk. Of course we should not forget co mention Razuvaev's main achievement as a coach. In the 1 970s he was one of a small group chat helped the young rising star Anatoly Karpov to become World Champion. He was also captain of the gold-medal-winning Russian team in Manila 1 992. Rubinstein's Great Help Coincidentally I have played some of the best chess in my life in the Rubinstein Memorial. I missed a few opportunities in 1 997 and was second, but won the tournament in 1 998 and 2000. In 1 998 I scored one of my most memorable wins, with the Gelfand-Khalifman Variation against the Griinfeld. The game can be found in my first book My Most Memorable Games, but I do not chink it will scare away potential readers of chat book to give the highlight of the combination; a move I was very proud of finding.

1-0 Noe only did I play well in these tournaments; more importantly, this invitation came at a time in my career where I had received no invitations for six months and I believed my career to be in ruins. Bue I won this game and another great game, and suddenly I was back. My connection with Akiba is stronger than just this (as if this was not enough). I played in the Spanish League for four years, and I find it pleasing that the team chat invited me to play in Spain comes from the town where Rubinstein played one of his greatest tournaments in 1 9 1 2, the year in which he won five top tournaments. Moreover, he played one of his greatest games there. Akiba Rubinstein - Carl Schlechter San Sebastian 1 912

Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 15 Championship title. His main successes are in "daily life". I first talked to lvanchuk in 1 983 and we played for the first time in 1 985 in the Soviet under- 1 8 championship. I won the game, somewhere in the middle of the tournament, and managed to keep this advantage to the end. I have over a hundred games against lvanchuk in my database, but I have certainly not entered every game we have played. So including rapid, blindfold and all that stuff, we have played more than that altogether; each of them a world in its own right; always interesting and instructive. lvanchuk has so broad an opening repertoire; he can simply play everything. In the 20 1 3 Candidates tournament he surprised me with the Chigorin Defence, which is not often played in top tournaments. He got a good position, but later got into time trouble and lost. Against me he has played the Dutch, Benko Gambit, Queen's Indian, Slav, Semi-Slav, King's Indian and so on. We have probably played a game in every opening after 1 .d4.

16 Positional Decision Making in Chess

9 ... .Bc5!? This was sort of a novelty. It had been played in a few games between strong amateurs, but I cannot say that I had considered it at all. A bit earlier the same year 9 ... .Be7 was played (by transposition) in Ivanchuk - Dominguez Perez, Linares 2009. The game developed well for White, although it was eventually drawn. le is not unusual for Ivanchuk to play the same positions from both sides, so it was not a great surprise. Ac this point I spent 24 minutes deciding how I wanted to develop my pieces. I think I found a good idea chat managed to put my opponent under pressure.

10.a3!

This is quite a subtle move with a number of points to it. IfWhite plays 1 0.tllc3, as Ivanchuk did against Dominguez, Black's bishop is ideally placed on c5. After 1 0. .. tllxc3 1 l .bxc3 O-O White is not able co put early pressure on che black queenside with tllc2-d4. White still has some play to compensate for the weak pawn, but he has no chance of an advantage. Another idea I considered was to play 1 0. .Bxd5 exd5 l 1 .tllc3, but after 1 l ...d4 1 2.tlla4 Wfb5 1 3.tllxc5 Wfxc5:

[diagram]
I think Black has a good version of the Tarrasch. The light squares around the white king are undefended and further weaknesses will not be difficult for Black to provoke. White has to seek equality quickly, if it is there at all!

1 O.e4 is of course one of the main challenges to

Black's set-up. After I O ... tlldb4 1 1 .tllxb4 .Bxb4 1 2.a3 it looks as if White is winning a tempo. Bue Black plays 1 2. .. .Bc5 1 3 .tllc3 .Bd4.

[diagram]
I could not see how co exploit this tempo gain at all. In this position e2-e4 looks like it has only succeeded in weakening the d4-square. This is the reason I went for 1 0.a3. This time around White has a real threat. He wants to go b2-b4 and e2-e4, pushing back the black pieces. This provoked quite a natural reaction from my opponent. ••• a5 Looking back at this move with not only the hindsight of knowing the course of the game, but also with the knowledge gained by challenging the assumptions we had during the game, this move looks less natural than it did at the time. Rather than looking like an obvious move, fighting for the control of the b4-square, it looks like a move we would make in a blitz game. Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 1 7 If we compare the time spent o n a2-a3 and ...a7-a5, we can see that White's move has deprived Black of the b4-square, while Black has defended against a threat that did not exist a move ago. In this way we can safely say that the inclusion of these two moves favoured White. Furthermore, as we shall see later on, moving the a-pawn has left the black b-pawn exposed. It is quite likely that it will have to go to b6 in order to let the c8-bishop join the game and here it will be much more exposed than the a7-pawn would have been, had it been the base of the queenside structure. But what about White's threat of gaining space in the centre. Surely this should be respected? During the game I was absolutely certain about this, but a lifetime of analysing my own games has taught me that we should always investigate our assumptions; go deeper and get closer to the truth of the position, which might at times turn out different than we expect it to. As you have probably guessed by now, analysis shows that Black should seriously consider playing:

10. ..

O-O!?

[diagram]
This of course allows White to push forward with: 1 1 .b4 Be7 But with the bishop aiming to go to f6 and with ...a7-a5 hanging in the air, things are not so simple. Please forgive me for going into a bit of detail. 1 2.e4! 1 2.i.xd5 l:!d8! ( 1 2 . .. exd5?! 1 3.tlJc3 is promising, although Black has some resources there as well) 1 3.tlJc3 i.f6 gives Black reasonable counterplay. 1 2. .. tlJf6 1 2. .. tlJc?!? This move looks a bit strange, but it is more ambitious than retreating to f6. White has to react with great urgency to create problems for his opponent. 1 3. .le3 ( 1 3.tlJc3 tlJb5 indicates that advancing the pawns on the queenside may have its drawbacks as well. Black is fighting for the d3- and c4-squares indirectly and the d4-square rather directly. To use a common cop-out: more analysis is needed.) 1 3. .. Wf a6

Subsequent analysis suggests that the right way to play was: 1 1 ...tt'Bf6! 1 2.tt'Bc3 O-O The reason the knight had to go to f6 can be seen after:

13.tt'Ba4 \Rb5 14.tt'Bxc5

[diagram]

[diagram]
The weakness of the dark squares ( ...a5) is a problem that cannot easily be solved. However, Black also has positive things going on for him. I think White is slightly better. All this is of course something we were able to find after the game through deep analysis.

[diagram]
 4 3 2 White is threatening to play tt'Ba4 and take the bishop, which gives Black a hard choice.

[diagram]
It is harder to play positions where you are a bit worse than those where you are a bit better. Every move has drawbacks and it is hard to determine which are the most serious ones. lvanchuk decided to solve his problems with the exposed queen, but White has quite a lead in development and the queen did to some extent contribute to the defence of the weakened squares on the queenside. 1 2. ..

O-O

This works less well now. 1 3.tt'Ba4 \Rb5 1 4.tt'Bxc5 Black now has to recapture on c5 immediately rather than first attacking the queen, as White could put his queen on h5, defending the c5-knight. Thanks to this difference, White can cause serious problems.

This is quite ambitious. Black wants to play ... b6, ...Ba6 and ... l:!d8, with active counterplay. Also possible is ...Ba7 followed by ...e5, again with a decent position for Black. So at this moment I thought for I I minutes and I believe I found a good idea, which in retrospect seems logical: if Black is playing with only a few pieces, it makes sense to exchange them so he is left only with undeveloped pieces. This is how I can explain it now. But during a game I just look for the best solution. It is a far more concrete process. This does not mean that the understanding is not important; only that it is more subconscious.

13.i.e3! b6

Ivanchuk tries to continue his plan. The endgame after I 3. ..Bxe3 I 4.tt:lxe3 WxdI I 5.l:!fxd I ± is quite depressing for Black. We can now see that ...a5 has weakened the position and that Black is in grave danger from manoeuvres such as tt:lc4-b6/d6 and e4-e5 followed by tt:le4-d6/c5. Note that Black cannot take on b2. After I4 ...Rxb2 I 5.l:!c l , White will win the game with I6.tt:lc4. To be honest, I was not fully aware that my advantage was as big as I now see it is. During a game this is often an irrelevant Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 21 consideration. You see that you have a nice position, that you can improve your pieces, so you go for it. What more do you need?

22 Positional Decision Making in Chess

White already has a clear advantage for simple reasons. He is way ahead in development and the b6-pawn is very weak. It is by no means easy for Black to defend it. It is chat simple. If Black castles, it is possible for White to play E:d6 and llla4, when after ...b6-b5 the knight comes to c5. After this the black bishop and knight cannot easily come into the game. If Black cries to push his b-pawn to b4, White will play a3-a4 and have ideas of .ifl -b5 and lllc5-b3. And any pawn push in the centre by Black fails to create counterplay and only leads to additional weaknesses.

17. ..

i.d7 Black is trying to change the course of the game. If I play 1 8.E:ad l I am sure he intended to castle queenside. Maybe this is not that great, but I decided to avoid it all the same.

18.e5 .Bc6

1 8. ..O-O-O is not possible now: 1 9.E:d6 and White wins. 1 8. .. E:c8 1 9.E:ad l .Bc6 20.E:d6 is quite similar to the game. I9JM6 hg2 20.Qxg2 gbs We have reached maybe the last critical moment in the game. At this point I had to calculate accurately to ensure that the knight endgame was winning. As this was the case, I more or less forced him to enter it. You cannot do such things on feeling. On the contrary it is important to be very careful in this kind of situation. You can easily end up in a position where you have simplified so much that your advantage is no longer sufficient to win the game. This would be the worst scenario.

21 Jladl O-O

Black could also have tried 2 l ... h5 with the intention of ...h4 and getting the rook into the game in this way. Bue if this had been played in the game, maybe we would now be debating if Black should not have castled instead. Black's position is poor no matter what.

[diagram]
23 ...gfdS I will be in full control of the knight ending, but I am not at all sure what else Black could have cried. For example, 23 ...b5 24.llle4 and White is about to invade. One possible line would be: 24 ...b4 25.a4 b3 26.E:cl E:b4

Qg6 45.Qd5 e4 46.Qxc6 1-0 It is of course surprising to win such an easy game against one of the strongest players in the world. But on the other hand, when you look through the game, it is not that easy to spot the mistakes. This is the second time I have annotated this game; the first time was just after the game, when I had my impressions and the quick suggestions of the engines to go by. These were wildly different from the annotations in this book. While we were working on them, we found quite a lot of resources for Black that neither I nor my opponent was anywhere close to seeing during the game. And this is exactly the point of the next topic. The Squeeze Rubinstein was not only good at winning better positions. He was also good at putting long lasting pressure on his opponent, exploiting a slight space advantage for example, and then just squeeze, squeeze and squeeze, until the opponent would break under the pressure. Because chess is after all a game that has to be played; and giving the opponent problems is what it is all about. The following game is an excellent demonstration of this. Esteban Canal - Akiba Rubinstein Karlsbad 1929

[diagram]
Canal has played the opening somewhat passively, but has managed to get through it without significant scars. We should remember that this game was played 40-50 years before it was discovered how Black should play Hedgehog positions. Today we have great empirical material showing us how to play these positions with both colours; how many pieces to exchange, what to keep and so on. But in 1 929 the players were flying blind, trying to come up with their own ideas. It is my feeling that White would be better off keeping the knights on the board. It is not clear what good Black can do with his knight after something like 26.a3, which most grandmasters would probably play these days. In the game Canal goes out of his way to exchange knights, fixing his own a2-pawn as a weakness. The thinking is probably that without the knights there would be fewer tricks and manoeuvres to keep under control. Although this is questionable objectively, Canal shows excellent defensive skills in what Romanovsky referred to as the fourth phase; endings with queens and rooks, where the play is directed both towards queening pawns and attacking the king. Alekhine made a great contribution to this type of ending, greater than Rubinstein, but I still find Akiba's handling of the position Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 25 deeply impressive. Especially later on, when the king comes to the centre to free up the queen and join in the attack. But as said, this comes later.

i>g7 33. i>fl fH'8 Black has definitely made some progress. White's pawn structure is flexible, but full of weaknesses. Rubinstein plays slowly, squeezing his opponent. At this moment he is aiming to play .. .f4, creating weaknesses and most importantly fighting for the d4-square. Canal thus plays the only move he has at his disposal; not only preventing Black's idea, but also preparing to advance the d-pawn, creating a bit of counterplay.

White has defended really well and his position looks possible to hold at this point. This does not mean that he is not still under pressure; only that he is withstanding it sufficiently. Although not a household name today, Canal was considered one ofthe strongest players from South America between the two wars. He won a number of tournaments in the 1 920s and had a lifetime plus score against World Champion Max Euwe. He won a nice game against him as late as 1 948.

[diagram]
So things look okay for White, but once again Rubinstein proves his class by changing the nature of the position and posing his opponent new problems. The feeling of pressure that never ends must have been uncomfortable for Canal and undoubtedly he was also starting to get tired at this point. 48 ... £4!? 49.exf4 gxd4 50.gxd4 cxd4

26 Positional Decision Making in Chess

51Jld3?! The first of only two mistakes that lead to White's demise. At this point it was necessary to change the approach to the position and go from passive defence to active counterplay. White can fully equalize with the strike 5 l .f5!. If Black takes the pawn, White has ideas with Wi'e2!, attacking both the h5-pawn and threatening penetration on e6. I cannot see any reason Black would be better in this scenario. But also after 5 1 ...d3 52.Wi'e5 d2 it is limited what Black can actually do with his position. After something like 53.Wi'xb5 Wl'e7 54.fxg6t Rxg6 55.Rg2 White is not in any danger. His king will come to assist with dealing with the d-pawn, while Black will find it really difficult to defend against all the checks. Today we know that we should fight for counterplay like this; that we need to change the character of the game when we have the chance. But as we will see again and again in this book, it is not by any means easy to find the right moment for today's grandmasters either.

Black forces a rransmon into a rook endgame. As we know from Mihail Marin's Learn from the Legends and Mark Dvorecsky's Endgame Manual, this is the phase where Rubinstein truly excelled. Even though Canal plays a lot of good moves, the position is lost and Rubinstein offers him no chances.

0-1 It is well known chat Botvinnik studied Rubinstein's games and learned a lot from chem. He won many games by squeezing his opponent, just like Rubinstein did in this game and many others. The Long Plan Nimzowitsch wrote about Rubinstein that what amazed him most about his games was the incredible length of the plans. When you look at games like these against Schlechter and Canal, you see chat Rubinstein's play in the opening, middlegame and endgame is connected. Everything is tied together in what looks like one long plan. You find a path in the beginning of the game and you follow it right the way to the end. Now I do not believe that it is possible to predict the way the game is going to go. Bue what made Rubinstein the master is that he developed his pieces, defined a goal and used all the possibilities on the way to achieving it, be they tactics or improving the position of his pieces. This is how I see it. And it is how I try to do it. Team Chess I do not play for a lot of teams, but I was involved with building up a team to compete in the Russian Team Championship together with Igor Burshtein, who is a big fan of chess and also the owner of probably the best chess magazine in the world, the famous Russian magazine 64. Our idea was to invite young talents to the team, such as Giri, Caruana, Wang Hao, Karjakin, Nepomniachtchi and many others. We did not have a big budget, but with this approach we managed to build a strong team. Another idea of the team was to only use players who like chess more than poker. This might sound silly, but in a lot of the other teams the preference between the two was probably a bit more balanced. I prefer to play in a team where the topic of conversation is the games we just played ...

28 Positional Decision Making in Chess

Later on the team merged with another for financial reasons. We won the Russian League twice and bronze in the European Club Cup once. Throughout most of its existence, the team was called '64', but after it merged it was called 'Moscow 64'. Burshtein eventually became too busy to be involved in the team, but it still continues. In 20 1 4 I could not play, but the team still took second place. A game in a team event is not too different from an individual game. But it is always nicer to play in a team where there is a good camaraderie rather than the strongest possible team. If you do not talk to each other after the game, what is the point of being in the same team? Fighting for the c-file - White against Vladimir Malakhov I have only played one game against Malakhov with a classical time control. We have also played a rapid game once, which is not in the databases. I have to admit that I do not know that much about him, but I can give my impressions all the same. If they are right, they might help people who will face him in the future. If they are wrong, they will perhaps benefit Malakhov! Either way, it will probably help the reader a bit in appreciating this game. Malakhov is to some extent the inventor of the style we now associate with Magnus Carlsen. He plays very strong technical chess and is able to outplay his opponents in flat positions. There are many players who are able to play well in positions where they have a slight advantage; but to be able to create something out of nothing is really a supernatural skill. Malakhov is also an accomplished nuclear physicist with connections to the physics department in Dubna, where his mother lectures. His father is also a physicist, as well as a keen chess player. I remember that I was especially impressed with the way he beat Evgeny Bareev in a game in the Queen's Gambit Accepted, also in the Russian Team Championship, this time in

2008. Bareev and I played for the same team

Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 29 This ending is not only completely equal, but it is close to what we would call dead drawn. However, Malakhov is able to cook soup on a stone, and exploit the miniscule advantages that can be spotted only with a microscope. First of all White has the potential to create a little pressure because of a tiny space advantage. Secondly the a6-pawn has the potential to be slightly weaker than the pawn on a3, because of the placement of the bishops. Finally, and this will probably come as the biggest surprise to the uninitiated: the pawn on h6 can become weak. In the game Black should probably have defended slightly more aggressively on the kingside. In particular he should have looked for a possibility to put the pawn on h5 in order to exchange it. But it is also quite natural for Black to wait and see, before doing anything active. After all, he does not have to prove anything if he wants a draw: the status quo is quite satisfactory. Bareev decided to take the king to c7 in order to free his bishop. This is slightly in contradiction with the basic principles of the endgame, where you should focus on making the most out of your best pieces. And in almost all positions, the king is more effective than the minor pieces, as long as its safety can be guaranteed.

But when you are deciding how much risk you should take in your own game, you look over at the board next to you and feel assured that at least Evgeny is making a draw! Psychologically, there is a significant difference between playing a comfortably equal position with chances to press, and playing a slightly worse position. In the latter case, you may have to choose the right moment to change the course of the game in order to avoid falling under more substantial positional pressure.

This opening is popular among players who like a simple repertoire where the number of concrete lines is limited, so they know more or less what they can expect. Black should be slightly worse, but on the upside his position is very solid. As such it fits very well to Malakhov's style and it is no surprise that he has played it consistently for the last decade. White has a great choice against this opening. I have personally switched a lot between

5.a4, 5.e3 and 5.c5. I used the last of these

in two great games, against Movsesian and Kiril Georgiev. These games can be found in the book of my best games, published by Olms. While 5.e3 is a natural developing move, both

Most significantly, Anand used a version of this idea as his main weapon in our 20 1 2 match. You can find our games with this line from page 1 92. A lovely memorial Chebanenko died quite young. I met him a few times at junior competitions where he was helping his students. He was a very pleasant man and he truly loved chess. These days a rapid tournament is organized in his honour. In 20 14 the fifth edition of the Chebanenko Memorial saw Viktor Bologan win in front of such strong grandmasters as Malakhov, Shirov, Kuzubov, Lysyj and Svetushkin. The tournament is organized by Bologan and is sponsored by the president of the Moldovan Federation, Igor Dodoo. It is a wonderful way to remember Chebanenko. Back to the Malakhov game!

A terrible blunder that loses the game rapidly. Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 35 Another benefit of this move is that White can play a4-a5 or c4-c5 in some positions, getting a better structure on the queenside. We shall look more at this in the next game. 5 ...e6 6 . .Bg5

The inclusion of ...a6 and a4 might not seem like a big difference, but in reality the position is simply different and should be approached on its own terms. However, I should say that even in the classical Cambridge Springs, an advantage does not necessarily lead to a win. I lost to Magnus Carlsen in the 20 1 3 London Candidates after getting a slight edge in the opening, without either of the a-pawns having been moved. I have had this position (with the subtle pawn pushes included) against both Aronian and Kamsky. The latter game was played in our 2007 Candidates match in Elista, and was drawn after a big fight.

7.e3 .Be7 s.gcl

This might look a little bit odd. The c-file is not about to be opened. But I already had decided to transfer my bishop to b 1 , as happened in the game. From b l the bishop is safe from the knight on b4 and at the same time it controls the e4-square. There is little doubt that Black is going to use the weakness of the b4-square by putting a knight there. Having said that, maybe 8.i.d3 is more natural. It should be said that theory has moved on a bit and that these days it is more typical to put the bishop on e2, the queen on b3, and quickly exchange the knight when it comes to b4. My occasional second and close friend Pavel Eljanov from Ukraine recently won a good game in this line, against guess who:

The main function of this move is to make space for the rook on d l , not to defend the c4-pawn. It was of course possible to play 1 2.b3, but in that case I was anticipating that Black would put his bishop on b7, with the intention of playing ...c5. I only wanted to play b2-b3 if Black put his bishop on a6 and forced me to do it. 12• • .

Black will be able to play ...c5 and equalize the game completely. The bishop on b I is out of the action in this position and the e4-square has become irrelevant. Bur this is not a very natural way for Black to play and neither Malakhov nor the other players who have had this position have played anything other than 1 2. .. Ba6. One of the main reasons why taking on c4 makes more sense here is because some pieces are exchanged and White's space advantage for that reason matters less. This is the way the opening goes; with good play Black should always equalize. When I was preparing for this game I had to choose between the various ideas I have against this opening. I remember that the computer said that this is a very innocent-looking system, but my feeling was that the position was much easier to play for White. It takes a special type of psychology to defend the black position.

[diagram]
Both players are following up on their intentions. Black now has to solve the problem of his bad bishop on c8. Chapter 1 -Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 37 But if you have this system in your repertoire, you should be ready co play such positions: passive, but solid. But another question is if you like the white position; and I do.

13.b3 lLJd7?!

This is quite passive. The knight is heading nowhere from d7. 13 ...c5 14.lLib5! shuts out the a6-bishop. White has won two tempos in this symmetric position, as che black a- and c-pawns have gone to the 4th rank in two steps. White is simply more active. The strongest move was 1 3. .. lLie4!, as it exchanges the knight, which otherwise has no function. White should not exchange the bishops: 14 . .Bf4! lLixc3 1 5.E!:xc3 c5 1 6.lLie5 f5

17.E!:d l You cannot prove it to the computer,

but I still chink White is a little better. He still enjoys the same space advantage and a lead in development. Objectively it is not much, but it does matter which side of the board you would prefer to sit on. White won in David - Dunis, Porz Barcares 2005.

[diagram]
14. .Bf4!

This is an important moment. It does not make sense to exchange the bishops, and since Black has no weaknesses, White should not rush into things with 1 4. .Bxe7 Wfxe7 1 5.e4, when Black can enjoy the benefits of his flexible structure. A serious option is I 5 ... dxc4 1 6.bxc4 e5 and White will soon find himself with a few weak pawns. Another way to make this decision is co understand that when you have a space advantage, you need to keep it. Exchanging pieces does not support this goal. Now White is threatening e3-e4, so Black's next move seems to be forced, after which Black loses a lot of his flexibility. For example, if he ever goes ...c6-c5, White can play lLib5 and the pawn on e6 stares to be a bit weak.

14. ..

fS The position has transposed into a Stonewall structure, where the formation of the black pawns usually means chat the bishop on g2 is worse than the "bad bishop" on a6, b7 or h5. I am not sure chat the white bishop is much better on b l , but as in the traditional Stonewall structure, we can exchange it. And here this is maybe a bit easier. 1 5J:Udl Of course it is not very likely chat the cl-file will open, but as Black does not have a lot of active moves, I do not believe that White loses anything by putting the rook on d I before executing his main plan. 1 5. .. .Bf6? The bishop has more or less no function here. Maybe it was played to cake control of the e5-square or to give the black queen space, but in reality White is threatening to execute a long plan and Black is doing nothing to counter it. Hard as it might be to imagine now, in the end this bishop becomes Black's worst piece and White wins the game by playing against it. Black should play I 5 ... E!:c8 and cake it easy.

38 Positional Decision Making in Chess

One of the engines suggests that Black should play for an active blockade with 1 5. ..g5 1 6.Bg3 g4 and then it wants White to put the knight on d2, which seems odd. Where it is going from there is not clear at all. This reminds me of a friend from my chess club in Minsk, National Master Sergey Begun, who had gone through all of Fischer's games and said that he never went backwards. If his pieces were attacked, he would look for a counterattack, rather than retreating. I was deeply impressed by this observation and since then I have always been on the lookout for counterattacks, whenever my pieces are attacked. 1 7.tt:le5 tt:lxe5 1 8.Bxe5 Bf6 19.Bf4 The white bishop might look like a bad bishop on paper, but it is still better than its counterpart. I do not know if White is objectively better here, but with more active possibilities and a safer king, I prefer his position.

All of White's pieces are where they belong, so it is time to start the fight for the c-file. First we exchange Black's two best pieces. Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 39 It is not without dangers to take on b3, but probably he had to enter these perilous complications in order to change the course of the game. Of course if he had done so and lost, we could have said that he should have defended passively and not done anything desperate. I see this as an important feature of the great players: to be able to accurately judge when to wait and when to change the course of the game. It was one of Anand's great strengths when he was at his peak a decade ago. He was good at waiting and then spicing things up when necessary. It was my feeling that no one else had as good a sense for this as Anand did back then. After 1 8. .. '%Vxb3 I intended to play 1 9. .Bd6 threatening to trap the queen. Forced is: 19 ... dxc4 20.i.c2 '%Vb2

[diagram]
After 2 1 ..Bxf8 followed by e3-e4, White's position is much better. White's idea is to open the game with the black queen out of play on b2. Malakhov's decision can be explained by the fact that the he often plays the Chebanenko, an opening where you get accustomed to being a little passive and having slightly less space. A danger with playing such systems can be that you become immune to the danger signals - a bit like the metaphor of the boiling frog.

Not being able to see what Black should do, I decided to improve my position on the kingside, with the aim of creating more weaknesses down the line. I do not remember with certainty, but I do not think I considered paying homage to Karpov - Unzicker, Nice (ol) 1 974:

29 ... Ei:xc2 30.Rxc2 <iid7 was suggested as a better defensive option by Hubner. The idea is chat the king comes to fight for the c-file, but White has 3 1 .Re2! and Black is struggling. If Black puts the knight on c6, White can invade on a6 with the queen. There are simply too many weaknesses.

When playing this I calculated a good way into the endgame, to around move 38, which I thought was a winning position. There are too many weaknesses and too great a space advantage. It is quite natural in such a position, after carrying out his strategic intentions, chat White looks seriously at the forcing options; here this means the transition into a minor piece ending. I should add that the g4-g5 push comes at just the right moment, when the bishop cannot go to e7, as it could if White exchanged the major pieces first.

Black is under pressure. One tactical point is that 33 ... ciie7? is met with 34.Rc6! and White wins directly, as the pawn ending cannot be held. And after 33 ... ciie8 34.f4 White dominates the board and will slowly invade the black position. In a sense, the above tactic is irrelevant because White can slowly invade whether the king is on e7 or e8. The only thing to look out for is if Black is able to create counterplay and maybe give perpetual check. If White plays well, this will not happen, but the presence of the queens does carry a slight risk that White needs to pay attention to.

3 l .i.e5? would be a mistake now. After 3 l ... l"i:xc2 32.Rxc2 ltJc6 Black manages to close off the c-file and neutralize most of White's advantage.

Queen endings are of course a bit riskier than other endings, in that the defensive side can often make a draw by perpetual check, which is not a frequent occurrence in other endings. For example, in my Candidates match against Michael Adams in 1 994, I failed to win a queen ending, which temporarily caused a unbalanced view of queen endings in my subconscious. In the subsequent match against Kramnik in Sanghi Nagar 1 994, I could have transposed into a winning queen ending, but was reluctant, keeping on the rooks. Vladimir managed to find a great stalemate trap in his analysis and held the game. That ending is on page 246 in My Most Memorable Games. 32 ... 'itixc8 33.i.xbS 'itixb8 White is still in the process of carrying out his strategic operation. Notice that the black bishop is utterly useless on h8, despite being a so-called good bishop. The space advantage is considerable and the black king is very far away. Had the king been on e7, Black would be quite close to a draw, but e7 is quite a long journey at the moment!

Here I spent quite a bit of time. First of all, even if you have enough time approaching the time control, you will inevitably get some heightened emotions approaching move 40. It is almost always very useful to calm down before making more decisions. Chess history is full of big mistakes made on move 4 1 or 42, probably because of adrenaline and other hormones impacting the brain in a way that does not work well together with making long-sighted rational decisions. Secondly, there is no reason not to invest the time in understanding the position at a deeper level, which here means working out a clear win. This is what I did here. I played rather quickly later on. White has to make a decision about how he wants to break the black defence. And I think I managed to find the most natural and convincing way. Basically I just want to get the king to g6 and squeeze. I also wanted to make sure that the bishop was unable to break free and attack the e3-pawn. White would probably still be more comfortable, but if it can be prevented, it should be. You also have to realize that you will have to make a decision, find a way to advance. What I was looking for here was total domination. Black is never in time to create any kind of counterplay.

Despite being a pawn down, Black holds this pawn ending. Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 47 This all looks quite hairy for Black and we should not forget Larsen's mantra, Long variation - Wrong variation. It is quite certain that there are improvements for both sides along the way. But what I wanted to illustrate with this long variation was the path the game could have taken, had Black attempted to defend actively. Compare this with how the game developed and you will see that although it looks scary, it was the only sensible way to play the position.

[diagram]

[diagram]
Rubinstein has achieved what he was looking for all along. White has permanent pressure against b7 and if Black ever manages to play ...b7-b6, the c6-pawn will be weak and there will be an excellent square on c5 available for the white knight. It is possible that Takacs went into this position thinking that he could hold it, as b7 is not that difficult to defend. But then he did not have the advantage of studying Rubinstein's collected games! It was only years later that they were available in book form. 30 ...Qe7 3 1.:Sb2 Qd7 32.ilebl Qc8 33.Qe2 i:!e7

White has achieved all he can on the queenside. Standard theory on endgame technique tells us that you need to provoke a second weakness. In this case it is logical to do so on the kingside. And this is indeed where Rubinstein turned his attention.

A very concrete move that Rubinstein no doubt calculated deeply. Still, I am not entirely convinced it fits in with "best practice".

1-0 I see myself as a well-educated player and am always happy when I am able co play games chat show this. The following game is quite interesting from this perspective. In it I managed co play the entire game based not only on one idea, but on the same idea as the above game. The b7/c6-pawns are fixed and vulnerable and I managed co gee a knight co a5. Boris Gelfand - Alexander Morozevich Astana 2001 Alexander Morozevich is a highly creative grandmaster from Moscow. He has always gone his own way and cried co reinvent the game of chess, which at times is very impressive, but at other times has been a liability for him. He played in the World Championship tournaments in 2005 and 2007 and peaked in the world rankings in 2008 where he was placed 2nd. He has not done as well in recent years, but is still often found either just inside or just outside the cop ten. le is well known chat Morozevich played a lot of training games with Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 49 friends and trainers, in person or online. In 200 1 when this game was played, Morozevich had just emerged in the World elite and this was how he did it. He played rare openings, often provocative and dubious-looking. But he had analysed them deeply and as said, gathered a lot of practical experience in training games. Probably people remember his 1 1 ...g5 in the Slav, which is now the main line. He played the Chigorin and in the French he popularized some sharp variations with ... gxf6 in the Burn Variation. His contribution to opening theory in that period was huge and is still felt today, especially through the style of preparation, involving very risky and concrete play, but also creating big problems for the opponent to solve, if he wants to try to refute it. The opponent is forced to think independently and play very energetically from the beginning, as in this game.

1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.tlic3 tlif6 4.tlif3 a6

Again the Chebanenko Variation. At the time this game was played, this variation was quite novel and the ideas of it not yet fully mapped out. At first it was developed by especially Bologan, but later on both Kasparov and Topalov played it for a while, adding a lot of new ideas to the theory. Comparing with this game it makes sense to illustrate Black's idea based on 4 ... .Bf5, which is met by: 5.cxd5! (5.Wfb3 Wfb6 is known to cause Black fewer problems; but in the game the a-pawn has moved and the queen would no longer be defended.) 5 ...cxd5 6.Wfb3

[diagram]
Black cannot defend both the b-pawn and cl-pawn with any of the moves that he wants to make. Retreating the bishop is unpleasant, but probably still best. A young Egyptian GM avoided this retreat when playing against me. After 6 ... Wfb6 7.lllxd5 lllxd5 8.Wfxd5 e6 9.Wfb3 i.b4t 1 0.i.d2 lllc6 1 1 .e3 E:c8 1 2.a3 .Bxd2t

5.a4 .Bf5

[diagram]
In the Malakhov game we saw 5 ...e6. Compared to this, 5 ... i.f5 is the natural move. In the Slav Defence it is always nice if you can develop the bishop and play ...e6. The drawback is that it weakens the b7-pawn, which obliges White to play Wfb3 immediately. If Black has time to play ... e6, he would be able to defend the pawn with ... Wfc7.

[diagram]
This might seem incredibly odd, but actually it is quite a common idea in the Chebanenko and one of Morozevich's ideas at the time. He won a good game against Anand in the Dortmund tournament where Anand collapsed, losing four games and winning none.

The rook is of course badly placed on a7, but Black is banking on this being a temporary inconvenience. If he gets time to play ...e6 and ... tt:lbd7, he would be able to develop in a carefree way. Later on White would not be able to prevent the rook from coming back into the game, as we can see from the Anand game. Clearly it is a provocation and it forces White to play very energetically, to go forward and do something. If Black were given time to finish setting up his structure, there would be nothing wrong with his position. He would have no weaknesses and be able to play ... tt:le4 or ... tllh5 with good play. It would be hard to suggest anything sensible for White to do to put pressure on Black.

This was clearly still part of my opponent's preparation. I was out of book after five moves, while my opponent was still playing really fast. 1 1 .e3 This is the pawn structure I was aiming for. l 1 .Bf4 is also possible and it is tempting to put the bishop on the other side of the pawn chain, but if I get a knight on a5 and develop the kingside I will have a serious advantage. Therefore it is not so important if my bishop is developed or not; so I quickly get my other pieces out and castle to safety. Getting the knight to a5 is so important that everything else dims in comparison. Another point is of course that Black is not intending to allow me to get everything as I want it, without offering some resistance. We should consider seriously how he intends to deal with this simple plan. Once we do so, it becomes apparent that he is planning on sacrificing a piece at some point for 2-3 pawns and activity. If you know your opponent is planning to sacrifice a piece against you, it makes sense to get your pieces into the game and keep your position compact. These were my reasons and they are all reasonable. But I have to say that I cannot see anything wrong with 1 Lif4 either. Maybe it is also a good move. But I wanted to keep things under control, as whenever it gets out of control, Black will have achieved the game he wanted. 1 1. ..

If White wastes time and does nothing, Black will still be able to improve his position. Another point concerning this variation is that Black has managed to change the course of the game. I was very happy to have the b7-pawn as a target, so why should I allow my opponent to escape this path so easily? This is one of the main things I learned from Rubinstein.

Black probably has to provoke this concrete action. This is his one chance to give up a piece for three pawns. He should not have been given the chance, but sometimes we make mistakes.

We now see that the dark-squared bishop has been bad all of the game and that this has been a big part of Black's problems. In this line White has of course been entirely successful in keeping his best piece, while leaving his opponent with his most impotent piece.

I certainly did not have the feeling of playing a surprising or genius move at any time, though I do think I handled the challenges of preventing his counterplay quite well. Morozevich was one of the first to work deeply with computer programs, so maybe at some point he simply believed the evaluation of the computer, which evaluates the position as acceptable for Black even to this day. Probably his training games also went well and he felt confident enough to try it in a big tournament game. One of the myths of Morozevich has always been that he is very creative and plays with a lot of improvisation. Obviously he is very creative at the board, but we should not forget that this creativity in the opening is based on a lot of home analysis. The public have a tendency to not understand that about the conception of

58 Positional Decision Making in Chess

the most innovative ideas; they do not see how much preparation it requires between tournaments to be creative. Luckily this does not in any way diminish his achievements in this area; being creative at home is very difficult as well, as anyone who has ever cried can testify. My own playing style does not usually bring as much enthusiasm from the chess fans as chat of Morozevich, but in the struggle between dynamics and statics, sometimes someone has to cake the more conservative side. I do not personally chink this makes the games dull, though I am aware chat at times the real battle is going on under the surface, making it harder for some people to comprehend. Hopefully the more verbal explanations in this book will help unlock the thought process behind this kind of strategic game for a lot of people. In general I would like to add chat I am a strong believer in the value of a chess education built on thorough knowledge of the classics. Any attempt co emulate the engines and their 2,000,000 moves a second is doomed co fail. We need to supplement calculation with all other weapons available. And one of these is intuition, which is strongly rooted in pattern recognition. When you have "uploaded" a lot of chess patterns to your brain in your childhood, you will often have a very strong suspicion regarding what the right move is in a position, even though you have no idea why. ..

This game was played at a time when opening theory looked nothing like it does today. Most of the games opened l .e4 e5 or l .d4 d5. These days it is quite common for Black players to use dynamics as a way to counter the slight pressure White gets from the start. A hundred years ago people tried to equalize by solving their problems early, which is what Rubinstein manages to do in this game.

This can mean that you spend many more moves winning a position than the computer or even someone else might, but as long as you win, this does not matter. And the way to ensure that you win is to minimize the number of difficult decisions you will have to make in the conversion. And this is exactly what Rubinstein achieves with this move. 57 ...g5! is the computer's recommendation. White cannot create real counterplay against c7, as h2 would fall and the pawns promote.

0-1 A better pawn structure A scenario I quite enjoy is the one where I have a slightly better pawn structure and for this reason can manoeuvre around, putting pressure on my opponent all over the board, threatening to carry out a strong break here or there. Obviously I prefer my structure to be strong, flexible and vibrant, and for my opponent's structure to be riddled with weaknesses, for example isolated tripled pawns. But in the real world you have to play resourceful opponents; if you achieve anything it is already time to celebrate. In the 20 1 3 World Cup in Tromso I had a game where I got in my preparation in one game and obtained a nice advantage with a better pawn structure. Alex Huzman was walking around smiling and fell into conversation with one of the arbiters, who asked him, "Why all the happiness?" Alex explained, but found no understanding. ''A better pawn structure? If he was a rook or a queen up I could understand it, but this is surely nothing!" As the playing strength of the players increases, the advantage needed to win a game also diminishes. But I am sure that having a better pawn structure is an advantage 6 5 4
[diagram]
 Chapter 2 - The Squeeze 67 at all levels! So even if you do not know exactly what to use it for, get it. In the long run it will pay off. In the following game I managed to get a pawn structure where I could apply a bit of pressure down the b-file, and where it was easier for me to organize a pawn break on the kingside than it was for my opponent. In principle this could not be called an advantage, as analysis constantly proves that Black has more than sufficient counterplay. In the end, chess is a game played with ideas and moves. Each player has his own vision and understanding of chess, and will try to impose it on his opponent. In this game it was simply easier to connect White's ideas to good moves than it was to come up with ideas for Black. Boris Gelfand - Loek van Wely Plovdiv 2003 Van Wely has been one of the strongest Dutch players for two decades. He has an active positional style and is very strong willed. He was part of the European Team Championship winning teams for the Netherlands in 200 1 and 2005, both times on Board 1 . This game was played on Board 1 in Round 3 of the 2003 edition of this tournament. There is a great story involving Van Wely from 1992, when I played in Wijk aan Zee for the first time. With one round to go I was trailing Salov by half a point, and he was Black against Van Wely (I was Black against Sax). During the game Van Wely came up to me and told me that he had been offered a draw, but wanted to help me win the tournament and had thus declined. This made me a little nervous! A short time later he was dead lost. In the end I managed to win against Sax and Loek saved the dead lost position, securing me shared first place. It is quite typical of Loek to want to help by fighting! It is in his nature. l .e4 Around that time, 2002-2003, I played 1 .e4 quite frequently, maybe in a third of my games. It can be a good idea to play both l .d4 and l .e4 for a number of reasons. 1) It gives you the chance to play different types of positions. 2) It makes it more difficult for your opponent to prepare. 3) It makes it easier to go for weak spots in your opponent's preparation. For these reasons I gave 1 .e4 a serious shot, but somehow it did not really work out, so after some time I stopped playing it. Around the same time Kramnik was playing l .e4 as well, but it did not work out for him either. We even worked a little together on a few openings. Also around this time Grischuk asked me a few questions: why do you play 1 .d4 when l .e4 is obviously stronger? And why do you play the Najdorfwhen it is obvious that Black's position should be lost? At the time he was very serious about this, especially that a refutation of the Najdorf would be found imminently. But a few years later he started playing both 1 .d4 and the Najdorf. .. I should say that I do not believe that you can refute openings, especially not those with a solid positional foundation and a long history, such as the Najdorf. These days, people are getting ever more inventive in the opening. Some openings that were considered just bad are now mainstream, like the Berlin for example. Other openings might be harder to play, like the Chigorin, the Tarrasch Defence or the Modern Benoni, but they cannot be refuted.

13.a4

This was White's idea. The queenside is blocked and Black cannot play ...b5 or any other active options, and White is able to play a bit like in the King's Indian with a kingside expansion. In short, White secures a small structural advantage and prepares himself for a long game, trying to squeeze his opponent.

It is not really an effective piece, but from c7 it will both defend the b6-pawn and work against White's f2-f4 push. I suspect he was thinking that I would not be able to do much if he just waited. With so many pieces and so many possible things to do, this is a rather dangerous strategy, and in practice it proved difficult. Another interesting and logical option was to play: 22 ... tt:Jd4 23.tt:Jxd4 cxd4 24.Bd2 Bc5 Black has successfully defended the b6-pawn and can start to move his more effective pieces to the kingside.

If White managed to play h4-h5 and lllh4, Black's position could become unpleasant rather quickly. 24 ... llld4 This is still playable, though as mentioned Black had decided not to play it on previous moves. This is a common thing we see: if a player does not do something in good circumstances, it is highly unlikely he will do it in a less favourable situation, even if it is required. Also, White has been able to improve his position a little since move 22, so he would be able co create more difficulties for his opponent.

a quick collapse of the black position on the kingside. He can probably give up a pawn and fight on, but it is clear that this was a big opportunity.

Getting ready for the promised tripling on the g-file. But actually this is an inaccuracy, allowing Black to get back in the game with an active possibility. At this point I believe 33.tllgl! is best. White has some pressure and will play Wi'g2 and tllh3 {or tlle2). We have analysed this a bit and Black constantly had to solve problems, which is what White's strategy is all about. 33 ... .td6?! With the pressure being released on the queenside, it is quite natural for Black to add some flexibility to the bishop, at least superficially. At this stage in the game, there is a chance that a few decisions are made too quickly, due to the limitations of the clock, though I have to say that neither player was in serious time trouble at this point. During the game I was also considering 33 ...:ag? and after the game I analysed it a little. Essentially White can continue to put Black under pressure for quite a while. But this is irrelevant when you discover Black's active possibility. With the rook having abandoned the queenside, Black could have played 33 ...bS! in order to create a passed pawn and with it some active play.

[diagram]
A likely short variation is 34.Wi'g2 Wff7

35.cxb5 cxb5 36.axb5 a4 and Black has good

counterplay. (Note that an additional idea beyond creating a passed pawn is ... i.a5 in order to fight for the f4-square for the knight.) It might even be White who has to be careful at this point! For this reason it is possible that White should not take on b5 at all, making it immediately obvious that Black should have played this. However, neither I, nor my opponent (to the best of my knowledge}, considered this option during the game. I only found it while working on this book. Chapter 2 - The Squeeze 77 It is very hard, when you have a passive position, to time the right moment to create active counterplay. This ...b5 idea reminds me of the final game in the most recent World Championship match, where Anand managed to put his opponent under some pressure before recklessly sacrificing the exchange and losing the game. Magnus Carlsen - Viswanathan Anand, Sochi ( 1 1 ) 20 1 4 From move 3 3 to 3 7 I wasted five moves, moving aimlessly around. It took some time for me to understand what I should be doing in the position: open lines on the kingside with f2-f4. So I should manoeuvre the knight to support this push and keep the rook on b I to prevent ...b6-b5. All of this is easy to see in hindsight. It took time to work it out at the board. Luckily, like Polugaevsky (see page 229) I was not afraid to admit my mistakes, except I did not know they were mistakes at the time! I believed I was just keeping things fluid before the time control!

Although I still believe in White's position, there were better ways to defend the pawn. 37 ... :gbs This comes across as the most natural move, but was probably rejected by Van Wely because of a simple tactic. Bue if we look a bit deeper, we can see that instead White should carry on with his strategy and play:

White has managed co open up files on the kingside, making it possible to put extra pressure on the black position; most noticeably here, the f6-pawn. 37 ... Vfff c? would sideline the queen and White would continue with exactly the same moves and have some advantage. Finally, Black could consider not defending the pawn at all! If White takes it, the main effect might simply be a black invasion along the b-file. Chapter 2 - The Squeeze 79 37 ...Bh6! For the reasons mentioned, it makes more sense to answer this with:

40.cxb5 Ra2

I think this gives Black decent counterplay and makes the game rather unclear and complicated. So White would have to accept the pawn on b6 after all, giving Black a lot of active play. It is possible that White is still better somehow, but from a practical perspective, this would be a fantastic development for Black and something he should have gone for - and would have gone for - had he realized it was a real possibility. Instead, with his misplaced rook on a6, Black is unable to do anything active while White regroups on the kingside, preparing to play f2-f4 with all of those threats we have talked about previously.

1-0 It is possible to say that I outmanoeuvred my opponent in this game. But it was not just a difference in the level of play of the two players on the day, White also had a slight advantage out of the opening. Maybe not in the way we normally use the word advantage, as here I am talking about the advantage of having a very clear idea of what I was trying to achieve, while Black had to find ways to counter White's manoeuvring and constantly read my mind to avoid landing in trouble. In the end this proved too taxing. An important psychological point that should be mentioned is that it is quite a lot harder to play inferior positions where you are only fighting for two results, compared to positions where you are worse, but can also realistically imagine a way you can win the game. I should add that this was the first time Israel won team medals in an international event. Russia won the tournament, while we took silver and Georgia bronze. Our team line-up was Gelfand, Smirin, Sutovsky, Avrukh and Roiz.

82 Positional Decision Making in Chess

It works against the best There have been a few grandmasters who have been accused of only playing on their technique. Drawing lots and lots of games and only winning if they get an advantage in the opening or if the opponent plays poorly in a technical position. I want to stress that this is not an approach I am advocating - and I seriously doubt that these descriptions are truly representative of what these guys are trying to do. But if you manage to get a nice position, the squeeze strategy can be unusually effective. It is simply easier to play positions where you are applying pressure than to play positions where everything you do will lead to an inferior position. In such situations it is quite possible to make a mistake, even if you are the greatest chess player there ever was ... Boris Gelfand - Garry Kasparov Linares 1994 Garry Kasparov is probably the greatest chess player ever, especially through his impact on the game itself. His deep opening preparation expanded our general understanding of the game, as well as moving theory forward with concrete ideas. When I was growing up, I learned a lot from him. I shared his attitude to chess when I was younger; I played aggressively in the opening and tried to find new ideas all the time. So I believe that his attitude greatly impacted on me. I still play in this ambitious style, although Magnus Carlsen has proven that there will be plenty of chances to outplay the opponent later on, even if you have no ambitions in the opening. The Karpov- Kasparov matches probably made a greater impact on my chess understanding than anything else. I was following the games live, analysing them deeply. When I came to play in top tournaments, the first one being in Linares 1 990, Kasparov was my first round opponent. It was a great game, maybe the best we ever played (to be found on page 73 of My Most Memorable Games), and ended in a draw. It was reassuring to know that I could play on equal terms with anyone in the world, and it gave me confidence to play well for the rest of the tournament.

[diagram]
Although this was not at the core of his repertoire at this point, Kasparov had great experience in these positions from his matches against Karpov, where it was one of his main weapons - with both colours!

[diagram]

[diagram]

[diagram]
Theory has developed quite a lot in this direction. We analysed it in the post mortem after the game in the old-fashioned way: we sat at the board analysing the game with lots of people watching and strong players offering suggestions. These days some players tend to rush to their hotel room to get the computer's opinion rather than develop one of their own. I still analyse my games afterwards with people such as Kramnik, Aronian, Topalov, lvanchuk - the guys who grew up learning chess in this way! Of course I analyse with younger players after the game as well, but less frequently. But not because I am not willing! White's strategic idea here is to exchange the dark-squared bishop and then consolidate his marginal strategic advantage. It is a type of

In principle Black should be able to hold, as indeed Capablanca did, even though he had what appeared to be the worst of all worlds - a minor piece ending with a bad bishop against a powerful knight. (Later on players tried to keep a set of rooks on if this endgame was appearing in the horizon.) But defending such a passive position is not to everyone's taste. From another point of view, White's advantage is not big. It is not easy to improve his position. I remember that I once got a similar position against Morozevich. I tried for some 50 moves to make progress, but found nothing. After we had made a draw he told me that I clearly had wanted to make a draw and that this is why I had not played more ambitiously! I simply had no words. But I understood that he had analysed the position we got in that game in depth and genuinely considered it harmless. Or maybe he just wanted to pull my leg ...

i.g4? Not a great moment for Kasparov and his fans. I had wanted to play f2-f3 anyway to control the e4-square and here he forces me to do it, as well as providing me with two extra tempos. Simply stunning. When Kasparov played his first match against Karpov, he struggled to solve his problems gradually, and famously went down 5-0 along the way. But he learned how to deal with these problems during the matches and at some point he was able to hold such positions to perfection. Chapter 2 - The Squeeze 85 But after 1 987 he seemed to lose patience. And also, his opening preparation was so good that he rarely faced such positions. So he became out of practice with defending such positions and had a shift in mentality, where he truly believed that he could get great positions in every game and would not have to defend. But at times he did have to defend and he was not prepared for it. Famously he lost a drawn rook ending against Piket. I think there is no chance that he would have done so during his matches with Karpov. It was of course a rapid game, but just as important is that he was not mentally prepared to play such a position. Back to our position. I think Kasparov mainly looked at 1 6.'1Wd3 and some very concrete lines, which he calculated well and where he is okay. But this is not a position where the correct moves can be decided by calculation. The effects of the moves are long term rather than short term. This is something we often see in such positions where one side is squeezing. The opponent is looking for active counterplay, but it is really hard to find, as the pieces are permanently inferior in one way or another. Of course we always need some calculation, but here it is mainly just checking that we are not missing something, while making long term strategic decisions. 1 5. ..d4 is always possible. After 1 6.lllxe6 fxe6

17. exd4 lllxd4 the question is what we make

of this position. White is slightly better, his bishop is good, but Black is also very solid, and it will be hard to remove the knight from d4. However, it is still quite early in the game and it is a good question whether Black would be happy to defend such a passive position for the rest of the game. We should also consider what choices the opponent has to make! 1 5. ..Rd6 would be more natural, with the idea of putting the queen on e5. Black would still be looking to play ...d5-d4 at some point. A natural reply is simply 1 6.Rd2 to improve the position, but it is hard to claim that White has a sizeable advantage. And after 1 6.lllb5 Rb4 ( 1 6. .. Re5 1 7.llld3 Rb8 1 8.lllc5 is also not much, but maybe something) 1 7.llld4 lllxd4 1 8.Rxd4 Rxd4 1 9.exd4 E:c4 20.llle2 we get a technical position where White has the better bishop. It is really not a lot, but still it is a game and Black would find it more challenging to come up with good moves than White, as the advantage has a lasting character. Botvinnik won some nice endings in this structure, among them one against Petrosian. Against the best defence this would not happen, but it can happen, even against a World Championship Challenger about to dethrone the Champion!

[diagram]
1 7. ..d4 was of course still possible. Black's situation is worse than a few moves ago, but you have to play the position you have got. After 1 8.lllxe6 fxe6 l 9.llle4 I like White, not surprisingly. I 7 ...a6 was also possible. Again I like White after 1 8.lllce2 or 1 8.llla4. The endgames are starting to become unpleasant for Black.

86 Positional Decision Making in Chess

This is a good moment to take stock. White's plan was to exchange his opponent's good bishop and consolidate. He has entirely succeeded in this, as well as managing to put his pieces in dream positions. The question is what to do next. An important consideration here is to think of what Black wants to do. Basically, he would like to exchange all the rooks. At least, if I was Black here, this is what I would try to do: make sure I had only one weakness and then try to hold. I would probably start with ...g6, but it is also interesting to do it directly: 2 1 ...:gxcl

[diagram]

25.lllh5 llled7 and Black holds. So I wanted to

do something concrete to improve on this line and prevent ...g6.

21.g4!?

A concrete idea based on sound positional foundations. First of all, White can allow himself to play in this way because his opponent is not very active and because the situation in the centre is entirely stable. There are of course long-term issues with the king's safety, which we will see later in the game. But at this point in the game it is clear that the positives outweigh the negatives. The main idea behind pushing the g-pawn is to attack the d5-pawn. Nimrowitsch said that isolated d-pawns should be blockaded; Bent Larsen said they should be taken! Having satisfied Nimzowitsch, I am now aspiring to please Larsen as well... An interesting question is whether White's advantage would be enough to win the game without playing g2-g4. It is really hard to say. It is far easier to answer the question by saying that his advantage is bigger with the push.

21...lllg6?!

It appears that a sensible way for Black to play here was 2 l ...h6 22.h4 :gxc l 23.:gxcl lllc6! when it is not so easy for White to prove a serious advantage.

[diagram]
The tactical point is that after 24.g5? comes 24 ...hxg5 25.hxg5 lllh5!! and the tables are turned. So White would have to improve his position slowly; maybe with 24.:gc3, when after 24 ... :ge8 the game would continue. Maybe White should play 25.h5!? to fix the g7-pawn for later, although it is by no means obvious that this will prove relevant. One line we looked at in our analysis that shows the possible drawbacks of advancing the pawns goes like this: 25.liig2 g6 26.lllxc6 bxc6 27.'Rd4 lllxg4!

28.fxg4 'Rxh4 and Black has taken over the

22 ... �eS? As is often the case when one player is squeezing the other, the advantage is nothing dramatic. Bur in practice it can be hard to deal with it. You have to come up with ways to improve your position, while anticipating all of your opponent's ideas. It is quite likely that you will miss one. Kasparov decides on transferring his knight to d6, probably in order to lessen the impact of g4-g5, and to prevent any h2-h4 ideas. However, this transfer has a significant flaw. Instead Black should have played something like 22 ... E!:fd8 or 22 ... llle5, when White continues to be a little better. 23J�xc8 This is quite natural. White will be the only player with an active rook. 23 •. . .bcs 24Jkl �d6 Kasparov continues his plan. It was probably already difficult to find a good move.

Having seen his position gradually becoming more and more unpleasant, Kasparov chooses to give up the d5-pawn and at least get some activity for his pieces. Defending the pawn with 26 ... i.e6? loses to

4l8.ti:)f5 Lf5 49.gxf5 !z-1/2 Although he managed to save the game, Kasparov did not come out of it looking great. And this leads us to an important point, because there is no questioning Kasparov's greatness. It was the position which was very difficult to play. In short, it was more difficult for Black to find sufficient counterplay than it was for White to maintain the pressure. One of the reasons why it is so difficult to play a position where you are squeezed is that there will come a time when you need to switch from passive to active defence. If you do it too early, you can find, like Kasparov, that there are no targets for your active counterplay and that you are just wasting your time. Or like Janowski, you can miss the moment when you need to do something in order to not be squeezed entirely. It is also very difficult to cell the difference between positions chat are only slightly worse and chose chat are much worse - both feel uncomfortable. This is why blunders happen so frequently in worse positions. This is not the only time I failed co win a winning position against Kasparov. His resourcefulness in even hopeless-looking positions was quite amazing. (In a totally crazy game - Dos Hermanas 1 996 - I won a piece and was completely winning, but fell for the last trap on move 40.) It does not mean chat the strategy was not successful - only chat chess is really difficult. A final note The squeeze is the correct strategy in some positions and in others it is not. A classically trained player like myself will be happy co go for this strategy when the position allows it and it gives the best chance of success. The same goes for a player like Topalov, who is not commonly associated with this type of position, but is no less of a classically trained player than myself The difference is chat there are borderline situations where he and I might choose co go in different directions, because of our different interpretation of chess. Bue we are both going in the direction which we feel will give us the greatest chance for success. And at times this is implementing the squeeze. The goal of this chapter has therefore been to present this strategy as one possible way to play, and something we should be happy to do when the position requires it. Chapter 3 Space Advantage Te/Aviv 2012- Returning.from the match

96 Positional Decision Making in Chess

I definitely learned about space advantages from studying Rubinstein's games, as well as other classical games. le is one of my favourite weapons and we shall meet it often in these books, in one form or another. I am not sure if I can add anything new co the concept of space advantage, but I hope I can give the reader a higher level of understanding of the strategy of playing for and with additional space, looking at it from a practical angle. What is a space advantage? Having more space optically is not the same as having a space advantage. I chink this is one of che things chat tends co confuse some people. fu; I have always understood it, a space advantage occurs when pawns are taking important squares from the opponent's pieces. I chink the easiest way co illustrate this is by showing an absurd example: No space advantage If we were co add seven pieces co this position, Black would no longer have a fortress - at lease not if White is co move. White has a space advantage

[diagram]
1 .lDxg6! fxg6 2 . .Bxg6! hxg6 3.h7 and White wins. The inability of Black co defend the weakness on h7 illustrates co a great extent what space advantage is all about. (Obviously this is an absurd example and if Black were co move, he would save the game with 1 . .. lDxh6.) Most chess games are a baccle of two able minds of similar ability with exaccly the same resources at hand, so it is of course impossible for us co find such an absurd example in grandmaster practice. But this is only because the advantage has been extended grossly. Lacer in this chapter, we will see how a top grandmaster who has played Board One for a gold-medal-winning team at the Olympiad managed co end up with Black in this position:

[diagram]
White has much more space, but because of the lack of minor pieces (not that rooks would change anything) the position is a simple fortress. Chapter 3 - Space Advantage 97 A theoretical explanation My own understanding of space advantage is to a great extent intuitive. I can recognize it when it is there and I know from the example of Rubinstein and others how to handle it. This is quite a natural state for a practical player, who only has to make good decisions, not explain to others how to replicate such decisions. For this reason we looked at chess literature for good descriptions of the concept of space advantage. I am not surprised that we did not find many excellent descriptions of it, but we did find a few, of which the champion by far was Michael Stean's classic Simple Chess, originally published in 1 978, now available in an algebraic edition. His final chapter is on space and starts with this brilliantly clear explanation: "Unlike the ideas expressed so far in this book, space is not an easily definable or recognizable concept. The visual impression you obtain by glancing at a position and estimating who seems to have the lion's share can be misleading. The following is nearer the truth. Any given Pawn structure has a certain capacity for accommodating pieces efficiently. Exceed this capacity and the pieces get in each other's way, and so reduce their mutual activity. This problem of overpopulation is easy to sense when playing a position - it 'feels' cramped. "To take an example, compare Diagrams A and B. A: White has a space advantage

[diagram]
 4 3 2 B: No space advantage

[diagram]
"They do, of course, represent the same position, but with two pairs of minor pieces less in the second case. "In Diagram A Black is terribly congested. There is no way he is ever going to be allowed to play ...b5, while alternative methods of seeking some breathing space by (after due preparation) ...e6 or ... f5 would compromise his pawn structure considerably. White on the other hand can build up at leisure for an eventual e5, safe in the knowledge that so long as he avoids any piece exchange, his adversary will never be able to free his game. "Diagram B is quite a contrast. The size of Black's forces is here well within his position's

'capacity'. As a result there are no spatial problems at all and Black can very quickly seize the initiative by ...a6 and ...b5, or even by ... b5 as a Pawn sacrifice, e.g. l ...b5 2.cxb5 a6 3.bxa6 :gxa6 with tremendous pressure. "We see from this pair of positions that Black's structure is very good, but his capacity is small. Visually White has a spatial advantage in both cases, but in the second the eye flatters to deceive. In fact, he is grossly overextended. A vast empire requires an army of equal proportions to defend it." (Pages 1 33- 1 34) Space advantage and counterplay The difference between Stean's two positions is stunning, though we should not be blind to the fact that he removes White's best knight on c3, instead of the less well placed knight on f3, in order to make his point. Still the main difference is quite clear. With fewer pieces on the board, Black is able to prepare a pawn break and open up the position, thus making his artillery valuable. If Black is struggling with limited space, he will often have to make a sad choice between suffering passively or accepting compromises to his pawn structure in order to free himself. An extreme - and realistic - example

[diagram]
In my database there are 739 games where this position occurred. I managed to win a game against lvanchuk with the white pieces in this variation, but it is really too early to say anything definite about the position. Both sides have things to be happy about. Maybe after another 800 games we will know more ... There is an argument for White having a space advantage, but if we forget about our knowledge of opening theory, we will probably find it more surprising that there is an argument against this as well. With rooks on e8 and c8, a retreat of the queen to b8/a8 and the bishop to ffi, Black will have found good squares for all of his pieces. White will have to run the risk of overextending himself in the pursuit of an advantage. Black's strategy will be to wait and at the right moment blow the position open with ...b5 or ...d5 and in some cases ...e5. I am by no means dogmatic when it comes to space; it does not always come in the shape of an advantage, but it is one of the important strategic concepts in chess we have to take into account. In order to integrate space into our strategic thinking, we need to understand how a space advantage is exploited, so we can see when it is applicable. Mobility We have seen that when you have more space, it gives you more possibilities to manoeuvre your forces around. For example: you are able to switch your pieces between the two sides of the board faster than your opponent. This can lead to a situation where you enjoy better lines of communication and have better positions for your pieces. You might be able to attack a weakness more times than it can be defended, simply because you have more space Chapter 3 - Space Advantage 99 to line up your pieces, or because the lack of freedom in your opponent's position makes it hard for him to come to the defence of his weaknesses. Yusupov on how to use a space advantage In Chess Evolution 2 on page 234, Artur starts Chapter 2 1 with the following words: "The side whose pawns are further advanced than those of his opponent often has an advantage in space. This side then has much better lines of communication, which is an effective advantage in positions in which play can be carried out on both flanks. Space is only one element in the position, and it is often less important than, for example, an open file or pawn weaknesses. Nevertheless there are plenty of positions in which the possession of more space is an advantage. The side which has an advantage in space can position its pieces better and regroup them more easily. The side which has less space often has a problem doing that: it has too few good squares available for too many pieces. "Some guidelines for the side which has the advantage in space: 1) Avoid any unnecessary exchanges of pieces, because such exchanges provide more space for the opposing side's remaining pieces. 2) Carefully prepare to open a file, so as to penetrate with your major pieces. 3) Try to prepare a pawn advance, in order to drive the opposing pieces even further back. 4) If the situation permits, you may try to manoeuvre against two weaknesses. Better lines of communication play an important part in this. 5) It is important to think prophylactically and to prevent any attempts by your opponent to free himself." I absolutely agree with these five points, but would like to add a sixth point: 6) A space advantage can be increased by a transition into the endgame. If you have a space advantage and have taken control of the position, you could find that exchanging rooks, and especially the queens, will eliminate the opponent's remammg counterplay. A good illustration of this is Gelfand - Campora, found on page 109. hope you have found this theoretical foundation interesting. I would like to close it with the point with which I started it - to me space advantage is first and foremost something I approach intuitively. This does not mean that it does not exist, or that there is not a theoretical understanding of it. It means that for a practical player, a list of rules and well-defined concepts is not as useful as a good feeling for how to handle such positions, through experience, gathered both from using it and from seeing how other players have used it. Rubinstein and space advantage If you did not notice it at the time, you can go back and look at some of the Rubinstein games we discussed earlier in this book and see his masterly handling of space advantages. But it would be a crime to write about Rubinstein and not examine at least one of his games through the prism of space. I like the next game for many reasons. I like how Rubinstein plays the opening, especially moves 7 and 9. He then plays for a space advantage in the centre with the pawn trans formations from moves 11-15, and thereafter masterly uses it to outplay his opponent.

100 Positional Decision Making in Chess

I think Rubinstein was first with this idea. He wants to avoid the exchange on c3 under unfavourable circumstances. Obviously Black could have exchanged earlier, but Rubinstein judged, correctly I think, that it matters more here. These days the tlJd5-jump is played in roughly half of the games. 7 ... JJ8 8.d3 h6 9.b3!?

This operation is typical of Rubinstein. After the transformation of the pawn structure, we can see that White has a space advantage, not unlike a lot of positions we see in the King's Indian today (though with the bishop on g7, which gives more chances to create counterplay}. Once again we see that whenever Rubinstein had a fixed plan, he was not very flexible and

[diagram]

[diagram]
At this point I think the black position is starting to get rather sad. 15 ... c!lle7? I put the question mark here from the perspective of the 2 1 st century. If we imagined that some young player had played this today, we would question his chess education. A modern player would seriously consider giving up a pawn with: 1 5. .. ltJd4! 1 6. .Bxd4 exd4 1 7.'?;Vxd4 g6

[diagram]
Black has given up a pawn in return for dark-squared counterplay (potentially with opposite-coloured bishops) and will follow up with moves such as ... .Bg7, ... l:'!c8 and ... '?;Va5. I am sure that it is enough. To me it looks pretty playable for Black. I have played similar positions in the Sveshnikov many times over the last few years, for example in the World Championship match with Anand. The exchange of both sets of rooks should lead to a draw. Maybe the best thing White can hope for is an ending with rook and bishop versus rook and bishop, though I cannot see a way for White to exchange the queens. But even in this case, all Black needs to do is to keep control of the c-file and he will be OK, though he would still suffer a bit. This is often the case when we play slightly inferior positions: the wrong exchanges will make life difficult for us. There is nothing special in that direction about this position. Of course we cannot criticize Duras for not making this decision. The problem is that the dangers of allowing the opponent to have a space advantage were not fully understood at the time of this game; after all, we are to some extent talking about the pre-Rubinstein era ... Even 15 ... lDb8!? appears more natural. The knight certainly has lost time returning to its starting position, but at least it has a future on a6 or d7.

16.Yfd3

Out of the pin. I find the way Rubinstein played from this point on very instructive. First he improves all his pieces. To start with, both players have a number of pieces in poor positions. Both sides have stupid bishops, the knight on f3 has no function and it is hard to work out where the knight on e7 is headed. But White has a space advantage,

102 Positional Decision Making in Chess

allowing him to regroup his pieces in a smoother way.

16. ..

Vfd??! I don't like this move much. The main idea behind this move seems to be to exchange the light-squared bishop. These days our experience in the King's Indian is extensive and we know that we need this bishop to hold the queenside together. But again, we cannot judge Duras on modern terms. At this point we can start to see a consequence of White's space advantage: Black's position is getting rather cramped. Maybe Black should play something like: 1 6. .. i.d7 l 7.llld2 b5 This is hardly an ultimate solution, but it seems necessary. 1 8.a4 a6 The computer suggests that Black should take on a4, but this only helps White. Actually, we should forget about computers when we are looking at such closed positions. Here it seems that c4 is a key square. Now imagine that the game continues with: 19 .Ei:fcl Yfb6

I am not sure I would hurry to play this, but it is quite relevant for our theme to discuss what would happen if we did. 20 ... Yfb7 2 1 .b4 White is of course better, but compared to my game with Campora later in the chapter, we can see that Black has managed to keep his good pieces.

[diagram]
After 40 moves m a Closed Ruy Lopez White has the advantage through extra space. But in this case it is not apparent that he can do anything with this extra space. There are no entry-points and no weaknesses within reach. Furthermore White's bishop is tied to the defence of the a5-pawn. All in all, the game should soon end in a draw (as indeed it did) . In our example Rubinstein has freer hands and can start using his extra space to organize an assault on the kingside, presumably connected with f2-f4. And although it is not going to be easy to break Black's defences, it might be possible, due to the smoother manoeuvring White's space advantage gives him.

Bue it is quite typical of Rubinstein to spend as much time as possible improving his position. This is a clear sign of his style. 1 8.lt:Bc4 is neither better nor worse than the move Rubinstein chose in the game. It is a bit more energetic, but Rubinstein did not value dynamics that highly. Realistically Black would not change his play. But we should remember Bocvinnik's idea, which is that when you have to play several moves to follow your plan, it is best to start with the moves chat keep your ideas hidden and options open, if only to confuse the opponent.

White's advantage is extensive no matter what; probably the position is already lost for Black, somewhere between ± and +-. When I grew up our evaluation was formed by the system used in Chess Informant, where a slight advantage (t) meant that one side was pushing, and a large advantage (±) meant that nothing conclusive could be seen, but the opponent is in a dire situation. The players from my generation still think like this, while the younger players operate with a different system, which they learned from the computer (+0.20 for example), which is not very informative in my opinion. Or maybe I am just suffering from the afflictions of middle age. (I should probably say that the use of + 1 or +2 as descriptions is now used almost universally among grandmasters. But more or less only when they want to explain how winning the position was that they misplayed!) 23J:Ua l a6 24.�cl The bishop is rerouted to a better square.

This is the final instructive moment of the game. White is completely winning. He has more space, better pieces and not least, an extra pawn.

As said before, Rubinstein never rushed unnecessarily; so much so that the mantra promoted by modern books on endgame technique (Shereshevsky, Dvoretsky, Yusupov, Aagaard and Muller}, "Do not hurry" is attributed to Rubinstein.

White has maintained his slight edge. He has extra space and a better bishop still. At some point soon it will be time to open the position on the kingside in order to create weaknesses in the black position. I decided that this made it a good time to exchange queens, though it is by no means obvious that White does not also have winning chances by keeping the queens on the board. It is obvious that the c-file is the best place for the queens. At the moment Black has been allowed to control it, but I do not think he should be allowed to do so uncontested for any longer. By placing my queen on the c-file, I give my opponent a choice of whether to exchange queens or give up the c-file. I play what I consider to be the best move, but at times it is not obvious which path is the right one and in such cases I do the same as everyone else: I play the move that feels right to me on the day. Give me this position on another day (with the same opponent) and I might have waited before making a decision regarding the exchange of queens.

108 Positional Decision Making in Chess

[diagram]
I am unsure about this decision. Keeping the queens on would give potential counterplay when the game opens up later on.

[diagram]
Black has by no means been outplayed here, but he is under slight persistent pressure with no clear active options. It is difficult to defend this type of position accurately, especially for humans, and it is therefore less of a surprise that Carlsen errs. The real conundrum is that it is very hard to anticipate when Black should change the pawn structure, or when such a change would be for the worse; when he should be patient and passive, and when he should be active and/ or desperate. 39 ... .tf/? This fairly innocuous-looking move is actually a decisive mistake. 39 ...gxf4 40.exf4 J.f7;t; was required, though White has some pressure still. Here I missed my chance. 40 . .Bb3? After the game I found out that I could have won the game with 40.f5!. The threat of .Bc2-b3! would force Black to do something immediately.

42.Bxc4 dxc4 43.iie l White wins easily. The

king goes to c3 and a knight to d2. White wins a pawn and soon after the game. The black knight can only go to h7, f8, d7 and b8. There are no routes to anywhere else. Quite a good illustration of the power of the space advantage. And after 40 ...exf5 White should not take with the pawn, as I had considered during the game, but instead exchange Black's only good piece with 4 1 .llixf5t! llixf5 42.gxf5.

When you have managed to squeeze your opponent into only two or three ranks, it is often the case that you want to exchange the rooks and queens, but not minor pieces. Rooks, and especially queens, will be able to do a lot of damage if they manage to sneak behind a far advanced pawn chain, while minor pieces do not gain extra potential from a big void in the same way. Also, they are far less likely to escape from their prison. This of course only matters in positions where there is at least one open file; how are the rooks otherwise going to be able to escape? Bue in most games there is an open file, as for example in this one. Boris Gelfand - Daniel Hugo Campora Cesme 2004

1.d4 lDf6 2.c4 d6

I have some experience with the ...Bg4 idea chat Campora played in this game. Back in 1 987 I won a nice game with Black against Loginov. This can be found on page 47 in My Most Memorable Games.

Campora has played this a few times. I think this system is coo passive and chat White gains a definite edge out of the opening. Exchanging 1 1 0 Positional Decision Making in Chess the good bishop does little to ease the pressure, as we shall see in the game. Such observations might sound very basic, but we should not discard old knowledge just because of its age or how easy it is to understand. We should judge it on whether or not it is useful for us today. In this case it is. If Black plays 4 ... J.xf3 White can take either way. Against lvanchuk (without ... tlJf6) I took with the e-pawn. There is no big reason for this; on a different day, when I had been in a different mood, I might have taken with the g-pawn. White is fighting for an advantage there as well, but at least he has doubled pawns.

[diagram]
Up to this point I had not spent any time to speak of. There were no difficult decisions to take; it was simply choices between equal options.

9.d5!

I cannot say that this was a very difficult decision either. With this move White secures a good pawn structure. The bishop on g4 will sooner or later be exchanged and we are in a King's Indian structure, where Black in principle should do whatever he can to avoid exchanging the light-squared bishop. Okay, this is of course a bit dogmatic, it should not be believed religiously. But at least Black should have a serious reason for this exchange, which I do not see here. 9 ... cxd5 Black is making this decision before he is forced to do so. It would be better to keep the flexibility. If Black played something like 9 ...a6 I would probably play 1 0.tlJel ( I O.a4 is anti-positional because of 1 0. ..a5 and Black has secured a permanent outpost on c5.

White is slightly better with the bishop being better than the knights and the d6-pawn being weak.

An argument one way would be that the position where Black gives up a pawn would give him more activity and thus be easier to play. But on the other hand it is also tempting to be a pawn up!

1 1 6 Positional Decision Making in Chess

[diagram]
White's advantage is not up for debate, but he still needs to find a way to break through; especially as the position is rather closed at the moment. Obviously we want to squeeze Black on both flanks, but we should not do this without having a clear plan about how we can improve our position. The next stage in this game is to exchange the rooks and queens. Having done this, Black will have no counterplay whatsoever, allowing me to play on both flanks, which is necessary to exploit the advantage. Going through Rubinstein's games you will find this theme countless times. Someone else told me that the same principle exists in military strategy. It is quite logical; if you are weaker, you want to narrow the battlefield as much as possible and have as few contact points as possible. Both in war and chess, we see this concept played out in the fortress strategy. In this position Black might be able to defend his position on one flank, but as soon as the front becomes wide, he collapses. After the exchanges White will be able to open the game without fearing that something dangerous will slip through the cracks. Also, as White cannot gain control of the c-file, it makes sense to prevent Black from getting it.

[diagram]

[diagram]
26.:Sxc7

Apparently it is anything but obvious to some other grandmasters that White should exchange all the heavy artillery in this position, but I did not spend a lot of time on this decision at all. The danger of doing this is of course that Black could be able to set up a fortress and the heavy pieces would be needed to break it. Making such a decision at the board depends a lot on what you believe about the position. I was sure that I could break any attempt and therefore went for it without much hesitation. I should add that it is of course too far into the future to consider which type of fortress Black will try to set up. This is a moment to go with your feeling. I believed that White would win this ending and there were a lot of upsides to it. And I always play according to my beliefs. At the end of the day it is not a matter of life and death; nor is it the right moment to try to find ultimate solutions.

32.b4!

There is a trade-off with this move. On one hand it is no longer possible to put the knight on b4, but on the other hand Black is denied his only good square for the knight and he will feel the squeeze of limited space all the more after the loss of it. Finally, the b5-pawn is fixed. In many positions White could consider sacrificing a piece on b5 followed by queening the a-pawn. I am not saying that I would take on b5 (unless it was very clear), but that it is an additional thing for Black to worry about. 32 ... lC!cd7 After the game I wondered if it was maybe better for Black to put the knight on a4, to avoid getting too cramped. Of course White would keep the advantage, putting the king on c2 to paralyse the knight, and then regrouping the knight to a3. The threats of a sacrifice on b5 would force the black king to the queenside and/or the knight to a7. After this White can start improving his position on the kingside and hopefully win the battle there. Working on this book I looked at how this would actually play out in practice. The following long variation is just a possible example and should not be considered as a final proof of anything. But it gives a good illustration of how White could try to make the best out of his advantage on both wings: 32 ... llla4 33.'tt> d2 'tt> d8 34.'tt> c2 llld7 35.Bh3 'tt> c7 36.lllb3 lllf6 37.llld2 lllg8 38.lllbl llle7

1-0 1 20 Positional Decision Making in Chess White is obviously winning, taking all the vital black pawns. That it is mate in eight is a bit more surprising, but luckily this is irrelevant for us when we are making decisions. I think this game is a good illustration of how to win against someone who defends passively from the beginning. The main thing to think about is the possibilities of fortresses and of course counterplay. The masterpiece The following game would definitely be in a Best Games collection, if that is what I had wanted to write. I have played Wang Yue six times; the first time in the Grand Prix tournament in Sochi 2008. He played great in that Grand Prix cycle and was very close to qualifying for the Candidates Tournament. If he had won from a better position in the last round, he would have. He really impressed me in our first game. I was not in good shape and played the opening poorly, but then I got into a bishop ending and thought I was going to hold the game. But he found an incredible plan, putting the pawns on the same colour as the bishop, winning the game. I saw that a few years later he did the same against Khairullin in the Russian League. Probably he made a real contribution to endgame theory with this game. They will have to be analysed deeply for us to see if this is the case - which is outside the scope of this project. Wang Yue is certainly a high-level player and he has really impressed me on several occasions. Sometimes he plays brilliantly, while in other games he is happy with a draw and plays without any ambition. I don't know what this is about. But his technique is excellent. He is the first Chinese player to get to the top and into the elite tournaments. In 20 1 4 he led the Chinese team to Gold medals in the Tromso Olympiad. He did so by drawing nine games and losing against Leko. But on Board One sometimes all you have to do is survive, in order that the sharks floating around on the lower boards can do the job. Wang Yue plays the Slav/Semi-Slav in what we can safely call a pretty defensive manner. The Slav is of course the team opening for the Chinese, though they do not always seem to check up on the material available to us in the West. To be honest, they do not really work with foreigners, which means that we know very little about how they work. They have some training camps, but no one really knows what goes on in them. But in general they all have excellent technique and play the Slav, which could be a clue. Wang Yue has a lot of patience and plays defensive positions really well, which is maybe why he has good results in the Chebanenko and Schlechter systems.

6.c5 is very committal. With this move I

grab space, but also fix the structure. Therefore I need the knight jump to prevent Black from Chapter 3 - Space Advantage 1 2 1 playing ... .Bg4 i n order to exchange the bishop for knight. If he could do this and follow up with ...e5, he would be on top. So, at this stage White has a space advantage. It could backfire as White has wasted some time in the opening, but it looks as if it works. 7 .•.Ag7 8.f4 a5 9 . .Be2 flc7 This is no longer the way people play. We will look at this after the game.

10.O-O O-O 1 1 .a3!

[diagram]
This was our idea. Short term, the move simply prevents ... b4, which could be relevant in some lines. Longer term, it is a slight improvement in the pawn structure, preparing to support the long pawn chain. I could have played this earlier, of course, bur there were other moves that were more pressing; for example castling. Obviously ... b4 is not really a threat at the moment. White replies llia4 and a2-a3, using the b-pawn as a target for the creation of weaknesses. Bue it might be down the line and White is now better prepared for this. The best way to describe my idea is probably that I wanted to play .Bf3, llid3 and a3, keeping a space advantage. I had looked at this variation together with Alex Huzman and somehow we came up with this set-up. I say "we" on purpose. Certainly one of us came up with it first, but it happened in a conversation while we moved the pieces around (on the board, not the screen!), both hands on both sets of pieces. It was truly a collaboration. In a very similar position I played l l .g4?! against Bareev, leading to an early confrontation on the kingside. I got a worse position and lost the game. After this we tried to understand how to play the position, which helped me for this game. 1 1 ... J.e6 12• .ia lllbd7 13.llld3!

[diagram]
This is the key move. I knew my opponent would place his pieces as he did in the game. So we decided to play for a space advantage. And in doing so I followed the typical plan of not allowing the exchange of pieces unnecessarily. The general idea is to keep the space advantage and then see what happens.

If Black plays 1 3. ..Bf5 White avoids the exchange with 1 4.llif2, leading to something like: 14 ...h5 1 5.Bd2 l:!ae8

[diagram]
White can play either 1 6.g3;!; or 1 6.h3!?, with the point that after 16 ... h4 1 7.ie 1 the h4- pawn is exposed. I am not sure which I would play; it depends on concrete stuff that I have not considered. Either way, White is better. In general I do not like Black's position here. If he was able to play ...Bf5xd3 he would get some relief. Then .. .f5 would follow and he would be able to block the position. But this is not going to happen. This is the spirit of this opening: it is really passive - Black gives White a space advantage in return for solidity. But okay, I do not want to make this book a "Beat the Chebanenko" manual, so let's leave it at that. I hope I will not scare people away from playing this against me!

[diagram]
14.g4!

As explained above, White's concept would be ruined if Black were allowed to play ...Bf5 and ...g5, so this move is pretty much forced. 14 ... llih7 I do not think Black has much choice here but to block the kingside. If he played

14. .. h5 1 5.h3 hxg4 1 6.hxg4 g5 1 7.'it>g2 I

would build up on the kingside and Black would be in serious trouble. White has won the opening battle. Black did not manage to solve the problem of his light squared bishop and is slowly getting squeezed. My next two moves follow from what came before, as A is followed by B.

This might be a mistake, though I was entirely convinced he was going to play it during the game (as sometimes happens) . It was only when I started to analyse the game that I realized that the alternative was playable. The big question is what White should do after: 1 6. ..h5 Chapter 3 - Space Advantage 1 23 During the game I thought that it would give me an extra target, by way of a piece sacrifice (though this is by no means the only idea). But from another point of view, maybe things are not that simple. Black can put his pieces on the queenside and be ready to meet the sacrifice on h5 with a counter-sacrifice: l 7.llie2 Bf7 l 8.llig3 e6 I 9.Bd2 E!fb8

[diagram]
20.llixh5!?

This seems to be the critical approach. If White instead plays slowly with 20.@f2 Black will try to close the board: 20 ... Wfd8 2 1 .E!gl Wf e8, when White is of course to be preferred after 22.llie5 llixe5 23.fxe5 llif8 24.llie2, but it is not apparent how he should break through. It is possible that White could achieve something by shuffling the pieces around, but still, it is not so easy to find a plan for White to advance. At the same time I do not see any point of playing like this with Black. You are simply waiting to see what White will come up with, hoping that he will not be able to create serious threats. 20 ... gxh5 2 I .Bxh5 Bxh5 22.Wfxh5 llihf6!? I did not consider this idea during the game. The following variations are not meant to be conclusive, but suggest that White also has good winning chances here.

35.E!g5

White has good chances to win the game. The passed pawns are very powerful. Whether Black should take on g5 or play ...h5 might be difficult to decide. But it is quite easy to explain that the fact that Black has ended up with such a choice means that something has gone gravely wrong earlier in the game. In both cases White will find chances and the question of where these would be greater is impossible to solve at the board. 1 24 Positional Decision Making in Chess Black is hoping for a fortress, to hold the position and nothing more. By exchanging the pawns he has given White the open h-file, but on the other hand, he has rid himself of a potential weakness on h5.

17.hxgS

[diagram]
At this point we can say that the opening stage is over. The pawns on c5 and g5 work together in tandem, limiting all of Black's minor pieces. Black has no active ideas and White can slowly manoeuvre his pieces around before he does something active. The first thing to do, I decided, is to attack the f5-pawn. This is done over the next eight moves, putting the bishop on d3 and knight on g3, so that a sacrifice can be considered. In the meantime Black runs with his king to the centre, which seems like a good idea, as he would otherwise risk getting mated down the h-file. Once White has managed to threaten a sacrifice on f5, Black is forced to play ...e6, limiting his light-squared bishop even further. He played it a bit quickly in the game, but with moves such as Viic2 and tli h4, I would have been able to force him to do it anyway. For Black to play ...e6 is a big improvement to White's position. We simply take one more square away from Black. Both the bishop and the knight want to use the e6-square as a transit square and now they cannot.

.th7?! I believe this is a faulty defensive idea. His idea is to use the bishop as a plug, but in the game we shall see that this idea is very risky and probably not holdable. I am not sure if Black can hold with best play, but this sort of absolutism is also not so interesting for me. It is much more important to focus on playing good moves. The right idea here is to play 26 ... E!:e7! and wait. White will continue to look for ways to improve his position. As we will see in the game, there is almost always a way to do so. Will it be enough for a win? Again, this sort of speculation is of course interesting for people watching the games with a beer in their hand, but for the competitive player, it has 8 7 6 Chapter 3 - Space Advantage 1 25 no relevance during the game. Play your best moves and see where it leads. One of the ideas behind putting the rook on e7 is that if White puts pressure on the a5- pawn, he can play ... 1"1ea7 defending it without giving White control over the b4-square. White will probably have to consider ideas with e3-e4, sacrificing a piece in order to open up the position. One knight would come to d6 and the other knight to e5. It is quite possible that White wins all the same, but this was Black's best defensive idea. (Again we see the advantage of having forced Black to play ...e6.) White has a few plans and Black will have to anticipate them and try to defend against them all. And even then, he might not be able to hold. From White's perspective, you keep on improving your position until you get to a moment where you have to calculate which plan to go for.

From here the knight can go to both b4 and e5. My thinking is that it makes no sense to go to e5 at the moment, as the bishop on h8 can go nowhere. To allow Black to exchange it would be the equivalent of giving up a piece. 42 • . • geb7 White has improved his position a lot and no further improvements seem possible. Perhaps the king would be safer on c l , but it seems pretty safe on fI as well. For this reason it is time to switch from move-by-move improvement of the position and calculate the consequences of various lines of action. I decided to break through on the kingside with an exchange sacrifice.

43.tlih4

This comes with the threat of lllxg6 followed by Bh5. And after 43 ... l:!g7 44.llle5 White is not only threatening lllhxg6, which seems to be just game over, there is also a sort of zugzwang that makes it impossible for Black to prevent Ba5, when White manages to improve his position once again. 43 ... .ig?

[diagram]
This is entirely forced. It also forces White to do something. The waiting is finally over. 44J::l xh7! Both the bishops are bad, so it can be a little surprising to learn that the bishop on h7 is the better of the two. The reason is very simple: it has a function! It defends g6. By eliminating it, White can remove the g6-pawn and start to find a way in for the pieces. 44 • . • tlixh7 45 • .!LJxg6 Here Wang Yue came up with a strong defensive try that I had missed.

I believed he would have to retreat, after which I was going to play .Bh5 and be doing very well.

46.J.h5

Black's idea is of course that after 46.!!xh7? 'Rxg6 White's advantage is not entirely conclusive. It still makes no sense for me to exchange any black pieces. 46 ••• YHd8 The funny thing is that if Black plays 46 ... llldf8 the knight on h7 is lost. Compared with the position after 45 ... llld7!, this time around there will be nothing hanging on g6, so White just wins the knight. 47.lllxIB 'WxIB 48 . .Bf3 and after 48 ...Bh8 then 49.g6 is the human move.

[diagram]
I think this is an instructive moment. We can now see the advantage of having spent 6-7 moves going to and fro, forcing Black to play ...a4. At the time we might think that there is no need; we are going to decide the game on the kingside. But when you can improve your position, you should do so! It is rather simplistic to say so, but it is not about saying these easy things, it is about doing them. 47 .• J:k7

[diagram]
This is the next critical moment. An amusing thing is that at move 40 my computer (at the time the game was played) gave me +5.00 (now it is "only" +3.50), but at the same time it could easily have been a fortress, making 0.00 the human evaluation (though I had no fear that this actually was a fortress). It is therefore not relevant to consider this position from the aspect of computer evaluations. White is better, but he will have to do something to break through. This might reduce the computer's appreciation of the position, but winning the game is about delivering the deadly blow, not about mathematics. Again, this might be a simplistic thing to say, but I think that part of whatever success I have had in chess is because I have a decent feeling for when this sort of advice is useful and I follow it when it makes sense.

Black's minor pieces are clearly limited by the pawn structure, with no way of entering the game without losing material. We would usually talk about such pieces as being buried alive or lifeless. And if any of the pieces were able to break out of their jail, we would say chat they have come alive. I believe this is a meaningful way of understanding Philidor's statement, though we should not forget that the beauty of a metaphor is that you can understand it in many ways and still be right. Although this imaginary posmon is clearly exaggerated (not to speak of illegal because of the lack of kings!) it is still closer to real life than most people would intuitively sense. Take for example this position, from Gelfand - Movsesian, Polanica Zdroj 2000.

The second half of thinking about pawn structures is to aim for a structure that is beneficial to the activity of your pieces and detrimental to the movement of the opponent's pieces. This is important, but still the first thing to chink about must be the value of the pawns themselves! Weak pawns have a tendency to be lost! And extra pawns have a Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 37 tendency to become queens and from there follows checkmate and champagne! A subtle weakness in the pawn structure One of the areas where Rubinstein added a lot to our understanding of the game is that concerned with weaknesses. The following game is really easy to understand for a modern player, but the impact of the simplicity with which Rubinstein won it on the pre-World War chess world should not be underestimated. I don't believe that Rubinstein and Capablanca learned much from each other, but looking at Rubinstein's virtuosity in the endgame, it is at least possible to see that they were thinking in the same way at times. Erich Cohn - Akiba Rubinstein St Petersburg 1 909 I like this game a lot for its simplicity. In a more or less symmetrical position with open c- and d-files, Rubinstein wins almost without any effo rt. It is the same structure as in his famous tactical game against Rotlewi, but victory is achieved in an entirely different way.

We have reached an important moment in the game, and one where we can see Rubinstein's style come out in full. His position is clearly pleasant, but nothing more. There are a number of good moves he could play, none of them giving White excessive problems. Naturally he chooses the move that inflicts slight damage to the white pawn structure. Again his games are best understood backwards. At the end we can see that this decision is decisive and a part of a long plan, which this time is to win in the simplest way possible. Also, we notice that Rubinstein chooses to rely on static rather than dynamic features. His play is slow, but the effects are permanent.

24.f4 was the correct move, to prevent the rook

from going to h4. There is no real reason why White should lose this rook ending, though he might end up doing exactly that. At least we can be sure that his defensive skills would be tested. After all, Rubinstein is famous for his fabulous skills in rook endings. We analysed it a bit and did not find it so easy for White to defend if Black plays well.

Once again we have an almost symmetrical structure with open c- and d-files. This time White has a slight initiative despite the doubled f-pawns. What made this game memorable co me was the way White manages to increase the pressure without having serious targets and/or mistakes from his opponent. He does this by creating chem, one by one, cooking soup on che slight frailty of the e6-pawn.

We are entering the more interesting phase of this game (stating this happily ignores the debate on how to get such a position against Anatoly Karpov) where the pawn structures have disintegrated entirely and the theme has dissipated.

I fear that to many it might come across as a bit dry. After all, White got a slight edge from the opening, put Black under some pressure and forced him to solve some problems. Having missed the "easier" ways to solve his problems, eventually Black had to find a study-like move in the rook ending (45 ... 1':i:h3!!) in order to save the game. Presumably exhausted from four hours of intensive defence and with no one hinting that this was the moment when all energy had to be consumed on saving the game, the World Champion failed the task. I agree that this does not look as exhilarating as Kasparov's unruly demolitions of Karpov in the second half of the 1 980s; but it is also a valid way of playing and on this occasion it was enough to beat the strongest player in the world at the time. King walk to h3 (or a3) As this is a chapter on pawn structures, that is of course our main focus, but it would be nonsensical not to draw specific attention to Rubinstein's king march - probably the most famous in chess history before Short - Timman, Tilburg 1 992. It is something all the following champions knew well, as can be seen from their games, such as these two examples by the World Champions from 1 985 to 2006. Evgeny Sveshnikov - Garry Kasparov Minsk 1 979 I was following this tournament live in the playing hall. Every day I would go to watch the games and think along with the great players, at times exchanging variations with other spectators.

This is no criticism of Winter, but merely shows the unlimited possibilities in chess and how we often can find additional resources if we analyse a game deeply.

One commentator has quite understandably mentioned 1 8. .Bxf7!? as a serious option. The knights are truly scary the way they jump around on the kingside. But it is not clear that

it is yet necessary to give up the dream of using the two bishops later on.

[diagram]
White does not have any clear targets, but with the advance of the a-pawn he aims to double rooks on the a-file and take on b6 to create counterplay. It is not much, but he needs to do something. It is also not as easy as it seems at first for Black to improve his position. Sure, he can bring a knight to f4, but it is not such a great achievement. Everything is protected.

[diagram]
I am not sure if Rubinstein considered 2 1 ...a5!?. It is a move with both positives and negatives. It does halt the white advance on the queenside, but it also fixes Black's pawn structure permanently. As we shall see in the game, a lot of changes to the pawn structure can and will happen on both sides of the board. Most importantly, the b6-pawn would become weakened and Black would not be able to play ... c6, which can be a serious option for him in the game.

and the queen is trapped. Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 47 For this reason the best move is probably the prophylactic 25.Wf f2, trying to keep everything under control. But moves like these are not that easy to find, especially when you have a lot of options. Obviously Black still has a lot of possibilities and the game would continue. It is likely that Rubinstein would have enjoyed such a turn of events as well. We could imagine that Black would transfer the knight from f6 to g6 and maybe later to h4. But this would take time and White would be able to break through on the a-file. Probably this would give him enough counterplay. In the game White went for a more direct approach, which looks poor on the surface, though it actually has some merit to it. 25 . .Bxf4?! If you were writing a manual for beginners in the 1 980s you would undoubtedly have criticized this move severely. White is giving up his good bishop, leaving him in a closed position with a bad bishop on fl against a powerful knight. Indeed it is a big concession to give up the dark squares. But luckily chess is more complicated than following basic rules. Yes, they do apply, but they are not the whole story, like gravity fails to explain all of physics. On the plus side for White, we have the closure of the kingside, where Black had serious ambitions, as well as the elimination of Black's best piece and his stronghold of the f4-square. All in all, not an equation which is easy to work out without a few variations. My first impression was that this is a terrible mistake; but now I don't think so. Chess is indeed a difficult game. 25 • • • gxf4 26.Wffl g5 This is a natural continuation. It does not make sense to question it, although other options exist. 26 ...h5? 27.g5 llld7 28.h4 would be a clear improvement for White. The bishop will be useful on h3.

0-1 A brilliant game, despite the handful of blemishes. Changes in pawn structures in my own games In both of these games, Rubinstein's play was ahead of its time. This does not change the fact that something was missing. Earlier in this chapter I paralleled advances in chess to those of physics and cosmology, and I would like to do so again. When Einstein developed his theory of relativity, he imagined a static eternal universe. Today we know that the universe has a beginning and that it is wildly dynamic. The same thing has happened in chess. Attempts to outplay the opponents through technique alone, as was the case in some of the games of Capablanca, have been replaced by a far more dynamic approach to the game. The wild tactical counterplay with which Wolf could have saved the game reflects chess thinking in our time rather than the thinking of a hundred years ago. And just as our thinking about physics now involves Quantum Theory, which I do not pretend to know much about, except that it has revealed that our world is far more complicated and dynamic than we believed, our thinking in chess has changed radically as well. Since the time of Rubinstein we have seen a considerable development in the openings, these days including the moves g2-g4 and h2-h4 in all types of positions, as well as an almost relativistic approach to material. This does not mean that the observations of Rubinstein and the style in which he played have become redundant, but only that his style has become less mainstream. Take the example of the next game: I am facing an opponent who aims for a pawn structure that facilitates active play with his pieces, with the ultimate Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 53 goal of creating direct threats to the king. In the process my opponent may allow more of his pawns to become weak and in general take more chances than Rubinstein's opponents would. But on the other hand, I am dealing with a snakelike adversary, ready to lunge at any time with his venomous fangs. At times I envy Rubinstein his opposition, though I have to admit that he probably would have quickly adjusted to the demands of modern chess and dealt with these dynamic relativists at least as well as me. In the following game I managed to mould the pawn structure to a perfect fit for my pieces, even though my opponent was one of the best players in the world, a possible future contender for the World Championship. Of course Grischuk would have been the 20 1 2 Challenger, i f I had not defeated him in the final of the 20 1 1 Candidates match; but more about this in the next volume. Boris Gelfand - Alexander Grischuk Beijing 20 1 3 Alexander Grischuk is i n my opinion one o ft he most creative players of our time (perhaps the highest praise I can give) . If I had to determine his style, I would probably compare him to Boris Spassky. He likes to play for the initiative, yet is very objective in his assessment and only goes for it when it is justified. If necessary, he is happy to play long endgames or any other type of position. However, his defining trait, as far as I can determine, is the drive to play creatively. He frequently chooses new directions in the opening just to get a fresh position. In my games with Grischuk there have been many decisive battles. We have faced each other over thirty times. I have a modest plus score at the moment, but when we sit down to play each other it would be fair to say that all three results are equally possible. Our games have been quite important in the World Championship cycle. In the 2005 World Cup he knocked me out in the tie breaks. After we had won a classical game each, the match went to the wire and I lost in blitz. In the 2007 World Championship in Mexico his results were important too. He had a close to-winning rook endgame against Anand, but failed to win it, while he managed to win a better ending against me. If it had only been the other way around. .. The most important game we played was Game 6 of the Candidates Final in Kazan 20 1 1 . It is one of my best ever games and can be found in the next volume of this series. In the latest two cycles of the Grand Prix we have managed to ruin things for each other repeatedly, and there is still one tournament to go. Hopefully this time he will ruin things for someone else after all the nice things I have said about him! I.d4 �f6 2.c4 g6 3.�c3 J.g7 4.e4 d6 5.i.e2 O-O 6.�g5

have played this a few times recently. played it a lot when I was younger and I 1 54 Positional Decision Making in Chess decided that, because it is less deeply analysed than the most popular lines, it might lead to interesting games.

in the opening; it does not make sense to cover them all deeply. Grischuk committed his common mistake, using too much time in the opening. This meant that he did not have sufficient time to solve the complex problems I managed to pose him later on in the game. At this point I had a real choice. I was considering playing 1 4.h3 Bd7 1 5.Be3 a la Gligoric, which would also lead to a normal game. I think it is a matter of taste and after 1 1 minutes I decided to go for 1 4.Be2 in the same way you would choose fish over steak in a restaurant; I just felt my way.

14.i.e2

Once the centre has closed, White is facing different problems in relation to the pin. So, although this looks like a loss of time, there are a number of favourable things that would not have happened had the bishop not retreated to fI earlier. Also, an exchange of Black's "good" bishop on g4 for White's "bad" bishop would be in our favour. This also explains Black's 1 5th move.

2 1 ...f4? 22.Wlc2t favours White, who will occupy the e4-square.

22.f4 e4!

22 ... :B:ae8?! 23.fxe5 would be more similar to the game and presumably in White's favour, though we should never take anything for granted in such positions.
[diagram]
 4 3 2 a b c I do not believe that White is seriously better in this structure at all. Black is ready to play ... :B:ae8 or ...b5, activating the last few pieces. White also has some resources, of course, and a variety of ideas, but Black can always obtain a lot of counterplay. At times we need to generalize like this. This is probably the most important moment for the further course of the game, seen from Black's perspective. In a structure like this, he has two standard pawn breaks, the most obvious being ... f5. But as White has not advanced his forces on the queenside yet, Black should also seriously consider breaking on that side of the board with ...b5. In retrospect it is possible to make an evaluation of these two options with reasonable certainty, but at the board, things are much harder. It appears that Grischuk, having considered the two options carefully, chose the wrong one.

[diagram]
Furthermore, about retrospective thinking in chess: it is much easier to solve problems when you know what form they take. In this position I did not seriously consider that Black would break on the queenside and somehow, although he considered it, Grischuk still did not find it compelling enough to seriously investigate it. We are used to Black playing ... f5 in the King's Indian and this is what he did. Only on this occasion, it was not the most accurate way. On the other hand, if the ...b5 idea had been played and not worked out, the criticism would have been withering: "Black plays too slowly. He should play natural moves such as ...f5, as every schoolboy knows." Criticism of decisions in chess is cheap and does not in itself teach us anything; especially not when formulated like this.

fS?! In the press conference after the game Grischuk mentioned 1 9. .. llJc?! as a serious idea; and indeed it is. f g h The idea is very concrete, Black just wants to play ...b5. I had thought about playing

20.l:!b l b5 2 1 .b4, but it is not too hard to see

that Black can reply 2 1 ...cxb4 22.llJxb5 Bxb5

23.cxb5 llJxb5 24.l:!xb4 llJd4.

[diagram]
It seems that the bishop on g7 plays a bigger part in the game than the bishop on g2. Black is more than fine. I am not sure what I would have done if Grischuk had played like this. Would I have taken big risks with 20.f4 or some other aggressive approach, fighting for the initiative? Or would I have gone for the above line and tried to secure a draw? I do not know. All we can say with certainty is that Grischuk could have set me a real challenge with 1 9. .. llJc?!. It is always easy to find an explanation that fits the solution! This could have made me doubt 1 9.Bg2 of course, but how the game turned out also matters. The move makes sense in itself. Probably we should look earlier for improvements, for example 1 5.Bd2!. Maybe 1 5.g3 and later Bg2 is a true Rubinstein idea - which includes it being a bit slow... But really, thematically this manoeuvre should be associated with Petrosian. If I had chosen: 1 5.Bd2!

20.f4! Vff6

During the game I was quite afraid of 20 ... lDb4, when I am forced to play 2 1 .Wfb 1 . I was thinking that something like 2 1 ...exf4 22.i.xf4 i.d4t 23.'itih l Wff6 would be unpleasant for me.

[diagram]
But as Grischuk pointed out, I have 24.a3 lDa6 25.exf5! i.xf5 26.lDe4! and White has a real advantage. This variation looks quite simple once written down, but it is by no means easy to see everything along the way and to realize that the moves given are the best ones. Were things just slightly different, they might be poor ones! We have arrived at another critical moment for our theme. White has the choice of transforming to a number of different pawn structures. The first observation we should make is that it is usually not a good idea to release the tension when we have four pawns positioned as they are on e4, f4, e5 and f5. It tends to give the opponent extra options. But this is an exception to this observation. The only real options are to take on f5 only, or to take on e5 only. It makes no sense to take on both e5 and f5, as after I take on e5 in the game, I retain the option of taking on f5 later, as long as I prevent my opponent from playing ...f4. 21 .fxe5! This forces Black into a pawn structure where neither of his bishops can come into the game easily. 2 l .exf5 gxf5 22.a3 e4 transposes to a line we looked at earlier. Black is okay. 21 ... dxe5 2 1 ...Wfxe5 is not a serious move. After

22.exf5 Wfxf5 23.lDe4 Black is in grave trouble.

The d6-pawn is weak and White is ready for i.d2-c3.

I like this move as it prevents Black from advancing his f-pawn. The computer wants to take on f5 already, but for a human such a committal decision cannot be made on such flaky grounds as those presented by a machine. 22 ..

At this point I wanted ro prevent 24 ... f4

The bishop belongs on d2, so it is preferable to play b2-b4 immediately if it works.

counterplay with 27 ... llld6 28.Wfe2 E:c8. I still prefer White after 29.bxc5 bxc5

It is difficult to find a serious active option for Black here, and Grischuk decided to basically do nothing. 28 ... ti'h5 Another aspect is that both players were already getting low on time. I certainly had more than he did, but what is much more important is that my position is easier to play. Black will have to find a complex plan to create counterplay, while White can improve his position with simple moves. For this reason it also does not make sense to assess the position at this point. White is still improving his position, while Black is not. It makes more sense to decide later on how much better White is. The following lines show how difficult Black's position is; though it should be said that Grischuk was pretty optimistic, thinking his position was fine. 28 ...h5 29.tlldl h4 only plays into White's hands after 30.gxh4. 28 ... tllc7 This could have been tried, involving a pawn sacrifice:

29.tlldl tllc7 30.b4 cxb4

30 ... tlle8 does not really work this time around. White is much better after 3 1 .bxc5 bxc5 32.i.e3 tlld6 (32 ...Rb6 33.Rf2 does not improve things) 33.i.xc5 E:c8 34.i.xd6 Rxd6, and either 35.i.xf5 or 35.tlle3! with a close-to-winning position. 3 1 .i.xb4 3 1 .axb4 would allow 3 1 . ..b5. 3 1 ...E:c8 32.tlle3 e4 The following piece of analysis is quite fascinating, but I want to underline that it is unlikely that we would see such moves played in a game. Maybe the odds are I % that a top player would find all of this! But as these are the best moves, it would be strange not to include them.

33.E:f4!

White has a definite advantage and will start to pile up on the f5-pawn. However, he has to act with vigilance. If he hesitates his advantage could easily slip. Black can seek counterplay, but this could easily backfire in sharp tactics. My guess is that I would play 33.'Wf f2 if l had this position in a game. But here Black has an amazing way to gain counterplay: 33 ...a5

34.i.d2 E:cf8 35.tllg2 (35.Rf4 tlla6 and the

knight comes to c5) 35 ...f4!! 36.tllxf4 E:xf4

37.gxf4 i.xh3 38.E:gl 1Mfh5 Black has good

35.axb4 E:cf8 36.c5, which gives White a

most pleasant position, although Black is still fighting after 36 ... i.e5.

This is a committal decision, though at the same time a very understandable move. Black is looking for counterplay and advancing the h-pawn is a natural way to achieve this. But in reality, there is no counterplay and the h-pawn simply becomes a target. In the game I managed to win it outright. This is not easy to foresee in time trouble. To call it impossible is maybe too much, but at least it was too difficult for one of the most gifted players of our time! The problem is of course that when you are short of time, you usually calculate concrete variations, but do not pay too much attention to the strategic aspects of the position. And changes in the pawn structure are all about long-term strategic potential. We have already encountered 3 1 ...llle8?!

1-0 Keeping the tension There are times when it is important to keep the tension. This happens when all the ways you can change the pawn structure are undesirable to you, while the opponent cannot change the pawn structure to his advantage either. This might sound like a rare case, yet in my experience it is anything but. It seems quite common chat both players will try to limit the positive effects of changing the pawn structure available to the opponent. Indeed, outplaying the opponent often means that you combine your ideas in a way that forces him co allow you to change the pawn structure in your favour. It can also mean that you have managed to set the opponent plenty of practical problems and chat he gives into the pressure, only to make a change in the pawn structure that is co your advantage. The latter is what happened in the following complicated game. The possible changes in the pawn structure between moves ten and twenty were numerous, but not many of chem were

The simplest. White gets a knight ending with an extra pawn. 1 68 Positional Decision Making in Chess to Black's advantage. In the end he did not manage to find the subtle move that would have kept the tension, which is in some ways quite forgivable, as I did not find it during the game either. But on the other hand, not finding it meant that he lost the game rather quickly thereafter. Boris Gelfand - Boris Avrukh Ramat Aviv 1 999 My opponent is a well-known author of chess books. His first book, Grandmaster Repertoire 1 - J.d4 Volume One became an instant classic upon its publication in 2008 and, I would dare to say, elevated chess books to a formerly unseen level. These days he is more a trainer and writer than a player. He has a very strong classical chess education and strives for dynamic play always, bur based on a solid positional basis. It is an attitude I really like and share, which is one of the reasons I have enjoyed analysing with him on many occasions. Avrukh has beaten many strong players and has been a part of the Israeli national team for many years, being a member of the silver-medal winning team of 2008, as well as the winner of individual gold medals in the 1 998 and 2006 Olympiads. Boris has worked with a lot of the top players: Caruana, Radjabov, Kramnik (before the 2006 match with Topalov) and of course with me on many occasions. This game was played in the Israeli Team Championship, which is more or less the only event in Israel where all the professional players play. Even though there are many grandmasters in Israel, there is not a great chess scene and it is very rare that there are any strong events. When I moved to Israel in 1 998 the only event that made sense to play was a rapid event in Haifa (which ended in 2000) and the Israeli League. But even this does not happen often, and it is rare that the local chess fans have a chance to see me play in Israel. There are some recent signs that things could be improving, but with the past we have had, I am only a reluctant optimist. In my first year in the Israeli League, I won against many strong GMs: Sutovsky, Milov, Avrukh, Har-Zvi, Manor, and drew with Zilberman. It was my best result in the league. I have never played as many as six games again, and never as successfully. Sometimes I made 212, but it is really not the same.

1.c4

Avrukh plays the Griinfeld a lot. This was an early morning game, as are the majoriry of games in the Israeli League, so I decided to avoid a theoretical discussion. These days the English Opening is very popular, starting with I .4Jf3 or l .c4. I assume people got fed up with the enormous amounts of theory elsewhere and just wanted to play chess.

A rare move, but in my opinion the most logical one. When I returned home after the game I was surprised to find only one game in my database with it; but it was a game of the great Leonid Stein, a player I admire a lot. He died in 1 973 at the young age of 38, in tragic circumstances. In his best games we can see how great this loss was. He was truly a fantastic player. When I came to Israel I rented my first apartment from a chess player. After I moved on, it was taken over by a young man who got in trouble with the landlord for playing guitar in all the waking hours of the day. At some point he was called to the landlord's house for a "conversation". When he arrived he saw a chess set and said, "Oh, my uncle was a chess player." "Who is your uncle?" "Leonid Stein." As you can imagine, the attitude of the landlord changed immediately. He stopped throwing epithets at him, although his appreciation for the young man's musical "talent" probably did not increase much. Alex Huzman goes to a dentist called Rubinstein. Once I prodded him, asking why he did not go to Tal's son, who is also a dentist and lives in the same town as Alex. "I am a bit afraid of his style. It is better to stay with Rubinstein." There are many famous Jewish chess players; and many of their descendants live in Israel...

1-0 What went wrong for Black in this game? Basically he could not find a way to maintain the construction with a pawn on c6 and bishop 1 78 Positional Decision Making in Chess on d5 and eventually gave in, taking on e4 and played ... c5, after which his problems took a more permanent form. With time trouble on top of this, he simply collapsed. Fighting for key squares When there is a difference in strength between the contestants, even when it is as small as in this case, it is quite common that one of the players does things he normally would not do unless forced to. To some extent this is what happened to Avrukh in the previous game; the pressure became too much and he decided to make a concession, as he could not find any alternatives. And to be fair to him, there is no guarantee that such an alternative exists when you are sitting at the board. When players of equal strength face one another, it is common that they fight for key squares, preventing each other's plans and ideas while creating ideas of their own. The outcome of the game is to be found in the depths of long complicated lines and the two players' willingness to enter lines where they are unable to determine the final outcome in advance. The following game is one of the biggest victories in my career, against one of the greatest players I have had the pleasure of competing against. Levon Aronian - Boris Gelfand Dresden (ol) 2008 This game was played at the 2008 Olympiad in Dresden, where I and the Israeli team had our greatest result in team chess ever, claiming the silver medals. I had a really good score on Board 1 and missed the gold medal by the narrowest of margins. With a rating performance of 2833, I fell short of Peter Leko's 2834 gold-winning performance! Still, it was an unbelievable result. The silver medal was much more important, and of course much more difficult to get than the gold medal I achieved with the Soviet Union. The greater importance is not because I am now an Israeli, but because the Soviet team in 1 990 was clearly superior to all the other teams in the event. Important results in 2008 included our victories over Armenia and the Netherlands. Unfortunately we lost to Ukraine, missing out on the gold medal. Levon Aronian is of course one of the greatest players of our time. However, in team events he is usually even stronger. Due not least to his spirit and leadership, the Armenian team managed to win the 2006, 2008 and 20 1 2 Olympiads, and the 20 1 1 World Team Championship, as well as achieving bronze in the 2007 European Team Championship and the 2004 Olympiad. Armenia also won bronze at the 1 992 and 2002 Olympiads, though without Aronian on the team. However, it was from 2006 when Aronian entered the elite and took over Board 1 from Akopian that the team became the most successful in the world. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Aronian is the soul of the Armenian team. I consider him to be the most creative player of our time, both over the board and in opening preparation. So far he has failed in the Candidates tournament, but I hope that Anand's and my results in the Candidates in recent years will inspire him to keep on trying. He has so many qualities that I would not be surprised if he manages to become World Champion one day. I really feel that as long as one wants to work on chess and has the will to progress, there is a possibility of doing so. These days when you read older players complain about younger players that they only know how to push the space bar and have no culture, just think of Aronian. He has a great knowledge of music, literature, arts and culture Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 79 in general. This is another reason why I would be happy if he kept on improving and reached the highest peak. What a World Champion he would be! In a recent interview in New in Chess he said chat whenever he plays me, he tries to impress me. It is friendly competition. We have warm personal relations and work on chess together occasionally. So in every game we try to bring something new. If one player comes up with a good novelty, it is great! This is one of the reasons why we have so many decisive games with each other. It is always an open game where both players want to win.

Aronian is not seeking an instant clarification in the centre, hoping instead co gee chances later on in the game. One of the main reasons for this move is co cake away the g4-square from the black knight; another is co improve the position with f2-f4 and g3-g4 in order co put pressure on the pieces defending the centre. 1 5.%Va4 had been played in Norri - Tella, Finland 1 995, when it is not clear whether the bishop is best placed on e6 or f5.

Now 1 8.f4?! f6 1 9.f5 fxe5 20.fxe6 Rxe6 ought to be considered, though we should remember the words of the Armenian Master Eduard Mnacakanian: Black has an extra pawn, if nothing else (see page 204) . So instead White should probably play 1 8.Qh2 or similar, with even chances. As it turns out, the move I made was not bad, but I did not like entering forced lines. I did not see a concrete problem in them, but being forced co go in one direction is a bad sign.

Black will have great compensation for the exchange on the light squares.

The computer does not think that Black is better here, but maybe it just does not understand what is going on? One thing that plays in Black's favour is that the remaining bishops are opposite-coloured, which makes it hard for White to force exchanges.

26 .. J::l e2 27..bd5? A blunder, played pretty quickly as far as I remember. I do not know what he missed. After the game he was extremely disappointed and we did not really talk about it. I assume chat he missed something pretty simple, as all players do from time to time, even such champions as Levon. During the game I believed that White could force a draw:

I believed chat there were several ways for White to make a draw. This was also my conclusion after checking briefly with the computer in 2008. Bue looking deeper now, it appears that things are not so simple. White has no clear way to keep the balance, even though his position might be holdable in the long term. I hope the reader will forgive me for being a bit technical here and showing our analysis in detail. I think it helps illustrate the way White has taken risks and now will have to play many good moves in order to defend. Not an easy task at all.

for White. Understanding Black's 3 1 st move in this variation is by no means easy. Why would forcing the white king forward be an advantage? Only accurate analysis and comparison will show that after 33.g5 ¥Me5 34.¥Mg4 J.e2 it is a vital point that the f5-pawn hangs with check, as otherwise White would secure sufficient counterplay with 35.¥Mh4, which now loses a pawn. I am by no means convinced that I would have found this during the game! 29 ...gc4!

have spent some time analysing this position in the work for this book, without coming to any final conclusions.

The only hope I can think of is to somehow give up the bishop for both of the black pawns on the kingside and make a draw with the king in the queenside corner. But I do not believe that Black need allow this. So instead White should try 32.Rf4 with a worse position in which nothing direct exists. To speak of it in terms of lost or drawn makes no sense to a practical player like me. What matters is that White has a real fighting chance, while what matters from Black's perspective is that he is happy to be able to cause White continuing problems. 27 ... i.xf5 2s.Rf4 i.e6

1-0 A curious coincidence. 1 92 Positional Decision Making in Chess Exploiting a slightly better pawn structure Up to this point we have looked at some examples where the main focus has been on creating a better pawn structure. What I have not talked a lot about is how to make something out of this advantage. Often the advantages are indirect. The play goes on, but the opponent has been burdened with an extra responsibility, like a boxer that has suddenly had his foot chained to one corner of the ring. Obviously the dream is to pin his other foot down with another weakness, making any move he makes critical. The principle of two weaknesses springs from this scenario, and has been one of the basic aspects of converting an advantage that young players have been taught since the days of Nimzowitsch and of course Rubinstein. A top grandmaster, not to mention a World Champion, will fight desperately against being pinned down with two weaknesses in a technical position, which is an important point to remember when you go over the last game of this chapter. Boris Gelfand -Viswanathan Anand Moscow (7) 20 1 2 This is quite a n important game i n my career. So far it is the only game I have won in a World Championship match and as such it marks probably the biggest highlight of my career so far. It was played just after the halfway mark and gave me a temporary lead in the match. Viswanathan Anand is one of the greatest players in chess history. He has won the World Championship in matches and in tournaments, both all-play-all and knockout. It is really not my place to present a description of his career, but I do want to say this: although he has had occasional poor results since turning 40, it is clear that he has been the victim of a lot of unfair criticism, with journalists and others trying to put words of retirement into his mouth. This is rather pointless, as Vishy still has a lot to offer to the chess world. At some point the story even was that he would not participate in the 20 1 4 Candidates tournament in Khanty-Mansiysk, something I personally never believed. Indeed Vishy did participate and won the event convincingly, giving him a return match against Magnus Carlsen. During this game I did not really notice that the changes in the pawn structure were pervasive all the way through. The pawn structure was fixed early on in the game, and subsequent play was directed at keeping and exploiting the slight advantage my better structure gave me. After the game, however, I can see that there were actually a lot of subtleties relating to possible changes in the pawn structure.

This was Anand's main defence for the match. This trendy variation does not have a name as far as I know - though we can see some resemblance with the Chebanenko Variation, which we have met a few times in this book already. Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 93 Ac the beginning of the match I must admit chat I struggled to get anything out of the opening, making the games somewhat dull for the spectators. Bue such is the nature of the World Championship. le is not 1 2 individual games, but one game played 1 2 times. In a tournament you need to win several games more than you lose in order to take first place, while in a match chose extra wins give you nothing at all, and therefore taking risks to achieve chem make no sense. I know it is not what the majority of the fans want, but to some extent chess incorporates both low-brow and high-brow elements. Blitz, blindfold and so on have little lasting value, whereas World Championship matches live on far beyond the lives of the players playing them. And history's view changes. For example, I am sure chat few people remember the 2000 match between Kramnik and Kasparov for its lifeless draws? They were there all right, but there were also exciting moments of great artistic value. Just like my match against Vishy. In the first two games I followed the recommended path:

6.b3 .Bb4 7.Bd2 lllbd7 8.Bd3 O-O 9.O-O .Bd6

[diagram]
Black wasted a move on forcing the white bishop to the pointless d2-square, resulting in an unusual arrangement of pieces all along the cl-file. Theory suggested chat White might have some advantage here, but in practice I did not manage to make the World Champion chink seriously for even one move! Game 2 continued: 1 0.l:!cl e5! 1 1 .cxd5 cxd5 1 2.e4 dxe4 1 3.lllxe4 lllxe4 14.Bxe4 lllf6 1 5.dxe5 lllxe4 1 6.exd6 Rxd6

[diagram]
Then the queens came off and on move 25 there was nothing left to do but to agree co the inevitable draw. In Game 4 I went with the main move, but again I did not manage to even scratch the surface of Black's nerves. 1 0.Rc2 e5 1 l .cxd5 cxd5 1 2.e4 exd4 1 3.lllxd5 lllxd5 1 4.exd5 lllf6 1 5.h3 .Bd7 1 6.l:!adl l:!e8 1 7.lllxd4 l:!c8 1 8.Wb l h6 1 9.lllf5 .Bxf5 20 . .Bxf5 l:!c5

Black is clearly okay and the game ended without drama in a draw on move 34. 1 94 Positional Decision Making in Chess So in Game 6 I went for an entirely different direction, only to run into my opponent's preparation.

Later in 20 1 2, Kramnik won a long game with 6.i.d3 against my second Tomashevsky, igniting new life into that line as well. There are other options, such as 6.a3 and

6.tt:le5, which could be investigated. I am sure

we will see more developments in this opening over the next few years. As we have seen with the Berlin Wall, it can be difficult to force Jack back into the box, once he has leapt out.

But I was not able to cause my opponent, Andreikin, enough problems, although his position is clearly very passive at this point. The game was eventually drawn in Tashkent 20 1 4.

[diagram]
On the free day I had another look at the various options with my seconds and we decided to go deep in our analysis of a specific plan, based on a rapid development of the queenside.

7.Yfc2!

Though this was not a novelty, it was its first occurrence at the top level. I took part in the analysis sessions in the afternoon, while my seconds continued through the night, analysing the strategic concept we developed together in depth.

7.b4 b6 had been played before, but it seems

that Black can slowly solve his problems and get a decent position, similar to some lines of the Queen's Gambit Declined with 5.i.f4. It is not obvious to me that the bishop is better placed on cl ; actually, ifWhite was allowed to do so here, probably i.cl -f4 would be a decent move!

7.i.d3 e5!? reminds of some variations of the

Chebanenko Variation with 4 ...a6 5.ltJf3 b5

6.c5 ltJbd7 7.Bd3 e5!, where Black has good

results. Also here Black should be doing well. 7 ...b6 This is by no means the only move, but it is quite logical. We had also prepared in depth for a lot of other options. I ask the reader to forgive me for not revealing my intentions against these; the author should be allowed to keep a few secrets ...

8.cxb6 ltJxb6

Without this, Black will be left with a weak c-pawn, but advancing it does not solve all his problems. After something like 1 0.ltJa4 Ra7

his greatly weakened c-file. White is leading in development on the queenside, and is not

&&VSL &&B

[diagram]
To be honest, I did not take a great part in the analysis starting from this point. I told my seconds that the type of position suited me and left it for them to go further. As the computer has revealed to us that almost all moves are playable, the importance of what suits you and what does not suit you has increased in my opinion. This should be taken as good news, as it makes it possible to play chess in many different ways, keeping our game spiritually alive.

This is not really better or worse than the move played in the game. Our idea was to continue with something like: 1 l .b3 cxb3 1 2.axb3 .Bb7 13 . .Bd3 .Bd6 1 4.O-O O-O 1 5.ll'le5 Vlie7 It seems that White is slightly better after: 1 6.f3!l:%fc8 1 7.Vlib l Black does not have the possibility of playing ... ll'le4 and has yet to get his pieces into the game in a meaningful way. White's position is easier to play. l 1.exd4 .td6 This is probably the best move. White has a pleasant position after l l .. . .Bb7 1 2.ll'la4 as well.

[diagram]
This is the first big moment of the game. At the time of the match we had the best possible computer we could get; it suggested 12.Na4, Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 97 which is also what my seconds spent time analysing.

12. .Bg5!

I believe that the team was not very happy with my decision here, but by the end of the game they had already forgotten all about it. 1 2.l0a4!? l0xa4 1 3.'i.Rc6t .Bd7 1 4.1.Rxd6

[diagram]
And it was a game ... I chink I held some advantage, but fortunes changed and eventually I had to hold on to draw on move 4 1 , Gelfand - Aronian, Paris/St Petersburg 20 1 3. One of the interesting things is that the engines we were using at the times gave almost

0.00 for this structure. Even later on, when it

is obvious that White is pressing with a serious advantage, the engines were not convinced. This is why many commentators said that 23 ...g5 was a blunder and speculated on how it was possible chat the World Champion could make such a mistake. But as we shall see later 1 98 Positional Decision Making in Chess on, chat posmon was already very difficult. Only with a sequence of only moves can Black stay in the game, while the computer is still hovering around the zero-mark. But after that pawn has been advanced, even the engines can see the desperate state of Black's position, thus alerting some lazy journalists to his problems and his "horrible mistake". We have progressed far into the game, of course, but I wanted to explain my choice and the underlying considerations in detail, as this is one of the biggest decisions you can ever make at the chess board: to go against your seconds' recommendations in a World Championship match. Eventually I chose to go with my instincts and stepped into the unknown. Of course it was a hard choice and you can debate if it is bravery or stupidity to do so. In the real world this is of course decided by the result! I can imagine that my seconds would have been in another mood if I had lost after they had stayed up all night, going to bed only at seven o'clock in the morning (for two weeks in a row). Obviously it could have been very embarrassing! It comes down to this - I feel that I have to trust my intuition; it is just too difficult to work everything out.

Here White is also better. Again the machine indicates we are close to equality, but the position could be very dangerous for Black. There are not a lot of positions left in chess where we can ignore the computer's opinion, but maybe this is one of chem. Noe that we would be able to beat the computer if we played on of course! Extremely often the computer will suggest moves that no human would consider. And when we do not feel it delivers us a clear understanding of why this move is good, I cannot see that it makes sense co follow its recommendations.

15. .. WfbS?

Ac this point the computer is totally correct in pointing out 1 5. ..Bf4! as the best move.

[diagram]
I do not think that this move looks logical, but it wins an important tempo by pushing the rook away from the c-line. Black wants to play ... lllbd7, ...a5 and lacer on ... E:c8 and cake control of the c-line. The following shows how Black can use this extra time to solve his problems. 1 6.E:ce 1 Noe by any means the only square, but this is the nature of illustrative lines: they do not pretend to cover everything. 1 6. .. lllbd7 Preparing to meet llle5 and other moves with ...W!b6 to put pressure on d4. 1 7.Bg3 Bxg3 1 8.hxg3 a5

Black is ready for ...Ba6 with a decent game. I do not believe that White can cause Black any damage once the bishops are off the board. Ac least, we did not manage to find anything substantial in our analysis. 3•..slfeK

200 Positional Decision Making in Chess

[diagram]
16.i.g3

I had a reasonable think at this point - twelve minutes. It is slightly surprising, as at such a moment I would usually think for longer. Maybe I was in good form? When I do not spend too much time on a choice and make a good decision, it is a clear sign of feeling decisive at the important moments. For others it might mean superficiality, but I do not think that is my problem too often. (Admittedly, some players try to even out their time consumption and spend the same amount of time on each move. Different players have different chess philosophies, which is hardly a surprise!) Anyway, it felt like an important moment. I liked my position and there is a real choice here. Either to play as I did or to give Black doubled pawns by taking on f6. After the game the computer indicated: 1 6.Bxf6 gxf6 l 7.lt:Je2!

[diagram]

[diagram]
18.hxg3

I also considered taking with the f-pawn, although it does not fit with the concept at all. It is a sort of knee-jerk reaction to the move order. Black could have taken on g3 immediately and then played ... E:c8. It is a sort of provocation when he chooses to do it the other way around. But at the end of the day, Black's problems are on the c-file, not the f-file. Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 20 1

[diagram]
A natural-looking move and not one I suspected there was anything wrong with during the game. The queen goes to a better square and frees space for the rook. But in our analysis we went backwards again and again when we failed to solve Black's problems, and ended up deciding that he erred seriously on three occasions, on moves 1 5, 1 8 and 20. l 8 ... :B:c7 l 9.:B:c2 V!fa7 was another idea that we considered seriously in our analysis and which also seemed to be a serious option during the game.

[diagram]
20.V!ieS!? with the long-term idea of g4-g5 is

interesting, but we found that Black is okay after 20 ... i.c6! 2 1 .:B:fcl :B:ac8 22.Vfif4 lt'Bc4

23.g4 V!Bb6 24.lt'id l i.b5 and all his pieces have

made it to meaningful squares. Our conclusion is that White is to be preferred after: 20.:B:fcl :B:ac8 2 1 .Vfiel !

[diagram]
A brilliant move found by Alex in a similar position (see below). White is using the queen to coordinate on the dark squares, in particular supporting the knight on c3, while the bishop and knight on c3 take care of the light squares. White has a tiny advantage, though if Vishy played his best chess then he would surely manage to neutralize it over time. But then, when Vishy plays his best chess he never loses! The trick is to make him uncomfortable enough to bring him out of his balance. I want to add an important point about ... :B:c7 and ... V!fa7. It is a rather deep idea and even though it might seem simple enough, it is not straightforward to guess that the queen is best placed on the obscure a7-square. It is only when we look longer at the position that we might see that it is aiming at the d4-pawn and making ... i.c6-b5 a future possibility. Way too often people see such moves suggested to them by computers and somehow think that they are easy moves to find. This is far from the case! What often happens is that the explanation comes after being alerted to the computer's suggestion. The difficult thing in chess is to understand the important elements of a position before you know what the computer thinks is best!

202 Positional Decision Making in Chess

White plays the most natural moves. Maybe this is a good place to point out that Black is on his way to having two bad pieces, the bishop on b7 and the knight on b6. I briefly considered playing l 9.llJe5, but after 1 9. ..gc7 20.gc2 llJfd7! I could not see what I was meant to be doing.

[diagram]
Improving the position of the knight and defending the a6-pawn at the same time. 19 ...a5 looks natural as well, but after 20.gfcl it is not so easy for Black to contest the c-file. 20J:Uc1

[diagram]
20 . . . gabS?! This looks like a simple waste of time; the c-file is much more important. I believe Anand was already intending to take back on c8 with the bishop, and hoped that he would get some counterplay on the b-file - maybe even against the d4-pawn. However, it is not possible to see how this could actually happen in the real world, and we can now describe this as being simply too optimistic. But we should not be too hard on the World Champion. When all the options are unsatisfactory, it can be quite hard to choose between them. 20 ...ges is what I thought Vishy was planning. My idea was to play: 2 1 .llJa4 e5 22.dxe5 llJxe5

[diagram]
It is by no means clear that Black has improved his position. The weaknesses on the queenside still exist and the bishop on b7 is still poor. On top of this the d5-pawn is now isolated. At the same time White is getting his knight to c5 and has control over the c-file. During the game I did not worry about this possibility. You can of course always add details, and certainly White will have to make more good moves to prove anything, but his position is nice. However, Black had another idea which was stronger: 20 ... gc7 with the idea of doubling the rooks. I had not originally considered it much. I am not even sure I had realized that 2 1 .llJb5 does not work (as Black takes on c2 and c l , getting two rooks and the initiative for the queen) . As Anand played his move quickly, I did not have time to realize that it was an option until after the game.

[diagram]

[diagram]
White is ready to play b4 and llic5 with an advantage. Notice that White should avoid exchanging the second rook, which would allow Black more freedom of movement in the long run. We can see how well placed the queen is on e l , just as we can observe chat Black has failed to solve the problem of his bishop.

21.tlla4

I spent 1 6 minutes on this, even though it is the most natural move in the position. I had a full hour and wanted to be sure I was getting the most out of my position. As it turns out, there are a lot of other good moves, which is an indication of how well things have gone for White.

[diagram]

[diagram]
I was anticipating the exchange of rooks and was prepared to recapture with the queen, but

[diagram]

23.llic5 a5! Black is closer to equalizing,

204 Positional Decision Making in Chess

as shown in quite detailed analysis by Alex Huzman. I probably underestimated the final move, but honestly, I cannot remember exactly what I was thinking at this point. The critical position arises after: 22 ... i.c6 23.tlJc5 i.b5

[diagram]
White has several interesting options:

24.tlJe5

24.i.xb5 13xb5 25.tlJd3 also looks good for

[diagram]

[diagram]
White has a significant advantage, which cannot easily be neutralized. An important point is that White had a better pawn structure all along, but in all the lines we have seen where Black equalized, he managed to get rid of his poor bishop or improve his pawn structure. This case lies between the two. Black has got rid of the bishop, but White's pawn structure has improved! Also, the white knight is a good deal better than its counterpart. A typical illustration of the transformation of advantages.

22.gxcSt hc8

Just when it seemed implausible, Black's bishop got worse. On 22 ... 13xc8 I was planning on playing:

[diagram]
During the first Petrosian - Spassky match, Armenian radio reported that "in the opinion of International Master Eduard Mnacakanian, White has an extra pawn." Here the same is the case. Black's bishop is poor and the d5-square offers nowhere near sufficient consolation for the material deficit. The engines have a different opinion, stating that this was the lesser evil. Arguing with computers makes no sense, but of course the position is won. Anand's idea might have been to give up a pawn, but I honestly did not consider taking the pawn for even a moment. White is probably better, but it is not a positive transformation at all. Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 205

[diagram]
There is nothing wrong with this move, but I would like to add that from the live commentary room Leko and Karpov suggested an equally strong move: 23.Wfe l ! with the idea 23 ... .Bb7 24.Ra5!, when White has great control over the dark squares on the queenside. If Black tries to contest the c-file with 24 ... E:c8 he is faced with: 25.E:xc8t .Bxc8

[diagram]
26.Rd8t Rf8 27.Wfc7! Black is completely

tied down. Very impressive indeed. ••• g5?! Everyone criticized this move, which is indeed bad, but as we have seen it is by no means solely responsible for Black's problems. I guess the issue is partly that it was around this point that the engines started to understand the serious state of affairs that Black is facing. I can see a point to ...g5, which could be to provoke White to do something crazy, like taking on e4 in better circumstances than on the previous move. It reminds me a bit of a discussion I had with the father of one of the top young players a few years ago. I had a winning ending against someone who laid quite a cunning trap for me. I discovered the trick and found a better way to deal with the issue and quickly won the game. This father told me in an offhand remark that I was lucky that my opponent had made such a poor move, allowing me to win quickly. I tried to explain that I really did not care how long it took for me to win the game, but only about the certainty of a win. And in that respect, a well-laid trap was probably the best chance to alter the course of the game. But the old man would have none of it. You should always play the best move, no matter what, he insisted. Although I do not necessarily disagree with this statement, I think we should not allow the engines to define "the best move", but be more intelligent about it. If Black plays 23 ... .Bb7, I would play 24.llJc5 and Black's position is simply bad. The best chance for Black is 23 ... llJdf6, but after 24.llJc5 Black has to take. 24 ... llJxc5 Here it is possible to take with the queen, but it feels quite natural to play: 25.dxc5 Wfc7 26.Wfc3

[diagram]
206 Positional Decision Making in Chess

White has a big advantage. He is intending co play c5-c6 and in other ways slowly squeeze Black against the edge of the board until he flattens entirely. Obviously the computer tries to find some resources here, but we should not forget that it is the job of engines to suggest moves, even when no good options exist.

Chapter 5 Transformation of Advantages Maya, Avner, Avita! and Boris 2 1 0 Positional Decision Making i n Chess Breaking it down, there are several types of advantages - extra material; having the more active pieces; having a better pawn structure; two bishops against bishop and knight - and so on. The way that theoretically inclined people like to divide this up is into two types of advantage: Static advantage: An advantage that has a lasting quality. It could be a better pawn structure, extra space, extra material, bishops against knights and so on. Things that will be there ten moves later unless something drastic happens. In general, if you have an advantage like this, you are hoping it will help you to win the game - though good moves will always be necessary of course! Dynamic advantage: An advantage dependent on time. The simplest form is a lead in development. We also have an attack on the king and the initiative in general. Dynamic advantages have a tendency to be unstable. The attack may quickly disappear if, for example, the attacker is too deliberate in the execution and so on. Conversion in theory A game can be won only in a few ways. Besides the opponent overstepping the time limit, they are all versions ofeventual checkmate. Whether it is on the next move or in fifty moves does not matter. Resignation comes in the belief that mate cannot be avoided indefinitely. A draw is agreed in the belief that mate cannot be achieved. But then mate can happen in a few different ways. It can happen after a long fight, for example when the last pawn on the board is promoted, after which queen and king gang up on the opponent's king. Or it can happen in the opening or middlegame with a strike on an insufficiently guarded king. The conversion of an advantage is when we give up one type of advantage in order to gain another type of advantage. When we have a static advantage, it is common to convert it at some point, hoping to increase our advantage or to gain an advantage that can be more easily exploited. For example, we can give up an extra exchange in order to cripple the opponent's pawn structure. Or we can exploit one of the advantages of the bishop pair by choosing a profitable moment to exchange one of the bishops in order to create weaknesses in the opponent's position. Conversion from a static advantage into a dynamic advantage, or vice versa, is quite common. Giving up a pawn for an attack, or giving up the attack in order to secure an extra pawn; these can both be easily imagined. However, we rarely see the exchange of one dynamic advantage for another dynamic advantage. Most players would probably find it difficult to think of one, myself included. An important point about dynamic advantages is that we need to make something of them before they disappear. They are unstable. A lead in development will either grow or decrease; and if we do not manage to convert it into mate or a static advantage, the opponent will get his pieces out and our advantage will be gone. Conversion in practice The main principle of exploiting an advantage is to remain flexible. It is rare that we are able to win a game based on one strategic idea. It was possible in previous times - you can find beautiful games from Petrosian, Borvinnik and Rubinstein based on one idea. But these days it is nearly impossible; the level of defence has gone up. In short, our opponents have a tendency to resist! Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 2 1 1 For this reason, we will at times change the nature of our advantage. An extra pawn might be sacrificed, in order to improve our pieces. Or if we have been able to put our opponent under pressure because of our better pawn structure, we might use that to create attacking opportunities. Conversely, our attack might be going well, but by changing our focus, we can win a pawn and win the game in technical style. The constellations are not infinite; I am sure it would be possible to set up a table with all the possible transitions. But it would be large and not at all useful for the practical player. For us it is essentially important to keep an open mind and look out for the options chat suggest themselves to us during the game. These transitions are very concrete and we have to follow the requirements of the position; try to solve the problems in the way they demand, not the way we would prefer. To summarize, we should not be dogmatic and stick to our plan at all costs, but should instead be ready to exploit all the possibilities we are offered. I know this sounds a bit like we should play good moves, but we will see in the games that there is a bit more meat on the bones than just this. Choosing to change the nature of the position is often quite a serious decision and we should not take it lightly. At times it will come as a natural extension of our plan and at times it will come as an option we did not expect, but that we should consider seriously. The transformations of Rubinstein In this chapter I have included four games by Rubinstein and a few games of my own, illustrating typical scenarios that someone playing in this classical sryle will encounter. As you will see, Rubinstein was really good at some types of transformation, the ones that came at the end of a plan, exemplified by moves 1 9 and 28 of the following game against one of the greatest chess thinkers of all time. Akiba Rubinstein -Aron Nimzowitsch Berlin 1 928 l.d4 ttJf6 2.c4 e6 3.ttJc3 i.b4 4.°1Wc2 d6 5.e3 c5 6.i.d3 lbc6 7.ttJge2

[diagram]
This game sees two big pioneers in this opening in battle against each other. Nimzowitsch obviously invented Black's defence, while 4.e3 is named after Rubinstein. His main idea was to play tlige2 and win the bishop pair without getting doubled pawns. 7 •.• e5 8.d5 i.xc3t We see here that we are in the early years of this system. Nimzowitsch often gave up the bishop on c3 unprovoked, while these days Black will most often look from a concession from White before giving up the bishop: either giving him a doubled pawn, or at least getting him to spend a tempo on playing a2-a3.

White has done well out of the opening. He has the two bishops, which will especially be beneficial on the dark squares where the bishop is stronger than the knight. On top of this he also has a space advantage, which he can use to put pressure on the kingside.

It is an interesting question what Rubinstein would have done if Black had played: 1 9. ..a4 I suspect that he would have played slowly, closing the position with 20.f5 in order to use his space advantage on the kingside. It seems likely that this is not enough to win the game against accurate defence, according to my analysis. In the 1 930s and 1 940s it became more and more common for players to sacrifice the exchange and the compensation that could be achieved became better and better understood. A few World Champions added additionally to this knowledge, each in their own way. Petrosian showed how the exchange sacrifice could give a long-term advantage, even in the defence, while Kasparov and later Topalov and Anand showed the dynamic potential. Here it is the dynamic factors that are in play:

It now seems natural to bring the knight on g6 into the centre, but actually it is well placed where it is, defending the kingside. 20 ... lllxe5?

1-0 A fantastic game; Rubinstein at his best. But it is not always the case that we are able to carry out our plans in this way, to fully mobilize our forces and then choose which way we want to change the position. Our opponents have plans of their own, and will try to impose their will onto us. This can lead to great complications where we need to calculate and evaluate things at a deep level in order to make the best move. I do not want to give the impression that Rubinstein - nor I for that matter - always solved this kind of problem perfectly. He had a tendency to go for the more technical positions which arose from his calculation. In the following game Rubinstein brings in all his pieces before having to make a big decision on move 1 6. As we shall see, his bias towards technical positions proved quite effective, but his decision was not truly accurate. Akiba Rubinstein - Grigory Levenfish Karlsbad 1 9 1 1

Actually, you will find only a limited number of games where Rubinstein makes this kind of mistake! Bue we should not forget chat this game was played decades before Boleslavsky, Bronstein and others developed the King's Indian and added a lot of dynamic dimensions to the understanding of chess. Rubinstein's play on this move is certainly sloppy, but maybe also coloured by his love for having a space advantage. However, the most interesting moments occur at moves 25-27, where Rubinstein takes the initiative, not caring for unimportant pawns.

 Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 219 In the initial stages of the following game, Rubinstein's play is most impressive, yet it is the rook ending that is surely the most interesting part. In a game filled with strategic, tactical and technical challenges, these two giants of early chess history battle their way to move 76. As you would expect, not all decisions on the way were the best possible, but the high quality of the play is undeniable. Akiba Rubinstein - Alexander Alekhine Karlsbad I 9 1 I In this game Rubinstein built up a strong centre and space advantage. On the other hand, Black was very solid, so it was not so easy to make something of this advantage.

This is where the opening ends and the middlegame starts. If we look at this with modern eyes, we would not rate White's chances to be that extraordinary. If Black were to play ... l'!d7 immediately and simply improve his position slowly, he would have a solid and defendable position. Accurate play would still be needed, as White's small pluses are still valid, of course, but the game goes on.

23.axb5 cxd4 24.cxd4?

The most obvious positional move, but here Rubinstein missed a chance to improve his position greatly. I have already mentioned this once; Rubinstein was not very flexible and would rarely deviate from his strategic goals. He could have played: 24.c4! llib6 (24 ... llie7

With a technically winning position. I am not sure if it was Nimzowitsch or Lasker who said about Rubinstein that he could at times be too slow, but on the other hand he would never force matters prematurely. 24 ...b6 I am pretty sure that Alekhine believed that his position was a fortress, with just one weakness and a lack of entry points in the position. But Rubinstein manages to outmanoeuvre him.

[diagram]
27.Bxd5!

It looks odd that White gives his strong bishop away, but as Black has to take with the pawn, his structure is weakened further and fixed in an awkward position. The transformative power of White's advantage is clear. 27 ...exdS 28.gacl White enjoys a big advantage. Black has weak pawns on a7, d5 and h7 to look after.

Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 22 1 Up to this point Rubinstein has played a great game, but from here on his play is less impressive. Now, more than a hundred years later, it is of course difficult to guess why. Maybe he had not slept well; maybe it was something he ate. The possibilities are endless when once you get going. But the most accurate statement is simply that he did not handle the endgame well on this occasion. This is not a judgement on his strength, as top grandmasters today also play badly on occasion, which reminds me of Grischuk saying that he did not fully understand why I am so infatuated with Rubinstein's games. In his kind words, I am apparently a much better player than Rubinstein was. Even if you were thinking this was the case, it certainly was not the case when I bought Razuvaev's book! Or in Jacob Aagaard's words: It was only by climbing on top of Akiba's shoulders that I was able to jump into the world elite and make my own mark on modern chess history - however faint.

34.@e2?

I have no idea why Rubinstein allowed Black to exchange a set of rooks. It made more sense to wait and try to improve the position further.

Another careless move? Rubinstein appears not only blind to his opponent's chance to create counterplay with the a-pawn, but he also weakens the e-pawn. However, as we shall see, Rubinstein had a deep prophylactic idea. An important point is that after 36.@d3 Black can force a draw with 36 ... l3c8!. The pawn ending is surprisingly a draw even after:

Usually we would assume that White would have great winning chances if he was able to exchange his e-pawn for the black b-pawn and get his king to c6.

[diagram]
Surely Black would end up in zugzwang? But in this case Black would actually be winning with a series of thematic breaks with ...h5, ... g5 and ...f4, allowing the h-pawn to run up the flank to promotion. White can stay back

with the king and avoid defeat, but there is no advantage to speak of. Rubinstein realized this and thus prepared to push his e-pawn with 36.f3. Black would now lose the pawn ending after: 36 ... :B:c8? 37.:B:xc8 c;t>xc8 38.e4!

Black does not have time to create counterplay on the queenside and White can slowly penetrate on the kingside. However, there is another drawback that the great men apparently did not notice. 5 4 3 2

224 Positional Decision Making in Chess

[diagram]
Rubinstein has shuffled his rook about a bit and is now ready to go with the king to the kingside to force Black to make concessions.

If Black scares giving checks again, the white king will go up and pluck off the d5-pawn before finally winning the black rook. 1-0 By no means a flawless game, but you can say the same about a lot of my best games, so please do not lee the precision tools we have at our disposal today diminish your appreciation of the great skills Rubinstein and Alekhine possessed. This reminds me of a recent press conference from Scavanger where Alexander Grischuk once again displayed his entertaining wit. In a more serious moment he made the following comment on the increased use of the word blunder in the language of modern chess. "Actually, I chink this is why people chink chat players forty years ago played better than nowadays. Now the computer Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 227 immediately shows the mistakes, It's red, and they think OK, they are complete patzers. But in fact in many of those situations where the computer immediately shows that it is a blunder, it would have taken a week to debate it in the press; Igor Zaitsev would find some amazing resource and so on. But now the computer just shows it in two seconds." Transformations in my own games Things are of course never easy in a practical encounter against a resourceful opponent. In the rest of this chapter I will give four examples from my own games. They all show different aspects of transforming the position in an attempt to fight for - or keep - the advantage. Things are rather subtle in places, but I hope that the deeper meaning will still shine through. In the first game we shall see how I managed to transform the advantage of the first move into a slightly preferable structure. My opponent played decently for quite a while, but the pressure of being a little worse, no matter what he did, eventually led him to make a small mistake, making it possible for me to improve the structure a bit more. Then a few things happened in the game, but eventually the better structure was decisive. Boris Gelfand - Branko Damljanovic Istanbul (ol) 2000 Branko Damljanovic is one of the strongest Serbian players of the past. I know him quite well, as we played for the same club, Agrouniverzal, once in the Serbian Cup and many times in the European Club Cup. The peak of his career came in 1 990, where he played brilliantly in the lnterzonal and would have been a Candidate had he won one of the last two rounds instead of drawing them both. In the game against Shirov in the penultimate round, he was completely winning, as is well known. But also in the last round he was winning against Ljubojevic, though we only know this today when the computers point out the amazing winning combination. In the Chess Informant annotations from the time of the game, the move that throws the win away was awarded an exclamation mark. ..

Damljanovic played in the style of many players from the Balkans, where the opening knowledge was perhaps not very deep, but the lines were always sharp and tactical and he always had clear ideas about what he was doing. I played with him a few times and won a very nice game against him, which can be found on page 98 in My Most Memorable Games. These days he has developed his style and occasionally goes for big theoretical discussions.

The idea of putting the knight on a6 was invented by Russian grandmaster Igor Glek. He told me that he was recruited to army training and had to sit in a tank for days with nothing to do, so he speculated about chess. At some point he wondered why no one puts the knight on a6 in the King's Indian. At first he considered the Averbakh system (6.i.g5) and then the Classical system. We have seen it in the Averbakh in my game against Grischuk on page 1 53. As I used to be a King's Indian player, I have of course played it myself quite a number of times.

8.O-O '\W e7!?

This is a rare move. The idea is chat if White plays d4-d5, the queen is much better placed on e7 for various reasons. Other popular moves at this point are 8 ... 'Re8, 8 ... tllg4 and 8 ...c6. 9 . .Bg5 I like this idea, which I found during the game. It brings the ideas of tlld5 and c4-c5 into play. Shortly after the game Khalifman called me and asked me if I had seen this move in his book, as it was his recommendation. I hadn't, but it was a good push to read his books carefully. Later on I won a great game against Peter Svidler, using one of his recommendations. We will see this game in the second volume of this series.

This is the most sensible move. However, White can try pushing the c-pawn all the same.
[diagram]
Here White just has to resist the temptation to exchange too many pieces. l 9.tlJxc5! White is a pawn down, but is clearly for choice. The quality of the pieces matters a lot!

[diagram]
When I played 9.Bg5 I was aiming for this position. Obviously it made no sense to think beyond this point. I think White has a fine position. Black has a slight weakness on d6 and White has some space advantage. Added to this, Black does not have the usual active counterplay that makes the King's Indian so playable. The opening was developed by U...c6 Pretty natural. Sooner or later Black will have to eliminate the pin. Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 23 1 Boleslavsky and Bronstein and they almost always managed to create some active play. But with the exchange of two minor pieces, it is not apparent where Black's counterplay will come from. This raises the question, what next? At this point my idea was to consolidate. First I want to prevent Black from playing ... d5 and activating his pieces. 15 ... a5 16Jfadl gds 17JUel i.d7 18 . .ifl Vfie7

[diagram]
The big question here is whether Black should put his pawn on a4 or not. It is really not clear. One the one hand it limits White's option of playing b2-b3 to support the c4- pawn; on the other hand it will expose the pawn later on and force the black pieces to defend it. It is indeed a good question as to which is the right choice. Personally I would prefer to play it, but I do not say this with any certainty of it being the right choice.

19.tlle2

The knight is going to c3 in order to further restrain ...d5. White could also consider l 9.b3, but when Black has already shown that he does not want to play ... a4, there is less motivation to prevent it. Honestly I cannot remember why I made this small decision fifreen years ago. Probably I liked my own ideas and focused on them. There is no way to know for sure.

19. ..

J.es The bishop was not doing well on d7, so it is transferred to f7, from where it controls d5.

20.t£!c3 f6

Here my plan is to manoeuvre around so the rooks can put pressure on the d6-pawn. As White has a slight space advantage, it is easier for him to regroup, which he should use to his advantage. In short, it is not easy for Black to do anything. There is no easy way to change the course of the game, as neither ...d5 or .. .f5 is likely to do any good. 21 .Vfifl .Bf7 22JM2 gd7 23.gedl gad8

24.g3

As it could be unpleasant if the white bishop comes to h3, Black's next move is obvious.

.te6 25.b3

[diagram]
At this point I no longer need the knight on c3, so I want to manoeuvre it to d4 (or f4}, which could work well together with J.h3. For this reason I need this move of my b-pawn, which by the way I could have played at any moment.

[diagram]
At this point I was thinking that I wanted to harass the pawn on a5 a little bit to see how Black would decide to defend it. I would of course be happy to provoke ...b6 (weakening the c6-pawn) and if nothing else, the black rook would be passive on a8. Therefore I vacate c3 for the queen to ask Black what he wants to do. I have to say that I still like this idea fifteen years later, though of course it will have to be done with subtlety. The additional idea here is to play l2Jd4 with Bh3 coming, as mentioned earlier. Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 233 A part of the philosophy behind the squeeze is to try various things and see if the opponent defends well. 26 ... £5 It is obvious that Black was planning this with his last move. If he had wanted to wait, it would have been better to do so with the idea described on the 25th move. 27 .exf5 .lxf5 The structure has changed, but Black has not been able to free himself of his weakness on d6. White continues to be slightly better. 27 ...gxf5? 28.ltlf4 would give Black an even worse structure.

28.ltld4 YlYf6 29.YlYe3

With the combined ideas of putting the queen on c3 or on f4, prodding; all the time prodding.

29.ltlxf5 would make less sense here, as Black

can play 29 ... gxf5 and follow up with ... f5-f4.

[diagram]
29 ...�fi?! After being under pressure for 1 5 moves, Black makes a small mistake that gives White a chance to make a favourable exchange. During the game I felt that Black should activate his rook with: 29 ... :ge? Here it is not so easy to prove an advantage for White. For example, 30.Rf4 can be met by 30 ... :ge5!.

30.Rc3 :gas

Here White has to find a fantastic move to be better. 3 i .:gf2!! Black has tremendous counterplay after both 3 1 .ltlb5 Rxc3 32.ltlxc3 :ge3 and 3 1 .Bg2 :gae8 32.Wal ltld3!. For this reason, White needs this sensational prophylactic move. 3 1 ...id? 32.Rd2 White continues to pose Black problems, and he will continue to manoeuvre. Objectively, White's advantage has not increased greatly, but as the game has progressed, it has become increasingly difficult for Black to find the moves needed to hold. I would also like to add that a move like 3 1 .:gf2 is possible to find for a human, though it might take 20 minutes or more! At this moment I grabbed the chance to improve my structure and to add the miniscule advantage of bishop against knight to the overall evaluation.

34.gdl?

At this point I was already short of time. This move does not have any serious idea behind it and Black gets a free move to get organized. Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 235 Furthermore, the rook has no great task to fulfil on the d-line. During the game I was considering 34 . .Bh3, which I probably should have played. However,

34.Wf d2! looks even stronger. After 34 ...

b6 White now plays 35 . .Bh3! with an even better version. Things are highly uncomfortable for Black, who cannot really defend against .Bxf5, E1h6 and so on. This is quite a typical situation for handling an advantage. There comes a moment when you have to play a few accurate moves to exploit the opponent's poor coordination, in order to make the most of your position. This was the moment for me, but sadly on this day I was not up to it. Luckily my opponent was not able to exploit this chance to get back into the game. 34 .• JU6 35.ti'd2 b6 There is nothing wrong with this, but maybe Black could even have looked for active play with 35 ... a4!? 36.b4 lt:le6 with ideas of ...d5 and ... f4.

White is of course better, but he no longer has complete control. 36J;d4 Qh8 37.J.g2 After this White manages to consolidate again, this time not letting his opponent off the hook. Black missed a nice tactical shot: 37 ...dS!! Creating the active counterplay he has been craving for the whole game.

236 Positional Decision Making in Chess

White has an unpleasant choice between allowing ... lllf2-g4 (after @h2) or exchanging on e4, giving Black a strong passed pawn. In either case White might have a few winning chances still, but Black has really managed to get back into the game in a big way.

[diagram]
This allows White to simplify the position in his favour, but otherwise the bishop remains superior to the knight, so Black's task was already difficult. 38 ...Wc? was possible, but after something like 39 . .iB White continues to improve his position.

[diagram]
Black has made something out of the knight and it is no longer inferior to White's bishop, but this comes at a price. Not only will the black e-pawn be a target, but White also gets a chance to expand on the kingside and push his newly created passed pawn.

39.he4 fxe4 40.Vf e3!

This is a standard move in Rubinstein's style. Black should not be allowed any unnecessary counterplay. After something like 40.f5?! e3! 4 1 .'Re2 !!ee8

42.E:xd6 !!xd6 43.E:xd6 Re5 White has won a

pawn, but his coordination is all over the place and the e3-pawn gives Black counterplay. It is clearly not a practical choice to play like this.

1-0 Transforming dynamic and static advantages The next game shows quite a nice twist. In athbe opening I sacrificed a pawn in return for ig centre and a lead in development, as I have done many, many times. However, when my opponent weakened his pawn structure, I was quick to upgrade my initiative into a better structure, with the option of having an extra pawn. There was nothing special about this, but what makes this game interesting is that when my opponent (quite rightly) tried to create active counterplay, I found a way to give up the extra pawn and instead recapture the initiative, using it to create a winning attack on the seventh rank. Boris Gelfand - Mark Tseitlin Tel Aviv 1 999 Tseitlin is a very aggressive player who constantly seeks his opponent's king. He is originally from St Petersburg, but immigrated to Israel in 1 990, where he had his best chess years, earning the GM title in 1 997 and achieving his highest rating (2545) in 1 995. He has won the European Senior Championship four times and also the team event once. In the Soviet Union he only made it to the level oflnternational Master, but still managed to beat the legendary Viktor Korchnoi four times. The following game is quite amazing.

This gambit used to be my favourite line; I even wrote a chapter on it in My Most Memorable Games. For the pawn White gets space and a lead in development. It used to be great fun to play, but sadly these days it has been analysed too heavily and it becomes a memory test more than a game of chess to play this way.

White needs to build up his initiative slowly here.

I would be quite comfortable here, but will not claim that White has achieved anything special. Just to make one thing absolutely clear. We were both out of our preparation at this point. While Tseitlin was thinking, I was wondering what I would do against 1 6. .. tLic4, becoming a little worried and feeling a gust of relief when he did not find it. Of course he wanted to play something like this; Tseitlin is a dynamic player who understands these things well, but this time he could not make it work and settled for a concession.

17. .Bc5!

This strong move switches from the theme of the strong centre and harassing the black queen. Instead the idea of taking on b6 and regaining the pawn comes to the foreground. Black will still have weaknesses on b7, e6 and e7 to deal with. I think it is quite a clever idea, leading to a really horrible situation for Black. Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 24 1 Black was okay after l 7.Re2 E:fc8 1 8.Ei:a5 lllc4 l 9.Ei:c5 b5 in Meissner - Gaerths, Germany 1 992.

At this point I had planned 1 8.Wb l , when there are a lot of complications that are not as clear as I had imagined. This approach is too concrete.

244 Positional Decision Making in Chess

The two bishops - a long-term dynamic advantage Usually we talk about an advantage being short-term or long-term, or dynamic and static, if you like. This is at times a little too simplistic. In the next game we shall see the power of the two bishops dominating two knights which have no good squares available. During the game I had options of using their superiority in both dynamic and static ways, either to support an attack or to squeeze my opponent, making him choose between various bad endings. I chose the latter, mainly because I did not see the attacking possibilities! Boris Gelfand - Sergey Rublevsky Palma de Mallorca 2008 Sergey Rublevsky is a good friend of mine and has been so for a long time. As a player he has been a part of the elite for many years; he was a regular top 20 player, qualified for the Candidates, beat Kasparov and so on. These days he seems to be focusing more on being a trainer than a player, for Kramnik during his World Championship matches and later for the Russian women's team when they won the Olympiads in 20 1 2 and 20 1 4. He has quite a narrow, but well thought-out opening repertoire. He has played the Queen's Gambit Accepted throughout his entire career. It was only recently that he added some Slav lines to this. He is similarly narrow in his approach to the white pieces. I think he must analyse the opening phase of his own games very deeply in order to come up with something new again and again. In the opinion of Igor Zaitsev (Karpov's second for many years), Rublevsky plays in Bogoljubow's style. I do not really understand what this means, but at least it is nice to know that I am not the only player whose style matches a great player from the past. 1 .d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.e4 This is the most ambitious and challenging system. It requires more knowledge than other systems, as Black can play a lot of moves here. 3 ...e5 This is the standard move for Rublevsky. The main alternatives are 3 ...c5, 3 ... lllf6 and 3 ... lllc6, and recently 3 ...b5 has also become quite popular.

However, in this posmon Rublevsky was making a real choice. If you exclude this game from the statistics, he has scored 50% with this move, performing slightly below his expected score. After 4 ...exd4 5.Bxc4 lllc6 6.O-O Be6 there are 1 1 games in my database where Rublevsky is Black. He has a + 3 score, exceeding his expected score slightly.

A matter of taste.

An important move.

9.O-O ltJxd4 I O. .Bxd4 ltJc6 offers an easy

route co equality, as can for example be seen in one of the key games for this line, Bologan - Rublevsky, Saint Vincent 2005.

9.liJdbS Ba5 also offers Black decent chances.

Again Rublevsky has been Black in five games from this position. It feels likely chat Rublevsky has analysed these lines deeply and knows how to eliminate the apparent pressure from White. 9 ...hc3t I think this capture is more or less forced. The problem is that if he goes: 9 ...Ba5 1 0.O-O lDxd4 (If he plays the natural 1 0. .. .Bb6, then I reply 1 1 .lDxc6 lDxc6 1 2. .Bxb6 axb6 and I am in time for 1 3.f4 with a fine position} 1 l ..Bxd4 ltJc6

[diagram]
I now have l 2 . .Bc5 with some advantage.

[diagram]

Taking on d4 makes no sense anymore, as I can cake back with the pawn. 1 1 .Ae2 It is a good question where the bishop belongs. Against Hubner I placed the bishop on a2, which seems to be a bad choice as it will simply

246 Positional Decision Making in Chess

be exchanged, as Robert did against me: I l .Ba2 b6 12.Re2 c5 1 3.lDb5 lDg6 14.l:!d l Re7 1 5.O-O Be6 1 6.Bxe6 fXe6 1 7.f4 l:!ad8 1 8.l:!xd8 l:!xd8 1 9.e5 Rd7 20.lDd6 Y2-Y2 Gelfand - Hubner, Munich 1 994. So I think putting the bishop on e2 is more ambitious. It was not exactly a new move; Kamsky had played it against Shore in their 1 994 Candidates match, though Short played so poorly that it is rather irrelevant for this game. Instead we will follow Bareev - lvanchuk, as referred to below.

I don't want to go into greater detail on the opening in this book, but I am certain that this way of playing is better. It might look dangerous for Black and it requires accurate and deep preparation; but I am sure that Rublevsky did his work.

Although not as strong as I I ...f5, we cannot call Black's play unnatural.

My improvement for this game. Bareev played 1 3.Rc2, which is also natural, and he went on to win in Bareev - lvanchuk, Dortmund 1 992. Still, I find my move more appealing. It forces Black's reply and thus wins a bit of time. White wants to play lDf5 and Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages obtain the advantage of two bishops against two knights, so why delay?

[diagram]
Executing my plan. At this point I was sure he was going to take on f5 and he did so without too much thought.

[diagram]

[diagram]

[diagram]
This is a better square for the knight than in the game, which is paradoxical. At first glance, e5 looks like a more active and natural square, but as we shall see in the following, the knight is unstable there. Obviously it helps that the knight attacks the f5-pawn from e7. On e5 it looks pretty, but it is not able to do much for Black's position.

[diagram]

[diagram]
The operations of the opening are at an end and it makes sense to take stock of what has happened. Let us start with the conclusion: White has the advantage. First of all, White has two good bishops in a fairly open position. They are well placed and will be useful in the long run. Compare this with the black knights, which are struggling to find stability. Black does have the nicer pawn structure, but

248 Positional Decision Making in Chess

White's split pawns are not without potential.

17.h3!

A natural improvement of the position, which can be useful in many ways. White might consider g2-g4, but also he just does not want to get back-rank mated or hit by a ... lllg4 tactic. This might all seem very simple and logical when described, but it took me 25 minutes to decide on this move! In the event of 1 7. :Sfe l , Black can exchange rooks and White will have gained nothing from his last move. The question is what Black should do in this position besides exchanging on d l . There is no obvious way to fight for equality.

[diagram]
By preparing to bring the other rook to the d-file, Rublevsky provokes me to cake on d6. He intends to recapture with the c-pawn in order to bring the other rook to the c-file, to put pressure on c3 and also occupy the c4-square. During the game I was worried about: 1 7. .. lllb7!? This would have been a concrete attempt to solve Black's problems with a pawn sacrifice. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and the same often goes for pawn sacrifices; we have to take it. .. 1 8.'1Mfxa7 lllc5

[diagram]
I was not sure about this position at all, but it turns out chat White has plenty of resources. Black is not really threatening ... lllc6. The main refutation comes from the computer. l 9.:Sxd8! :Sxd8 20.a4! With the idea a4-a5 and also chat the white bishop would be protected on b5. le seems chat White is just a pawn up. 20 ... lllc6 Black can also try 20 ... llle4, but White has no problems after 2 l ..Bxb6 lllxc3 22 . .Ba6 lllf.3t 23.<J;>h l and I cannot see what threats Black is supposed to have. 2 1 ..Bxc5 bxc5 22.Rb7 A pawn up, White is close to winning. So my concerns during the game were not justified, but it is better to be worried about critical tries from the opponent than to be oblivious of them! Black could of course try other moves, such as regrouping the knight with 1 7. .. llld7. Here White can try 1 8.Rb4!?, when provoking Black to play 1 8. ..cS would be quite an achievement, and after 1 9.Rf4 White has a fine position with the possibility of expanding on the kingside with if.3 and g2-g4-g5. 1 7. .. :Sfe8 1 8.:Sd4 also looks pleasant for White. Again it would be welcome if Black played 1 8. ..c5, when after 1 9.:Sxd8 :Sxd8

20.:Sd l White is for choice.

We see that in general that White would love Black to play ...c5, taking the square away from the knights. As Mihail Marin likes to say: the knights will find it hard to achieve stability. Ac this point White has a long-term advantage of two bishops against two knights, which brings us to the thematic question of this chapter: what should we do once we have the advantage? Obviously I can only tell you how Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages I approach this situation and the reader will then have to work out for himself if he finds this approach useful.

[diagram]
My main approach is to think, "What should I do next?" During the game I will seriously consider which transformations would be to my advantage and which would not. But in general I am just looking for a way to improve the position. In this position the main thing for White is to create a function for the rook on fl . As the bishops are solidly placed on the e-file, my next move is not too difficult.

[diagram]
Forcing White to take on d6. I had of course anticipated this, but felt that the circumstances were different. Black has lost a vital tempo putting the knight on the inferior c6-square. This is an important part of thinking about transformations. Dynamics is a big part of chess and thus dynamic considerations will always be important. 19Jhd6 There are positive reasons to play this for White as well; essentially the d6-pawn is now a target in a way the pawn on c7 never was. After l 9.l:'i:e4 I did not like l 9 ... Rf6, when I did not feel my pieces would be well coordinated. The rook looks stupid on e4.

19. ..

cxd6 l 9 ... Rxd6 20.Re4 is also unpleasant for Black. It is not clear where the knight will go from e5. Again, the knight lacks stability.

[diagram]
Black has no defence against Rg3 on the next move, winning at least a piece. The above tactical finesse might look like a random chance, but that is not how I see it. Chess is a logical game and the tactical chances we get come from our play earlier in the game. That Black could have been punished for misplacing his pieces is natural. Of course nothing is really spoiled by my missing this move; the problems that allowed it are still there, and Black is teetering on the edge of defeat. It is quite common that we miss a chance or two in an overwhelming position but win anyway, because the plan we choose is also good enough. 20 . . . 1"lc8 Black is still dreaming of ... lt:\a5-c4.

Shortly after the game I had the feeling that it might have been better to play the more direct

ll'Ba5 the best I have been able to find is to transpose to a line that could have occurred in the game: Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 25 1

[diagram]
23 . .Ba6! (23.Rxd6?! Rxd6 24.l::1 xd6 tllac4 brings Black's pieces to life and thus gives him real drawing chances.) Now Black should play 23 ... l::1 c7! transposing to the line given in the note to Black's 23rd move below, as I do not believe Black can hold the endgame after 23 ... l::1 xc3?! 24 . .Bd2 l::1 c5 25.Ra8t Rf8 26.Rxf8t ci>xf8 27 . .Bb4 die7 28 . .ixcS bxc5 29 . .ibS!, though nothing is certain, of course. 22 . .ibS!? was an interesting move that I did not seriously consider during the game. It also leads to interesting options for White, but is not a clearer path to an advantage than the game continuation. During the game you have to choose between options that attract you, and this was not one of the things I looked at. 22 • • Jk7 22 ... l::1 d8 would be poorer, though it contains a lovely trap: 23.f4? d5! 24.l::1 xd5 tllf3t would allow Black back into the game. But the main problem is that after 23 . .ibS tlla5 24.a4 Black is almost paralysed.

White has a pleasant choice. After 28.:B:d5 f6 29.j,xe5 fxe5 30.:B:xe5, White has an extra pawn and decent control over the position.

28.j,xe5 llixd6 29.j,xd6 :B:xc3 would give

White a little less control over the position; on the other hand he would have two bishops against a rook. This line would open up the possibility that after exchanging pawns on the queenside, Black might be able to draw, albeit after a lot of suffering. I am not saying this would happen, but there is a risk.

Only I believed that White has serious winning chances. Emil Sutovsky subsequently put the position on Facebook and asked whoever he bumped into what they thought. The opinion was almost universally the opposite of mine. I have not done any serious analytical work on this and it remains guesswork. The argument against my view is that White will be unable to attack any weakness twice. On the other hand the bishops are very strong and can potentially dominate everything.

1-0 Conversion from nothing to nothing! There are times when we transform the position simply because we need to do something. In this case we are not looking for a way to preserve an advantage but for a way to preserve equality, or for a way to set different problems for our opponents. In the following game there are a number of interesting possibilities for both players to transform the position. Initially Black has to choose between the ...c5 and ...e5 options. Later on White needs to choose between different ways to pose problems for Black. In the endgame Black probably chooses the wrong strategy of waiting solidly, hoping that White cannot improve his position greatly. This leads to a critical position at move 37, where White forces matters and Black has to come up with a sequence of only moves to avoid losing quickly. As so often happens, this is not as easy as it sounds ... Boris Gelfand - Laurent Fressinet Canada de Calatrava (rapid) 2007 This game was played in a strong rapid event in Spain. It was the second edition of the tournament and the only time I took part. I tied for first with Shirov, Fridman and Ivan Sokolov, ahead of other such strong grandmasters as Anand, Mamedyarov, Polgar, Grischuk, Karpov and so on. Fressinet is essentially a classical player with a broad knowledge. He has seconded both Kramnik and Carlsen in World Championship matches. He can play all types of positions well, and does not have an obvious weakness as far as I can see. When he was younger he was quite tactical, but he has clearly matured. I have played quite a number of games against him and, as he pointed out, I tend to have achieved my best results when he was also taking part in the tournament (not necessarily dependent on our individual result) . In 20 1 3 I won both the Paris Grand Prix and the Alekhine Memorial, where he also took part, as well as a few other tournaments over the years. So naturally he suggested that I should press organizers of the big tournaments to invite not only me, but also him.

This move is becoming more popular these days. The main reason is that it has less theory associated with it than for example

4.lllc3, where Black has a big choice between

the Classical Slav, the Semi-Slav and the Chebanenko Slav. White wants to have a long positional game, rather than trying to win from the opening. 4 •• • dxc4 s.Wfxc4 .Bg4 Fressinet chooses the more dynamic of the two main options here. 5 ... i.f5 is the other main line.

This is a reasonable decision, though it should probably be followed by ...c5 rather than ...e5. 1 5. ..c5 This will mainly transpose, but there are a few details that it makes sense to include here. 1 6.d5 If Black is allowed to take on d4, then he equalizes.

have analysed this position further and it seems that there is no clear way for White to claim an advantage. He does have the two bishops and a passed pawn, but the pawn is quite safely guarded and there are excellent squares for the black bishop and knights on the dark squares. It would be easy to confuse everything with a lot of variations, but essentially they would only confirm the optical impression, which is that Black should be okay with accurate play.

16.La e5

1 6. ..c5 would give White nothing better chan transposing to the lines above.

A sensible move. It was also possible for White to play l 7.d5 cxd5 1 8.exd5 or l 7.tDe2!? with slight pressure in both cases.

The following manoeuvre is questionable. On the surface 1 7. .. '!Rxe5 1 8.i.h4 may look unpleasant for Black, but what he did in the game looks less logical. The knight takes two moves to get to a square that is no better than where it came from.

[diagram]
At this point White would be doing really well if he had an additional move to play f2-f4 and i.f3, preparing e4-e5. It is therefore Black's task to neutralize White's pressure before it becomes too great.

As mentioned above, White would love to have an extra tempo to play Bf3 and e4-e5, but things are not that easy. The resulting structure is unpleasant for Black, but tenable none the less. 2 1 ...h6 Not a pleasant move to make, but sooner or later Black will have to play this move to force White to take on f6, so he might as well make it now.

[diagram]
An important move. Black has to choose this structure to prevent e4-e5. It is a sad way to play, but with the manoeuvre ... tllf8-e6-d4 coming, White will not have a great advantage. If White could get his knight to f5, things would be hunky-dory, but there is no express route to make it happen. I have analysed this position some more and with a few good moves, Black is okay. 20 ... .Bc5 This is a must. If White is allowed to play f2-f4 and keep his big centre and the two bishops, his chances will be high.

[diagram]
At this point White can no longer keep the two bishops, but has to accept the exchange of what is probably his best piece. In return I was able to transform the position into an endgame where Black has a small weakness and has knight against bishop. It is certainly not a lot and my feeling during the game was that the position was definitely defendable. 21 .hc5 '!Rxc5 22.tlld5 The concrete approach.

Black has to play 26 ...gbs. White's position is pleasant, though his advantage is modest. I should probably admit that I was planning to reply 23.Wfxe4, which is less dangerous. On the other hand, it is very dangerous for Black to enter these complications. If something were to go wrong, he would find himself simply lost. So it is very natural to go for liquidation as Laurent did. Sure, he has a slightly worse pawn structure, but on the other hand he has control of the d-line. In my opinion, Black's position in the game looks more defendable than the alternatives.

The remaining pawns are still split and we should not forget that the doubled f-pawns are useful defenders in a number of endgames. For example, were we to exchange minor pieces and remove all pawns from the queenside, White would have no winning chances to speak of, despite having an extra pawn.

26.f.3 lNe6 27.@f'l

The way I understood this ending - which proved to be correct - is that Black will have to make committal decisions, while White can manoeuvre around, waiting for a chance.

In the game Black decided to do nothing and just wait. Although it is probably still sufficient, I do not think it was a very practical choice. It is of course worth checking: 27 ... llld4 The most challenging option seems to be:

White is making miniscule progress and actually has a slight advantage here, which only means that Black has to play more accurately than White in order to keep the balance. 30 ...h6 Black continues his waiting strategy. It is too late for 30 ...c5, as White plays 3 l .f5, winning a pawn.

If Black just waits, it is possible to make progress. For example: 3 l ...gd8 32.ga4!? a6

it is not much, White has managed to improve his position slightly. If you want to improve your ability in playing such positions, I can recommend a close study of Karpov's and Carlsen's games. 32 . .Bg4 gds 33.b4 Minor improvements have combined to form a clear improvement of the position compared to ten moves ago. Black is waiting and since White is not under the illusion that he will be able to win quickly, he simply improves his position slowly.

Is the bishop better placed on this diagonal? During the game I thought so, but of course it is hard to say for certain. To some extent I am using a simple technique: move the pieces around, probing for weaknesses. The idea that we can see all the possible plans and cricks from the beginning may be emotionally attractive, but it is not in line with experience. Things will show up that we did not consider. 36 ... llid4 36 ... llic7 37.Ei:d3 Ei:c8 38.a4 is also a small further improvement for White. Black's position is unpleasant, but should still be defendable. But from where we started out, unpleasant is a big step in the right direction. Who is to say chat this will not be the direction of travel for the rest of the game? I know I have said it elsewhere in this book, but my editor has assured me chat repeating important points will only help the reader to appreciate chem, so here I go again: Chess is a game and the practical dimension should not be underestimated. The evaluation of pleasant/ unpleasant is often more useful than +0.73 or whatever the engine is saying. How difficult is the posmon to play in practice? That is what will determine the result, more than any computer evaluation.

[diagram]
This forces matters in a situation where neither player has enough time to determine the consequences of the various pawn endings. This is a sensible practical decision, as all the responsibiliry lies on Black to find the right moves - and this without the knowledge we have in hindsight, chat there actually is a way to hold. During the game I was thinking that this would lead to a "slighcly better pawn ending". Pawn endings have four possible outcomes: winning, losing, drawn or a transition into a queen ending. But as always, an advantage means chat the position is easier to play as much as anything. With 37.i.a4 White could continue to put slight pressure on Black, but is unlikely to pose as many problems to the opponent as the move played in the game does.

[diagram]
37 ... llie6? The pawn ending is rather complicated and the following variations are of course the product of computer analysis and not my own Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 263 speculations during the game. For this reason I have chosen to give the moves with few notes. Pawn endings are very concrete and in this case correct play leads to a draw. 37 ... lllxb3! Though clearly it was possible to choose the wrong pawn ending with little time left on the clock, this is not the most challenging moment.

38.gxd8

38.gxb3 gd l is fine for Black of course.

38 ... 'iif xd8 39.axb3 39 ...h5!! This is the first of a series of stunning moves that Black would have to find in order to save the game. 39 ...'iif e?? 40.g4 wins for White. The idea is to play h4-h5 and keep options open on the far kingside. Later on he can push with e4- e5 and break up the centre, before heading for the queenside with the king.

Qe7 44.h4 Qd7 45.a4 1-0 Conclusion The advantage in chess may take a number of different forms: development, space, material, pawn structure, king safety and so on. To make the most of a favourable position may well require a trade of one type of advantage for another, and the process may have to be repeated several times before victory can be achieved. The overall principle of Transformation of Advantages is easy to understand, but judging when and how to do so is one of the most difficult aspects of chess. There are numerous possibilities and this chapter has by no means tried to list them all; however, I hope I have gone some way towards illustrating the spirit and the mechanics of transformation in a way that benefits the reader.

Appendix I Cannot Leave My House! Interview with Jacob Aagaard - 2012 In conversation with Vishy

266 Positional Decision Making in Chess

Hi Boris, how are you doing? I am doing okay. I am still very tired, but it should get better. How has the reaction been in Israel? It is something unbelievable; I cannot leave the house! I go onto the street and people stop me. When you enter my city there is a billboard saying, "For us you are the champion." It is unbelievable; I really cannot understand it. I went out this morning and I could not walk more than a few metres between people stopping to greet me. Let us start with the obvious question - what is your overall impression of the match? It was a great moment for me. I really enjoyed it and I woke up every day thinking, 'What a great day this is - I am going to play another game.' So I am full of very positive emotions. I prepared for months and you saw that I chose some new openings and I changed the attitude in my game. I am happy that I managed to put most of the things I prepared into practice. It looked to me as ifyou were trying to either take the initiative or at least prevent Anand from taking the initiative. Kind 0£ It is very difficult to face Anand when he has the initiative. He is the greatest player of our time. So, yes, it was my strategy not to let him get the initiative. Let us go through the critical moments in the match. Maybe we can start with you choosing the moments you found critical in the match. You know it is hard for me to decide on this, as I was focusing on each game separately. But the decisive games were of course always critical. And of course Game 3 where I was lucky to escape. In Game 3 there were some commentators who felt that Anand did not have the ability to concentrate fully at this critical moment. What is your opinion on this?

[diagram]

37.@cl gxa2.]

I do not think you should judge him based on one mistake. The opinion that Anand is no longer the same player comes from a well-respected great ex-champion and too many people are putting too much weight on this. I find that this opinion is really biased. In the Topalov match Anand made even bigger mistakes than in this match, blundering in a drawn position, but no one said that Anand was in poor form then. But then Anand was of course accepting his assistance in 20 1 0, but no one wanted it in 20 1 2. .. If Anand had managed to get the initiative he would have proved that he was in good form, but he could not get the initiative. The mistake in Game 3 - well, these things happen. I am not entirely sure what actually went wrong for him. Maybe it was some kind of mental black-out. Or maybe chess is just diffi cult? Well, to play 34.d? is not so difficult, but I am not sure it was fully winning. I am still analysing it. To push the pawn was not difficult, but to find the win was. It would have put me under great pressure, but I am still not sure it is winning. After 34 ..J :k5 it is not so simple. I can give you a line if you are interested? I have not analysed everything to the end yet, so probably my analysis is not so precise. I am very interested! So: 34 ... l:!c5 35.l:!exh7 l:!d l t 36.mb2 l:!d2t 37.ma3 b5

Another thing which is interesting about this game is that I managed to play it in the style of my favourite player, Rubinstein, where you have one idea and you play according to it in all of the game.

[diagram]
This is also why I played 16. .Bg3 instead of the objectively stronger I 6.i.xf6. Of course I also underestimated the llie2-g3-h5 manoeuvre. But I saw that 1 6.i.g3 would keep a nice initiative. If this had not been the case, probably I would have taken on f6. Later on 20 ... gabS is bad. After 20 ... E:c7 White has to play very precisely in order to get an advantage. Alex Huzman found the only way to play for an advantage, 2 1 .%Ve l ! and only after 2 l ... E:ac8 White should play 22.lt'Ba4 with the idea llic5. Basically it is prophylaxis against ... %Vb4. 20 ... E:ab8 is basically wasting of a tempo. In the Bth game you based your calculations on 1 4. .. %Vf6, but it just did not work. Yes, but you know, I think the general approach was correct. When White plays 7.lt'iec3 it is obvious to me that you have to do something on the kingside. I should also say that I played this game without feeling any pressure by the fact that I was leading the match. Unfortunately it backfired. I can tell you what went wrong, after: 9 • • • exf6 10.Vfd2 f'5 1 1.exf5 .Bxf5 Appendix - I Cannot Leave My House! 271 White has so many possibilities, so 1 7.Vfff2 escaped my attention.

Maybe I spent coo much time solving chose positions you sent co me! 7his is a beautiful line. Yes, yes. Then I moved on co other moves. So I calculated all of these lines and in the end I missed l 7.Wff2 and the position is so bad after this that I had co resign. It was just a blunder. How did you react to this blunder emotionally? I was pretty calm. Maybe too calm. I do not know why, but I was pretty calm. OK, it can happen. It is a long match and I decided that it would be better just to forget about it and concentrate on the next game; and this is what I cried to do. This bothered me for quite some time, but then I found: 16...Na6 17.?lxd6 Se7 18.a3 Sd8

272 Positional Decision Making in Chess

To me Game 9 seemed to be the most critical game of the match. I probably agree. Maybe move 19 [where Boris played 19.c5] was the critical moment of the game? Do you think you wanted to be too much in control when you played this move? I shall tell you what happened. First of all it was not possible to calculate everything to the end. Secondly, I was fully aware that fortresses are Vishy's bread and butter. He did it very often, even in our mutual games. I knew there was a serious risk that this would happen. But I also did not see how I should continue if l played 1 9.a3 and he simply waited. So I thought, "No matter what I do, there is risk involved." Maybe I would have to play c4-c5 in worse circumstances. So I invested a lot of time trying to calculate the endgame and I decided that with the damaged pawn structure on the kingside and the pawn on a6, I would create another weakness on the kingside and I would break through. I was totally sure that it was won from an assessment point of view.

I was really laughing. And the journalist; how dare he write this? He said: "Oh, I had not time to check the games, so I decided to just write something." Unfortunately the people who watch the games do not have time to comment on them, so we are left with these people making comments that "the games are boring" and things like this. So the people who did not watch the games were unhappy. What can you do? But I can say in this match that we both did everything we could to win the match. But sometimes you cannot get an interesting game. Like Game 5 where I had this novelty in the Sveshnikov and equalized. My assessment of the match was that when both the players are relying on surprises with Black and have an extra halfyear to prepare it is very diffi cult for the player with White to get an advantage in the first few games. Exactly! Actually this was a sort of revelation to me during the match. Before it I could not imagine that it would be so difficult to get anything in the opening. Even though Anand played a side-line it was very difficult to get an advantage, because he had analysed it deeply with computers. You need to spend a comparable amount of time in a line to be able to create problems. Let us talk about the tie-breaks. It seems to me that the decisive factor was that Anand changed his openings and you did not? Probably!? I still have to revisit it to make up my mind. But also, if your opening has served you well? You can play something you have not analysed deeply, but when Anand played l .e4 in the match, he was ready to meet all kinds of openings. So I relied on the openings I knew better. I could have played another opening, for example the Najdorf, and got trapped there. I had to

276 Positional Decision Making in Chess

make a choice and all choices had advantages and drawbacks. So I chose as I did. But even the way it came I had my chances. Of course I had to spend too much time in Game 2 finding an antidote to this interesting idea - 1 1 .tlla5! - which we had not predicted in our preparation. But in Monaco I managed to win far more complicated rook endings and hold far more difficult endgames than Game 2, also playing with increments of 1 0 seconds. I was surprised in Game 2 that you did not give up your bishop for the pawn in order to defend rook against rook and knight. Somehow I could not see a way to get it. I was also hesitating; should I look for it or should I make a fortress? I really spent too much time hesitating. I should have made up my mind more decisively. Could I really have forced this endgame? Yes, a Jew times. But a few times I could also have created a fortress. I would think that a harmless theoretical position would be a better choice than a fortress, which you need to understand But a theoretical position, you just know. Exactly! But you know, I would make a draw eight or nine times out of ten from this position. But this time it did not happen. And Game 3 I would probably win 999 from 1 OOO, but still this did not happen. In Game 4 I also had the advantage, but I should have played more patiently, advancing on both flanks and maybe it would have been enough to win the game. What were you actually thinking when you played :gh7?

1. sys tem atize the the matic plans used and give clear expla nations of them, and

2. in corpo rate the ideas of the featured ope ning vari ation into the pawn struc -

ture that en sues. The lat ter is ac tu ally quite im portant. In the pre-com puter era players normally pol - ished their open ing rep ertoire over the years, and even though open ing prep a ra tion did not go nearly as far as to day, years of the o reti cal and prac ti cal ex pe ri ence brush - ing up one's rep ertoire would normally re sult in a rea son ably good strate gic un der - stand ing of the po si tions aris ing from the open ings played. In the past 15 years, the involve ment of com puter pro grams and databases has made it con sid erably eas ier to pre pare a par ticu lar varia tion for a par ticu lar op po - nent. However, thorough study and good strate gic un der stand ing of the po si tions still re mains a must in or der to cap i tal ize suc cess fully on your open ing prep a ra tion. I still re mem ber watch ing one of Anatoly Karpov's post-mortems, when he had won from some ini tially in fe rior Ruy Lopez with black. His op po nent, slightly an noyed, re marked: 'Here, af ter the ope ning, you were defi nitely worse', to which the 12th World Champion calmly replied: 'Yes, but soon I was better'. In deed, Karpov has won from quite a num ber of in fe rior po si tions (his en coun - ters with Garry Kasparov in cluded), due to his su pe rior strate gic un der stand ing of the ope nings he was play ing. Kasparov has won many Najdorfs and King's In di ans not only be cause he had the best novel ties, but be cause he fun da men tally un der stood those po si tions better than his op po nents. On the other hand he was too stubborn to ad mit that the Berlin Vari ation of the Ruy Lopez was not 'his cup of tea', which ul ti - mately cost him his World Champi on ship title against Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Kramnik, on the other hand, be ing devas tat ing in Cata lan-type sys tems with white and Meran Slavs with black, at some stage started to opt for sharp Si cil ians with white and King's In di ans with black. That adven ture did not last very long. Nowa days he is a mer ci less killing ma chine with his Cata lans again, squeez ing out the small est of mi cro scopic advan tages, while the King's In dian with black is a long-forgotten voyage. If such mis takes are com mit ted by the world's very best, then what are we to ex pect from lesser gods? Through out my own ca reer, I have also scored rea son ably well in the po si tions I un der stood and paid the price for be ing too stub born to stay away from po si tion types that did not suit me. So the rea sons why I have tried in this book to in corpo rate the stra te gic middlegame ideas and the games which I view as im portant into the four dif fer ent types of pawn struc ture dis cussed in this book, were:

1. to provide a complete guide for the club player;

2. through a pro

cess of se ri ous analy sis of the mate rial in this book, to also give the club player a rea son ably accurate feel ing as to which partic u lar po si tions suit him and which do not; and

3. to give the club player who takes his time for a thor

ough study of this book, new stra te gic and also prac ti cal ope ning knowl edge, af ter which he will defi - nitely see a clear improve ment in his re sults. In the in tro duc tions to the four dif fer ent chap ters, I will further ex plain the dis tin - guish ing types of position, games and vari ations featured. I hope that, apart from try ing to im prove his chess skills, the reader will also sim ply en joy study ing the games selected in this book. Ivan Sokolov, Au gust 2008 Win ning Chess Middlegames Chapter 1 Doubled Pawns In tro duc tion In this chap ter, I will try to make struc tures with dou bled pawns eas ier to un der stand and ana lyse, by system atiz ing them into 12 stan dard po si tions. The 12 'Struc ture' di - agrams I have con nected with the com mented games that fol low, re flect those stan- dard po si tions, which are reached the most fre quently. As we shall see, a vast ma jority of struc tures with dou bled pawns arise from the vari ous lines with 4.e3 or with 4.a3 (the Sämisch Vari ation) of the Nimzo-In dian De fence. Apart from the fact that it is good to un der stand these po si tions in gen eral, for those who play 1.d2-d4 with white, or the Nimzo-In dian with black, the com - mented games be low will have the ad di tional prac ti cal value that they will clearly improve their ope ning knowl edge, an im prove ment that can be im me di ately imple - mented in tournament play. Struc ture 1.1 (Game 1 - Sokolov-Johansen) shows a rel- atively rarely reached type of po si tion. I have in cluded this game pri marily in or der to improve the reader's gen - eral un der stand ing. In prac tice it does not often hap pen in the Nimzo-In dian that White gets dou bled pawns while Black keeps his bishop pair. Struc ture 1.2 (Game 2 - Sokolov-Winants) and Struc - ture 1.3 (Game 3 - Gligoric-Nikolic) show what has been for many years the main line of the Nimzo-In dian. Any one who at tempts to fun da men tally im prove his chess skills needs to ana lyse these po si tions thor oughly. In the games re lated to Struc tures 1.2 and 1.3 I have tried to ex plain the pros and cons of these po si tions, which are dif fi cult to play for both sides.

Very of ten when it turns out that there is not enough com pen sa tion for the sacrificed c4 pawn (this is mostly the pawn that falls), White is left with a ru ined po si - tion and loses with out a real fight. Since giv ing a pawn for dy nam ics based on a strong pawn cen tre is by defi ni tion an in tu itive sac ri fice, this is a tricky busi ness and even the very best of ten get lost in the treach er ous waters.

Clas si cal Nimzo full cen tre-dou bled pawns struc ture - White sac ri fices his c3 pawn A long time ago, in Oviedo 1992, I was play ing Black in a typi cal Nimzo-In dian with dou bled pawns and a closed cen tre against some 2450 player. At some stage there was a tac ti cal swindle and I won his c3 pawn. To my sur prise, my op po nent ob tained nice play, get ting am ple com pen sa tion for the pawn, and I was lucky to get away with a draw. The fact that his c3 pawn was not vol un tarily sac ri ficed but ob vi ously blun - Win ning Chess Middlegames dered, played a role, so I found it diffi cult to un der stand that be ing a sound pawn up I had had to fight to hold a draw. Later I analysed the game with Ljubojevic (for the youn ger gen er a tion: in the pe - riod of 1978-1988, Ljubomir Ljubojevic was one of the world's lead ing play ers), who opined that taking the c3 pawn was a se ri ous strate gic mis take, be cause ac cord ing to him I had helped my op po nent by giv ing him more space to move his pieces around and by ope ning the di ago nal for his dark-squared bishop. 'Any way, you are not the first one to take pawns in such po si tions and later re al ize that White gets a strong, last ing ini tia tive that's very diffi cult to cope with. Even a player of Spassky's stat ure once suf fered a ter ri ble de feat against Keres in their match, mis judg ing those risks. The pawn on c4 is al ways worth taking, be cause you threaten to ex change the light-squared bish ops and at the same time the a1-h8 di ago- nal re mains closed for the dark-squared one. Tak ing the pawn on c3 only opens the di- ag o nal and helps White', Ljubo was quick to explain. In 1992 I did not have a com puter, so the above-men tioned game was not easy to find. This ex pla na tion, how ever, seemed logi cal and I re mem bered it. Around the end of 1993 I bought my first lap top and af ter in stall ing the da ta base, one day Ljubo's com ments re sur faced in my mem ory. So, I found the game he had men tioned. Well, he was very right. Take a look for yourself.

This vari a tion owes a con sid er able deal of its pop u larity to the ef forts of Artur Yusupov. A num ber of times Artur tried this vari ation as White, also against 12th World Champion Anatoly Karpov. Karpov scored well in those encounters. This vari ation came as a slight surprise to me, so I was try ing to re mem ber those Yusupov-Karpov games. I did re- mem ber that in one of the games there was a pawn ex change in the cen tre with

13...cxd4 14.cxd4 d5, and Black ob -

tained an equal game (Yusupov-Kar pov, Linares 1993), while in the other game be tween the same op po nents, a dif fer- ent plan was tried: the c4 pawn was im - me di ately at tacked - a plan which ap- pealed to me more at the time.

The fol lowing game is a good ex am ple of a stra te gic and tac ti cal bat tle in po si tions with doubled pawns and a full centre. Anand does every thing con trary to the gen eral set of strate gic rules I have been try ing to explain and to the exam ples I have given so far. Black opts for the in fe - rior open ing varia tion, then vol un tarily strands his knight on a5 with out hav ing any re al is tic chances to ever take on c4. White, mean while, gets his flexi ble pawn cen tre ready to roll and has well-devel oped pieces to sup port it, with out hav ing to make any con ces - sions from his side. At first sight it looks as if, with all those trumps, White should be hav ing a size - able advan tage (as in deed he had). Black then co mes up with a rather in ge - nious strate gic plan, start ing with

12...g5, which is worth study ing and

re mem ber ing. However, the black plan involves a weaken ing of his king and with White's advan tage in space as well as de vel op ment, the po si tion should log i cally con tain a tac ti cal blow. The prob lem with such tac ti cal so lu tions is that they must be de tected and exe cuted at once. Be ing just one move late will al low the op po nent to co or di nate his pieces and the possi bil ity is lost forever. Even though this was a rapid game, it was well played, rather com plex and an ex cel lent learn ing ex am ple.

Nimzo-Sämisch struc ture - white pawn chain pa raly ses the black kingside In these dou bled pawns/full cen tre po si tions, Black has to be care ful not to allow the white pawns too far. If this hap pens, then the black kingside could eas ily be par a lysed and cut off from play. The fol low ing game is a good ex am ple.

Nimzo struc ture - White has an open file and a dou bled e-pawn In the fol low ing game White exe cutes a beau ti ful po si tional sac ri fice. I have to admit that I have played this type of po si tion with white in a num ber of games, and never thought of this kind of sacri fice at all. White sac ri fices the ex change in or der to achieve har mo ni ous de vel op ment and a long-term initia tive, based on his pow er ful cen tre and strong light-squared bishop on a2, which will be come a mon ster. The open f-file and the pres sure on f7 per fectly fit in with this strat egy. Once made, the sac ri fice looks very log i cal. How ever, it is far from easy to think up over the board (for mer World Cham pion Spassky did not find it ei- ther) and very use ful to re mem ber, be cause it can def i nitely be used as a stan dard sac- ri fice in this type of position.

Black has a tem po rary advan tage in de - vel op ment and de cides, probably cor - rectly, to open up the po si tion. It would be a mistake for Black to stick to a 'reg- u lar' strat egy, keep ing White's dou bled pawn on c4 and, in gen eral, try ing to play closed-type po si tions. White has the open f-file, his pawns in the cen tre (c3, c4, d2, e2) en sure cen tral dom i na - tion and prevent Black from get ting any counterplay, while the dou bled c-pawns are actually quite useful here. Even a player of Anatoly Karpov's stat- ure - and in his prime - misjudged the domi na tion White achieves, as so ci ated pri marily with his cen tral pawn struc - ture, and he lost an important game with out get ting the slight est chance of counterplay.

Win ning Chess Middlegames Chapter 2 Isolated Pawns In tro duc tion In Chap ter 2 I have fol lowed a simi lar struc ture as in the chap ter on dou bled pawns, with the dif fer ence that here I have di vided the mate rial into two sec tions. The first sec tion shows several suc cess fully em ployed strate gies to fight against the iso lated pawn, while the sec ond sec tion fo cuses on plans to be im ple mented by the side that has the iso lated pawn. Iso lated pawn struc tures are argu ably the struc tures that arise from the most dif - fer ent ope nings (Tarrasch De fence and Semi-Tarrasch, Queen's Gam bit Ac cepted, Queen's Gam bit De clined, Nimzo-In dian De fence, Meran Vari ation, Ragozin Vari a - tion, Petroff Defence, etc.) and are there fore very important po si tions to un der stand, re gard less of the ope ning prefer ences a player may have. In the com ments to the games, the club player will not only be ex plained the main stra te gic ideas, but he will also re ceive a lot of in forma tion about the openings played. If the reader takes enough time to study this chap ter, he should be well-armed to meet a num ber of vari ations in prac ti cal tourna ment play. A) Play ing against an iso lated pawn Struc ture 2.1 (Game 20 - Ivanchuk-Aronian). Here a clas si cal iso lated pawn-po si tion is reached, where the side fight ing against the iso lated pawn has a good block - ade while the side with the iso lated pawn has seemingly enough counterplay to make a draw. With mas ter ful play, Ivanchuk first quashes Aronian's counterplay and then ex ploits the weak ness of the iso lated pawn. Struc ture 2.2 (Game 21 - Kramnik-Illescas Cor doba). In one of the main vari ations of the Tarrasch De fence, fight - ing against an iso lated pawn, Kramnik em ploys a well-known strategy of cre at ing a sec ond weak ness to tar - get. When the knights are ex changed on c6, Black re cap - tures with his b7 pawn and now, in stead of an iso lated pawn on d5, the newly-created weak ness on c6 is the ob - ject of White's at ten tion. In our main game (Kramnik-

Illescas Cor doba) and other games featured in the com - ments (Kasparov-Illescas Cor doba, Sokolov- Petrosian and Ljubojevic-Gligoric), this classi cal strat egy is ex - plained. Struc ture 2.3 (Game 22 - Jaracz-P.H.Niel sen). In this game an other strat egy is em ployed. Fight ing against an iso lated pawn, White at some stage ex changes a black knight on e4 and af ter Black re cap tures with ...d5xe4 a rel ative pawn sym me try is reached, where White's pieces are better placed for the en su ing ac tions. B) Play ing with an iso lated pawn Struc ture 2.4 (Game 23 - Petrosian-Spassky). In this beau - tiful classic World Championship encounter, Spassky, play - ing with an iso lated pawn, at some stage ex changes knights on d4, and af ter Petrosian re cap tures e3xd4, a pawn sym - me try in the cen tre (white d4/black d5) is reached, which drastically changes the strategic obj ectives. In general, given the fact that both sides have a light-squared bishop remain - ing (the dark-squared ones have been ex changed), such a trans ac tion should in gen eral favour White. However, with the beau ti ful knight ma noeuvre 32...Àh7!, Spassky bril - liantly ex poses the de fi cien cies of the white po si tion and wins the game in style. Struc ture 2.5 (Game 24 - Sokolov-Cebalo). In my own game I em ployed a sim i lar strat egy; at some stage ex - chang ing knights on d5, and af ter the forced re cap ture ...e6xd5, a pawn sym me try in the cen tre (white d4/black d5) is reached, where the su pe ri ority of White's light-squared bishop to his black col league (the dark-squared ones be ing exchanged), com bined with White's con trol of the e5-square, along with the kingside at tack that is devel oped, plays a cru cial role.

Struc ture 2.6 (Game 25 - Kasparov-Karpov and Game 26 - Sokolov-Schandorff). Here, the same cen tral ex change trans ac tion oc curs as in the two previ ous games (Petrosian-Spassky and Sokolov-Cebalo), with the dif fer- ence that now White has a knight as a minor piece and Black a light-squared bishop. In gen eral, the knight is su - pe rior here. Most of the time, Black's light-squared bishop com bines badly with its own pawn on d5 - a light square -, and the dark-squared bishops are already ex changed. Struc ture 2.7 (Game 27 - Beliavsky-Illescas Cor doba) shows a beau ti ful, orig i nal rook ma noeu vre, ex e cuted by Illescas Cor doba play ing with an iso lated pawn. Struc ture 2.8 (Game 28 - Vyzhmanavin-Beliavsky and Game 29 - Sokolov-Nikolic): White, play ing with an iso - lated pawn, exe cutes a d4-d5 pawn break, af ter which a few pieces are ex changed. When a pawn sym me try is left on the board (two vs two on the queenside, three vs three on the kingside), White will have a dom i nantly-placed piece on the d5-square, caus ing trouble for Black. Game 30 (Kramnik-Hübner) shows a slightly un ortho- dox and un com mon idea: White sac ri fices his cen tral (iso lated) pawn in or der to elim i nate Black's bishop pair and gain a few tempi to develop an initia tive. Struc ture 2.9 (Game 31 - Kasparov-Timman). Here and in the fol low ing games we ana lyse an im portant stra te gic idea for White, where he sacri fices his iso lated pawn un- der dif fer ent cir cum stances (mostly by play ing d4-d5), ei ther to dis orga nize Black's pieces or to take advan tage (should Black re cap ture with a pawn) of a beau ti ful newly-created out post for the knight on d4, as well as the open e-file for the white rook on e1, which cre ates vari - ous sac ri fi cial mo tifs around tak ing the black bishop on e7 with the rook. In our first game (Kasparov-Timman), the purpose is to take advan tage of the dis orga ni zation of Black's pieces caused by the sac ri fice. Chap ter 2: Iso lated Pawns

White decides to re main fo cused on the d5 weak ness. The other way was to take on c6 in or der to create and fo cus on a new weak ness for Black. This used to be the main plan here - and it looks rather log i cal to me as well. Some ex am ples:

A) The attempt to create counterplay with 14...Qa5? does not work since the tac tics favour White af ter 15.Õxc6! Ãd7 16.Ãd2! (16.Õxf6 Ãxa4 17.b3 gxf6 18.bxa4 can also be con sid ered)

The dark-squared bish ops have been ex - changed, the knight on c5 is a strong, dom i nant piece and the black pawn on c6 is a newly-created weak ness. Black has to create counterplay in or der to achieve a dy namic balance. However, with out the dark-squared bish ops and with the white knight so well placed on c5, counterplay is not easy to find. Al most all further piece ex changes fa - vour White: 16...Ãg4 17.Õe1 and now: B1) The stem game in this line, Ljubojevic-Gligoric, Bugojno 1978, con tinued 17...Qb6 18.Qc2 Õad8

I have to ad mit that in my prepa ra tion for this game, for my de ci sion which vari ation to choose Kasparov's game played a cru cial role. This decision- making pro cess is in no way con nected to the pawn struc ture theme, but may be use ful for read ers to know. In the past ten years or so, my main weapon against the Tarrasch had been the main line (like in the game): 9.Ãg5 cxd4 10.Àxd4 h6 11.Ãf4 (in stead of

11.Ãe3), lead ing to a slightly better

end game for White. A few months be - fore my game against Petrosian, I had a game against Akobian. In the slightly better end game that re sulted af ter

11.Ãf4, I never had any real win ning

chances and the game ended in a dull draw. Now, fac ing Petrosian, I knew the Tarrasch would ap pear on the board. I had only about two hours to pre pare and wanted to play something new. Un der those cir cum stances it is use ful to check the games of the world's very best. Should the line cho sen by them suit you and not seem too com pli cated to pre pare in a few hours, PLAY IT. In my profes sional ca reer this strategy has served me very well.

14. Àa4-c5 Àc6-a5

Not an easy choice. This knight looks clumsy at the edge of the board, but other moves also do not create the kind of play Black is hop ing for. In gen eral, Kramnik's plan is per haps a so phis ti cated ver sion of the al ready dis - cussed 13.Àxc6 bxc6 14.Àa4, since in the current po si ti on the b7 pawn hangs, creat ing an extra problem for Black, while White keeps most of his po si - tional trumps.

Black has ended up with a damaged pawn struc ture on the kingside, but there are not that many pieces left on the board and there is mate rial equality, so at first sight it seems that Black should have reason able drawing chances. If he man aged to ex change ei - ther queens or rooks, even los ing his a-pawn in the pro cess, he would reach the safety of a draw.

In the sec ond game of the match, Petro- sian had opted for a different plan and played 14.Àb5, with the idea to trans fer the knight to d4 and then to take on c6, creating a new pawn weak ness to focus on. This well-known strategy, which worked well in Kramnik- Illescas Cor - doba (Game 21), did not work here, since Black quickly achieved dy namic play and took over the initiative, never al lowing White to 'remind' him of his weak c6 pawn: 14...Qd7 15.À5d4 Ãh3

A good move, forc ing White to choose be tween two un pleas ant op tions: ei ther to weaken his own pawn struc ture and close off the g2 bishop with f2-f3, or to move the queen to f1.

19. f2-f3

White will con trol the e4-square and later place his bishop on h3, but this de - ci sion compromises his pawn struc ture, even though, due to the fact that the dark-squared bishops are exchanged, it is considerably more difficult for Black to make use of this po ten tial weak ness.

20. Õc1-d1 Àc6-e5

White's pawn struc ture has been com - promised (he has a po ten tial weak ness on e3 to worry about), his bishop on g2 is temporarily shut off and can not exert pres sure on the d5 pawn. His small ad- van tage has vanished and he has to be careful to maintain the bal ance.

In the cen tral d4/d5 pawn sym me try, often re sult ing from an iso lated pawn po si ti o n, Black's light-squared bishop is (due to the fact that Black's pawn is on a light square - d5) al most per defi ni tion infe rior to the white light-squared bishop or a knight. Here are two rela tively sim ple ex am ples that high light Black's problems. The first ex am ple is a game that de cided the 1986 World Champi on ship match, while the sec ond is an exam ple from my own prac tice.

ing a new po ten tial pawn weak ness in the white camp while keep ing full con - trol of the d5-square. This could well be the safest and best plan here, for in - stance: A) The at tempt to make use of the fact that the b5-square is not pro tected and to de velop an im me di ate ini tia tive with

14.Àb5 does not seem to bring White

any thing spe cial: 14...Àe4 15.a3 Àxg3

15.bxc3 Àe4 16.Ãf4 Õc8 17.Àd2

Àdf6. The black pawn is well placed on a7 and the po si ti o n was about equal in Arencibia-Beliavsky, Elista Olympiad 1998. It is in deed better for Black not to in - clude 13...a6 14.a4 here, since this in - clu sion of ten forces him to keep his rook on a8 to defend the a6 pawn.

13...Àh5 is an other op tion, elimi nat-

ing White's dark-squared bishop but al low ing the d5 break: 14.d5 Àxg3

15.hxg3 exd5 16.Àxd5! (the old

school probably thought that White should elim i nate Black's bishop pair, so in Gligoric-Petrosian, Zurich 1961, Chap ter 2: Iso lated Pawns White decided to ex change the light- squared bish ops with 16.Ãxd5 Ãxd5

17.Àxd5. However, with out the ac tive

bishop on c4 White was not able to de - velop any mean ing ful ini tia tive and Black was OK af ter 17...Õe8 18.Õfd1 Ãc5 19.Qc4 Õc8) 16...Ãd6 17.Õfd1 Àf6 18.Àe3 with an initia tive for White.

14. a2-a4 Ãe7-b4

Black may also decide to elim i nate White's dark-squared bishop im me di - ately with 14...Àh5. Just like in the game, that plan has the drawback that Black loses con trol of the d5-square, so it allows the typ i cal break 15.d5, for ex am ple: 15...Àxg3 16.hxg3 exd5

17.Àxd5! (it is a good idea for White

to keep the light-squared bish ops on the board here, since that makes it eas - ier for him to develop the initiative. White has only a small plus af ter

17.Ãxd5 Ãxd5 18.Àxd5 - it should

be noted that should Black choose for this plan, then he is better off to im - ple ment it with his pawn on a7, as in the game Gligoric-Petrosian)

17...Ãd6 18.Õfd1.

Here it also ap pears rather dif fi cult for Black to neu tral ize White's initia tive.

Black wants to put his knight on c4 and shut off the white bishop. The other pos si bil ity was 16...b4, in which case, as previ ously seen in the com ment re- lated to 11...b5, White would be slightly better due to the weak ness of the c5-square after 17.Àa4 bxa3

Most likely it was better for Black to stop the advance of the white h-pawn and elimi nate some tac tics with

pawn on h5 would now be a new weak - ness and some thing for White to worry about. It is not easy for White to prove ad e quate com pen sa tion here and this may be the rea son why Kramnik never re peated this pawn sacrifice. For in stance: 17.Õad1 Qc5 18.Qg3 Àxh5 19.Qd3 Àf6! (19...Qf5

._._._._ _._._._. Ii._.iIi _._._._. Sac ri fic ing an iso lated pawn by means of the the matic d4-d5 break One of the im por tant stra te gic plans for the side play ing with an iso lated pawn is to temporarily sacrifice it (mostly by pushing d4-d5, or d5-d4 for Black) and obtain ex cel lent piece play in re turn. If this strat egy is exe cuted well, then the ini tia tive de vel oped is worth much more than the small ma terial in vest ment. The break ing sacrifice of the isolated pawn is one of the very important typical motifs in this type of po si tion. In the next cou ple of games I will try to give a num ber of in struc tive ex - am ples. In the next Kasparov game, White al ways had the possi bil ity to quickly re gain his pawn with the better game, so even though it never amounted to a real sac ri fice, the way Kasparov kept his ini tia tive leav ing his pawn hang ing on d5 for a very long time and never allow ing Timman to take it in a con ve nient way, was true 'power play'. Later we will also delve into some ex am ples of the 'true' pawn sac ri fice.

Black re leases the pres sure in the cen tre, im me di ately en ter ing an iso lated pawn- po si tion. This plan has the draw back - which is excel lently ex ploited by Kasparov - that the usual block ade on d5 is not main tained, which means that White has tac ti cal pos si bil i ties re lated to the d4-d5 push.

Com pared to the many other reg u lar iso lated pawn-po si tions, White has a pawn on a4 here (in most other cases this pawn is on a3), which has its pros and cons. With the pawn on a4, the white bishop on c4 is rather stable and it will also take Black more time to put his c8 bishop on the a8-h1 di ag o nal, since ...b7-b5 is never pos si ble.

._.i._._ _.n.iN_. Ii._BiIi r._Qk._R One may won der why White first 'loses' a tempo with 6.Ãh4 and then takes with 9.Ãxf6. Well, White wanted to wait for Black to place his bishop on b7, then take on f6 and cap ture with the pawn on d5, forc ing the ...exd5 re cap - ture and ob tain ing a pawn struc ture where his light-squared bishop should be better placed than its black coun ter - part. This po si ti o n re sem bles those with the d4/d5 pawn sym me try in the cen tre where (as we have al ready es tablished) White's light-squared bishop is al most per defi ni tion better placed than its black colleague. Here, however, there is a rather impor - tant dif fer ence, since White has a mo - bile pawn on e3 and Black has one on c7. Most of the time it is advan tageous for White if Black de cides to push ...c7-c5 and then cap tures ...cxd4, al - low ing White to re cap ture e3xd4 and ob tain the advan ta geous cen tral sym - me try with a better bishop. The problem for White, however, is that af ter play ing ...c7-c5, Black usu ally keeps the ten sion in the cen tre, rel y ing on his bishop pair (the bishop on f6 be - ing well placed). Should White try to take advan tage of Black's hang ing pawns and at some stage take d4xc5, then Black gets the op portu nity (as we will see later in a num ber of ex am ples in Chap ter 3 on hang ing pawns) to play the dy namic ...d5-d4 pawn thrust, of - ten devel op ing a serious initiative. This is one of the main po si tions in the Tartakower/Makogonov, which is also im por tant for a stra te gic un der stand ing of pawn struc tures in the middlegame in gen eral. So I shall give a num ber of lines that are not of di rect in ter est for this game, but serve to create a better un der stand ing of the pros and cons of the position.

Win ning Chess Middlegames Chapter 3 Parallel Hanging Pawns in the Centre In tro duc tion In this chap ter I have kept the con cept simi lar to the chap ters on dou bled pawns and iso lated pawns, se lect ing diagrams that show pawn struc tures (and games) re lated to the most prin ci pled plans for both sides: with par al lel hanging pawns and fight ing against them. Hang ing pawns in the cen tre are by defi ni tion con nected; for two hang ing pawns on the same rank we will use the term 'par al lel' in this book. They normally arise from vari ous 1.d4 ope nings, like the Tarrasch De fence, the Tartakower Vari ation of the Queen's Gam bit De clined, the Queen's In dian De fence, the Meran Vari ation, etc. In four of our five com mented games, the Tartakower Vari ation of the Queen's Gam - bit is played. For a club player will ing to learn the stra te gic pros and cons of these po - si tions and, sub se quently, to ei ther em ploy this vari ation with black or to learn better how to tackle it with white in prac ti cal tourna ment games, it will certainly pay off to spend time on a thor ough analysis of these games and comments. Struc ture 3.1 & Struc ture 3.2 (Game 36 - Fischer-Spassky). This World Cham pi on ship classic re- mains an ex cel lent learn ing exam ple. Af ter the open ing, one of the most typi cal po si tions with hang ing pawns in the cen tre arises. Fischer then exe cutes a stan dard plan, exe cuted by White on a num ber of other oc ca sions in dif - fer ent open ings - one of the main lines of the Tarrasch De fence in partic u lar: first he takes the black bishop on e6 with Àd4xe6, forc ing ...f7xe6, and then he attacks the black cen tre with a timely e3-e4 pawn thrust, forc ing Black to make a po si tional con ces sion. Spassky quickly col lapses un der the pres sure. The com ments to this game also provide a good open ing guide line for a club player in this Tartakower Vari ation of the Queen's Gam bit. In Game 37 (Sokolov-Khalifman) we see White build ing up pres sure against Black's hang ing pawns in the cen tre, to the point where Black is forced to look for tac ti cal so lu - tions.

3.1

3.2

_._._._. Ii._.iIi _._._._. Struc ture 3.3 (Game 38 - Sokolov-Short). In this game White exe cutes the stan dard e3-e4 plan, hit ting Black's hang ing pawns in the cen tre, with the dif fer ence com - pared to the Fischer-Spassky game that there has been no piece exchange on e6, so the black pawn is still on f7. An in ter est ing stra te gic bat tle en sues, show ing how eas ily things can go wrong in such com pli cated po si tions. This game and its com ments are a good learn ing exam ple of this Tartakower line, as well as of the stra te gic pros and cons of the po si ti o n. Game 39 (Kramnik-Yusupov) is an in ter est ing tussle, where both sides demon strate an abun dance of tac ti cal pos si bil i ties such as are of ten pres ent in these dy namic po si tions. Again, be sides im prov ing his un der stand ing of these po si tions in gen eral, the club player will find some use ful ope ning informa tion about this Tartakower line.

._.i._._ _._.iN_. Ii._.iIi _.rQkB_R The stra te gic sit u a tion is rather clear. White has agreed to exchange a few pieces in or der to create a po ten tial weak ness: Black's c-pawn. Black, on the other hand, will play ...c7-c5 and then, af ter a pawn swap on c5 (dxc5 bxc5), a po si tion would arise with two par al lel hang ing pawns in the cen tre. Black is har mo ni ously de vel oped and should have a good game in gen eral. White, on his part, will use the queen manoeuvre Qa4-a3 in order to pin the black queen along the a3-f8 di ag o nal - on e7 -, try - ing to create some problems for Black.

11.... Ãc8-e6

As of ten happens af ter a pawn swap on d5, Black keeps his bishop on the h3-c8 di ag onal, since from b7 it would hit its own pawn on d5. This gen eral logic is ques tion able here, since af ter ...c7-c5 White is likely to take on c5 and then, if Black has two par al lel hanging pawns in the cen tre (c5 and d5), it is quite use ful to have the bishop placed on the long di - ag o nal, sup port ing var i ous tac tics re lated to the ...d5-d4 break. Any how, Black has dy namic play af ter 11...Ãb7 and White has not shown a way to an advan tage af - ter this con tinuation. It is fully playable and I will give a few ex am ples: A) With 12.Qa4 White fol lows a stan - dard plan, like in our main game; rel y - ing on the pin along the a3-f8 diag onal.

An in ex pli cable mis take for a player of Spassky's cal i bre. Did he re ally fear Fischer so much? White now gets a free hand to at tack on the kingside, and his bishop gets open di ag o nals, while Black does not have any counterplay and is doomed to wait in ag ony for the in ev i - table to happen. Black's po si tion is al ready diffi cult, but it could have been better de fended. One way is to try and provoke White to play e4-e5 with the black pawn on d5, so that Black can set up a pawn chain with e6, d5, c4, and try to restrict the white bishop: A) 20...Àf6 21.Qh3!

._Ii._._ _.n.iN_. IiQ_.iIi r.b.kB_R I guess that the main idea be hind the choice for this move (as op posed to

7. b2-b3

The most com mon move here, since Black does not have ...e6-e5. White can also opt for 7.Ãd3, but then Black has the op portu nity to try and prove that his bishop is well-placed on e7 by play - ing 7...c5, and af ter 8.O-O cxd4 9.exd4 dxc4 10.Ãxc4 O-O 11.Õd1 Àb6

7. ... b7-b6

In the ab sence of the ...e6-e5 break, Black has to develop his light-squared bishop to b7. We also have this type of line with the black bishop on d6 in - stead of e7, and again this looks (to me at least) like the more natu ral devel op - ment.

Pin ning the d7 knight and in creas ing the pres sure on the d5 pawn (the c5 pawn is well de fended and can not be hit for the time being) is a stan dard plan here and it is the correct way to pro ceed. One of the stan dard stra te gic plans in these po si tions is 14.e4. The idea is to force ...d5-d4 (in case of a mas sive swap on e4, Black's c5 pawn would re- main rather weak and easy to target) and then trans fer the c3 knight via d2 to c4 and reach the con stel lation Ãd3/Àc4; or to leave that knight on d2, put the bishop on c4 and transfer the other knight via e1 to d3 with the con stel la tion Àd2/Àd3/Ãc4, tak ing advan tage of the block ade on d3 and c4 and, af ter that block ade is established, start advanc ing the e- and f-pawns (f2-f4 and e4-e5). The problem for White is that Black gets space and pos si bil i ties for a kingside at tack. Moreover, the idea out - lined above is dif fi cult to exe cute, for ex am ple: 14...d4 (Black also gets good counterplay in the event of 14...c4

This is con sid ered to be the start ing po - si ti on of the vari ation. One may won der what White's idea could be here? Af ter all, Black has the bishop pair, the dark-squared bishop in partic u lar be ing well placed on f6, and with his last move ...c7-c5 Black even gets some pres sure on White's cen tral pawn d4. Well, White's main idea in this vari a - tion is to force a swap on d4 and end up play ing with a favour able d4/d5 pawn sym me try in the cen tre, where his light-squared bishop on d3 is su pe rior to its col league on b7, an idea we have al ready seen in a num ber of games in Chap ter 2 on the Iso lated Pawn. If White's idea is well exe cuted, he will have a small, last ing advantage.

12. ... Àb8-a6

With the text Black wants to avoid the afore men tioned ex change on d4 and keep the ten sion in the cen tre - which is a rea son able plan in gen eral. How - ever, the black knight is a bit clumsy on a6, and the text move is con sid ered to be one of the side lines. The po si tion is in ter est ing from a stra- te gic pro spec tive. It re quires both sides to be on the alert for cen tral ex changes, be cause three dif fer ent pawn struc tures may eas ily arise here: with an iso lated pawn, with cen tral pawn sym me try, or with hang ing pawns in the cen tre. For a better un der stand ing of the pros and cons of the po si ti o n I shall give a few lines. A) 12...Àd7 is con sid ered to be the main line. Quite some time ago, in Biel 1989, I had a game against Hellers which con tin ued 13.Ãf5, in creas ing the pres sure on Black's cen tral pawns and try ing to force Black to make a de- ci sion in the cen tre. 13.Ãb1 has also been tried, but this al lows Black to continue nor mal de vel op ment with

15.Ãd3 Ãg7 16.Qb3 (White has

slight pres sure on d5, his d3 bishop is con sid er ably better placed than its black coun terpart, and White's f3 knight is likely to en ter on e5. Black, however, has a strong bishop on g7 and his pres- sure along the a1-h8 diag o nal can be an im portant source of counterplay)

This is one of the typ i cal po si tions with the hang ing pawns in the cen tre-struc - ture.

Black's c5 pawn is also rather weak. The po si ti on is ob jec - tively better for White, but ex act play is needed. Black has the bishop pair (both of them are work ing now) and a po ten - tially strong passed d-pawn, so - as we are about to see - the tables can turn quickly. Please note that this pawn struc ture is far better for White than the simi lar one dis cussed in the previ ous game Soko- lov- Khalifman, where I sug gest 14.e4 in the com ments, in stead of the game move 14.Ãf5.

Chap ter 3: Par al lel Hang ing Pawns in the Cen tre

13. ... Àe4xg3

Black de cides to elim i nate White's dark-squared bishop. However, given the fact that the white knight on c3 ex - erts pres sure on Black's d5 pawn and White's g3 bishop is not caus ing any par ticu lar trouble at the mo ment, Black can keep the knight on e4 (keep ing the op tion of ex chang ing White's c3 knight at any mo ment) and main tain ten sion in the cen tre by play ing, for ex am ple,

13...Qc8, as in our next featured game.

Let me give a short survey of the op - tions in this position. A) 13...cxd4?! (the wrong plan. Black vol untarily rel eases the tension in the cen tre, giv ing White a free hand to take advantage of his well-placed pieces)

14.Ãxe4! (instead of play ing an iso lated

pawn-po si tion, White prefers a favour - able sym me try) 14...dxe4 15.Àxd4. White con trols the d-file, his knight is ex cel lently placed on d4, his bishop is work ing well on g3 and Black's b7 bishop is pas sive, hit ting its own pawn on e4. All in all, White is clearly better; B) 13...Àdf6 14.dxc5! (chang ing the pawn struc ture and creat ing an iso lated pawn on d5 for Black, while the white weak ness on c3 will hardly be felt)

If I am not mis taken, this in terest ing idea was invented by Short and in troduced into prac tice in this game. Black wants to put his d7 knight on f6 and be able to re- capture on c5 with his b6 pawn (which is why he moves his queen away from the d-file pin). Also, after ...Àdf6 the black queen can be transferred to e6, which is one of the best squares for the queen in these posi tions. T_D_.tM_ jL_SlJj. .j._._.j _.jJ_._. ._.iS_._ _.nBiNb.

signed in Sargissian-Halkias, Antalya Ech 2004. The way Sargissian suf fered this terri ble de feat in this game is not that uncom - mon for white players in such po si tions. Rather of ten, the side play ing against hang ing pawns in the cen tre, in stead of con cen trating on the e3-e4 pawn break or straight pressure on Black's c5 or d5 pawns (mostly c5) makes the mis take of be liev ing that a sense less shuf fling of pieces will for some rea son make one of Black's hang ing pawns weak by it self, and will force Black onto the de fen sive. In the mean time, Black will naturally use his space advan tage to ei ther prepare a suc cess ful ...d5-d4 break - as in our main game Lautier-Short - or - as in Halkias's case - a kingside attack.

And White re signed. Chap ter 3: Par al lel Hang ing Pawns in the Cen tre Chapter 4 Pawn Ma jority in the Centre In tro duc tion In this chap ter I have sys tem atized the struc tures and games slightly dif fer ently com - pared to the previ ous three chap ters, since the vari ous the matic ideas for both sides of ten must be con sid ered and fi nally cho sen, de pend ing on the pecu liari ties of the po si ti o n. Therefore, 7 structures are given on the fol low ing pages, re lated to the the matic ideas. Five com mented games then fol low, and of ten, in one game or its com ments, we en coun ter differ ent the matic ideas. The reader may find that I am per haps a lit tle bi ased, favouring the side play ing with the pawn ma jority. This opin ion could be correct, given the fact that I am a 1.d4 player, and through out my ca reer I have mostly played on the side with the pawn ma - jority in the centre. For a club player, apart from the fact that he will en hance his un der stand ing of the matic ideas, the five se lected games also offer an ex cel lent guide to the ope ning vari ations featured, and if you take time to study the ma te rial se ri ously, the knowl - edge you ac quire can be very valu able in tournament play. Game 41 (Spassky-Petrosian) is a guide to one of the main lines of the Semi-Tarrasch, fea tur ing clas sic and con tem po rary games. Game 44 (Sokolov-Howell) explains an in ter est ing side line of the Grünfeld In - dian and in cludes some previ ously un published analy sis of this game by the author. The games 42 (Kasparov-Najdorf), 43 (Galliamova-Tiviakov) and 45 (Sokolov- Polgar) all feature the Petrosian Vari ation of the Queen's In dian, a vari ation that the young Kasparov built a con sid er able part of his suc cess on al most 30 years ago. This partic u lar vari ation has also served me very well. In the com ments to these games I give the relevant stra te gic plans, im portant games, per sonal opinions and analyses. Struc ture 4.1 is a reg u lar start ing po si ti on with a pawn ma jority in the cen tre.

The pawn struc ture we have here is sim i lar to the one in the Petrosian Vari a - tion of the Queen's In dian, which we will see in the games Kasparov-Najdorf, Gallia mova-Tiviakov and Sokolov- Polgar further on in this chap ter. Com pared to that vari ation, Black has a slightly more con ve nient sit u a tion here, since he can im me di ately force the ex change of the dark-squared bish - ops. Given the fact that White has con- sid er ably more space, it is gen er ally quite use ful for Black to ex change his dark-squared bishop for its white coun terpart, in or der to make it eas ier for him self to ma noeuvre his pieces within the lim ited space avail able to him. The other op tion for Black is to slightly de lay the bish ops swap and make use of a tac ti cal el e ment to aim for quicker de - vel op ment, since af ter 8...Àc6 9.Ãc4 Black has the tempo move 9...b5. Prac - tice has shown that, with correct play by White, it is ques tion able whether Black, who is slightly un der devel oped, is ready for such an ac tive un dertak ing. The fol low ing game is a good example. T_LdMl.t j._._JjJ

Since this is one of the typ i cal po si tions with a pawn ma jority in the cen tre, this is a good mo ment to take stock and try to ex plain some gen eral plans. Black is, per defi ni tion, go ing to de - velop his bishop to b7, where it will be ac tively placed, hit ting the white cen tre. Black's a8 rook will be devel oped to c8, where normally White leaves it un op - posed, since rook ex changes are gen er - ally good for Black. The black knight is some times - as in this game - devel oped to c6 in or der to hit on White's d4 pawn and to have ma - noeuvres like ...Àc6-a5 or ...Àc6-e7; or to d7 in or der not to step into a d4-d5 tempo. Queen swaps and other types of ex - changes are gen er ally good for Black here. White is sup posed to orga nize his forces be hind a mighty pawn cen tre and ei ther exe cute the d4-d5 thrust in or der to get a passed pawn, or sac ri fice the d4 pawn in or der, af ter d4-d5 e6xd5, to push e4-e5, ob tain an out post on d4 for his f3 knight and get at tack - ing pros pects on the black king. If the black knight is devel oped to d7, White also has a pos si bil ity to leave his Chap ter 4: Pawn Ma jor ity in the Cen tre pawn on d4 and to push e4-e5 in order to limit this d7 knight and seize some ex tra space to orga nize an at tack on the kingside. The fact that White has sur - rendered the central d5-square is mostly less relevant than it may seem. White should gen er ally try to avoid ex - changes and keep as many pieces on the board as pos si ble. These are the gen eral plans in the po si - tions with a pawn ma jority in the cen - tre. They also ap ply, as we shall see, to the Petrosian Vari ation of the Queen's In dian, where both sides have dark- squared bish ops on the board. I shall give a suf fi cient num ber of top-class prac ti cal ex am ples to ex plore the above- men tioned plans. TsLd.tM_ jJ_._JjJ

Black can also first develop his bishop to b7, and later de cide where to put his knight, by opt ing for 11...b6?!. This move, however, has the draw back that it al lows the im me di ate 12.d5!

14.d6! Àc5 15.e5, as in Kortchnoi-

sur pris ing that White de vel ops a strong kingside at tack here.

Black's problems, on the other hand, are that his b7 bishop in deed looks won der ful, but does not create any threats at the mo ment; his knight on d7 and later f8 is pas sive; it is dif fi cult to cre ate counterplay, Black's forces are cut off from the defence of the kingside, and therefore Black will be forced to play ...f7-f5 at some stage, which will make his e6 pawn weak af - ter exf6.

I_._QiIi _._Rr.k. anal y sis di a gram A nice diagram po si tion for a good un - der stand ing of the point be hind a stan - dard sac ri fice like 16.d5. White has given a pawn in or der to have an ex cel lent knight on d4, which can eas ily be come a very strong attack ing piece by jump ing to f5. White's d3 bishop is a strong attack ing piece, which may eas ily form a battery with the queen and is per fectly placed on the open di ag o nal. White's e5 pawn has attack ing power of its own (e5-e6) and can soon be joined by the f-pawn (f2-f4) rolling on the kingside. Black's pieces are doomed to pas siv ity: the b7 bishop is merely a pawn, the f5-square is weak due to the e6 pawn be ing moved to d5, his kingside pawn struc ture is vul ner able to at tack in gen - eral, the knight on c4 is do ing lit tle and does not sup port the kingside de fence, and fi nally, Black's counterplay is very limited as well. All this for the price of a sin gle pawn is a good foun dation for a po si tional pawn sac ri fice and in gen - eral, not too many di rect vari ations are needed to justify its soundness. I know that I am be ing a lit tle bi ased here - on the other hand, is n't life it self Win ning Chess Middlegames bi ased? - when I say that in such po si - tions I would al most per defi ni tion pre- fer White. Af ter 19...Õae8 20.f4 b5 21.Qh1 White had good com pen sa tion for the pawn in Gulko-Yusupov, Tal Me mo rial, Riga 1995. All White's pieces are well-placed, so there is no more time to waste.

This vari ation was brought on the big scene by the 10th World Champion Tigran Petrosian, who reg u larly em - ployed it since 1958, and it was named af ter him. Nowa days it is one of the main lines of the Queen's In dian. Most of the time, the middlegame aris ing from this vari ation features a typ i cal struc ture with a pawn ma jority in the centre. The young Kasparov picked up this dy - namic line, stud ied its ins and outs and scored many de ci sive vic tories with it, tak ing ad van tage of his ex cel lent feel ing for White's attack ing po ten tial, which is stored behind his cen tral pawn majority. The po si tional idea be hind 4.a3 is a rather simple, straightfor ward fight for the cen tral squares d5 and e4. Con - cretely, the move prevents the Ãb4 pin.

A good mo ment to take stock and com - pare this po si tion to the previ ous Semi- Tarrasch game. The pawn struc ture is the same, but the dif fer ence is that here the dark-squared bish ops are still on the board. In my opin ion, in gen eral this should be favour able for White, since: - Black has con sid er ably less space to ma noeuvre his pieces; - Black queen sorties (to f6) are not pos si ble; - In the event of a cen tral pawn block ade (after d4-d5 and e6-e5), it is, in gen eral, pos i tive for White to have the dark- squared bish ops on the board. Should a black pawn appear on h6, White may get sac ri fi cial motifs with Ãxh6 and, in gen - eral, in many lines White simply has one more piece for his kingside attack. The plus for Black - perhaps the only one - is the fact that the ...f7-f5 idea, to under - mine White's pawn cen tre and take con - trol of the d5-square, is much eas ier to exe cute with the dark-squared bish ops still present.

Win ning Chess Middlegames The pawn struc ture is the same as in our pre vi ous game Kasparov-Najdorf, with the dif fer ence that Black's knight is now devel oped on d7 in stead of c6. The advan tage of this is that it can be trans- ferred to f6 or, in some lines (should ...e6-e5, d4-d5 ma te ri al ize), to c5, the c-file re mains open and the rook can some times en ter via c3. Moreover, White's d4-d5 break does not come with tempo. The dis advan tage is that White's d4 pawn is not attacked.

Tiviakov does not have the best ex pe ri - ences with Galliamova in this line. In their mini-match in Elista, in the previ - ous game where Galliamova played White, Tiviakov chose 12...Õc8 and let's see what hap pened:

Should it be f1/d1, or e1/d1, or d1/a1, or maybe d1/c1? Former World Cham - pion Anatoly Karpov, in his prime, had a fan tas tic natu ral feel ing for these de ci - sions. The course of the game would in - vari ably prove that his rooks had been put on the best squares from the very beginning. In this par tic u lar sit u a tion I be lieve that White's f1 rook should stay on f1 in or - der to sup port the pawn push f2-f4, while the only ques tion, in my opin ion, remains what is the best square for the other rook.

This has some pluses: White's d4 pawn is easier attacked and also the black king is better protected against dif ferent sorts of di rect attacks. The minus is that, should White be on time with the pawn push h2-h4-h5 - and most of the time he is - Black's kingside may quickly be - come vul ner a ble to at tack.

_._.qN_I I_D_.iI_ _._._.k. anal y sis di a gram This is the kind of po si ti on I wanted to reach. White's d5 pawn is strong, well-de fended and not easy to block; in stead of a strong knight on d6, Black may have a lousy blocker in the bishop on d7. Furthermore, Black may have problems de fend ing his e5 pawn should the f6 pawn be ex changed, and Black's king is very vul ner able; as will be shown in a num ber of lines, the king has no de fend ers at all, while White's queen + knight are a deadly at tack ing duo.

Win ning Chess Middlegames Through out my ca reer I have regu larly em ployed the Petrosian Vari ation with white as my main weapon against the Queen's In dian. In the be gin ning of the year 2002 I spent some ex tra ef fort study ing this line and the middlegame po si tions aris ing from it. Such ef forts usu ally pay off and in deed, in the 2002-2005 pe riod I scored well with this line and played a num ber of in ter- est ing games. In my com ments to this game I shall also give a few other interesting examples.

This is the other main move in the top i - cal Petrosian Vari ation. 7.e3 we have stud ied in Kasparov-Najdorf (Game 42) and in Galliamova-Tiviakov (Game 43). White's idea is simple - he wants to play e2-e4 in one move. However, later on the white queen mostly moves to e2 and normally we get either a trans po si - tion, or po si tions very simi lar to those af ter 7.e3. One of the rea sons that

7.Qc2 is more fre

quently played than

7.e3 nowa days, is that white players

have problems to find an advan tage in the line 7.e3 g6. 7.Qc2, however, gives Black an ex tra pos si bil ity in the line with 8...c5 - see Sokolov-Kramnik, the comments to 8...Ãe7. Ts.dMl.t jLj._JjJ .j._J_._

His king is still stuck on e8.

Chap ter 4: Pawn Ma jor ity in the Cen tre Black first wants to place a rook on d8, hit ting d4, and then de cide where to develop his b8 knight. However, given the fact that the b8 knight will be devel - oped to d7 any how, it would make more sense to first develop the b8 knight and then see what to do with the f8 rook. Main the ory agrees with this, and the game con tinuation is con sid - ered to be a sideline. Most of the games con tinue with

13...Ãxd3 14.Õxd3 cxd4 15.cxd4 Àd7

and here the main the o reti cal discus - sion con cen trates on 16.e5, with which White em ploys a stan dard plan (seen in many of our exam ples) of surren dering the d5-square in or der to gain more space on the kingside. Here the ab sence of light-squared bish ops makes the de- fence easier for Black. Back in 2003, preparing for the Hoogeveen tourna ment, I anal ysed the stan dard at tack ing move 16.h4, which keeps all the op tions re gard ing the cen- tral pawns open. Since Polgar played

13...Õd8, I was not able to test this plan

(which would have been a novelty at the time) in Hoogeveen, but I got my chance a few months later in Reyk javik, against Stefansson:

16...Qa6 (plac ing the black queen on

the f1-a6 di ag onal and freeing the c8-square for a rook is the most log i - cal con tinuation here. On a6, the queen is better placed than on c4, since now Black of ten plans Õac8 fol - lowed by Õc3 or Õc4. Moreover, the queen be ing on c4 could cost Black a tempo af ter 16...Qc4 17.h5 h6

Com pared to my game against Bologan, Black would be a tempo up - hence he would play ...Õf8-e8 at once.

Chapter 2 The Maroczy Bind The Maroczy Bind is one of the oldest Sicilian set-ups. I have selected six games for this chapter to explain what I consider to be the important aspects (strategic points) of this complex opening. Let's start with the 'Classical Maroczy Bind', examining positions that are favourable for Black and those that are favourable for White. In the first diagram we have a position Black is happy to achieve. The first important aspect is that Black's knight is safely placed on the c5-outpost; it will take White quite some time to conveniently hit it with b3-b4. Black's pieces are well coordinated and ready to take advantage of the mobile pawn structure, creating strong counterplay by pushing ...f5. Black can easily take over the initiative in such a position. In the second diagram we have a position White is happy to get. Black's knight is stuck on e6, White controls the c5-square (making it very difficult for Black to regroup), White has a space advantage and easy play while Black struggles to create counterplay. Our first two games illustrate the above-mentioned aspects very well. A straight attack for White Game 8 Bent Larsen Tigran Petrosian Santa Monica 1966

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.Be3 Bg7 6.c4 Nf6 7.Nc3 Ng4 8.Qxg4

Nxd4 9.Qd1 Ne6 10.Qd2 d6 11.Be2 Bd7 12.O-O O-O

13.Rad1

By developing the Ra1 to d1, White aims for a strategy combining a kingside attack with space dominance. Just like in the next game, Keres-Petrosian, the question whether Black is able to secure the c5-outpost for his knight plays a very important role here! An immediate kingside attacking idea has also been tried at top level: 13.f4 Bc6

14.f5 (on 14.Bf3 Black can choose: 14...Nc5 (14...Qa5 is a reasonable alternative)

and now White can opt for a pawn sacrifice with 15.b4!? Bxc3 16.Qxc3 Nxe4 with sharp play) 14...Nc5 15.Bf3. Black has to secure his knight's outpost: 15...a5! 16.Bh6 (Black's king is safe here - White will not get anything close to a Dragon attack) 16...Qb6 17.Bxg7 Kxg7

18.Kh1 f6 and Black had a good position and went on to win in Spassky-Savon,

Moscow 1973. White can certainly consider the immediate 13.b4 a5 14.a3, to control c5, when Black has no dynamic follow-up. For 13.Rac1 see the next game, Keres-Petrosian.

13...Bc6

Petrosian probably did not play 13...a5 because he was worried about White starting an attack with 14.f4 Bc6 15.Bf3 Nc5 analysis diagram

16.e5! Bxf3 17.Rxf3 b6 and now White can afford the violent 18.f5!. The position

opens up and White has a strong attack: 18...Bxe5 (also 18...dxe5 19.Qe1 Qe8

20.Nd5 will not end well for Black) 19.Bd4.

14.Nd5

An easy way for White to get a clear advantage here is to immediately deprive Black from the c5-outpost by playing 14.b4!. Black is doomed to passive defence; his knight on e6 is clumsy here. Trying to conquer c5 for his knight with 14...a5? leads to a disaster after the simple 15.b5 Bd7 16.Na4 and in a higher sense White has a winning advantage. It is interesting that two years prior, Bent Larsen played the same position as Black (!!), getting a good game and winning in the end. His opponent did not go for 14.b4!; it would be interesting to know why, playing White two years later, Bent did not go for 14.b4! here and also why Petrosian did not copy Larsen's play - for psychological reasons?

14...Re8

In the mentioned game, Larsen immediately secured the c5-outpost here with

14...Nc5! 15.f3 a5.

Black's situation improved further as White now made the wrong trade: 16.Bd4? when Larsen showed an instructive strategic plan: 16...Bxd4+ 17.Qxd4 e5!. Though the engines give zeros, in human play Black has the better chances in my opinion. White's Be2, locked up by its own pawns, is inferior to Black's excellently placed knight: 18.Qd2

18...Ne6 (Black could have opted for a good strategic trade with 18...Bxd5 with an

excellent position after 19.Qxd5 Ra6) 19.Ne3 Qb6. Black had a pleasant position and went on to win in Porat-Larsen, Amsterdam 1964. In our game, White starts immediate kingside action.

15.f4

White would have obtained a clear advantage with 15.b4!. Black's knight is deprived of the square c5 while the f5 pawn push is coming, with an attack.

15...Nc7?

This passive idea certainly does not help Black. Most likely Petrosian rejected 15...Nc5 because he did not like 16.e5, but still... for better or worse, this was the decision Black had to take here. It's good to know that after 16.Bf3 Black has an equalizing tactical motif that is useful to remember:

16...Nxe4! 17.Bxe4 e6=.

16.f5! Na6

Black is busy with his knight pirouette, achieving nothing. White probably felt the time was right to move to the execution phase and went for the direct:

17.Bg4

Simple 17.b4! was (in a higher sense) leading to a winning advantage. Black does not have the way to activate his knight. In reality White is a piece up on the kingside and will crush Black in attack!

17...Nc5!

Now Black is (very much) back in the game.

18.fxg6 hxg6 19.Qf2

Probably stronger was 19.Bxc5 dxc5 20.Qf4 Rf8 analysis diagram

21.e5! (note that the queen win 21.Nf6+ exf6 22.Rxd8 Raxd8 only improves Black's

position) 21...Bxd5 22.cxd5 Qb6. We have a position with opposite-coloured bishops, but White is the attacking side: 23.d6! exd6 24.e6! f5 25.e7 Rfe8 and White has an advantage, though the position is complicated. A logical run of play can be

26.Bf3! Bd4+! (26...Rxe7? 27.Bd5+ Kf8 28.Qg5 leads to a win for White) 27.Kh1

Rxe7 28.Qh6 Rh7! 29.Qxg6+ Kh8 30.Qxf5.

19...Rf8

20.Qh4 was possible here, but White makes a principled pawn sacrifice to continue

the attack:

20.e5!? Bxe5 21.Qh4 Bxd5 22.Rxd5

An interesting position. Many zeros for the computer engine... less easy for a human player!

22...Ne6

22...e6 is not an easy decision; after 23.Qxd8 Rfxd8 24.Rxe5 dxe5 25.Bxc5

analysis diagram to a human (at least to me) White's chances look better, however the engine holds this with active rook play: 25...Rac8!. After 22...Bf6 at first glance it looks like Black will be mated after 23.Rxf6 exf6

24.Bd4,

analysis diagram however Black has the defensive resource 24...Re8!! 25.Bxf6 Re1+ 26.Qxe1 (26.Kf2?? blunders into the prosaic 26...Ne4+) 26...Qxf6 with equality. The engine-type move 22...f5 (not likely to be played by a human) also appears to lead to equality: 23.Qg5 Bg7 24.Qxg6. analysis diagram Here Black needs to find 24...Rf6! (White has a winning attack in the event of

24...fxg4? 25.Rxf8+ Qxf8 26.Rf5 Qe8 27.Qxg4) 25.Qh5 e6! and after 26.Bxf5 (we

get a draw by perpetual check after 26.Bf3 exd5! 27.Bxd5+ Ne6 analysis diagram

28.g4! fxg4 29.Bxe6+ Rxe6 30.Qf7+ Kh8 31.Qh5+ Kg8 32.Qf7+ Kh8 and White

can play for a win but the position remains equal after 33.Qxe6 Qe8) 26...exd5

27.Qh7+ Kf8.

analysis diagram The position is very sharp. The zeroes evaluation by the engines does not mean much in human play here: 28.Bd4 Qe7! 29.cxd5 Qf7 30.b4, and the zeroes blinking on my computer tell me this position is 'dynamically balanced'.

23.Rf3

Now Black needs to be careful!

23...Bf6?

This runs into a nice finish. Black's king needed an escape square and it could have been created by 23...f5!

24.Rh3 Ng7!.

analysis diagram Now White has nothing better than to force a draw by perpetual check with 25.Qh7+ Kf7 26.Rh6 fxg4 27.Qxg6+ Kg8 28.Qh7+.

24.Qh6 Bg7

Bent Larsen must have felt great executing his next move!

25.Qxg6!!

Not a difficult sacrifice, but still a nice picture!

25...Nf4 26.Rxf4 fxg6 27.Be6+ Rf7 28.Rxf7 Kh8

29.Rg5

White has all the time in the world to give checkmate as Black's pieces are completely cut off and unable to help his poor monarch.

29...b5 30.Rg3 1-0

The importance of the c5-square Game 9 Paul Keres Tigran Petrosian Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade ct 1959

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.c4 Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Nc3 Ng4 8.Qxg4

Nxd4 9.Qd1 Ne6 10.Qd2 d6 11.Be2 Bd7 12.O-O O-O In my opinion, White has a clear advantage here if Black does not manage to secure c5-outpost for his knight. Without the knight on c5, Black is unable to create counterplay in these positions.

13.Rac1

White has a different set-up here starting with 13.Rad1 - see the previous game Larsen-Petrosian.

13...Bc6

An important moment!

14.Rfd1

This logical rook development is actually a mistake! Black now secures the c5- outpost for his knight and gets the type of position he was aiming for. Precise was 14.b4! with a clear advantage - more space, different plans. Black has no counterplay and is doomed to passivity: A) Fighting for the c5-square with 14...a5? leads to a disaster after 15.b5 Bd7

16.Na4. Black cannot coordinate his pieces at all, and White has a winning

advantage. For the reader to get an idea how bad Black's situation is, I will give the following line: 16.Rfd1 b6 17.Na4 Nc5 18.Nxc5 bxc5 19.a4. White has a passed pawn and more space and obviously should have an advantage here. The question is, how much of an advantage do you think Stockfish gives? The answer is almost plus three!; B) The pawn grab 14...Bxc3? 15.Qxc3 Bxe4 leads to suicide after 16.Bh6 Re8

17.Bg4 f5 18.Rfe1 and Black soon gets mated;

C) Probably Black has to opt for something like 14...b6. White has an easy advantage here and many good ways to continue; for example, 15.Nd5 or 15.h4.

14...Nc5 15.f3

Now Black secures his Nc5 outpost!

[diagram]
Suddenly Black has achieved his initial objective and he has a clear plan: b-pawn to b6, rook moves to d7 via a7, and then it will be time to push the kingside pawns: ...e6 followed by ...f5, with good play. White will be just playing around achieving nothing while Black will execute this plan. Checking with a computer engine may give you a wrong impression here. The engines are very happy with White's position, but in human play matters are not clear. Black wants to (and ultimately will) execute the mentioned plan, so what is White supposed to do here? Well, he has a couple of ideas to explore: a) prepare a3, followed by b4 and kick the Nc5 out; b) improve the Be2 by playing Bf1, g3 and Bh3; c) consider bold action pushing the g-pawn (g4).

16.b3 Qb6

Immediately starting with 16...b6 was the alternative.

17.Nb5

17.Nd5 was an alternative as after 17...Bxd5 (if Black plays 17...Qd8, White can

consider the above-mentioned plans) 18.cxd5 Qb4 the queens will be swapped and White will have an advantage in ending... the only question is how big. Other options are 17.Kh1 Qb4 18.Nd5 Bxd5 19.cxd5 Rfc8 or 17.Kf1.

17...Rfc8 18.Bf1

Black now decides to start the mentioned regrouping plan:

18...Qd8! 19.Qf2

19.g3 deserved attention.

19...Qe8 20.Nc3 b6 21.Rc2 Qf8 22.Qd2 Bd7 23.Nd5 Rab8 24.Bg5

The bold 24.g4!? was an option.

24...Re8 25.Re1

Let's suppose White wants to call it a day with 25.Nc7 Red8 26.Nd5 - well, Black can keep playing on with 26...f6 27.Be3 e6 28.Nf4 Bc6.

25...Rb7 26.Qf2 Bc6 27.Qh4

Black now executes the last phase of his regrouping plan:

27...f6! 28.Be3 e6! 29.Nc3

In the past 15 moves, Black has improved his position a lot while White's pieces are still more or less in the same positions(!). Black is ready for the ...f5 break, taking over the initiative. Note the importance of the stable Nc5 in all this!

29...Rd7

The immediate 29...f5 was certainly possible since Black pieces are well coordinated, e.g. 30.exf5 exf5 or 30...gxf5.

30.Bd4

Petrosian judges that the moment for the pawn break has come:

30...f5! 31.exf5 gxf5 32.Rd2

Black is happy to trade the dark-squared bishops.

32...Bxd4+ 33.Rxd4 Rg7 34.Kh1 Rg6 35.Rd2

Black has attacking potential here, his king is safer, the pawn on d6 is an 'academic weakness' and White's Bf1 is badly placed (dominated by the Nc5).

35...Rd8

Black could have played more directly with 35...Qg7 and ...e5 to follow.

36.Red1 Rd7 37.Qf2 Qd8 38.Qe3

After quite a lot of preparatory moves, Black decides to push his e-pawn.

38...e5

39...f4 looks unpleasant, so White decides to act:

39.f4

How should Black react? Uncharacteristically, Petrosian committed a serious strategic blunder:

[diagram]
Black kills his own bishop and kills his own attack. Petrosian must have overestimated the ...Nd3 jump ideas. Black had to increase the tension with 39...Qh4! when White's situation is not easy as after 40.Qf2 (40.fxe5 allows a strong attack: 40...Rh6 41.Qg1 dxe5 42.Rxd7 Nxd7; Black's king is safe, he has dangerous mobile pawns, the Bc6 is well placed while the Bf1 is doomed to passivity, e.g. 43.Nd5 f4 with ...Nc5, ...Rg6 to follow....Black is clearly better) Black can choose between grabbing a pawn and playing for the initiative with 40...Qh5. After 40...Qxf4 41.Qxf4 exf4 Black may have lousy pawns but one of them is extra. White faces an uphill struggle for a draw.

40.Ne2

As a result of Black's mistake, the situation has changed drastically. Black's d6- weakness is no longer 'academic' - now it is simply a weak pawn (just like f5)! White had to immediately target Black's pawn weaknesses with 40.Nb5! when he has a large advantage. The transaction 40...Bxb5 41.cxb5 does not help Black as the 'stupid' Bf1 goes to c4 and suddenly becomes a monster bishop, while the 'stable' Nc5 will have to leave its post as White will play a3 followed by b4.

40...Rdg7 41.Nd4 Bd7

Now finally White decides to chase away the Nc5 from its post:

42.a3 Qa8 43.Kg1

43.Nb5 led to White's advantage.

43...h5 44.Rb1 h4 45.Rbb2 Rg4 46.Rf2

White is ready to push 47.b4 with a clear advantage. Black needs a strong tactical resource here!

46...Qd8! 47.b4 Rg3!

To come up with this sacrifice, Petrosian needed to envision the pretty mating net that we are about to see. Keres takes a principled decision, accepting the sacrifice.

48.hxg3

White had an alternative in 48.Qe1 axb4 49.axb4 Nd3 50.Bxd3 Rxd3 51.Rfd2 with unclear play.

48...hxg3

The critical moment!

49.Rfd2?

In order to save His Majesty, White needed to return the material:

49.Rf3! Qh4 and now:

A) 50.Rxg3 Rxg3 51.Qe1 Na4. analysis diagram The position is equal but White needs a precise tactical defence: 52.Re2! Qxf4

53.Nxf5! Bxf5 54.Rf2! Qh4! (54...Qe3 leads to a drawish endgame: 55.Qxe3 Rxe3

56.Rxf5=)

analysis diagram White seems to have been tricked. 55.Rxf5?? loses the queen to 55...Rxg2 so Black is a piece up. But White saves the game using Black's weak king and hanging pieces: 55.Qd1! Qf6 (55...Nc3 keeps an extra piece but 56.Qxd6 holds). Now White gets his material back with equality by 56.Qxa4 or 56.Qd5+. B) The less human 50.Be2 also leads to approximate equality: 50...exf3 (the fancy

50...Qh2+ 51.Kf1 exf3 52.Nxf3 Ne4 does not create a real threat: White can calmly

take 53.bxa5! and Black struggles to find a good move as 53...bxa5?? blunders into the simple 54.Rb8+ Kh7 55.Nxh2 gxh2 56.Qh3+) 51.Nxf3 analysis diagram

51...Qh8! (Black wants to play 52...Rh7) 52.Qd4! Ne6 53.Qf6 Rh7 54.Qxh8+ Kxh8.

Now we get a few more trades, 55.Rd2 Nxf4 56.Bf1 Bc6 57.Rxd6 Bxf3 58.gxf3, leading to a probable draw. The 'computer move' 49.Be2 transposes after 49...Qh4 50.Rf3.

49...Qh4 50.Be2

White can no longer be saved as 50.Nf3 loses to 50...exf3 51.gxf3. analysis diagram Black is now only an exchange down while his mating attack continues... still, precision is needed: 51...Rh7! 52.Bg2 Re7! 53.Qd4 Re1+ 54.Bf1 and now the knight needs to join the party: 54...Ne6! 55.Qd5 (or 55.Qxd6 Nxf4). analysis diagram It would be wrong to think that any move wins, as only one move wins! 55...Be8

56.bxa5 Kg7! with 57...Nxf4 and the mating net is closed (56...Bf7? is wrong due to

the simple 57.Qxd6 and if 57...Nxf4 there will be 58.Qd8+).

50...Rh7 51.Kf1

And this instructive game concluded elegantly:

51...Qxf4+!! 0-1

The third game shows a strategically interesting plan of Bent Larsen's which is hardly used nowadays. It doesn't really work provided White reacts well. Larsen's dark-square domination Game 10 Anatoly Karpov 2710 Bent Larsen 2565 Brussels 1987

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.c4 Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Nc3 Ng4 8.Qxg4

Nxd4 9.Qd1 Ne6 In the 1980s, Larsen developed an interesting dark-square domination concept for Black here: keeping the king in the centre, starting with the early queen sortie to a5 and being ready to place his queen in the middle of the board e5-square. The concept had practical success against the world's very best players. However, if White knows what to aim for, Black can get into serious trouble. I will give four examples of top players (Karpov, Kramnik, Anand and Short) reacting as White. Anand was the only one whogot it right! Let's see and try to draw some conclusions.

10.Qd2

A game of Nigel Short playing White (vs Larsen) went 10.Rc1 Qa5 11.Be2 b6 12.0-

0 Bb7.

Already a critical position! What can be Black's problem here? Answer: his exposed queen. White should take action and harass the queen, at the price of a pawn if needed! One 'rule' is that a queen trade is okay for Black in this line. A) Instead of taking immediate action, White played a standard constructive move:

13.f3, and now Larsen went for his dark-square domination plan: 13...g5! 14.a3 (the

pawn sacrifice 14.Nd5 Bxb2 is not clear at all here) 14...Qe5. Due to Black's control of the dark squares, his queen is safe in the middle of the board. 15.Qd2. Black has already decided to keep his king in the centre and takes more space on the kingside: 15...h5! 16.Rfd1 d6. Not being able to disturb Black's queen, White takes the correct decision to push on the queenside: 17.b4 h4 18.Nd5 Kf8 19.Bf1 (probably best was to be consistent and continue 19.a4!) 19...Bc6. Black is controlling a lot of (dark) central squares, however now it's not easy to find a clever follow-up. It would be nice to make a couple of good trades - which is exactly what Nigel Short assists his opponent in doing: 20.Qd3 (the correct decision was 20.Qf2, preparing Rd2 followed by a4, and here we see another drawback of Black's concept: he has difficulty improving his position while White has a plan;

20.b5!? Bb7 21.a4 also deserves consideration) 20...Nf4. Now White makes the

wrong trades: 21.Nxf4? (it was not too late to change his mind and retreat with

21.Qd2) 21...gxf4. White now helps Black with another trade: 22.Bd4?! (22.Bf2)

22...Qxd4+ 23.Qxd4 Bxd4+ 24.Rxd4 Rh5.

Capablanca's rule was: 'Do not have pawns on the squares of your bishop' - have a look at White's bishop here! Black went on to win this ending in Short-Larsen, Brussels 1987; B) Much more to the point was 13.a3!. White wants to play 14.b4, embarrassing Black's queen, and Black is already in a rather unpleasant situation. B1) If 13...h5 (Black wants to play 14...g5, securing his queen on e5, but he won't get the time) 14.b4! Qxa3 15.Nd5 White has considerably more than just compensation - compare this to Anand-Ljubojevic later in the comments; B2) If 13...g5, trying to follow the same strategy Larsen did in the game, White has a pleasant choice between a temporary pawn sacrifice and using the fact that his f- pawn is still on f2 and play 14.Bg4. After 14.Nd5! Bxb2 Black's queen is badly placed: 15.Bd2 Qc5 16.Rc2 Be5 17.Bb4 and Black is in bad shape; B3) Whether he likes it or not, probably Black has to accept White's pawn sacrifice and part with his dark-squared bishop: 13...Bxc3 14.Rxc3 Bxe4 15.Re1. Black's queen is still exposed and he still has to castle, while White's pieces coordinate excellently... White has plenty of compensation here.

10...Qa5 11.Rc1 b6

This game was played in the same tournament as Short-Larsen, but this one was played first (played in the first round of the tournament). Karpov also takes a slow approach.

12.Be2

Vishy Anand, playing the same position ten years later (in a rapid game) did much better: 12.Bd3 Bb7 13.O-O. Ljubo knew Larsen's games and copied his plan: 13...g5. Anand takes the right approach: harass Black's queen and don't care if this involves a pawn sac: 14.a3! h5 15.b4!. Ljubo says: 'if I have to suffer, better to do so with a pawn up'. 15...Qxa3 (15...Qe5 was an option; however after 16.Nd5 White has a considerably better version of Short-Larsen; he will follow up with 17.a4 and open up the queenside, with a clear advantage. The position is similar to the game where White's a-pawn is still on the board) 16.Nd5 Qb2 17.Rc2 Qe5. Black has grabbed a pawn and his queen is, for the time being anyhow, safe in the centre. Black's problem? His queenside will collapse. 18.Ra2 h4 19.h3. Black understands that he won't be able to defend his queenside, so he hopes to create some threats to White's king: 19...Rg8 (if 19...Bxd5? 20.exd5 Nf4 21.Bxb6 Black starts losing material on the queenside without any threats to show for it) 20.Rd1 Bh8 (Black's threats are easy to stop) 21.Be2! Bc6 22.Bf3 Kf8. This was a rapid game, so even for a player of Anand's stature it's not easy to find the best execution. 23.b5! was White's quickest road to victory here (23.Qc2 was played in the game, White went on to win in Anand-Ljubojevic, Monaco 1997)

23...Bxd5 (23...Bb7 loses to 24.Nxe7) 24.exd5 and White wins on the queenside, e.g.

24...Nc5 25.Bxc5 bxc5 26.d6 Re8 27.Rxa7 etc.

12...Bb7 13.f3

Larsen comes up with his concept of gaining space on the kingside:

13...h5 14.O-O

In a rapid game, Kramnik took a cautious approach (not trying to harass Black's queen but trading the queens instead) and got nothing: 14.b3 h4 analysis diagram

15.Nd5?! (this only equalizes) 15...Qxd2+ 16.Kxd2 with a balanced game, later

drawn in Kramnik-Ljubojevic, Monaco rapid 1994. Larsen continues with his plan:

14...g5 15.Rfd1 d6

Now, similar to Kramnik, Karpov makes a wrong trade!

16.Nd5?

The queen trade helps Black here. Karpov probably overestimated his queenside pawn advance, but it would have had been considerably more efficient with queens on the board. Similar to Anand, White had to go for 16.a3! followed by b4, not being afraid to sacrifice a pawn in the process.

16...Qxd2 17.Rxd2

The position is now balanced. Black places his dark-squared bishop in the middle of the board and puts his kingside pawns on dark squares.

17...Be5 18.b4 Rc8 19.a4 h4 20.Bf1 f6 21.Ra2

White's dark-squared bishop is an important piece for his queenside activity, so it makes sense for Black to trade it.

21...Bd4! 22.Kf2 Kf7 23.a5

We now get trades, Black doing well in the ensuing N vs B positions.

23...Bxd5 24.exd5 Bxe3+ 25.Kxe3 Nf4

Black is happy with his N vs B here.

26.Kd2

White does not get a free hand to target Black's queenside.

26...Rc7! 27.axb6 axb6 28.Ra6

Black decides to play actively:

28...Rhc8

28...Rb8 was also good enough.

29.Rxb6 Nxd5 30.Rb5 Nf4 31.Ra5

Now Black improves his knight, targeting White's c4 weakness:

31...Ng6!

White has to be careful as Black is taking over.

32.c5 Ne5 33.Rc3 dxc5 34.bxc5 Rb8

Black's knight is strong while White's passer is not going anywhere.

35.Bb5 Rd8+ 36.Ke2

36...Nc6

Black decides to call it a day. He has a pleasant position here and could have continued without risk for a few more moves with 36...f5 or 36...e6 followed by ...f5, ...Kf6.

37.Bxc6 Rxc6 38.g3 Rd4=

Now we have a drawn rook ending.

39.Rb5 hxg3 40.hxg3 Rd5 41.g4 Rc7 42.Ke3 e6 43.Rc2 Ke7 44.Rc3 Kf7 45.Rc2

f5 46.gxf5 exf5 47.Kf2 Kg7 1⁄2-1⁄2 White plays a Dragon-type set-up A modern development in the Maroczy Bind (and not surprisingly, one the computer engines love!) is that White assumes the set-up on the kingside that is usually employed against the Dragon. Here White has his pawn on c4 instead of c2, making Black's counterplay more difficult. I have picked three modern games that show the problems Black might be facing. In Navara-Jakovenko we see that the g4-push can be dangerous for Black even when the queens are traded! In the other two games, Berdnarskiy-Vakhidov and Caruana- Carlsen, we see White's attacking potential although in both games White does not take advantage of it. A Dragon-like decision Game 11 David Navara 2707 Dmitrij Jakovenko 2698 Jerusalem 2019

Bg7 9.f3 O-O 10.Qd2 Be6 11.Rc1 Qa5

12.b3

In the early days of this variation, it was considered that White was able to force a great ending here by playing 12.Nd5. A) The ending is indeed bad for Black: 12...Qxd2+? 13.Kxd2. Black is forced to part with his bishop: 13...Bxd5 14.cxd5 Rfc8. White plays it very precisely:

15.Rxc8+ Rxc8.

White has a space advantage plus the bishop pair. He has a large advantage here and in a higher sense a technically won position. In a game by Polugaevsky played more than fifty years ago I found a technically instructive win: 16.g3! (White's bishop will be excellently placed on the h3-c8 diagonal; Black has to be careful not to lose immediately) 16...Rc7 17.Bh3 Nd7 18.Rc1! (good judgement by Polu) 18...Rxc1

19.Kxc1 Nb6 (Black has prevented an immediate loss, but in reality he has only

'postponed' losing the a7-pawn and the game) 20.Kc2 Kf8

21.b3! Ke8 22.a4 Kd8 23.a5 Nc8 24.Bxc8 Kxc8 25.Bxa7 (the ending is easily won

for White) 25...e6 26.Kd3 exd5 27.exd5 Bb2 28.Kc4 Bc1 29.Kb5 Kc7 30.Bb6+ Kd7

31.a6 bxa6+ 32.Kxa6 Bd2 33.Ba5 1-0 Polugaevsky-Ostojic, Belgrade 1969;

B) But then it was discovered that Black had the strong reply 12...Qxa2!, leading to a dynamic balance: 13.Nxe7+ Kh8 14.Bd4. Due to White's uncastled king Black has enough counterplay: 14...Rae8

15.Nd5 (Magnus Carlsen showed an interesting idea for White in an internet game:

15.Qc3!? Nh5 16.Bxg7+ Nxg7 and now White is hoping to catch the black queen:

17.b4 Qa4 18.b5 (well... the queen easily escapes) 18...a5 19.Nd5 Bxd5 20.cxd5

(Black has great counterplay) 20...f5! 21.Ra1 Qb4 22.Qxb4 axb4 23.Bd3 Nh5 with approximate equality in Carlsen-Guseinov, chess.com blitz 2017) 15...Bxd5 16.cxd5 Rc8 17.Be2 Rxc1+ 18.Qxc1. A typical position in which the bishop pair is superior to B+N, however with just B vs N we have an unclear situation: 18...Nd7! 19.Bxg7+ Kxg7 20.Qc3+ Kg8 21.O-O - both sides have something to play for, and a draw was agreed in Polugaevsky- Andersson, Hilversum 1973.

12...Rfc8

Black does not have a threat yet. He needs one more move, 13...a6, in order to threaten 14...b5 and now is the moment for White to take a Dragon-like approach:

13.g4!

Black has nothing better but to go for his regular counterplay plan:

13...a6

After a move like 13...Rab8 White gets a clear advantage with the easy plan 14.h4 h5

15.g5 Nd7

analysis diagram

16.Nd5! Qxd2+ (rejecting the ending with 16...Qd8 does not make Black happy after

17.Nf4) 17.Kxd2. The pawn on e7 is hanging, while 18. Nf4 is in the position too:

17...Bxd5 18.cxd5 and the position has resemblance to Polugaevsky-Ostojic given

above. Navara decides to force a queen swap.

14.Na4

White has a good (probably better) alternative in 14.g5 Nd7 15.Nd5 ... analysis diagram ... and again Black has an unpleasant choice between entering into an inferior ending (playing for two results) with 15...Qxd2 or 15...Qd8 16.Nf4 with great attacking prospects for White.

14...Qxd2+ 15.Kxd2 Nd7

White's dilemma here is: how to push the pawns?

16.Rg1

Probably a better way was 16.h4. Black is under unpleasant pressure here: 16...Rc6 (the idea suggested below as an improvement on Jakovenko's play, 16...Rcb8

17.Nb6 Nxb6 18.Bxb6 Bb2, works less well here as White can advance his pawns

more easily: 19.Rc2 Ba3 20.g5 Bc5 21.Bxc5 dxc5 22.Ke3 - White continues pushing on the kingside and has an easy, risk-free advantage; threats on the h-file will play a role!) 17.g5 (17.h5 also looks good) 17...Nc5 18.Nc3. White had an advantage but the game Michalik-Guseinov, Batumi 2019, was drawn later.

16...Rc6

Black had a nice defensive idea here: 16...Rcb8! 17.Nb6 Nxb6 18.Bxb6 ... analysis diagram ... and now the bishop transfer 18...Bb2! 19.Rc2 Ba3 20.f4 Bc5 21.Bxc5 dxc5; Black should survive.

17.Be2 Kh8

18.f4!

White has taken too much space. Black's situation deteriorates quickly.

18...Nc5

18...f5 19.exf5 gxf5 20.g5 would have led to a similar outcome.

19.Nxc5 dxc5 20.Bf3 Rc7 21.Ke2 b5

Space advantage matters. Navara's execution is excellent:

22.e5 Rac8

23.Bd5!

White has simple threat: 24.Bxe6 followed by 25.g5, turning Black's Bg7 into a big pawn. Black has no choice but to allow White to create a passed pawn.

23...Bxd5 24.cxd5

Black has no counterplay. The c5-pawn is soon going to be lost and with it, the game.

13...Bd7

As we will soon see, this move is not accurate here. 13...a4! was better and if White goes for the game idea Black will have an extra tempo. Time for White to go for a Dragon- like attack:

14.g4! a4 15.h4! Qa5 16.h5! Be6

White now faces an important dilemma: should he play for a Dragon-like h-file attack or play for space? He opts for the former:

17.O-O-O

Taking space was stronger here: 17.h6! Bh8 18.Kf2. analysis diagram Black is in a difficult situation as White combines a queenside initiative with a bad black king, e.g. 18...Qb4 (or 18...Rfc8 19.b3! axb3 20.axb3 Qb4. Now is the first time to remind Black of his weak king: 21.g5 Ne8 22.Bxh8 Kxh8 23.Qd4+ Kg8. Now is the time for White to open the b-file and take action on the queenside:

24.Ra4! Rxa4 25.bxa4 and White has a large advantage) 19.Rhb1 Rfc8 20.b3! (Black

has a bad choice here since either decision; to close the b-file or to keep it open, leads to a large advantage for White) 20...a3 21.Rd1 or 20...axb3 21.Rxb3.

17...Rfc8 18.hxg6 fxg6 19.g5

White continues with his attacking plan. How should Black react here?

19...Ne8?

The wrong decision.

19...Nh5 was correct, with unclear play as in the event of 20.Kb1? Black simply

collects White's g5-pawn: 20...Bxd4 21.Qxd4 Qxg5! and White has no compensation for it. White now takes two 'non-principled' decisions. First he helps Black to develop:

20.Bxg7?!

White decided to play for the attack, so a logical continuation was 20.Kb1 as now the pawn grab 20...Bxd4 21.Qxd4 Qxg5? is a bad decision since it loses to the

22.Rxh7! blow.

20...Nxg7

And now White goes for a queen trade, which is contrary to his decision to play for an attack.

21.Nd5

21.Kb1 would have been the principled decision here. White does not need to worry

about his c4-pawn as after 21...Bxc4? 22.Bxc4+ Rxc4 he gets an annihilating attack: analysis diagram

23.Qd3 Rac8 24.Nd5 Qd8 25.f4 and White's attack decides (White's attack does

indeed look great, but how great? Well... in Stockfish language White is on plus five here!)

21...Bxd5 22.Qxd5+ Qxd5 23.Rxd5 Ne6

White has spoilt a promising attacking position and turned it into a somewhat worse ending. Black's knight is superior to White's bishop here, while the weakness of the g5-pawn is another worry. From the middlegame perspective, the rest of the game is of little interest to us. I will give just a few comments.

24.Kd2 Rc5 25.Rg1 Ra6

25...Nf4 26.Rxc5 dxc5 looked promising for black.

26.Rg4

26.e5!?, trying to open up the position for the Be2, was worth considering here.

26...Nc7 27.Rxc5 dxc5 28.Kc3 e5 29.f4 exf4 30.Rxf4 Re6

30...Ne6 31.Rg4 Ra8 was more precise.

31.Bd1?

The decisive mistake.

31.Bg4! would have kept White in the game as after 31...Re5 32.Bc8! he has

adequate counterplay.

31...Re5 32.Bxa4 Ne6 33.Rg4 Nxg5

Black's two connected passers will be fast. Vakhidov brings it home safely.

9.Be3 O-O 10.Qd2 a5

Caruana does not want to allow 11...a4 followed by 12...Qa5 and has an instructive plan!

11.b3 a4 12.b4 Be6

Black is hitting on the c4-pawn and seems to have enough counterplay, but White has a nice idea.

13.Rc1 Nd7 14.Be2 Nb6

15.Nb5! a3

In reply to 15...Rc8, White plays 16.Na3 and has a large advantage - he has more space and it is easy to improve his position. Black has no real counterplay. Now Fabiano switches to the other side!

16.Nd4 Bd7

A good time for White to start a Dragon-like attack!

17.h4! h5 18.g4! hxg4

Black has to hit White's knight, and it would have been better to start with it here:

18...e5 19.Nb3 (19.Nf5?! looks flashy but there is no mate after 19...gxf5 20.gxf5

Kh7) and now 19...hxg4 when White has two good options. Your computer engine will like both: the typical Dragon idea 20.h5 and the 'conservative' 20.fxg4, transposing to the game.

19.fxg4 e5

White has an annihilating attack. Black's Nb6 is hanging, limiting any counterplay, and it is actually incredible that Magnus escapes here!

20.Nb3

20.Nf3! was stronger as after 20...Bxg4 21.Ng5 ...

Magnus does not defend in the best way.

28...Nb6?

Better was 28...Ra7!, bringing on a defender a.s.a.p. Instead of playing for mate, Fabiano now got greedy for material and spoiled the win:

29.Rcd1

29.Rg1+ Kh8 30.Bg4 led to a winning attack.

30...Bxh4 31.Rc3 or 30...Ra7 31.Bf5 Rg7 32.Qe2.

29...Kh8 30.Qxd6?

The final mistake. 30.Bg4!, playing for mate, should still have won.

30...Qxd6 31.Rxd6 Nxc4 32.Rd5 Ne3

Now we get a drawn opposite-coloured bishops ending.

Chapter 3 The Hedgehog Hedgehog-type positions can arise from different openings, but predominantly from the English Opening and the Sicilian Defence. This middlegame book is based on

1.e4 systems, so I will deal with Hedgehog-type positions arising from the Sicilian.

Hedgehog position usually arise from either of two well-known Sicilian Variations: the Taimanov and the Kan. The Hedgehog is a complex concept and things can easily go wrong for either side. I have selected eight sample games that show what to my mind are the pros & cons of these positions. My analysis of these games should improve the reader's understanding of the topic (and of the Hedgehog in practical play!). After reading this book, the reader will understand that in my personal opinion, Hedgehog positions arising from the Kan Variation are considerably more dangerous for Black. That said, many great players, including Anatoly Karpov, have opted (as White) to face the Hedgehog set-up in the Taimanov throughout their careers. In Hedgehog positions arising from the Taimanov Variation, I do not like White's knight on the a3-square - it definitely needs to be improved. Diagrams 1 and 2 show White taking action with a Scheveningen-type pawn storm while his knight is still stranded on a3. The Scheveningen pawn storm White has just pushed g4, believing that the Scheveningen-type pawn storm will work even with his knight still on a3. My Stockfish evaluates this diagrammed position as around zero... so it might work - certainly in practical play. However, this concept is rather risky for White as he may simply be 'missing a piece' at some stage. Similar to the first diagram, White is rolling his kingside pawns, not caring about the stranded knight on a3. Here, however, Black has just pushed ...g5 (which is usually an excellent reaction for Black in similar situations - try to remember it!), and we will get tactical play, White will be 'missing a piece' and Black has a great position in this second diagram. The first game I have selected features a somewhat different position, but shows well the trouble White can face when he has stranded knight on a3. The passive knight on a3 Game 14 AR Salem Saleh 2690 Nodirbek Abdusattorov 2661 Sharjah 2022

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6

Our Sicilian Hedgehog exploration starts with the Paulsen Variation. In this case, White wants to avoid the Paulsen by opting for a Hedgehog set-up. In my opinion, this Taimanov Hedgehog type is less dangerous for Black than the Hedgehog coming from the Kan Variation, and therefore all other examples in this chapter will arise from the Kan. The main disadvantage of this Taimanov-type Hedgehog is that White's knight lands on a3 and needs time to be brought back into play.

5.Nb5 d6 6.c4 Nf6 7.N1c3 a6 8.Na3

I think the Kan Hedgehog, where White's knight is on the d4-square, is much more dangerous for Black. That said, 12th World Champion Anatoly Karpov favoured this line as White throughout his career, so White's set-up definitely has venom. However, in quite a number of games White lost in this variation, he neglected to bring his Na3 back into play. This recent game is a great example!

8...Be7

For younger readers, it may be interesting to know that in one of the most famous games in this variation Black opted for a gambit: 8...d5?! 9.cxd5 exd5 10.exd5 Nb4

11.Be2 Bc5.

We clearly see the influence of the computer engine on chess preparation as the famous 16th game Karpov-Kasparov from the World Championship Match, Moscow 1985, continued 12.O-O (both teams of seconds who were helping the actors missed that White has a simple solution in 12.Be3! Bxe3 13.Qa4+ Nd7 14.Qxb4 Bc5

15.Qe4+, demonstrated by Karpov a couple of months later in Karpov-Van der Wiel,

Brussels 1986. Interestingly, Van der Wiel managed to hold a draw, but the variation was closed after this) 12...O-O 13.Bf3 Bf5 14.Bg5 Re8 15.Qd2 b5. After a tense fight Kasparov won brilliantly, and I strongly recommend the reader to analyse that game.

9.Be2 O-O 10.O-O b6 11.Be3 Bb7

In some opening manuals you will find 11...Ne5 given as the most precise for Black so as after 12.Qb3 to be able to play 12...Ned7. This set-up with Nf6 & Nd7 is very flexible and was played by quite a number of top players. For many years I also thought that 11...Ne5 was the most precise; however, recent developments (this Abdusattorov game included) shed new light on this.

12.Qb3

12...Nd7

A) In his first outing vs Karpov in this line, Kasparov went for a novelty that worked out badly, but actually the idea is much better than its reputation: 12...Na5!?. Garry's idea found no followers due to the game outcome, but it looks playable for Black: 13.Qxb6 Nxe4 14.Nxe4 Bxe4 15.Qxd8 Bxd8 16.Rad1. And here Black can improve on Kasparov's play with 16...Bf6! (in the game Black probably miscalculated something; after 16...d5? 17.f3 Bf5 18.cxd5 exd5 19.Rxd5 Be6 20.Rd6 Bxa2 21.Rxa6 White was a sound pawn up and soon won in Karpov- Kasparov, Moscow 1984) 17.b3 (17.Bd4 Be7 is about equal) 17...Nc6 18.f3 (White can sacrifice an exchange with 18.Rxd6 Be7 19.c5 Bxd6 20.cxd6 when he has compensation but not more) and now comes the important move 18...Bb2! 19.Nb1 Bxb1 20.Rxb1 (only Black can be better in case of 20.Rxd6 Bxa2 21.Rxc6 Rfb8)

20...Ba3 21.f4 a5. White's queenside majority cannot advance, Black has a stable

position and can play ...Bc5 at any time he chooses, trading the bishops. The position is about equal; B) If Black is willing to adopt the above-mentioned set-up with Nd7/Nf6, he can still reach it by playing 12...Ne5 (this possibility was completely omitted by old theory!) as after 13.Bxb6 (13.f3 Ned7 and we have the standard set-up) 13...Qd7 Black has great compensation for the sacrificed pawn - White's pieces are poorly coordinated here; C) Black also has interesting option in a move that has not been played yet at the time of writing, so strange enough it would be a novelty: 12...Rb8 analysis diagram followed by ...Ba8, with complicated play. The pawn grab is risky and probably not advisable: 13.Bxb6 (13.Qxb6 is not even a pawn grab; after 13...Qxb6 14.Bxb6 Ba8 White has to give his pawn back and Black has excellent play, e.g. 15.c5 dxc5

16.Nc4 Nd4) 13...Qc8 14.Be3 Ba8 15.Qc2. White has lost time on the pawn win.

Black is harmoniously developed, White's Na3 is badly placed. Black opens up the centre and has sufficient compensation: 15...Nb4 16.Qb1 Qb7 (16...d5 also comes into consideration) 17.f3 (17.Bf3? is wrong due to 17...Nc6! 18.b3 Ne5 and Black has a clear advantage) 17...d5 and for the price of only one pawn Black has excellent play. Now, it is logical for White is to develop one of his rooks. Question: which rook to which file?

13.Rfd1

A number of strong players have opted for this move. I would personally prefer

13.Rad1 followed by Nab1, aiming to quickly solve the Na3 problem.

White can also postpone the decision about his rooks and improve his queen first:

13.Qc2 Nc5 14.Qd2 and after a few more moves, 14...Bf6 15.f3 Be5 16.Rf2,

the situation is in a way similar to our game. Black did not choose the right plan here with 16...Qh4. Black's planned queen activity will only give White the time to coordinate his forces (the correct decision was similar to Abdusattorov's in our game: 16...f5! and Black is ready to open up the position while White still needs to redeploy his Na3. After 17.exf5, interestingly Black gets good play with either recapture: 17...exf5 / Rxf5 18.Nd5 Ne7) 17.g3 Qf6

18.Rd1 Qg6

19.Nab1!. White has coordinated his forces and is now ready for action. 19...Rad8

20.f4! Bxc3 21.Nxc3. White has well-coordinated pieces, the bishop pair, and more

space, while Black's queen is 'overdeveloped'. 21...Ne7 22.f5! exf5. White has a winning advantage, but, as usual, precision is needed: 23.exf5! (the game Lupulescu-Nisipeanu, Khanty-Mansiysk 2009, went 23.Bxc5 bxc5 24.exf5 Qf6 and was later drawn) 23...Nxf5 24.Bxc5. Now Black is forced into a piece sacrifice that doesn't work: 24...Nxg3 (24...bxc5?? loses a piece for nothing after the simple 25.Bd3 Bc8 26.Qf4) 25.hxg3 Qxg3+

26.Kf1 Qh3+ 27.Ke1 bxc5.

analysis diagram White probably evaluated this position wrongly and therefore went for 23.Bxc5. Yes, at the moment Black does have three pawns for the piece, but White's pieces are better coordinated and his king is actually quite safe. After 28.Qf4 White has a winning advantage as Black's king will soon become a target.

13...Nc5 14.Qc2 Bf6

15.f3?

White is making seemingly standard Hedgehog moves, but probably he was not aware of Black's plan. I do not know whether Nodirbek knew Mamedyarov's game from 16 years earlier, but Shakhriyar went for exactly the same plan! 15.Rac1 Be5

16.Nab1.

Black is ready to open up the position: 16...f5! 17.f4! (White defends in the best way under the circumstances; after 17.exf5 his king would quickly become a target and Black has a pleasant choice between 17...Rxf5 and the more inventive 17...Ne7)

17...Bxc3 18.Nxc3 fxe4 19.a3 (White will get his pawn back, but Black has excellent

play) 19...e5 20.Nd5

20...Nd4 (this allows a relative simplification into equality. A good alternative was

20...a5!? when Black has the advantage after 21.fxe5 Nxe5 22.Bxc5 bxc5 23.Qxe4

a4!) 21.Bxd4 exd4 22.Rxd4 Ne6 23.Rxe4 Bxd5 24.cxd5 Nxf4 (Black does not have enough pieces for a real attack on White's king) 25.Bf3 (better was 25.Bg4 Qg5

26.Be6+ with approximate equality) 25...Qg5 26.Ree1 Rf6 27.Kh1 Raf8 28.Be4

Rh6. Black's situation has improved in the last couple of moves, but White is far from getting mated. White now made a terrible blunder, bringing the game to an abrupt end: 29.Rf1?? (he had to go for 29.Qc3) 29...Rxh2+! 0-1, Naiditsch-Mamedyarov, Fügen 2006. White first loses his queen and then more: 30.Kxh2 Qh5+ 31.Kg1 Ne2+

32.Qxe2 Qxe2 33.Bxh7+ Kxh7 34.Rxf8 Qe3+.

15...Be5 16.Bf1

[diagram]
White's knight is still stranded on a3 and Mamedyarov's plan now works much better! Black is clearly better here. The position opens up, and White is in essence a piece down (the Na3). It is difficult when a player has to choose between different bad possibilities. Salem takes a reasonable practical decision:

17.f4

An attempt at some flashy defence like 17.exf5 Rxf5 18.Nd5 fails as the knight is not doing much on d5 and Black has several good ways to achieve a winning advantage:

18...Qh4 (the simple 18...Ne7 should work well too) 19.f4 Raf8 20.fxe5 exd5

21.cxd5 Nxe5 and Black has a winning attack.

17...Bxc3 18.Qxc3 Nxe4 19.Qb3

White has the bishop pair, will get his pawn back, and if he doesn't get mated he will probably survive. White's biggest problem? Playing a complicated position essentially a piece down (the Na3)!

19...Rb8

The immediate attack 19...g5 was probably even stronger.

20.Bxb6

Stockfish suggests trying to bring the knight into play by 20.Nb1 as a better chance to survive. Well, Black has two good options here: 20...Nc5, keeping his extra pawn, or going for an attack with 20...g5.

20...Qh4 21.Qe3

21.g3 is similar to the game situation after 21...Qe7 22.Qe3 and Black opens the

white king's position with either 22...g5 or 22...e5 - a pleasant choice.

[diagram]
As said, 21...g5! was also good.

22.g3 Qf6 23.Bg2 exf4 24.gxf4

24.Qxf4? loses tons of material after 24...Qxb2 25.Qe3 Nc3.

24...Qg6

Now White attemps to finally bring his knight back into play:

25.Nc2

25...Ne5!

Direct and strong. Stockfish prefers 25...Ba8 26.Ne1 Rfe8 and either White loses his bishop (on b6) or he gets mated: 27.Bd4 Nxd4 28.Qxd4 (28.Rxd4 Nc3) 28...Nc3

29.Qxc3 Rxe1+ 30.Rxe1 Qxg2#.

26.Qe2

26.fxe5 loses to 26...f4 followed by ...f3.

26...Ng4 27.Rd3 Nef6

White simply has too many hanging pieces.

28.Bd4 Rfe8 29.Qf1 Nh5 30.Rd2

Black chooses a nice finish:

30...Re4!

30...Qh6 also wins.

31.Re1 Rxf4 32.Qd3 Nf2!

And White resigned. The 'Kan Hedgehog' Diagrammed is the Hedgehog position arising from the Kan Sicilian (this type of Hedgehog may also arise from the English Opening). White's knight is now placed on d4 and does not need to be improved. Black has just opted for one of the typical counterplay plans by pushing ...h5. I have selected three games here and hope they will give the reader a 'good grip' on the right timing of the h-pawn push for Black and how to deal with it as White. This diagram shows the dilemma White often faces. Black has just pushed ...h3 and White must decide how to react. In this position he should take gxh3!. The silicon brain also tends to take the pawn in such situations. Black's h-pawn push Game 15 Veselin Topalov 2737 Rustam Kasimdzhanov 2652 Tripoli FIDE-Wch KO 2004 We have here a top-level example of Black's h-pawn push and a poor reaction to it on White's part.

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6 5.c4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Qc7 7.a3 b6 8.Be3 Bb7 9.f3

d6 10.Be2 Be7 11.O-O O-O 12.Qd2 Nbd7 13.Rac1 Rac8 14.Rfd1 Qb8 15.Bf1 Rfe8

16.Kh1 Bd8

Both sides have been playing typical Hedgehog moves. Black has not shown his hand yet. He can still choose between all three standard plans: the h-pawn push, the plan with ...Bc7, ...Kh8, ...Rg8, ...g5, or staying flexible and aiming for a timely ...d5 pawn break. Topalov plays another regular Hedgehog move:

17.Bg1

Now Kasim shows his hand:

[diagram]
How should White react? As we will also see in the comments to the next game, Dominguez-Andreikin, most white players prefer not to touch the h-pawn. Topalov takes the same 'human' approach as Dominguez did: 'do not touch the h-pawn, do not risk creating a weakness'.

18.Qf2

White's best reaction was 18.h3 when after the logical 18...h4 19.Bh2 Nh5 analysis diagram

20.Nde2! covers the g3-square and makes sure White keeps the dark- squared

bishop: 20...Ne5 21.b3 Be7. As mentioned in a similar situation in the game Dominguez-Andreikin, e3 is a good square for the white queen here: 22.Qe3! and White is ready to push f4. The silicon brain prefers White. In human play I would say the game is unclear.

18...Ne5

Black's pawn could have continued on its journey: 18...h4. Most probably, Rustam did not play this because he was not sure about the position resulting after the following pawn sacrifice: 19.h3 (Black is at least okay after the pawn structure change with 19.Qxh4 Nxe4) 19...Nh5. Now White has to part with his bishop:

20.Bh2 (20.Nce2? is not good due to 20...Ne5 21.b3 b5!)

analysis diagram

20...Ng3+! 21.Bxg3 hxg3 22.Qxg3 Nf6. The bishop pair is important here as Black

will open up the position with the ...d5 break at some stage; Black has sufficient compensation.

19.b3 Ng6 20.b4?

The right approach was to touch the h-pawn: 20.h3! h4 21.Bh2 Nh5 22.Nde2.

20...h4 21.Nb3

Black now accomplishes his plan:

[diagram]
Should White take the black pawn or should he ignore it? The decision is difficult as White is clearly worse in both cases. Veselin decides to ignore the pawn.

22.g3

In an ideal world (it will not happen in this position) White hopes to preserve his pawn structure while at some stage collecting the pawn with Bxh3. Unfortunately for White, he does not get the opportunity to do this. In answer to 22.gxh3 Black has different good options. The most straightforward central pawn break is a good one: 22...d5 (22...Ne5 and later breaking with ...d5 is also good) 23.exd5 exd5. analysis diagram A) White gets devastated if he plays 24.cxd5 Rxc3 (the simple 24...Qa8 followed by ...Nxd5 is also not bad) 25.Rxc3 Nxd5 (White's pieces have poor coordination; Black has a winning advantage) 26.Rcd3 Bh4 27.Qd4 Ngf4 etc.; B) 24.c5 Nd7 (also better for Black are the positions resulting from the thematic pawn sac 24...d4 25.Rxd4 Bc7) 25.Nxd5 Nde5 26.Bg2 Qa8 - White cannot defend on the a8-h1 diagonal and this will prove decisive here.

22...Ne5 23.Rd4

Here Kasimdzhanov made the only mistake in this game, agreeing to a draw by move repetition:

23...Nc6?

Black has a large, close to winning advantage. Best would have been to open up the position further with 23...b5! and White does not have a good way to keep his stuff together. Black's bishop coming to b6 is very unpleasant for White: 24.c5 dxc5

25.Nxc5 Bb6.

analysis diagram White would love to solve the problem of the pin on the a7-g1 diagonal and also finally collect the h3-pawn... but he cannot get it done: 26.Rdd1 (26.Bxh3? loses to

26...Nfd7 27.Rdd1 Nxc5 28.bxc5 Bxc5 29.Qe2 Bxa3) 26...Qa8!. The pressure along

the a8-h1 diagonal has been increased while Black's queen no longer hangs once Black plays ...Nd7 and White takes. White's best option here is to finally grab the annoying pawn: 27.Bxh3 Nfd7. ...Nxc5 is coming, and White is in a bad shape here, while 28.Qd4 only delays the inevitable. Black has a large advantage after 28...f6 or

28...Rcd8 29.Qe3 Nxc5 30.bxc5 Ba5 31.Bg2 Nc4.

23...Qa8, though less forcing, leads to Black's advantage too.

24.Rdd1 Ne5 25.Rd4 Nc6?

1⁄2-1⁄2 White pushes a4, Black responds ...a5 Game 16 Leinier Dominguez Perez 2726 Dmitry Andreikin 2687 Havana 2011

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6 5.c4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Bb4 7.Bd2 Qc7 8.a3 Be7

9.Be3 d6 10.Be2 O-O 11.O-O b6 12.Qd2 Bb7 13.f3 Nbd7 14.Rfc1!?

We do not often see the rooks positioned on a1 and c1 in such positions. White has a specific plan in mind (similar to Agrest-Nisipeanu below).

14...Rac8 15.a4!?

The standard queenside pawn push 15.b4 is certainly an option here. Like in Agrest-Nisipeanu, White wants to push a5 and Black stops this in an unusual way!

[diagram]
I have rarely seen such a pawn structure - actually I cannot recall any other top game with it! Black stops White's pawn advance at the expense of giving White the b5- square. How important is it? Is White better here? It doesn't look that way. White has the b5-square for his knight, but Black's knight has obtained a very stable post on c5. Black seems to have no problems defending his d6-pawn, so the position is probably balanced. What alternative plans did Black have? Advancing the h-pawn is a standard plan, so let's see how it works here: 15...h5 16.b4. A) If 16.a5 bxa5 17.Nb3, White does accomplish his plan of bringing his knight to a5, however after 17...h4 18.Nxa5 Ba8 analysis diagram Black has adequate counterplay, White does not have a free hand to push his queenside pawns. One way for White to deal with Black's h-pawn advance is to bring his knight to f2:

16.Nd1. Now, if Black wants to, he can also push 16...a5 and have a reasonably good

version of the game; B) 16.b4 h4 (trying to use the fact that White's b4-pawn is not protected and going for a central break with 16...d5 may backfire as White has the strong piece sacrifice

17.Nxd5! exd5 18.cxd5 Qb8 19.Nf5; 16...Ne5 does not worry White as he has

17.Nd1) 17.a5 bxa5 18.Rxa5.

analysis diagram After 18...Ne5! (the immediate 18...h3 allows the nice rook swing 19.Rg5! and it is White who will attack on the kingside!) the position is unclear. Initially, the engine slightly prefers White, however there are many dynamic/tactical ideas: 19.Nd1 (if

19.h3 - White wants to play 20. f4 - Black has his trumps: 19...Nh5! (the pawn grab

19...Nxc4?? blunders the queen: 20.Bxc4 Qxc4 21.Nce2) 20.f4 Ng3! 21.fxe5 dxe5

the whole board is hanging; Stockfish gives zeros) 19...h3 20.g3 (20.gxh3 is possible but quite risky here). analysis diagram In an ideal world, White wants to keep his kingside pawn structure intact and collect Black's pawn with Nd1-f2-h3. 20...Qd7 (Black also has piece sacrifice ideas:

20...Bxe4!? 21.fxe4 Nxe4 22.Qe1 Qb7) 21.Nf2 and now is the time for the central

pawn break 21...d5 with an unclear game. Was 15...h5 an option? Yes, it certainly was. Another possibility was 15...Qb8 and in case of 16.a5 bxa5 17.Rxa5 (White cannot bring his knight to a5 as 17.Nb3? blunders a pawn to 17...Bxe4) 17...Ne5 it is not easy for White to advance further on the kingside; the position is balanced.

16.Ndb5 Qb8

17.Bf4

White wants to take advantage of his knight on b5 and put pressure on the d6-pawn. Anther way to do this was 17.Re1 Rcd8 18.Rad1 Nc5 19.Bf4. analysis diagram The pawn win appears not to bring White any advantage here: 19...Nh5! 20.Bxd6 Bxd6 21.Nxd6 e5 and the Nc5 is well placed while the Be2 locked up by its own pawns; Black is definitely not worse, e.g. 22.Qg5 (or 22.Ncb5 Bc6) 22...Rxd6

23.Qxh5 Rxd1 24.Rxd1 Bc6.

Dominguez most probably rejected 17.Rd1 because matters don't look clear after

17...Nc5.

17...Ne5 18.b3 Rfd8 19.Kh1

Andreikin now decides in favour of one of Black's standard Hedgehog plans: pushing the h-pawn:

19...h5

The alternative was to bring Nf6 to the nice c5 outpost with 19...Nfd7 20.Rd1 Nc5

21.Rab1 when the position is probably about equal.

How should White react to Black's pawn push? What I noticed is that most white players prefer not to touch their h-pawn, and here this is also the case.

20.Bf1

In this and most similar positions, Stockfish has much less trouble 'creating weaknesses' and happily plays 20.h3!. Now, after the most logical follow-up 20...h4

21.Bh2, Black seems to be doing well optically - one knight goes to h5, another to

g6, dark-square control... However, in practice it does not work that well here, for example 21...Ng6 (21...Nh5?? blunders a piece after the simple 22.f4) 22.Qe3! (the white queen is well placed on e3; it prepares the f4-push while also subsequently covering the g3-square) 22...Bc6 23.Rd1. White has a relatively simple plan here: double the rooks to keep Black busy defending the d6-pawn, and then at a convenient moment push f4. Black does not have an easy life here, as counterplay attempts like 23...Nh5 lose a pawn for no compensation after 24.f4 Ng3+ 25.Bxg3 hxg3 26.Bh5 Nf8 27.Qxg3.

20...h4

Now Black is fine. The position is about equal but probably easier to play with Black.

21.Qf2

21.h3 now does not bring the same result as after 21...Nh5 22.Bh2 Ng6

analysis diagram

23.Qf2 (in reply to 23.Ne2, Black has a nice idea in 23...Rc5! and White can easily

get in trouble, e.g. 24.Qe3? Bg5! 25.f4 Bh6 with the threat 26...e5; White's pawns are shaky and the evaluation is minus two!) 23...Ng3+! 24.Bxg3 hxg3 25.Qxg3 Bf6 Black has excellent compensation for his sacrificed pawn.

21...Rc5

Black is getting ready for the typical Hedgehog break ...d5. Could Black immediately go for 21...d5 ? Yes, he could. It does require some good calculation though: 22.cxd5 Nd3! 23.Bxd3 Qxf4 24.Qxb6. analysis diagram At moments like these, a human player often stops calculating and (instead of

21...d5!?) looks for some other moves (like 21...Rc5 in the game - so that b6 will not

be hanging). Black is actually doing pretty well here: 24...Bxd5! 25.exd5 (25.Ne2?? blunders into the simple 25...Rxc1+ 26.Rxc1 Qd2) 25...Nxd5. Black gets his sacrificed piece back, and White is the one who needs to be careful here: 26.Qg1! Nxc3 27.Nxc3 Rxd3 and White bails out into a drawn rook endgame with 28.Nd5! Rxc1 29.Nxe7+ Kf8 30.Qxc1 Qxc1+ 31.Rxc1 Kxe7 32.h3. A draw will be the outcome of this tactical tussle: 32...Kd6 33.Rc8 Rxb3 34.Ra8 etc.

22.Be3 d5!

Black judges well that the central break works and goes for it. For a better understanding of this position it is good to notice that in the event of

22...Ng6!? 23.Bxc5 dxc5, Black has full compensation for the sacrificed exchange.

analysis diagram For example, 24.Rd1 Rf8! followed by ...Nh5 and ...f5.

23.exd5 exd5 24.cxd5

Andreikin ignores the threat to his rook and decides to weaken White's king position.

24...h3! 25.Rd1

Black is fine in the event of 25.Bxc5 Bxc5 26.Qg3 as White has to give his extra exchange back: 26...hxg2+ 27.Bxg2 Nd3 28.Rc2 Nf2+ 29.Rxf2 Qxg3 30.hxg3 Bxf2

31.Kh2 Bc5. Black has suffient compensation for the pawn and is not worse here.

(Of course not 31...Nxd5?? which blunders into a pin and material loss) after

32.Rd1.)

25...Nxd5 26.Bxc5 Bxc5 27.Qg3 Nxc3

The position is sharp, but still approximately equal.

28.Rxd8+?

Most probably a time-pressure blunder.

28.Nxc3 led to a forced sequence of moves with a drawish outcome: 28...hxg2+

(28...Bd4 transposes after 29.f4! hxg2+ 30.Bxg2 Bxg2+ 31.Qxg2 Bxc3= etc.)

29.Bxg2 Bd4 30.f4!.

analysis diagram And we get a peaceful outcome after 30...Bxg2+ 31.Qxg2 Bxc3 32.Rxd8+ Qxd8

33.Rc1 and now a few more pieces leave the board: 33...Bb2 (or 33...Ng6 34.Rxc3

Qd1+ 35.Qg1 Qd5+=) 34.Qxb2 Nd3 35.Qd2 Qa8+ 36.Kg1 Nxc1 37.Qxc1 with a dead drawn queen ending.

28...Qxd8!

Black's threats are obvious, White either suffers decisive material loss or gets mated.

29.Qxe5

Or 29.Nxc3 Qd4.

29...Nd1 30.Ra2 Ne3 31.Nc3 Nxf1 32.Re2 Nd2 33.Qg3 hxg2+ 34.Rxg2 g6 0-1

White pushes the a-pawn, Black counters with his h-pawn Game 17 Evgenij Agrest 2554 Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu 2584 Batumi Ech-tt 1999

1.c4 e6 2.Nc3 b6 3.e4 Bb7 4.Nf3 c5 5.d4 cxd4 6.Nxd4 d6 7.Be2 Nf6 8.f3 a6 9.Be3

Nbd7 This position can also arise from the Kan Sicilian. If Black is worried about White's a-pawn push, he can delay developing the Nb8 with 9...Be7 10.O-O O-O when 11.a4 doesn't achieve its aim due to 11...Nc6.

10.O-O Be7

And now White goes for a plan similar to Dominguez-Andreikin.

11.a4 O-O 12.a5 bxa5 13.Nb3 Rb8 14.Nxa5 Ba8 15.Qd2

White has achieved his aim: his knight is well placed on a5, his queenside pawns are ready to move. White's plan is simple: push the b-pawn. Black cannot really stop this, so he urgently needs to find something. What is Black's best counterplan here? Answer: pushing the h-pawn. Nisipeanu ultimately understands this, but he loses precious time in the process!

15...Re8?!

On this move or the next, Black had to start with the immediate 15...h5! with sufficient counterplay.

16.Kh1 Qc7?! 17.Rfc1

With his last two moves, Black has not really improved his position, while White is ready to push his b-pawn.

17...Ne5 18.Bd4

Black now decides on the right counterplay; however, precious time has been lost. Black is in trouble here.

18...h5! 19.b4! h4

19...Rxb4?? was bad due to the simple 20.Nb5 axb5 21.Qxb4 and White is an

exchange up with a better position.

20.b5!

Black cannot stop White on the queenside, so for better or worse, he needs to keep pushing his pawn:

20...h3

The critical moment. How should White react?

21.g3?

Agrest reacts in a way similar to Topalov and Dominguez: preserve the structure, collect the pawn on h3 later. Correct was 21.gxh3! when Black has many tactical ideas, but they don't work. White has a large advantage. The pawn will stay on h3 until the end of the game and due to White's king weakness Nisipeanu eventually saves the game.

21...axb5 22.cxb5

Putting the queen on c7 was not a good idea in the first place.

22...Qd8!

Now White creates a strong passer on c6, probably thinking he had a winning advantage.

23.Bxe5 dxe5 24.Qxd8 Rexd8 25.Nc6 Bxc6 26.bxc6

Black saves the game due to White's weak king; the pawn on h3 is doing an excellent job.

26...Rd2 27.Ba6

Or 27.Bf1 Rbb2 28.Ne2 Bd8! 29.c7 Bxc7 30.Rxc7 Rxe2 31.Bxe2 Rxe2 with a draw like in the game.

27...Rbb2

The silicon brain will explain that 27...Ne8 was good as well, but the text is more human.

28.Ne2 Bd6 29.c7 Bxc7 30.Rxc7 Rxe2 31.Bxe2 Rxe2

White's king is 'inside the box' and the extra exchange doesn't matter here.

32.Rf1 g5 33.g4 Kg7 34.Kg1 Rg2+ 35.Kh1 Re2 36.Rc3 Nd7 37.Rfc1 Rf2 38.Kg1

Rg2+ 39.Kh1 Rf2 1⁄2-1⁄2 Fresh ideas for White The diagrammed position comes from the Kan Sicilian. Here we see a relatively new concept that will be more deeply explored! White has just pushed g4 and is starting a Scheveningen-type pawn storm. Do NOT confuse this with the first two introductory diagrams in this chapter as here the situation is VERY different. White's knight is well-placed on d4, so he does not run the risk of 'missing a piece'. White's attack can develop fast here! Game 18 Yasser Seirawan Nick de Firmian Estes Park 1986

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6 5.c4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Qc7

7.Be2!?

The text move is considerably less often played than 7.a3, but to me it is far from clear which move is the most precise. Black has two logical options: a) continue Hedgehog development with 7...b6 or b) try to exploit the fact that White hasn't played 7.a3 and play 7...Bb4. Let's have a look at both.

7...b6

A) 7...Bc5, played by Bronstein, does not look inspiring: 8.Be3 d6 9.O-O Bd7 10.a3 O-O 11.b4 Ba7 12.Rc1 White has a typical Hedgehog position while Black looks passive. White is going to trade the dark- squared bishops (a good trade for White here!): 12...Rc8 13.Qd2 Be8

14.Rfd1 Nbd7 15.Nb3 Bxe3 16.Qxe3 Ne5 17.c5 with an easy, risk-free advantage.

(17.h3 was played in Honfi-Bronstein, Miskolc 1963. White later spoiled his position and even lost.) B) 7...Bb4

8.O-O (8.Qd3 can of course be played - probably transposing to 9.Qd3 below - but

White should not really object to Black grabbing a pawn here) and now: B1) 8...Bxc3 9.bxc3 Nxe4 is asking for trouble after 10.Bf3 Nc5 11.Nb3

11...d6 (11...O-O? leads more or less to a lost position after 12.Nxc5! - 12.Qd4 d6

13.Rd1 was played in Shirov-Fedorov, Riga 2014, where Black eventually survived

- 12...Qxc5 13.Qa4 and Black simply cannot develop). Now White can reach a better ending with a relatively forced sequence: 12.Bf4 e5 13.Nxc5 Qxc5 14.Be3 Qc7

15.Qd5 O-O 16.Rfd1 Nc6 17.Qxd6 Qxd6 18.Rxd6 with play for two results: maybe

Black makes a draw, maybe not; B2) 8...O-O 9.Qd3 d6 10.Bd2. Similar to Bronstein's 7...Bc5, we have a Hedgehog position with the black bishop 'out'. To me, the bishop looks more natural on e7 in these positions. 10...Nbd7 (to

10...Nc6, probably White's best reaction is 11.Nxc6! bxc6 and now he can take

space 12.a3 Bc5 13.b4 Ba7 14.Bg5 with an easy advantage) 11.Nb3 Ne5 12.Qd4 Nc6 13.Qe3 Bd7 14.Rac1 Rac8. White now took the bishop pair with 15.a3 and had an advantage in Naiditsch-Ivanchuk, Danzhou 2017. White has two dangerous 'Sicilian pawn storm plans' here (both a little unusual for the Kan Hedgehog). In both cases Black holds a dynamic balance... if... a computer is playing.

8.Be3

The other option is 8.O-O Bb7 9.Qd3

9...d6 (9...Nc6 leads to a safe advantage for White after 10.Nxc6! Bxc6 11.Be3 Bc5

12.Bxc5 bxc5 13.f4 with d-file pressure and more space, Shomoev-Khismatullin,

Khanty-Mansiysk 2015). A) Now White can start a standard Sicilian pawn storm with 10.f4 Nbd7 11.b4 Be7

12.Be3 O-O 13.Rac1

13...Rac8 (13...Rad8? runs into a textbook tactic: 14.Nd5! exd5 15.cxd5 and White

got his piece back - 15...Qb8 is refuted by 16.Nc6 - and had a clear advantage in Khalifman-Akopian, Minsk 2014). Now we have an interesting situation: White starts a 'Scheveningen Sicilian pawn storm'! 14.g4!. White has five pawns on the fourth rank and yet he isn't overstretched! A1) 14...Qd8 15.g5. Now White has a winning advantage. This is a Hedgehog where the Scheveningen pawn storm works perfectly for White: 15...Ne8 16.Qd2

16...Nc7 (breaks of the 16...d5 type sometimes save Black in similar situations... but

not here! 17.cxd5 Bxb4 18.dxe6 Nc5. Now White first wins an exchange and later probably the game with the tactic 19.Nc6! Qxd2 20.Bxd2 Rxc6 21.e7) 17.a3 Re8

18.Nb3 (Stronger was just continuing the Scheveningen pawn storm with 18.h4!.

White has advanced so many of his pawns and yet Black does not have a good pawn break!) 18...f6 19.h4! Rf8. White understands he needs his Nb3 as an attacking piece: 20.Nd4! fxg5 21.hxg5 and White had a winning attack in Brkic-Gajewski, Jerusalem 2015 (1-0, 43); A2) Black is perhaps not worse if... a computer is playing, after 14...h6! 15.h4 analysis diagram

15...h5! 16.g5 Ng4 17.Bxg4 hxg4 18.Nce2. It looks like 19. Ng3 next will be

slaughter but Black has defensive resources: 18...g6! 19.Ng3 e5!. analysis diagram Now White has several beautiful ideas, all leading to a 'zeros' evaluation: 20.Ndf5! (or 20.h5 exd4 21.Bxd4 Ne5!) 20...gxf5 21.Nxf5. To a human player this looks terribly dangerous for Black but apparently the position is dynamically balanced:

21...Rce8! 22.Nh6+ Kh7 23.f5 and it all ends peacefully with a move repetition:

23...Qc6 24.Qd5 Qc7 25.Qd3 Qc6.

B) An interesting novel idea is 10.Qg3!? Nbd7 (the pawn grab 10...Nxe4?! 11.Nxe4 Bxe4 is at least risky: 12.Re1 Nc6 13.Bf3! Bxf3 14.Qxf3 Rc8. analysis diagram Black's pawn defences need to be destroyed: 15.Nxe6! fxe6 16.Rxe6+ Be7 17.Bg5 and Black is in bad shape; 17...Nd4? loses to 18.Qh5+ g6 19.Rxg6) 11.f3. analysis diagram It looks logical to fianchetto the bishop here: 11...g6 12.Be3 Bg7 13.Rac1 O-O. At first glance, this looks like a normal Hedgehog, but my Stockfish is very enthusiastic for White, evaluating plus one!

8...Bb7 9.f3 d6

It is perhaps useful to mention that 9...Bd6? is a tempo loss as after 10.Qd2 White threatens 11. Ndb5 and Black has nothing better than 10...Be7 (10...Bxh2 loses to

11.O-O-O with many threats). White is simply a tempo up compared to regular lines

and here went for the most aggressive continuation 11.O-O-O Nc6 12.Kb1 Ne5

13.Rc1 and White went on to win in Ivanchuk-Kamsky, lichess.org blitz 2020.

10.O-O Be7 11.Rc1 Nbd7

We have our standard Kan Sicilian Hedgehog with the difference that White has not played a3. If White wants a queenside a3, b4 build up he can still play 12.a3, transposing. However, White can also opt for a much more aggressive set-up!

12.Qe1!? O-O

And now White goes for a Sicilian pawn storm!

13.g4!

White is combining Hedgehog central control with a Sicilian pawn roll. Please note that White can also apply similar plans in lines with 7.a3. It just looks to me that if White is willing to go for such a set-up, this is the best move-order and the most efficient way to do it. The resulting positions are very sharp and easy to get wrong. It started as a standard Hedgehog but now the only thing making this a Hedgehog is White's pawn on c4, otherwise we have an open Sicilian where White applies a bayonet pawn roll on the kingside! Interestingly, there are almost no games here! We have one top-level game from almost forty years ago, then one game between top engines, and not much else - definitely an area to explore further! The first tough decision for Black is whether or not to play ...h6 - never an easy decision in such positions. In our human top-level game and also in the engines' top- level game, Black opted for 13...h6.

13...h6

Allowing White to roll his pawns undisturbed is not a good idea; after 13...Ne8 14.g5 g6 15.h4 Ng7 16.f4 Rfe8 17.f5 exf5 18.Nd5 Qd8 19.exf5 White was clearly better and easily won in Wagner-Sachdev, Biel 2018.

14.h4 Nh7

White gets ready to bring his rook to the h-file.

15.Kg2

White could also roll his pawns differently with 15.Qg3. If Black wants to follow Komodo's type of play with 15...Qd8 (see the next comment) White can continue with 16.Rcd1 Re8 (16...Bxh4 17.Qxd6 is probably better for White) and now: A) Pawn sacrifice ideas like 17.g5 hxg5 18.hxg5 Bxg5 19.f4 are not easy to evaluate: 19...Bf6 20.Rd2 and White's rook will swing to the kingside; my Stockfish evaluates around zeros... not easy to tell; B) 17.Rd2, preparing the g5 push (to sacrifice a pawn under better circumstances) is also an option; C) 17.Bf2 Rc8 18.f4 with interesting play. I would personally prefer to be White, but is a matter of taste. Yasser Seirawan took a drastic step to stop White's pawn roll:

[diagram]
In a high-level computer game, Komodo went for 15...Qd8. Obviously, these engines are much stronger than me, while to use my weaker engine to analyse top engine games looks stupid. So I will just give some moves of that game: 16.Rh1 Re8

17.Qg3 Ndf8 18.f4 (18.Rcd1 is an alternative)

It looks as if Black will fall victim to White's bayonet pawn roll, but Black has resources: 18...Bf6! 19.g5 hxg5 20.fxg5 (Black can counter 20.hxg5 with 20...Bxd4

21.Bxd4 e5 22.fxe5 Qxg5 with sharp play, my 'weak Stockfish' giving me zeros)

20...Be5 21.Qg4 f5! 22.Qh3 Ng6 with a sharp game ending in a draw, Stoofvlees-

Komodo, TCEC 2020.

16.hxg5 hxg5

Black did stop White's pawn and has also secured himself an outpost on e5; however, it's the h-file that matters! White has an advantage.

17.Rh1 Rfe8 18.Qg3 Ndf8 19.Rh6 Bf6 20.Rch1

Black is not exactly getting mated, but the pressure on the h-file is unpleasant for him here.

20...Be5 21.Qf2 Rab8

Now White improves his knight:

22.Nc2! Bc8 23.Nb4 f6 24.Nd3

Black has to part with his bishop (though doubling White's pawns).

24...Bxc3 25.bxc3 Re7

White improves his knight again:

26.Nb4! Rg7 27.Bd3 a5 28.Nc2

White's knight on d4 will annoying, while playing 28...e5 allows White to bring his knight to e3, targeting the d5- and f5-squares. White definitely has an advantage here, and Black faces unpleasant dilemmas. Yasser's problems were solved by probably the only mistake Nick made in this game - a draw offer! It was gladly accepted. Typical piece sacrifices for White The diagrammed position shows a typical piece sacrifice idea for White.Black is a piece up, there no deadly threats, and yet Black is in deep trouble! Though we have relatively little games featuring this sacrifice concept, it is dangerous for Black, and computer engines confirm this. Game 19 Pascal Charbonneau 2510 Viswanathan Anand 2803 Turin ol 2006

30.a4

This looks sharp, but 30.Nd5! leads to a winning advantage as after 30...exd5

31.cxd5 Black's bishops are killed (meaning 'no attack') and, apart from dominating,

White will also start collecting some material, e.g. 31...Ne8 (31...Bd8 loses a piece after 32.Rc8 Bb7 33.Rb8; 31...Qd8 32.Bxg5 (32.Ng3 with Nf5 to follow is also strong) 32...Nxe4 33.fxe4 Rxg5 34.Rxc7; 31...Bb8 32.Bxa6+-) 32.Bxa6 with Ng3- f5 to follow and Black's position will collapse, e.g. 32...Rh4 33.Bb5+- Bd8 34.Rc8. If 30.g4 Rh3 31.Kg2 h5! 32.Kxh3 hxg4+ 33.Kg2 Qh7 is unclear.

30...Bb7

30...Rh4, preparing the ...g4 pawn push, was logical, however White would again

have the killer 31.Nd5!! exd5 32.cxd5 Ne8 33.Bxa6 Ng3. Nf5 will follow, while Black cannot create real counterplay. Still, from a practical standpoint 30...Rh4 was perhaps the best move guided by the logic 'if White did not sac on d5 last move, it is not very likely that he will do it next move'. This is an interesting psychological moment! We are playing against an opponent but also playing against ourselves, and being a strong player (seeing your opponent's best options) does not always help!

31.c5

Could White still sacrifice a piece? The answer is: Yes! After 31.Nd5 exd5 32.cxd5 Bd8 33.Ng3 White has (similar to Hübner-Ligterink below) only one pawn for the piece but has domination and full compensation (as a minimum - and Stockfish agrees!). The game is now tense and probably dynamically balanced. This game has been analysed in many publications (including my own book Sacrifice and Initiative). Interestingly, Vishy was the one to err and the game became one of the biggest 2006 Olympiad upsets.

31...dxc5 32.bxc5 bxc5 33.Rb1 Bc6 34.Bxc5 g4! 35.f4

[diagram]
It's not easy to tell what Anand blundered, but this mistake proves crucial. 35...Nf3! was the way to go, with complicating lines resulting in equality.

36.fxe5! Nxe4 37.Nxe4 Bxe4

Most likely Black overestimated his threats. White has an easy way to deal with the problem:

38.Bd3! Bxg2+ 39.Qxg2 gxh2 40.Bxg6 Rxg6

Black has no attack here because he simply has no pieces left. White chooses an elegant finish:

41.Ng3 Rxg3 42.Qe4 Rg4 43.Be7! 1-0

43...Rxe4 44.Bf6 Qg7 45.Rb8 Bxb8 46.Rd8#.

Game 20 Robert Hübner 2620 Gert Ligterink 2445 Wijk aan Zee 1984 Another good example of a typical sacrifice idea for White. White does not need to sacrifice a piece here, but Robert Hübner's idea is instructive! If Black's bishops are tamed, White will have full domination and this can be achieved by means of a positional piece sacrifice:

29.Nd5!

White also had a reasonably promising pawn sacrifice at his disposal: 29.Ng3. A) If 29...Nxe4 30.Bxe4 Bxe4 White should not be greedy for material but should play for the initiative with 31.Re1! (Black has reasonable compensation for the exchange in the event of 31.Nh5 Kh7 32.Nxg7 Rxg7); B) After 29...Bxe4 White has an unpleasant pawn break: 30.c5! bxc5 31.bxc5 Bxb1

32.c6! and many black pieces are hanging. Black's position looks lost but he can

continue fighting: 32...Ne4 33.Nxe4 Bxe4 34.cxd7 g3! (the key move, creating mate threats) 35.h3 Qd8 36.Rd4! (36.Qxc7?? blunders into a mate after 36...Qh4) 36...Ba5

37.Qa3 Bb7 and White should be better but the game remains complicated, e.g. 38.f5

(or 38.Rb1 Ba8 39.f5) 38...Bb6 39.Rxd6 Qh4 40.Rcc6.

29...exd5 30.cxd5

From a practical perspective (compared to the 29.Ng3 lines) Hübner's choice was an excellent one! Black is now doomed to passivity and cannot think of those flashy lines shown under 29.Ng3. This is an instructive example because most of the players, when they sacrificing a piece and get only one pawn in return, will be looking for a forced justification of the sacrifice. White does not have a 'forced justification' here, but he does have domination! Black's bishops are killed and White's knight will travel to the f5-outpost.

30...Bd8

30...Rc8 31.Nd4 also looks good for White.

31.Bd4

31.Ng3! with Nf5 to follow was more precise.

31...Nh5 32.Bxg7+ Rxg7

33.Nd4

It was probably better to keep the f4-pawn (so as not to allow the blockade on e5) with 33.Rf1.

33...Nxf4 34.Nf5 Ne5 35.Nxd6 f6 36.Qe3 Nfg6 37.Rf1 Rh7

The best defence was 37...Qb8! when the situation is not clear because White has given Black an excellent blockading outpost on e5!

38.Rf5 Qb8 39.Ne8 Bc8 40.Nxf6 Bxf6

The only way to struggle on was 40...Bxf5! 41.Nxh7 Kxh7 42.exf5 Bg5! 43.fxg6+ Kg7 44.Qe1 Bxc1 45.Qxc1 Qd6.

41.Rxf6 b5 42.Rxg6 1-0

A dream position for White The diagrammed position, which occurred in a well-known top-level game, shows a dream situation for White! He has regrouped excellently and is ready to push his pawns on the queenside. Black has a badly placed queen and no counterplay. In a higher sense this position is close to lost for Black! The game is very instructive in the way White (Kasparov) regrouped his pieces and Black (Kramnik) got a terrible position due to just shuffling his pieces around and not coming with a clear plan. To have and have not a plan Can a world champion in a classical game get into a lost position by playing random moves, never achieving any counterplay? Yes, he can! So don't kick yourself if sometimes it happens to you. Game 21 Garry Kasparov 2838 Vladimir Kramnik 2802 Moscow 2001

Nbd7 We will get a typical Kan Hedgehog position.

10.Be2 Bb7 11.f3 Be7 12.O-O O-O 13.Kh1 Rac8 14.b4 Qb8 15.Qd2

White plans Rc2, Rb1, Na4, Nb2, Nd3, Qc1 and then simply start pushing his queenside pawns. Black obviously needs to plan some counterplay. In such positions, when it comes to planning, computer engines are less helpful than human knowledge/experience. The engine will give many options for Black evaluating at approximately 0.40. In my opinion, the plan Kramnik had to go for was pushing the h-pawn. Vladimir does not decide on a plan and keeps randomly shuffling his pieces around while Garry is executing his plan. As a result, once White's regrouping has been accomplished, he has a close to winning advantage!

15...Bd8

Black could consider 15...Rfe8 16.Rc2 h5.

16.Rc2 Re8

16...h5 again came into consideration. White continues with his plan.

17.Na4 Bc7

It was high time to start counterplay with 17...h5!.

18.Bg1

18...Rcd8?

This shows a lack of any clear plan as the ...d5 push is not really on the cards here. This was the last moment to play 18...h5! and if 19.Qe1, 19...Bd8 followed by ...h4.

19.Rb1

White is now clearly better and it's difficult to give Black clever advice.

19...Ba8

19...h5? is now wrong as there is no follow-up after the simple 20.Qe1.

20.Qc1

The next few random moves do not improve Kramnik's situation; however, without any counterplay his prospects are already bleak here.

20...h6

Kasparov takes the human decision and continues with his plan.

21.Nb2

My Stockfish is also enthusiastic about immediate action with 21.c5.

21...Nf8 22.Nd3

Regrouping accomplished! Now is the time for White to push his queenside pawns and crush Black!

22...Ng6 23.a4

Black's queen is terribly placed.

23...Qc8

White pieces are perfectly positioned for the final onslaught! Time to open the queenside. Which pawn would you push?

24.b5?

Surprising enough, Kasparov chooses for the least strong push.

24.a5 bxa5 25.b5 led to a winning advantage as Black cannot stabilize the queenside

situation:

24.c5 was perhaps strongest. At first glance Black seems to get counterplay after

24...bxc5 25.bxc5 d5.

analysis diagram However, the 'tension' lasts only a few moves: 26.e5! Nxe5 27.Nxe5 Bxe5 28.c6 and Black's queen is horribly placed. White has a winning advantage, e.g. 28...Bc7

29.Qf1!; 28...Qc7 29.Bxa6; or 28...Re7 29.Qf1.

24...a5

Black now stabilizes the queenside.

25.Nc6

It is possible that Kasparov, when deciding on 24.b5, thought that one of the pawn breaks 25.e5 or 25.c5 would work but then figured out that they didn't.

25...Bxc6

25...Rd7? is a mistake due to 26.Nxa5! bxa5 27.c5 and White crushes Black -

probably in the way he was hoping for.

26.bxc6

The lion's share of White's advantage has evaporated. Black stabilizes his situation and equalizes:

26...e5! 27.Bxb6 Ne7

28.c5

Keeping the bishop on was probably better: 28.Bg1! Nxc6 29.Rcb2.

28...d5 29.Bxc7 Qxc7 30.Rb7 Qxc6 31.Rb5 Ng6

Black has active play and the position is now balanced.

32.exd5 Nxd5 33.Nf2 Ngf4 34.Bf1 Ne6 35.Rxa5 Qc7 36.Rb5 Nd4 37.Rc4 Nxb5

38.axb5

We have a material imbalance resulting in equality.

38...Rb8 39.b6 Nxb6 40.cxb6 Qxb6 41.Qe1

Kramnik correctly decides to trade a pair of rooks.

41...Rec8 42.Rxc8+ Rxc8

The position is equal. One would expect White to give his king some air and play h3 or h4 now or on the next move, and then a draw agreement. However we are very far from the last miracle in this game!

43.Ng4 Re8 44.Bd3?!

Played with a wrong idea in mind.

44...Qd4

45.Be4?

This blunders a piece!

45...f5! 46.Bxf5 Ra8

Luckily for White, the loss of the piece is not fatal and he escapes into a drawn ending:

47.Bb1 Qb2 48.h4 Ra1 49.Kh2 Qxb1 50.Qxe5 Qh1+ 51.Kg3 Qe1+ 52.Qxe1 Rxe1

We have reached a theoretically drawn ending. But many mistakes will still be made and there is a lot to learn from this ending! This is, however, not an endgame book, so I will only point out a few important moments.

53.Kf4 Re2 54.Ne3 g6 55.g4 Kf7 56.h5 g5+

After 56...gxh5 57.gxh5 Rh2 58.Kg4 Black's h6-pawn is a target and White has an easy draw.

57.Ke4 Ke6

58.f4

This active defence complicates White's life. 58.Kd4 would have built a fortress, e.g.

58...Rd2+ 59.Ke4 Rb2 60.Nf5! Rb4+ 61.Ke3 Ke5 62.Kf2 Kf4 63.Ng3! Rb3 64.Ne2+

Ke5 65.Ng3 etc.

58...Rf2

As a result of his active defence, White now has to take an important decision.

59.Nd5?

This desicion should have cost him the game.

59.f5+! Kd6 60.Nc4+ still made a draw. Long analyses prove that the king and

knight coordinate well enough to hold.

59.fxg5 also held the draw, however after 59...hxg5 60.Nd5 Rf7 White has to

sacrifice a pawn and understand that he has a drawing fortress: 61.h6! Rh7 62.Nb4 Rxh6 63.Nd3.

59...gxf4 60.Nxf4+ Kf6 61.Ke3 Ra2 62.Nd3 Ra3 63.Ke4

63...Ra1

For some reason, until the end of the game Kramnik refuses to enter with his king:

63...Kg5 when White will run out of moves at some stage.

64.Kf4 Ra4+ 65.Kf3 Ra3 66.Ke4 Rb3 67.Nc5 Rb4+ 68.Kf3 Rb5?

It was still not to late to change his mind and enter with the king on g5: 68...Rc4!

69.Nd7+ Kg5!, winning.

69.Ne4+ Ke5

Now White grabs his chance:

70.g5! Rb4

Black is also in time to draw after 70...Rb3+ 71.Kg4 Kxe4 72.gxh6.

71.Nf2 Rf4+ 72.Kg3 1⁄2-1⁄2

Chapter 4 The Sveshnikov Variation The Sveshnikov Sicilian is rich with ideas, and half this book could have been devoted to it. With our limited space, my choice is personal and I have opted for two ideas for White that I like very much. Also, I think they can be useful for the reader in practical play. One idea is a positional exchange sacrifice; the other is an attacking idea related to a rook swing along the second rank. In both cases, we have quite a number of top-level examples. The exchange sacrifice Diagrammed is the typical exchange sacrifice idea seen in a number of top-level games. We have different versions of this idea, but positionally/strategically, the concept is the same. In return for the exchgange White gets light-square control, a dominant knight on the d5-outpost, and a passed b-pawn. Black is to move in the diagrammed position and has to decide on a plan to create counterplay. Black's best counterplay options here are related to the f-pawn push (...f5). In Kasparov-Shirov, which we will analyse below, White got an even better version of the diagrammed position with an extra pair of knights on the board. The second-rank rook swing The second diagram shows a nice attacking idea for White seen in a couple of top- level games. White has first sacrificed the h-pawn to open the h-file and now has just played b3, clearing the second rank for a rook transfer. White will push f4, then swing his Ra2 to the kingside and obtain a powerful attack. To my knowledge, this idea was invented by Ruslan Ponomariov and it has later been replicated in some top-level games. Exchange sacrifice/light-square domination For a good understanding of the positional exchange sacrifice with which White tries to achieves light-square domination, this game by Kasparov is an important cornerstone, and the next game Anand-Van Wely is another important building block. When the first game was played, it was (to my knowledge) a novel idea. Having to solve new strategic problems in over-the-board play, Shirov quickly got into trouble and Kasparov celebrated a smooth victory. As we will see, things are actually rather complex. Game 22 Garry Kasparov 2805 Alexei Shirov 2740 Horgen 1994

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bf4 e5 8.Bg5 a6

9.Na3 b5 10.Nd5 Be7 11.Bxf6 Bxf6 12.c3

12...Bb7

Predominantly due to this game, this continution has slowly disappeared from practice, perhaps unjustifiably so as Black's play can be improved.

12...Bg5 is nowadays considered to be the main move.

13.Nc2

Black's knight on c6 needs to be improved. Usually Black either opts for the game plan or plays 13...Ne7 which after 14.Nxf6 gxf6 leads to a different pawn structure.

13...Nb8 14.a4

In general, the standard plan for White here. In this particular case, Kasparov already had the ensuing exchange sacrifice in mind.

14...bxa4 15.Rxa4 Nd7

16.Rb4!

Preparing a positional exchange sacrifice. In this game, everything went perfect for White. Either Alexei was not aware of White's plan, or he underestimated it, and White's strategic idea worked to a full extent. There is however a risk associated with White's idea: if the exchange is not sacrificed on b7, the rook will be a bit awkward on b4.

16...Nc5?!

Definitely helping White with the execution of his planned exchange sacrifice; the knight will be out of play on b7. The correct decision was 16...Ra7 when matters are far from clear as White's exchange sac now works considerably less well. A) The exchange sacrifice now leads to approximate (dynamic) equality, e.g.

17.Rxb7 Rxb7 18.Ncb4 (18.b4?, trying to control c5 (similar to Kasparov) now does

not work with Black's knight on d7 as Black is actually better after 18...a5) 18...Nc5 (Black may also opt for 18...a5 when best for White is to gain back the exchange with 19.Ba6 Qa8 20.Bxb7 Qxb7 and it is doubtful if White has any advantage here) analysis diagram

19.Bxa6! Nxa6 20.Nxa6 O-O (Black may decide to collect the b2-pawn: 20...Rxb2,

and after 21.Nab4 (the threat is Qa1) 21...Qa5 22.Qc1 Qa3 23.Nxf6+ gxf6 24.O-O, to me the position looks promising for White but my Stockfish gives around equality)

21.Nab4 and compared to our main game (see below), we have a different situation.

White has compensation for the exchange, but not more; B) White can play for light-square domination with 17.Bc4!?, however after 17...O-O

18.O-O a5...

analysis diagram ... the rook is awkwardly placed on b4; best is to sacrifice a pawn: 19.Ra4 Nc5

20.Ra3 Nxe4 21.Qe2 Ng5 (21...Nc5 leads to White's advantage after 22.b4 Ne6

23.Rfa1) 22.Nce3 Ne6 23.b4 and White definitely has compensation but probably

not more; C) 24 years later, Alexei tried Kasparov's idea as White, but even though he won that game, he didn't get an opening advantage: 17.Nce3 O-O 18.h4!? (this typical idea to limit Black's bishop does not work that well here because Black can improve the bishop in another way) 18...a5 19.Rc4. The critical moment; here Black has a possibility to improve on the game by executing a typical Sveshnikov structure plan! 19...Nc5 (better was 19...Qb8! with ...Bd8 and ...Nb6 to follow. White's rook on c4 is clumsy and Black has a comfortable, perhaps even somewhat better position) 20.b4. Shirov's rook will now be liberated but Black gets the d4-square for his knight: 20...axb4 21.cxb4 Ne6 (White may have had regrets about pushing h4, as now he needs to spend a move protecting it and it can also can be a target for a piece sacrifice in the future) 22.g3 Nd4 (the position can be evaluated as dynamically balanced) 23.Bd3 Ra3 24.O-O

24...g6 (a standard Sveshnikov move, but Black had an interesting tactical option at

his disposal: the piece sacrifice 24...Bxh4!? 25.gxh4 Bxd5 26.exd5 Qxh4. Black already has two pawns for the piece and White's king is not secure, White needs time to coordinate his pieces. Your engine will give you zeros, but in practice it might be easier to play this position as Black) 25.Nc2. Now we get a position with opposite-coloured bishops. 25...Nxc2 26.Qxc2 Bxd5 27.exd5. White has a passed b-pawn, but Black can easily deal with it and is not worse.

27...Qa8? (a step in the wrong direction; correct was 27...Qb8 followed by ...Bd8,

...Bb6, ...f5, with sufficient counterplay) 28.Rc6! Rd8 29.b5 Qa5 30.Rb1. Now White is in the driving seat and his b-pawn is powerful. White soon won in Shirov- Lindh, Sweden tt 2018. After the text move, Kasparov gets what he was hoping for!

17.Rxb7! Nxb7 18.b4

Black's knight on b7 will be passive for quite some time. White has total light- square domination. Compared to Anand-Van Wely (below) White does not have a passed b-pawn, but the presence of an extra pair of knights (Black having a passive one on b7) definitely favours White. Shirov tries to create counterplay by opening the a-file (also giving White a passed b-pawn).

18...Bg5 19.Na3!

The right place for the Nc2 is the c4-square, so first improving the knight is the most precise.

19...O-O 20.Nc4 a5

Kasparov chooses the most human move, completing his development.

21.Bd3

Probably the most precise was 21.h4!. The bishop on h6 controls the (not exactly important) h6-c1 diagonal, but does not control e7, allowing White some tactical motifs: 22.Ncb6! A) After 22...Ra7 we see the effects of Black's bishop being chased to h6 and not controlling the e7-square: 23.Nc8! Ra8 24.Nce7+ Kh8 25.Bb5 and White has total domination; B) 22...Rb8 23.g3 and Black is very passive, Stockfish 15 even gives White a winning advantage (plus two); C) 22...axb4 23.cxb4! (playing for positional domination is the most practical here; on 23.Nxa8 Black can sacrifice a piece with 23...bxc3! (23...Qxa8? is a strategic blunder as after 24.cxb4 White has a huge advantage with his passed b-pawn and total domination): 24.Nab6 Bd2+ 25.Ke2 Nc5 and in a game between humans, this position does not look clear) 23...Ra3 24.Bb5. analysis diagram White has full domination and definitely plenty of compensation. Play may continue

24...f5 25.Nc4 Ra7 26.exf5 Rxf5 27.g3 followed by castling, with light-square

domination while Black doesn't have any counterplay. Such positions are what White aims for with his exchange sacrifice.

21...axb4 22.cxb4

22...Qb8?!

My Stockfish 15 (at a decent depth) advises Black to be patient, to 'sit on his hands' and go for something like 22...Ra7 23.O-O (23.h4?! Bxh4 23.Ncb6 Qe8=) 23...Kh8

24.g3 g6, claiming that it will be difficult for White to improve his position. I have

tried to play this position against my Stockfish, and of course failed to improve White's position; Black has defensive resources. For a human it's not easy to employ a 'rope-a-dope' strategy here, so it's easy to understand that Shirov wants to create counterplay.

23.h4!

This typical idea (send black bishop to h6) improves White's situation here (as tactics, later on, related to Ne7+ will appears).

23...Bh6 24.Ncb6 Ra2 25.O-O Rd2

Black does not really have counterplay as his Rd2 does not have any support.

26.Qf3 Qa7

27.Nd7

The most direct, but not the most precise. The point is that the Bd3 will be hanging in lines where White wants to capture Qxf7. Black's pieces are paralysed and there was no need for White to be in a hurry. Best was 27.Bb5! so as to play Nd7 and, when the Rf8 moves, Ne7+ followed by Qxf7. Black will first lose his extra exchange (since after White's Nd7 his Rf8 cannot move) and then White's b-pawn will decide. Black's Bh8 continues to control plenty of empty squares.

27...Nd8?

This loses quickly. Best was 27...Ra8! when White has a clear advantage but Black can still fight. White's best is to hope for a move repetition (and then play Bb5): A) 28.Ne7+ does not achieve the aim as after 28...Kh8 29.Qxf7, the Bd3 is hanging (therefore 27.Bb5! was needed) and Black can simply take 29...Rxd3 and after

30.Nf8 play 30...Qa2! when White has to force perpetual check with 31.Neg6+ hxg6

32.Nxg6+ Kh7 33.Nf8+;

B) 28.N7b6! Qa3 and now White has nice tactics due to Black's bad king position and bad piece coordination, but not a clear win (28...Rf8 allows the precise 29.Bb5!, with a winning advantage): 29.Nxa8! Rxd3 analysis diagram B1) 30.Nf6+ looks flashy but brings not more than a draw after 30...Kf8! (30...gxf6? loses to 31.Qg4+ Bg7 32.Qc8+ Bf8 though (as usual) White still has to be precise:

33.Nc7! and Black does not get the time to coordinate his pieces: 33...Qxb4 34.Ne8!

d5 35.Nxf6+ Kg7 36.Nh5+ Kg8 37.Qg4+ Kh8 38.Qf5 and White wins in a few moves) 31.Nxh7+ Kg8 32.Nf6+ Kf8 33.Qf5 Qxa8 34.Nd5 Kg8! and White has nothing better than a draw by move repetition 35.Ne7+ Kf8 36.Nd5; B2) 30.Qe2 Rxd5 (30...Rd2 loses to 31.Qb5 Qxa8 32.Nc7! Qb8 33.Ra1) 31.Nb6! (White's knight is needed on b6 as in some lines the move Nd7 is needed; 31.Nc7? is not precise as after 31...Rd4 32.Qg4 g6 33.Qc8+ Bf8 White needs to be able to play Nd7) 31...Rd3 32.Qg4 Rc3 33.Qd7. analysis diagram Here the only way for Black not to get mated immediately is 33...g5 (33...g6? leaves Black's king boxed in after 34.Qe8+ Kg7 35.Nd7 g5 36.h5) 34.Qxb7 - White has a large advantage and should win.

28.Nxf8 Kxf8 29.b5

Now White's life is easy. Black's pieces are still not coordinated. White has a passed b-pawn plus an attack, and Kasparov executes with energetic play right until the end.

29...Qa3 30.Qf5! Ke8 31.Bc4 Rc2 32.Qxh7 Rxc4 33.Qg8+ Kd7 34.Nb6+ Ke7

35.Nxc4 Qc5

White has many ways to finish the game off here; Garry characteristically chooses the most hard-hitting option.

36.Ra1! Qd4 37.Ra3 Bc1

38.Ne3!

A nice concluding move. White had an even nicer move at his disposal with a similar idea: 38.Nxd6!. 1-0 Game 23 Viswanathan Anand 2792 Loek Van Wely 2647 Wijk aan Zee 2006

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bg5 a6 8.Na3 b5

9.Nd5 Be7 10.Bxf6 Bxf6 11.c3 Bg5

This is not a theory book, but some opening info never hurts. The text 11...Bg5 has established itself as the main line nowadays because Black is not in a hurry to show his hand by quickly castling. The immediate 11...O-O has been played by a number of very strong players; however, after 12.Nc2 Rb8, 13.h4! ... ... is a clever and useful move - stopping ...Bg5, enabling g3 followed by Bh3, and getting ready to push the h-pawn further (definitely if Black plays ...g6), while still not showing his hand regarding his king position. Black would like to play ...Ne7, trading a pair of knights, but that allows Nxf6+, damaging his kingside pawn structure. A) With Black's king open after 13...Ne7 14.Nxf6+ gxf6 we have two games with Kasparov (as White) castling queenside: 15.Bd3! (in his first outing, Garry went for

15.Qd2 Bb7 16.Bd3 d5 17.exd5 Qxd5 18.O-O-O here, Kasparov-Kramnik, Novgorod

1994. Garry celebrated victory, however Black's play could have been improved and

in the same position a couple of months later he opted for the more precise text move). In Kasparov-Lautier, Moscow 1994, Black followed Kramnik's plan, hoping for counterplay: 15...d5 16.exd5 Qxd5. Now we see the advantage of the 15.Bd3! move-order: 17.Ne3! Qe6 18.Qh5. Just like in the game vs Kramnik, White will castle queenside but here he has a better version: 18...e4 19.Bc2 b4 20.c4 Kh8 21.O-O-O! White's king is safe on the queenside, and he has a better pawn structure plus attacking chances on the kingside. White is clearly better. The game did not last long; I will give it until the end because of the beautiful last move: 21...f5 22.Qg5 Rb6 23.h5 Rc6 (Black does not have any counterplay; if 23...Rg8 24.Qf4 Qh6 the bad coordination of Black's pieces is obvious after 25.Qc7) 24.Kb1 Rc5 (now on 24...Rg8 25.Qf4 Qh6 White has the unpleasant 26.Qb8!) 25.h6! (weaving a mating net!) 25...Qe5 26.Rh5! Rg8. White to play and Black to resign! 27.Ng4!! and mate or decisive material loss cannot be avoided: 27...Rxg5 28.Nxe5 or 27...Qe6 28.Rd8. B) Carlsen, playing Black, took the logical decision to place his bishop on g7 first and then play ...Ne7: 13...g6 14.g3 Bg7 15.h5. Now Black tries to get rid of White's dominant knight: 15...Ne7 16.Nce3 Nxd5 17.Nxd5 Be6. Now Wesley So played a good strategic move that almost always works in such positions: 18.Bh3!. Black is forced to take a decision, as ignoring this move is not easy: 18...Bxd5 (if Black ignore the move anyway and plays 18...Qd7, White has a clear advantage after 19.Bxe6 (my engine also likes 19.h6 Bh8 20.Bxe6 fxe6

21.Ne3±). Black has to allow his pawn structure to be damaged, otherwise the Nd5 is

a monster: 19...fxe6 20.hxg6 hxg6 21.Ne3±) 19.Qxd5 (Black hopes to stabilize the queenside) 19...b4 20.c4 Qc7 21.O-O Rb6 22.b3. We get this type of position more often in the Sveshnikov (which is the reason I selected this game) and it would be a mistake to evaluate this as drawish due to the opposite-coloured bishops. White has a clear advantage while Black has no counterplay: 22...Rd8. Wesley So is an excellent technical player but here he committed an unusual (for him) mistake. White had to continue to slowly improve his position when Black would be under long-term pressure struggling for a draw. For example, 23.Rad1. White has many plans here: triple on the d-file or think about pushing the f4-pawn. I am not sure if White's advantage is as large as your engine will evaluate (around +1) but Black definitely faces a long-term struggle for a draw. In a hurry to improve his position, So played 23.a4? bxa3 and now Black had a target (the b3-pawn) and the position was equal! 24.hxg6 hxg6 25.Rxa3 Qc5 (the queen trade leads to a drawish endgame) 26.Rfa1 Qxd5 27.cxd5 Bh6 and a draw was soon agreed in So-Carlsen, Stavanger 2019.

12.Nc2 Rb8

Anand goes for the main move (today as well as at the time). Vishy probably had the ensuing exchange sacrifice in mind already. Was he inspired by the Kasparov-Shirov game that he obviously knew? It's not easy to say, as the exchange sacrifice - based on light-square domination - Vishy is about to execute had already been tried in a lesser-known game from grandmaster practice.

13.a4

In another high-level game thirteen years later, White was definitely inspired by this game from Anand! Let's take a look at the critical moment: 13.Be2 O-O 14.O-O Kh8

15.Bg4 Bb7 16.Ncb4 Nxb4 17.cxb4 g6 18.a4 bxa4 19.Rxa4 Bc6 and now White sort

of copied Anand's idea with 20.Be2 (if White does it in a slightly different way with

20.Rxa6 Bb5 21.Be2 Bxa6 22.Bxa6, Black also, just like in the game, gets good

counterplay after 22...f5) 20...Bxa4 21.Qxa4. If we compare this position to our main game (see comment after the move 19...Qe8 - Black plays 19...g6 instead) we see that Giri is two tempi down compared to Anand (actually better compared to the stem game Barua-Lalic) as Black's pawn is already on g6, Black is to move and the pawn on a6 has not yet been taken! Black has comfortable play here with 21...f5! 22.exf5 Rxf5. Probably, Magnus had already calculated the coming tactical motif. It should be mentioned that a draw would have been enough for Carlsen to win the tournament, so he was not ambitious (Black could have shown ambition by playing 22...gxf5!?): 23.Bd3 Rf8 24.Qxa6

24...Bd2! 25.Qc4 (25.b5?! Ba5 leads to Black's advantage) 25...Qc8 26.Qe4 and

now comes the tactical solution Magnus had probably calculated when playing

22...Rxf5: 26...Bxb4 27.Nxb4 Rf4 28.Qc6 end it all ended peacefully in a drawn

endgame: 28...Rfxb4 29.Qxd6 Qf8 30.Qxe5+ 1⁄2-1⁄2 Giri-Carlsen, Wijk aan Zee 2019.

13...bxa4 14.Ncb4

14...Bd7

Main theory nowadays is 14...Nxb4, the starting point of the theoretical discussion being 15.cxb4 O-O 16.Rxa4 a5! when we have many top-level games; the current assessment seems to be 'a dynamic balance'.

15.Bxa6 Nxb4 16.cxb4 O-O 17.O-O Bc6

Black could have stopped White's exchange sac by playing 17...Qe8 but then White has an advantage after the simple 18.b3 axb3 19.Qxb3. White has light-square domination, a passed b-pawn and control of the a-file; Black has no real counterplay. Now Vishy goes for a positional exchange sac that had already been seen in grandmaster practice some years earlier, so it's quite possible that Anand knew that game:

18.Rxa4! Bxa4 19.Qxa4

Compare this position to (the same sacrifice idea in) Giri-Carlsen, in the comment after 13.a4 (White playing 13.Be2). Well, it cannot really be compared, because in that game Black had played three more moves: ...Kh8, ...g6, ...f5, and also his pawn on a6 is still alive! Probably guided by the logic 'I am material up - a queen trade makes sense' Loek went for that:

19...Qe8

Black struggles to create counterplay here anyway, so keeping the queens on did not equalize either: 19...Kh8 20.Bb5! (20.b5 Qd7 21.Qc4 f5 was about equal in Ragger- Markos, Austria tt 2007) 20...f5 (20...g6 does not bring Black the counterplay he is hoping for after 21.Bc6 f5 22.b5 fxe4 23.Qxe4) 21.exf5 Rxf5 22.Bc6. Now, best for Black is probably to go for a pawn sacrifice: 22...e4 23.b5 e3 24.fxe3 ... ... assuming he finds the brilliant 24...Qf6!, but White still has some advantage after

25.Rxf5 Qxf5 26.h4.

The stem game went 19...g6 20.Qc6. Now Black went for the typical bishop transfer to b6: 20...Bd2 21.b5 Ba5 22.Bb7 f6 (including the Rf8 in the game) 23.b4 Bb6

24.Nxb6 Rf7.

The game Barua-Lalic, Ubeda 1998, saw a 'clean-up' into a drawn endgame after

25.Rd1 Rfxb7 26.Rxd6 Qxd6 27.Qxd6 Rxb6=. White's play can be improved with

25.Qc4! and after 25...Rbxb7 26.Nd5 Black struggles for a draw.

20.Qxe8 Rfxe8 21.b5

We have a type of position White is happy to get. Yes, the queens are off, but the light-squares domination from the middlegame still persists. White's plan is relatively easy: push the pawn to b7, then Nd5-b4-c6 (get your exchange back) and win a superior endgame. Black urgently needs counterplay, which is difficult to find. Van Wely goes for the most logical - and typically Sveshnikov - counterplay idea:

21...f5 22.b6

Vishy continues on his path and keeps the position closed. It is doubtful if Black gets enough counterplay after 22.exf5 e4 23.b6.

22...fxe4

White stands better, but how much better isn't easy to tell. Vishy comes up with an interesting pawn sac:

23.h4!?

With a limited number of pieces, White sacrifices a pawn to penetrate the c-file. The most logical alternative for White looks to be 23.Re1 when Black needs to improve his king: 23...Kf7 24.Rxe4. analysis diagram Black's position is difficult to defend, but the engine always has ideas: 24...Rf8! (the arguably more logical 24...Bd8 25.Rb4 Ke6 loses to 26.Bc4 Rf8 27.b7. White wants to play simply Rb5, Nb4, Na6 and Black cannot stop this: 27...Kd7 28.Bb5+ Ke6

29.Bc6 followed by Rb5, Nb4, Na6). Now White needs to spend a move to drive

Black's bishop away: 25.h4 (25.Rb4 Bd2) 25...Bd8 26.Rb4 Ke6 and things are not the same as in the comment to 24...Bd8: 27.Bc4 Kd7 28.Bb5+. analysis diagram Here Black has the defensive resource 28...Kc8!! 29.Rc4+ (it's never too late to do something stupid: 29.Bc6?? Bxb6) 29...Kb7 30.Bc6+ Kc8. analysis diagram Strangely, White does not have a killer check here and has to go for 31.b7+ Rxb7

32.Bxb7+ Kxb7 with (still) some advantage, but Black has reasonable chances to

survive.

23...Bd2?

For better or worse, the pawn had to be taken! 23...Bxh4!. The c-file penetration is less decisive than it looks: 24.Rc1 Rf8 25.g3 Bg5 26.Rc6 analysis diagram

26...Kf7! with approximate equality after 27.Bc4 Kg6 (or 27...h5) 28.Rxd6+ Kf5.

24.b7 Kf7 25.Rd1 Bh6 26.Nb4 Ke7 27.Nd5+ Kf7 28.g4 Bf4

29.Re1?

Logical but not precise. Apparently, it was better not to force matters as after 29.Kg2 Black runs out of useful moves while 29...Rf8 loses to 30.Bc4 Ke8 (30...Rxb7 31.Nxf4+ Ke8 32.Ne6)

31.Bb5+ Kd8.

analysis diagram Now White reminds Black of his weak king with 32.Ra1! and gets a winning advantage, e.g. 32...Rf7 33.Ra6

[diagram]
A strong move, keeping Black in the game! He could also have chosen a different move-order: 29...Red8 30.Rxe4 Rd7 31.Rb4 g5! (the immediate 31...Ke6 does not work that well after 32.Rb5 g5 33.Nb4) 32.h5 Ke6 analysis diagram

33.Rb5 (White has no deadly discovered check after 33.Bc4 Bd2) and we see why it

was good to protect the bishop on f4: 33...e4".

30.Re2

White renews the idea of the c-file penetration. After the (perhaps most logical)

30.h5 Black holds with 30...Red8! 31.Rd1 (31.Nb4?? Bd2; 31.Rxe4 Ke6) 31...Rd7=;

if 30.Rxe4, Black again eliminates the b-pawn with 30...Red8! 31.Rc4 Rd7=.

30...Red8?

Van Wely (again) refrains from pawn-grabbing and this proves to be the decisive mistake. Normally Loek loves to take material!

30...gxh4! had to be played. The advanced h-pawn helps Black to create counterplay

and probably this will save the game! A logical run of play can be 31.Rc2 h3 32.Kh1 h2 33.Nb4. analysis diagram Black's situation looks hopeless but thanks to his advanced h-pawn he can save the game: 33...h5! 34.Nc6 and now another hidden resource: 34...Ra8! 35.bxa8Q Rxa8

36.Nb4 hxg4 and it will probably end in a draw; Black has enough pawns for the

piece.

31.Nb4

Now White is easily winning and Anand brings it home with a steady hand.

31...d5 32.Nc6

The simple threat is 33.Nxd8 Rxd8 34.Rc2 with Rc8 to follow, so 30...Red8? proves to be a loss of two tempi.

32...Rg8 33.Nxb8 Rxb8

34.h5!

In essence, creating another passed pawn, as Black's h-pawn is going to fall.

34...Ke7 35.Kf1 d4 36.Rc2 e3 37.fxe3

Sadly for Black, he has to take with the pawn:

37...dxe3 38.Rc7+ Kf6

39.Rxh7

White's passed pawns are impossible to stop.

39...e4 40.Bc4 Rd8 41.Rf7+ Ke5 42.Rd7

And Black resigned. The second rank rook lift Game 24 Ruslan Ponomariov 2700 Vladimir Kramnik 2754 Wijk aan Zee 2005

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bg5 a6 8.Na3 b5

9.Nd5 Be7 10.Bxf6 Bxf6 11.c3 Bg5 12.Nc2

12...O-O

Magnus entered this line twice as Black. First he lost to Peter Leko, but a year later (also at Linares) he repeated it vs Grischuk: 12...Ne7 13.h4 Bh6 14.a4 bxa4 15.Ncb4 O-O with a nice positional advantage for White: 16.Qxa4 Nxd5 17.Nxd5 a5 (after

17...Kh8, most probably Magnus did not like 18.Qa5) 18.Bb5.

White's advantage is small, but normally we have play for two results here. White will create a passed b-pawn, Black's Bh6 is controling many 'empty squares' while White dominates the light squares. 18...Be6 19.Bc6 Rb8. It's time for White to create a passed pawn: 20.b4 Bxd5 21.Bxd5 axb4 22.cxb4 (practically, White is a pawn up as Black's d6-pawn is not worth much, but Black should be able to hold) 22...Qb6

23.Rb1 (one year later, interestingly enough Grischuk went for a pawn sacrifice here

with 23.O-O Qxb4 24.Qd7. White does not have enough pieces to build on his light- square pressure and the game Grischuk-Carlsen, Linares 2009, was soon drawn)

23...Kh8 (the coffeehouse-type sacrifice 23...Bd2+? does not work for Black after

the simple 24.Kxd2 Qxf2+ 25.Kd3 Qxg2 26.Rhe1) 24.O-O. After losing against Leko, Magnus was ready to play this position again (vs Grischuk), and it makes me wonder what Magnus had in mind. 24...f5 (perhaps here Magnus intended to improve his bishop with the typical Sveshnikov maneuvre

24...Bd2 25.b5 Bc3 with ...Bd4 to follow, when it looks difficult for White to

improve his position) 25.Qa5 (keeping the queens on with 25.b5 offers White good prospects.) 25...fxe4 26.Qxb6 Rxb6 27.Rb3 and thanks to his b-pawn White has an advantage in this ending. Black is probably closer to a draw then White is to a win, nevertheless White won in Leko-Carlsen, Morelia/Linares 2008.

13.a4 bxa4 14.Rxa4 a5 15.Bc4 Rb8

This is the position of our interest. Ponomariov comes up with an interesting plan here! White has many pawns on his second rank, nevertheless Pono plans to swing his Ra4 to the kingside and obtain a deadly attack! Later, white players improved the move-order, however to my knowledge the plan belongs to Pono and this is the stem game!

16.Ra2!?

Nine years later Anish Giri copied Ponomariov's plan and crushed Alexei Shirov in their friendly match (it pays off to do some research!). Let's see this game. This is also the best move-order for White: 16.b3! Kh8 17.Nce3 g6 (If Black goes for 17...Bxe3 18.Nxe3 Ne7, White has an advantage after 19.O-O analysis diagram as Black does not have the convenient counterplay idea 19...f5 here, e.g. 20.exf5 Nxf5 21.Nxf5 (Black will lose his a5-pawn for no compensation) 21...Rxf5 /(21...Bxf5) 22.Qd5±.) Now Anish goes for the plan Pono devised in our stem game: 18.h4!. White sacrifices his h-pawn so as to open the h-file and gain time to push g3, followed by f4, clearing the second rank for the rook transfer Ra4-a2-h2! 18...Bxh4 (if Black does not accept the sacrifice, White has an easy advantage) 19.g3 Bg5 (19...Bf6

20.Ra2 transposes to our main game Ponomariov-Kramnik). Anish now copies

Pono's plan: 20.f4! exf4 21.gxf4 Bh4+ (this check is logical; Black hopes to gain time. After 21...Bf6 White gets a deadly attack with 22.Ra2! Re8 23.Rah2!). Where to go with the white king? A) It took white players some time to understand the necessity of keeping the second rank free for the Ra4-a2-h2 rook swing! After 22.Kd2, the king stands in the way of the rook transfer and Black has a good game after 22...Ne7! as for example in Topalov-Leko, Linares 2005; B) 22.Kf1!. Now Black wants to open the f-file to take advantage of White's king being placed on f1: 22...f5 (22...Ne7 now loses to the rook swing 23.Ra2! with Rah2 to follow and a crushing attack) 23.Ra2! (consistent and strong) 23...fxe4 (23...g5

24.Rah2 fxe4 25.Qh5 Rb7 26.Ke2 transposes to the game) 24.Rah2 g5. White will

need to move his king away from the f-file pin in order to threaten fxg5, but he needs to activate his queen first. I do not know how far Giri's opening preparation went, but I do know Anish played a perfect game: 25.Qh5! B1) 25...Ne5 does not help Black, as after 26.Ke2 Nxc4 27.fxg5! he does not have real counterplay, e.g. 27...Rxb3 28.Rxh4 and White's king is perfectly safe in the centre: 28...Rb2+ 29.Ke1 Rb1+ 30.Nd1 Bf5 31.g6 (Black cannot avoid material loss)

31...Rb7 32.Rf4 Bxg6 (32...Qd7 loses to the prosaic 33.Rhf1 and Bf5 falls, while

32...Be6 lands Black in a lost endgame after 33.Rxf8+ Qxf8 34.Qxh7+! Rxh7

35.Rxh7+ Kg8 36.Ne7++-) 33.Rxf8+ Qxf8 34.Qxg6 White was a sound piece up

and soon won in Korneev-Huerga Leache, Linares 2015; B2) 25...Rb7 26.Ke2. The triumph of White's strategy! His king is perfectly safe in the centre while Black needs to start worrying about fxg5, forcing the Bh4 to move and opening the h-file: 26...Be6 27.Qh6 Bg8 (more stubborn was 27...Bxd5, however after 28.Nxd5 - 28.Bxd5 leads to unclear consequences after 28...Rxf4! 29.Bxc6 Rxb3 as White is reminded that his king is now 'always safe' - 28...Rff7 29.Qe6 White has light-square domination plus an attack along the h-file, and should win)

28.Rg2! (White is playing with great accuracy; 28.Ng2??, hoping to clear the h-file,

is a blunder and loses to 28...Ne7; and moving the other rook was not precise as after

28.Rg1 Bxd5 29.Nxd5 Ne7 30.Rxg5 Nxd5 31.Rxd5 Black has the unpleasant tempo

move 31...Bg3!) 28...Rbf7 (arguably most stubborn was 28...Bxd5 29.Nxd5 Ne7, but ultimately it would probably not change the outcome as after 30.Rxg5 Nxd5 31.Rxd5 Bf6 - 31...Bg3? does not gain a tempo now and loses to 32.Rdh5 Qe7 33.Qg6 Bxf4

34.Rf5! - 32.Rdh5, White has a strong attack with the opposite-coloured bishops.

The attacking side usually wins in such situations!). Anish now demonstrates accuracy in the execution: 29.Rxh4! gxh4 30.Nf5 h3

31.Nh4!. Mate in one is always a powerful threat! Black is forced to part with his

queen: 31...Qxh4 32.Rxg8+ Rxg8 33.Qxh4 Rg2+ 34.Kf1. White has a sizeable material advantage, while his attack is far from over. Black will suffer further material losses: 34...Rh2 35.Ne3 Rg7 36.Qf6 Rh1+ 37.Kf2 Rh2+ 38.Ke1 (if Black keeps checking, White's king goes all the way to a3) 38...Rh1+ 39.Kd2 Rh2+

40.Kc1 Ne7

41.Nf5!, concluding the game. Out of inertia Black played a few more moves:

41...Rhg2 42.Nxg7 Rxg7 43.Qf8+ Ng8 44.Bxg8 Rxg8 45.Qf6+ Rg7 46.Qh4 1-0

Giri-Shirov, Hoogeveen 2014.

16...Kh8 17.Nce3

17...g6

The reason why 16.b3! is a better move-order than 16.Ra2 is the following line:

17...Bxe3! 18.Nxe3 Ne7 and now after 19.b3 white king is still on e1 and Black

equalizes with 19...f5, as for example in Karjakin-Topalov, Wijk aan Zee 2006. Now Ruslan goes for his master plan!

18.h4!

Interestingly, a couple of months later Anand did not follow White's bold plan and went for the relatively timid 18.O-O, giving Black a good game after 18...f5 in Anand-Kasparov, Linares 2005.

18...Bxh4

Again Black is not forced to accept the sacrifice but White has an easy advantage' after 18...Bxe3 19.Nxe3.

19.g3

19...Bf6

Facing a novel plan, Kramnik understood the danger and did not want to give White another tempo. A couple of months later, Vladimir utilizes Ruslan's idea on the White side and scored an easy win! Van Wely went for 19...Bg5 and Vladimir followed up on Pono's idea with 20.f4 exf4 21.gxf4 Bh4+ 22.Kf1 f5. With his pawn still on b2, White wants to take the maximum out of the position:

23.b4! (23.b3 transposes to Giri-Shirov). Now Black also needed to worry about the

move b5, harassing his knight at an unfortunate moment: 23...fxe4 24.Rah2 g5. It being a rapid game, White does not play in the most precise way. The most accurate was to immediately remove White's king from the pin on the f-file:

25.Ke2!+- (the game itself went 25.b5 Ne5 and now Black had some counterplay.

White eventually won in Kramnik-Van Wely, Monaco 2005). At a desirable moment White will take fxg5, unleashing the power of his doubled rooks. Black does not have a suitable defense, e.g. 25...Rf7 (protecting the h7-pwn with 25...Rb7 loses to

26.b5 and Black has no good answer; if 25...axb4, White comes first with 26.fxg5)

26.b5! and again Black does not have a good response.

20.b3

The second rank is almost cleared. White only has to push the f-pawn and the Ra2 will swing to the kingside with devastating power!

20...Bg7

Kramnik hopes his bishop will offer his king Dragon-like protection while creating counterplay on the e-file. Your computer engine will suggest 20...Kg7 21.f4 h5 - this looks passive and will probably not save Black.

21.f4 exf4 22.gxf4 Re8

Here Ponomariov missed an opportunity to create a masterpiece.

23.Qf3?

The best move was the bold and direct 23.Rah2!. Probably, Ruslan found it difficult to calculate the consequences of 23...Rxe4 (after 23...h6 24.Qf3 White has a crushing attack without any risk) 24.Rxh7+ Kg8 25.Qf3 Rxc4!. analysis diagram The position indeed looks complicated, and it's easy to understand that White did not go for this. He would have needed to see a beautiful mating net woven with 26.f5!! and Black does not have a good response as 26...Ne5 runs into 27.Rxg7+! Kxg7

28.f6+ Kg8 29.Rh8+! Kxh8 30.Qh1+ Kg8 31.Qh6 Qf8 32.Ne7+ Qxe7 33.Qg7#.

23...Kg8

A logical prophylactic move. Black does not want his h-pawn to be taken with check. The position is very complicated. Black's Bg7 is now protecting its king in 'Dragon fashion' and the silicon brain flashes with (some) zero-point-zero lines. To be honest, I am surprised that neither of the players cracked here and this crazy game ended in a draw!

24.Rah2 h5

Black's best defense was 24...Ne7! when the game may continue 25.Rxh7 Nxd5

26.Nxd5 (26.Bxd5 Qf6 looks fine for Black; again, similar to the Dragon Variation,

the dark-squared bishop is protecting its king and there is no mate) 26...Bf5. analysis diagram The white queen is urgently needed on the h-file: 27.Qf2! Rxe4+ 28.Kf1 Rxc4

29.Qh2 and most probably this mess now comes to a peaceful conclusion: 29...f6

30.Rh8+ Bxh8 31.Qxh8+ Kf7 32.Qh7+! Ke6 33.bxc4 Rb1+ 34.Kf2 Rxh1 35.Nc7+

Qxc7 36.Qxc7 Rh4 with equality.

25.Rxh5!?

Logical and principled! It is actually surprising that Black's defensive resources are sufficient. Stockfish thinks White needed to be a little more patient and would have had excellent attacking chances after 25.O-O or 25.Qg2.

25...gxh5 26.Qxh5

With his pawn defences removed, Black's king needs more defenders:

26...Re6! 27.Qh7+ Kf8 28.Rg1 Rg6 29.Rxg6 fxg6

The bishop is a strong defender; White cannot force mate by using his light-square domination only.

30.f5

If 30.Nf6, 30...Ne7! defends.

30...Qg5!

The active queen provides Black with counterplay.

31.Nf4! Ne7 32.Nxg6+ Ke8

White is a full rook down and needs to keep his attack going.

33.Nd5! Qg1+ 34.Kd2 Qg5+ 35.Ke1

Understanding there is no mate (and being a rook up), Vlad gets ambitious!

35...Bf6! 36.Ngxe7! Bxe7

37.Qh8+

Being a rook down, Ponomariov (very understandably and humanly!) looks for the most direct moves. I was very surprised that my engine considered White's domination enough compensation for the rook deficit and gave zeros after a 'pass move' like 37.Ke2.

37...Kd7 38.f6 Qg3+ 39.Ke2 Qg2+ 40.Ke3 Qg3+ 41.Ke2

Black still had winning hopes:

41...Qg4+ 42.Kf2

42.Ke3 should also have led to equality.

42...Bd8

Being a rook down, it is never easy to find quiet moves:

43.Bf1! Kc6

We could have had a spectacular finish with 43...Qxe4 44.Bg2 Qf5+ 45.Kg1 Bb7 (pinning the bishop with 45...Qg5?? leads to a disaster after 46.f7) 46.Bh3 and it peters out into a draw: 46...Bb6+ 47.Nxb6+ Kc6 48.Qxb8 Qxh3 49.Nc4 Qg3+=.

44.Qxd8

And Black decided to call it a day:

44...Qh4+ 45.Kg1 Qg3+ 1⁄2-1⁄2

I also played in this tournament, but it escaped my attention what an amazing game this was!! Chapter 5 French Defence: Winawer Variation The French is a strategically complex opening, with different (often unrelated) pawn structures, rich with ideas - enough material for a separate book. With limited space, I had to make a choice and you will notice that all my examples feature pawn structures from the Winawer Variation. Why did I choose these? Well, when I was in my 'formative years' (a junior player), I struggled to understand these Winawer type positions. I was approximately 2400 Elo, and I had trouble understanding that the positions that looked so great for White to me, were not so clear at all. Needless to say, computer programs did not exist, making my job harder. Per definition, White has more space in the centre and on the kingside, the pair of bishops, nice development, while Black has less space and a 'stupid' light-squared bishop locked in behind its own pawns. The doubled c-pawns White allows to grab the bishop pair look more like an 'academic weakness'. I assume that many of the readers will struggle to understand these complex positions just like I did forty years ago! That's why the Winawer pawn structures were my 'French choice' for this book. I have selected twelve games that, I think, illustrate well the strategic ideas for both sides in these complex positions. The weakness on e6 In the diagram, we have a typical position that is favourable for White. Black has traded his 'stupid French bishop' and even has potential c-file pressure, but he has one problem: the weakness on e6! White's knight is great on f4, keeping Black busy defending weak the e6-pawn, while White also has great prospects of a kingside attack. The first game I have selected is an excellent instructive example, Kasparov's play is logical, and his plans are relatively easy to replicate. Game 25 Garry Kasparov 2795 Nigel Short 2690 Novgorod 1997

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Qc7 7.Qg4 f5

A quite consequential decision (though taken by many top players, World Champion Botvinnik included). Black creates a permanent weakness on e6 for himself.

8.Qg3

8...cxd4

Fixing the central pawn structure. The more dynamic 8...Ne7 9.Qxg7 Rg8 10.Qxh7 cxd4 was tried in several Tal-Botvinnik games in the 1960 and 1961 World Championship matches. The basic problem for Black is that the modern treatment

11.Ne2!, as in Anand-Hansen, Middelfart 2003, gives White a strong initiative.

9.cxd4 Ne7

The greedy 9...Qxc2? is not a good idea here, as White can develop quickly and harmoniously while Black has to play some awkward moves: 10.Bd2 Qc7 11.Rc1 Nc6 12.Bb5. Now, in order to develop, Black has to go for 12...Kf7 and after 13.Ne2 Nge7 14.h4 Bd7 15.h5 h6 White has an initiative worth considerably more than the sacrificed pawn. Though White doesn't have an 'instant killer', Black cannot coordinate his pieces and in computer language this position is close to plus two.

10.Bd2 O-O

11.Bd3

Black is likely to play ...b6 followed by ...Ba6, trading off his bad bishop, while White (in this game and a number of others on top level) keeps his bishop on d2. It looks to me that White can win a tempo on Kasparov's play if he takes Bxa6 in 'one go' by playing 11.c3!? here. Black still has to continue his basic plan with 11...b6 and now White seeems to have a better version of the game after 12.h4 Ba6 13.Bxa6 (or 13.Nh3 Bxf1 14.Kxf1; or 13.h5) 13...Nxa6 14.Nh3.

11...b6 12.Ne2 Ba6

The typical French trade. Black solves the problem of his bad bishop; however, he will need one piece to defend the e6-weakness.

13.Nf4

White now gets long-term strategic pressure. 13.Bb4 looks active (and has worked well for White in practice), but it is not as good as it seems: 13...Bxd3 14.cxd3 Nbc6

15.Bd6 Qd7 16.O-O.

analysis diagram A) Black now unpinned his knight while also placing his rook on an open file with

16...Rfc8?!. This looks logical but is not best: 17.h4 Ng6 18.h5 Nh8 19.h6 g6.

Black's king is weak and White senses an opportunity: 20.Nf4! Nxd4 21.Ra2 Qb7. Now White would like to attack the Nd4 but first wants to prevent the retreat to b5:

22.a4! (22.Qe3 leads to unclear play: 22...Nb5 23.Nxe6 Re8 24.a4 d4! 25.Qe1 Nxd6

26.exd6 Qd7 27.Re2 Qxd6 with complications) 22...Rc6 23.Qe3! Nc2 24.Rxc2!

Rxc2 25.Nxe6. Black's king is weak and White has a winning attack. 25...Nf7

26.Nd4 Ra2

27.Nxf5! Nxd6 28.exd6! gxf5 29.Qg5+ Kf8. The pawn defences in front of Black's

king have been removed and White's rook joins the attack, putting game to an end:

30.Re1 Qf7 31.Re7 1-0 Diez del Corral-Portisch, Buenos Aires 1978;

B) Black could have exploited the fact that White's d4-pawn is shaky and taken the initiative with 16...f4! and Black is better, e.g. 17.Qg4 (or 17.Qf3 Rf7) 17...f3

18.gxf3 Rf7.

13...Qd7 14.h4

White can (again) place his bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal with 14.Bb4, however the outcome is not clear after 14...Rc8 followed by ...Bxd3 and ...Nbc6. It is perhaps good to mention that a number of strong players blundered here with

14...Bxd3? when White gets a large advantage after 15.Nh5!. Now, Black already

struggles to find moves to stay in the game: 15...Ng6 16.Bxf8 Ba6 17.Bxg7 Qa4! (after 17...Qb5 18.O-O-O Black had no compensation and White easily won in Brkic- Nikolic, Croatia tt 2008) 18.O-O-O Be2 19.Nf4 Bxd1 20.Rxd1 Nxf4 21.Qxf4 Qxa3+

22.Kd2 Nd7!. Black has prevented immediate annihilation, but White is clearly

better after 23.Bf6.

14...Bxd3 15.Qxd3

This is the position of our interest, and a good moment to take stock to trying to understand this type of position. Quite a number of top players (former World Champion Botvinnik included) have repeatedly picked the Black side here. Black has traded the 'right bishops' and has also fixed the pawn structure for the time being, as White has no immediate attack and no immediate pawn breaks. Black also has potential pressure on the c-file and an outpost on c4. What can be Black's problem? The pawn on e6 is a permanent weakness, and it is targeted by White's Nf4. Black cannot trade off this knight unless White voluntarily agrees to it. White will push his h-pawn, at least to h5 or maybe all the way to h6. He also has the potential g-pawn push (f3 followed by g4) and has an attack along the g-file, as happened in this game. Black's c4-outpost and c-file 'pressure' are of academic value. White has long-term pressure here, and potentially a swift attack as it is easy for Black to go wrong!

15...Nbc6

Some years later, Nigel Short tried to improve by first bringing his rook to the c4- outpost: 15...Rc8. His opponent of course knew the current game and copy-catted Kasparov's play: 16.Rh3! Rc4 (Black's 'active' rook on c4 doesn't have any value)

17.Rg3 Nbc6 18.c3 Rf8. Just like Garry, White now first took the time to improve

his king's position: 19.Kf1 Rf7 20.Kg1 Na5 21.a4 Qc6 22.Ra3 Kf8. Now is the time to bring the queen to the kingside (just like Garry): 23.Qb1! Nb7. Here, Black 'equalized' with a draw offer and the draw was agreed in Teran Alvarez-Short, Lanzarote 2003. In reality, if he had not been impressed by his opponent's high Elo rating, White could have continued like Kasparov with 24.Qd1 and built up a risk-free kingside attack. Stockfish 15 at a decent depth evaluates it as more than plus two! Kasparov goes for the immediate rook lift:

16.Rh3

16.h5 followed by Rh3 was an alternative.

16...Rac8

16...Ng6 most probably transposes into the same type position as in the game as

White retreats with 17.Ne2 followed by 18.h5.

17.Rg3 Rf7

A classic game by Botvinnik also mirrors the strategic decisions players have to take in this type of position, so let's have a look: 17...Kh8 18.h5 A) If Black is not in the mood to play ...h6, he can choose to transfer his knight to f7 with 18...Nd8 19.Kf1 (in case of 19.h6 g6 20.Kf1 Nf7 Black controls the entry points) 19...Nf7. analysis diagram White is better here as Black does not have any active counterplay. White will have to combine kingside threats with opening up the queenside to penetrate there; B) Reshevsky chose to determine the kingside pawn structure: 18...Rf7 19.h6 g6

20.Rc1 Rff8 21.Ne2! (preparing Bd2-g5-f6) 21...Nb8 22.Kf1 Rc4 23.Kg1 Nbc6

24.Bg5! Ng8 25.Re1 Qf7 26.c3 Na5 27.Nf4 Rc6.

B1) Probably in time pressure (which Reshevsky was known for), White gets impatient: 28.Bf6+? Nxf6 29.exf6 Nc4 (White can no longer play Rge3 and simply loses a pawn for nothing) 30.Qb1 (30.Qe2 Qxf6 31.Nxe6?? drops a piece to the simple 31...Re8) 30...Qxf6. Black is now a pawn up with an excellent position and won easily in Reshevsky-Botvinnik, The Hague/Moscow 1948; B2) The idea of Bf6+ followed by Nf4-h3-g5 needed to be prepared: 28.Rge3! Nc4

29.R3e2 Ne7 (29...Nxa3?? loses to 30.Bf6+! Nxf6 31.exf6 Re8 32.Nxd5) 30.Bf6+

Kg8. Now White improves his knight with 31.Nh3! Rfc8 32.Ng5 Qe8 33.a4 and Black has no active play. White will combine opening up the queenside with f3 and g4 (opening up the kingside). However, bear in mind that though your computer engine will give a clear advantage to White (considerably more than plus one!), White will need a precise execution to gain the full point.

18.h5

In the next couple of moves, Black has to decide whether to push ...h6 or not and White whether to push h6 himself (as Black will give him a couple of opportunities). It seems like Kasparov and Short mutually established ...h6 to be weakening for Black. Such pawn structure decisions are hard to take as there are no direct variations supporting them. Still, I think Black had to play 18...h6 here.

18...Nd8 19.c3 Rf8

Again, 19...h6 came into consideration.

20.Kf1 Rc4 21.Kg1 Nf7 22.a4 Rfc8

And again, 22...h6 was to be considered. Kasparov now skilfully improves his queen, generating different ideas:

23.Qb1!

Black has a passive position; however, the idea of holding on by 'sitting on his hands' will not work:

23...Nc6?

23...h6 was needed, though now White combines kingside pressure with the opening

of the queenside: 24.Qb5! (please note that a trade of the type 24.Ng6? Nxg6

25.Rxg6 is a terrible strategic mistake here, as White loses the crucial pressure on e6:

25...Nh8 26.Rg3 Nf7 and Black is doing well) 24...Qc6 25.Ra3 Kh7.

analysis diagram How can White improve here? Well, by opening up and penetrating the queenside:

26.Nd3! Qe8 (Black cannot say 'pass' as after for example 26...Kh8 White forces the

decision with 27.Nb2) 27.Qxe8 Rxe8 28.a5! b5 29.a6!. White's Rg3 now transfers to the queenside - Rg3-e3-e1-b1 - and Black has serious difficulties here.

24.Qd1

White could have considered 24.h6 g6 25.Nh5 Kh8 26.Nf6 as Black cannot remove the Nf6 with ...Ne7 and ...Ng8 due to 26...Qd8 27.Qb5! Ne7 28.a5!.

24...Ne7

Black now pays the price for not pushing ...h6. We are no longer just talking domination here, White gets a mating attack!

25.h6! g6

25...Nxh6?? loses a piece for nothing after the simple 26.Nh5 Ng4 27.f3 or 26...Ng6?

27.Bxh6+-.

26.Qh5!

Unable to stop White's threats, Black, understanding his position is lost anyway, grabs a pawn:

26...Rxa4

26...Kf8 runs into 27.Qh4 with 28. Qf6 to follow, and if 27...Ng8?, White wins with

28.Rxg6 hxg6 29.Nxg6+ Ke8 30.h7.

27.Rxa4

White had a pleasant alternative in 27.Re1 with the same winning attack as in the previous comment: 27...Kf8 28.Qh4 etc.

27...Qxa4

Probably feeling the job has been done, Kasparov now relaxes and does not execute in the best way:

28.Nxe6

A) The straightforward 28.Nxg6? hxg6 29.Rxg6+ Nxg6 30.Qxg6+ Kf8 31.h7 does not win as after 31...Qd1+ 32.Kh2 Qxd2 33.Qf6 Black has perpetual check with

33...Qf4+ 34.Kg1 Qc1+;

B) The most precise execution was the 'prophylactic attacking king move' 28.Kh2!. White now threatens 29. Nxg6 while, compared to 28. Nxg6 line, Black can no longer save himself by perpetual check, e.g.: B1) 28...Qd7 29.Nxg6 hxg6 30.Rxg6+ Nxg6 31.Qxg6+ Kf8 32.h7 Qd8 33.Bg5; B2) 28...Qc2 only delays the inevitable after 29.Be3 or the immediate 29.Qh4; B3) 28...Rc6 29.Nxg6 hxg6 30.Rxg6+ Nxg6 31.Qxg6+ Kf8 32.h7 (now Black does not have the saving check on d1) 32...Qd1 33.Bh6+ Ke7 34.Bg5+.

28...Qc2?

This loses on the spot. Interestingly, Black could have continued fighting with 28...Rc6! when White's next two moves are more or less forced: 29.Nf4 Kf8 30.Qe2 analysis diagram and now after 30...g5! yes, White does stand better but the issue is far from decided.

29.Qh4! f4 30.Bxf4 Nf5 31.Rxg6+

Black resigned as after 31...hxg6 White has various ways to win, the following line being convincing enough: 32.h7+ Kh8 33.Qf6+ Kxh7 (the only thing White needs to pay attention to is not to blunder into a perpetual check by ...Qd1+ and ...Qh5+)

34.Qxf7+ Kh8 and now White can go for mate: 35.Qf6+ (the simple 35.Qxg6 wins

as well) 35...Kh7 36.Ng5+ Kh6 37.Ne4+ Kh7 38.Qf7+ Kh8 39.Nf6 Ng7 40.Bh6. Kingside attack White is going to play for a kingside attack, while Black will push his pawns on the queenside, trying to create counterplay. This particular position is favourable for White because his knight on f4 is excellently placed, supporting a quick kingside attack. The same (pawn structure) position with a white knight on f3 would have had been rather unclear (as it will take White more time to start a kingside attack. I have selected two games emphasizing this point. The fixed central pawn chain Game 26 Sergey Karjakin 2778 Francisco Vallejo Pons 2697 Sao Paulo/Bilbao 2012

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4

7...O-O

Another main, more theoretical line here is 7...cxd4 8.Qxg7 Rg8 9.Qxh7 Qc7. I will not analyse it in this book because there are too many theoretical ('computer prep') lines here. The sideline 7...Kf8 avoids direct threats; however, Black will need to lose time solving his king problem, as for example in Anand-Xiong, Wijk aan Zee 2020. The sideline 7...Nf5 is no longer played at top level, and probably for a good reason, see Stein-Petrosian, Moscow 1961 further on in this French chapter.

8.Bd3

Modern theory regards this as the main line here. 8.Nf3 used to be played at top level - see Mecking-Korchnoi, Wijk aan Zee 1978. Black is now at a crossroads; he has to decide on the type of pawn structure we are going to get.

8...Nbc6

This leads to a closed structure. The alternative 8...f5 9.exf6 Rxf6, resulting in a quite different pawn structure, is another often played line here - see Anand- Timman, Dortmund 1999.

9.Qh5!

Modern theory considers this the most precise move here.

9.Nf3 can still transpose into Mecking-Korchnoi (the move-order with 8.Nf3 Nbc6

9.Bd3).

9...Ng6

Seeing this position, I recall playing my first Dortmund super-tournament 34 years ago, walking along the tables and seeing a former Soviet champion, the famous grandmaster Lev Psakhis, getting massacred. Engines did not exist at the time... opening preparation was at a considerably lower level, and poor Lev played 9...h6?? when thunder struck at once with 10.Bxh6!. Black's position is already lost!

10...gxh6 11.Qxh6 Nf5 12.Bxf5 exf5 13.O-O-O f4 (or 13...c4 14.Nh3 Qe7 15.Nf4+-)

14.Nh3 (even more effective/brutal was 14.Rd3 Ne7

analysis diagram

15.Rg3+!! Ng6 16.Ne2) 14...Bf5 15.Nxf4 with a winning attack; White won after a

few more moves in Kindermann-Psakhis, Dortmund 1989. The kingside pawn structure is likely to change soon. White will soon capture Bxg6 when Black recaptures ...fxg6 so White positions himself for this change of structure.

10.Nf3

Modern theory considers 10.Nh3! to be the most precise, see Caruana-Shankland, Saint Louis 2016.

10...Qc7 11.Be3

Vallejo decides to force the mentioned pawn structure change.

11...c4

Black can opt for a different pawn structure with 11...Nce7!? 12.h4 Nf5 when the pawns are not fixed and the game is rather 'fluid'. We have an interesting game of Anand here. White's chances are related to a kingside attack, so the knight on f5 needs to be harassed: 13.g4! Nxe3 14.fxe3 cxd4. A critical moment! A) Vishy opts for the most logical continuation, but it's not the best: 15.cxd4 Qc3+!

16.Ke2 Bd7. White's exposed king should provide Black with enough counterplay

for a draw: 17.Rab1! (White eliminates Black's ...Bb5 while penetrating the b-file; if

17.Ng5 h6 18.Nxf7 Rxf7 19.Qxg6 Black forces a perpetual check with 19...Rf2+!

20.Kxf2 Qd2+ 21.Kg3 Qxe3+=) 17...Be8 18.Ng5 h6 19.Rxb7! Qc8! 20.Rhb1.

It looks as if Black will crumble under the mating attack, but the bad position of White's queen offers defensive resources: 20...Nxe5? (a crucial mistake. Black has the right idea - to save the game by trapping White's queen - but fails in the execution. He could have saved the game with 20...f5! 21.exf6 Rxf6. analysis diagram White's queen is trapped, so he has to be careful: 22.Nh7! Rf5! and here White has only one move to stay in the game!: 23.Qxh6! gxh6 24.gxf5 exf5 and it ends in perpetual check: 25.Nf6+ Kf8 26.Nh7+ Kg8 27.Nf6+=) 21.dxe5 f5. analysis diagram Now the queen-trapping idea does not work so well: 22.exf6! Rxf6 (22...Bxh5? runs into mate in two with 23.Bh7+ Kh8 24.fxg7#) 23.Nf7! Rxf7 (or 23...Bxf7 24.Qe5 with a winning advantage for White) 24.Rxf7 Bxf7 25.Qe5. With material equal, White has an attack plus domination, and he went on to win, Anand-Lputian, Moscow 2004; B) Precise was 15.O-O!. With his king in safety, White can focus on the attack:

15...f6 (Black gets mated in case of 15...dxe3 16.Ng5 h6 17.Bxg6 fxg6 18.Qxg6

hxg5 19.Rxf8+ Kxf8 20.Rf1+ Kg8 21.Qe8+ Kh7 22.Rf8) 16.cxd4 (White's central pawn structure is now compact, while his king is safe) 16...Bd7 17.Rf2! and Black is in bad shape. White wants to double his rooks or take on g6 and collect a pawn for free. 17...Be8? does not help as White simply builds up with 18.Raf1 and has a winning attack.

12.Bxg6 fxg6 13.Qg4

White's central pawn chain makes it difficult for Black to obtain immediate counterplay here, while White wants to regroup and start a pawn storm on the kingside. Vallejo now regroups well, slowing down White's pawn storm:

13...Qf7!

At first glance, doubling rooks on the f-file looks logical: 13...Bd7 14.h4 Rf5 15.Qh3 (White wants to push g4) 15...Raf8 and now Anand started an instructive manoeuvre: 16.Ng1! Qa5 17.Ne2 Qa4 18.Kd2. White wants to render Black's doubled rooks 'obsolete' with 19. f4 followed by g4, storming the kingside. 18...Rxf2 19.Bxf2 Rxf2 (hoping for counterplay, but Anand is not afraid of ghosts) 20.h5! Rxe2+ 21.Kxe2 Qxc2+ 22.Kf1 gxh5 23.Kg1 Qg6

24.Qxh5 and White soon won in Anand-Ramirez, Mallorca 2004.

14.Ng5 Qe8

The 'active' 14...Qf5? traps his own queen after 15.Qe2 with a close to winning advantage for White in Kasparov-Short, Munich 1994.

15.h4

An important moment. Vallejo skilfully regroups, not giving White a free hand for a kingside pawn storm:

15...Ne7!

In case of 15...Bd7 16.Qe2! White's pawn roll works to perfection. Now, 16...Ne7 comes too late: 17.g4! Qd8 18.Kd2 b5 19.h5 gxh5 20.Rxh5 h6 21.Rah1 and White had a winning attack in Almasi-Lputian, Kemer 2007.

16.a4!?

Karjakin decides to place his bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal. However, this will involve a pawn sacrifice. In case of 16.Qe2, trying to roll the pawns like Almasi did (see the above comment after 15...Bd7), Black has defensive resources: 16...h6 17.Nh3 analysis diagram

17...Nf5!. Now White has an interesting pawn sacrifice: 18.g4!? (18.Nf4 does not

seem to achieve much for White as after 18...Bd7, 19.g4?? blunders into 19...Nxh4

20.Rxh4 g5) 18...Nxh4 19.f4. However, Black seems to be holding: 19...Bd7 20.Ng1

Qe7 21.Qh2 g5 22.fxg5 analysis diagram

22...Rf3! 23.Kd2 Rxe3! 24.Qxh4 Re4 with probably a draw after 25.gxh6 Qxh4

26.Rxh4 gxh6.

[diagram]
Black fixes a target on a4, getting ready to attack it. White goes for his regular pawn roll plan.

17.Qe2 Bd7

17...h6 18.Nh3 Nf5 is risky for Black here as the white bishop transfers to the a3-f8

diagonal with 19.Bc1.

18.g4

Black defends his e6-pawn and is now ready to collect on a4.

18...Ra6

Black could have also opted for 18...h6 19.Nh3 Bxa4. This position is very sharp and difficult to evaluate; your engine will give zeros after 20.h5 gxh5 21.g5 hxg5

22.Bxg5 Nf5.

Karjakin continues his plan to place his bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal.

19.Bc1

An alternative was the typical pawn break 19.h5 h6 20.Nh3 gxh5 21.g5.

19...Bxa4!

White has an attack, Black has material. Also Black has ...b5 and counterplay with the ...b4 pawn push.

20.Ba3 h6 21.Nh3 b5

The most direct. Retreating the bishop by 21...Bd7 with ...b5 to follow was an alternative.

22.Bc5 Rc6 23.Bd6 Rf7

A razor-sharp position, and both players were probably under severe time pressure. The objective assessment is a 'dynamic balance'... well... yes, if computer engines are playing. In a game between humans, (serious) mistakes are bound to happen. I strongly recommend to test your calculation skills here (and in the ensuing positions) and compare the results with the silicon brain lines. There are many lines here, and I will give what I consider the most important ones. There is no time to waste and Karjakin goes for a typical pawn break in these structures:

24.h5 gxh5

24...g5 was the alternative. Now White should prepare f4: 25.O-O Nc8 26.Bc5 with

sharp play: 26...Rxc5 27.dxc5 Qf8 and the objective assessment will be 'dynamic balance' and 'fire on board', e.g. 28.f4 gxf4 29.Rf3

25.g5 Nf5 26.gxh6 Nxh6

26...g6 was the alternative.

Most likely running short of time, Karjakin followed the logic 'whatever happens, my rooks need to get connected' and played:

27.Kd2?

This should have cost him the game. The exchange sac 27.Rxa4? does not work: 27...bxa4 28.Qxh5 Rb6-+. White had to opt for 27.Qxh5! and after 27...Bxc2 28.Rg1, analysis diagram Black needs to stay calm and focus on his own chances: 28...b4! (28...Kh8 leads to an ending where White dominates after 29.Ng5! Rf8 30.Qxe8 Rxe8 31.Rxa5)

29.Qxh6! Rxd6! 30.exd6 b3 with hair-raising complications and 'easy zeros'

(achieved via different lines) for my friend Mr. Stockfish.

27...Rf5!

Defending the h5-pawn!

28.Rhg1

28...Rb6! 29.f3 b4!

Counterplay time!

30.Qe3 Nf7 31.Bc5 Rb7 32.Rg2

32...Qb5?

It's not easy to remain calm in such situations (and probably in severe time trouble) but Black needed to cold-bloodedly continue his plan: 32...b3! 33.Rag1 b2!

34.Rxg7+ Kh8.

analysis diagram Probably Vallejo could not assess this position and opted for the 'safer' 32...Qb5. In reality Black queens while White has just a few checks: A) 35.Ng5 might look dangerous but Black has two ways to refute it: 35...Rxg5 (the bold 35...Kxg7 also wins: 36.Nxf7+ Kxf7 37.Qh6 Qg8 38.Rxg8 Kxg8 39.Qxe6+ Rff7 and White runs out of checks 40.Qg6+ Rg7 41.Qe6+ Rbf7 42.Qb6 and now Black queens after 42...Bb3!) 36.R7xg5 Nxg5 37.Qxg5 and Black has only one winning move here, but it's pretty convincing: 37...Kh7!; B) 35.Nf4 b1Q! and Black wins: 36.Rxb1 Rxb1 37.Rg6 Kh7.

33.Rag1?

Precise was 33.cxb4! axb4 34.Rag1 and now Black needs to find a path to stay alive with 34...Nxe5! 35.dxe5 c3+ 36.Ke1 analysis diagram

36...b3!. Now White has to play for mate: 37.Qh6 Rxe5+ 38.Be3 (Black needs to

distract White) 38...Rxe3+! 39.Qxe3 b2 (White can't allow Black to have two queens) 40.Kf2 b1Q 41.Qxe6+ Kh8 42.Rxb1 Qc5+! 43.Kg3 Rxb1 and due to the weak black king White has enough compensation to hold the balance.

33...bxc3+?

He doesn't take his chance. Black could have won with 33...Nxe5! 34.dxe5 and now White would have regretted not having taken 33.cxb4!: 34...bxc3+! and Black wins as White's king is simply too exposed 35.Ke2 (or 35.Ke1 Qb1+) 35...Qb2 (35...Bxc2).

34.Ke2

34...Nxe5?

Now the same idea does not bring Black the same result. The game could have been saved with 34...Ng5! 35.Nxg5 Qb2 36.Rc1 Bxc2... analysis diagram ... and now we can get a 'science fiction' variation: 37.Ke1 Bd3 38.Rxb2! cxb2

39.Ba3! b1Q 40.Rxb1 Rxb1+ 41.Bc1 a4.

analysis diagram Black seems to be queening/winning, however his king is weak: 42.Nxe6! a3

43.Nxg7! Kxg7 44.Qh6+ and White saves the draw.

35.Qh6!

Due to the fact that Black played 33....bxc3?, Black now does not have 35...Nxf3 with check!

35...Rff7 36.Qxe6!

Black now defends best under the circumstances:

36...Ng4! 37.Ng5!

37...Qb2?

This blunders into checkmate, putting an immediate end to this wild game. Black could have struggled on with 37...Qxc5! 38.dxc5 Rbe7; however, White still has a winning advantage after 39.fxg4 Rxe6+ 40.Nxe6 Re7. analysis diagram Now the time control would have been reached, and Karjakin would probably have found 41.gxh5 Rxe6+ 42.Kd1 d4 (Black's king is badly placed here) 43.Rxg7+ Kh8

44.Rg8+ Kh7 45.R1g7+ Kh6 and some precision is still needed:

analysis diagram

46.Rg4! (not 46.Rg6+? Rxg6 47.Rxg6+ Kxh5 with a draw) 46...Kh7 (46...Kxh5

loses to 47.Rg3 Kh4 48.Rg1) 47.R8g7+ Kh6 (or 47...Kh8? 48.R7g6 Rxg6 49.hxg6 d3 50.Rxc4) 48.R7g6+ Rxg6 (48...Kxh5 49.Rxe6 Kxg4 50.Re4+) 49.hxg6 d3 and now White can have a bit of fun choosing between the prosaic 50.Rxc4 or the more entertaining 50.g7 Bxc2+ 51.Kc1 Bb3 52.g8N+!

38.Qc8+ 1-0

The closed centre: White gets a 'perfect' attack Game 27 Fabiano Caruana 2796 Samuel Shankland 2656 Saint Louis ch-USA 2016 Perhaps it would be going too far to say that this game 'closed' the variation seen in Karjakin-Vallejo Pons but actually, in essence it did! Caruana regroups his pieces better and thereby gets a better/quicker attack. The mistakes Shankland made... well, it's not easy to say... could Sam have had played it differently? Yes. Could he at any point in time got something like equality? No. After this game (up to the moment of this writing) we no longer have top level games in this line. So, let's see.

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 Ne7 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 c5 7.Qg4 O-O 8.Bd3 Nbc6

9.Qh5 Ng6

So far we are following Karjakin-Vallejo. White's chances are on the kingside. Caruana readies his attack much better than Karjakin:

10.Nh3!

What is point behind this knight development? Caruana (correctly) anticipates that soon, just like in Karjakin-Vallejo Pons, the transaction ...c4; Bxg6 fxg6 is going to happen and he wants to be able to place his knight on f4 and immediately start pushing his kingside pawns. White will win considerable time compared to Karjakin- Vallejo Pons. Karjakin took three moves to place his knight on h3 while Caruana needed only one, while the pawn structure and the situation were more or less the same. For 10.Nf3 see Karjakin-Vallejo Pons, Sao Paulo/Bilbao 2012 (previous game).

10...Qc7

If Black wants to deviate, he should now or on the next move analyse 10...Nce7 though it is not clear if this brings any advantages to Black. For example, now White a slightly unusual tactical motif created by Black's last move: 11.Bh6 and after

11...Nf5 (11...gxh6?? 12.Qxh6 leads to a disaster for Black) 12.Bd2 it is not clear

what Black has achieved with his knight pirouette, while the pawn grab 12...cxd4

13.cxd4

analysis diagram

13...Nxd4?? is a suicide after the simple 14.Ng5 h6 15.Nxf7.

11.Be3 c4

Here Black can also decide to deviate with 11...Nce7 and here we have a top-level game with Judit Polgar playing White. Black hopes to be 'more ready' for White's kingside attack. True to her style, Judit takes immediate action, and doesn't mind sacrificing a pawn in the process: 12.f4 (12.g4!? with a similar plan was another interesting option) 12...Qa5 13.Bd2 Qa4

14.g4! (direct and principled! In case of 14.dxc5 Black gets some compensation for

the pawn after 14...b6). Black will be under attack anyway, so he'd better grab a pawn: 14...c4! 15.Be2 Qxc2 16.Rc1 Qb2. Now White needs to provoke ...h6 in order to create a target: 17.Ng5 h6 18.Nh3 f6 19.g5 hxg5. A critical moment! Judit may have underestimated Black's defensive resources:

20.exf6? (she had to move her bishop to the b1-h7 diagonal: 20.Bd1! followed by

Bc2, with good compensation) 20...Rxf6! (prepares ...Nf8) 21.Nxg5 Nf8 and suddenly Black was better, though later the game ended in a draw, J. Polgar-Hillarp Persson, Malmö 2000.

12.Bxg6 fxg6 13.Qg4 Qf7 14.Nf4!

The point behind 10.Nh3.

14...Ne7

15.h4!

We have a situation similar to the Karjakin-Vallejo game, White having more or less two extra tempi.

15...h6

Caruana goes for the most straightforward and principled plan: pushing pawns on the kingside.

16.Qe2!

Deciding on Karjakin's idea with 16.a4!? and Bc1 also made sense here, as White has gained some time.

16...Bd7 17.g4!

Black's only possible counterplay is on the queenside.

17...b5 18.f3 a5

White needs to decide what to do with his king. It will be perfectly safe on the g3- square!

19.Kf2! Rab8 20.Kg3 Be8

21.Bd2

Fabiano takes his time, but there was no need to hesitate! White could have started an immediate attack with 21.h5! and Black does not have good way to stop it: A) In case of 21...b4 White opts for the simple 22.axb4 axb4 23.cxb4 Rxb4 24.hxg6 Nxg6 25.Nh5 analysis diagram and White has too many threats: Bxh6 or Nxg7. Active defence does not exist here as 25...Rb2 (25...Ra4 26.Raf1 only delays the execution) loses to 26.Bxh6! gxh6 (or

26...Rxc2 27.Qe3) 27.Nf6+ Kg7 28.Rxh6.

analysis diagram Black cannot prevent the mating threats: 28...Rh8 29.Rxh8 Nxh8 30.Qh2 Qg6 and now White comes from the other side: 31.Ra8 (31.Ra7+ wins a well, e.g. 31...Bf7

32.Ra8) 31...Rxc2 32.Qh4 etc.;

B) 21...g5 22.Nh3 g6 (22...b4 again does not give Black even a glimpse of counterplay: 23.axb4 axb4 24.cxb4 Rxb4 25.f4! gxf4+ 26.Nxf4 and now one of the rooks goes to f1 and the game is decided) 23.hxg6 analysis diagram

23...Qxg6 (if 23...Nxg6, White wins with a thematic sacrifice: 24.Nxg5! hxg5

25.Bxg5 and the h-file penetration combined with Bf6 proves fatal for Black). Now

White wins by simply doubling on the h-file: 24.Rh2 b4 25.axb4 axb4 26.cxb4 Rxb4

27.Rah1 Rb2 28.Ng1 (28.Nxg5 hxg5 29.Qd2 also wins).

Black's only chance here is via queenside counterplay, otherwise White wins as shown in the comment to 21.h5.

21...b4! 22.axb4 axb4

23.Rhb1!

23.cxb4? is not a good idea as Black gets real counterplay after 23...c3 24.Be3 Nc6.

23...Nc6 24.Qe3 b3

At first glance, it may look as if Shankland has created counterplay. However, Caruana calmly forces some necessary trades and dooms Black to passivity for the rest of the game. Very instructive play!

25.Bc1! Bd7 26.Ba3 bxc2

27.Rc1! Rfc8 28.Rxc2

Now White will penetrate with his rook on the queenside, while his Nf4 keeps Black busy defending his weaknesses.

28...Ra8 29.Rca2 Be8

Black could have tried 29...Ra5 30.Bd6 Rca8, hoping for a rooks trade: 31.Rxa5 Rxa5. analysis diagram Now what to trade and what to keep? White needs to keep one rook to be able to penetrate on the queenside! 32.Rb1, and ultimately the outcome will be similar to the game. A colossal strategic mistake would have been 32.Rxa5? Nxa5 as without the rooks Black is likely to survive here.

30.Bd6 Rxa2 31.Rxa2 Qd7 32.Qc1 Bf7

33.Qb1!

Forcing Black into absolute passivity.

33...Qe8 34.Qb7! Kh7 35.Ra6! Kg8

Black does not have any active moves, so Fabiano decides to reach the time control and then decide on the execution.

36.Bc7 Ne7 37.Bd6 Nc6 38.Kg2 Kh7 39.Kh3 Kg8 40.Kg3 Kh7

Obviously White has total domination, but how to win? Caruana's plan is instructive: fix the kingside when Black will have no moves, bring the Nf4 to the queenside and Black's defence, already pushed to the limit, will eventually break.

41.Nh3 Kg8 42.g5! h5

Black cannot say 'pass' as 42...Kh7? loses even faster after 43.gxh6 gxh6 44.Nf2. Now the knight starts on its journey.

43.Nf4! Kh7 44.Ng2 Bg8 45.Ne3 Bf7 46.Nc2 Bg8 47.Na3 Bf7

Not willing to risk blundering, Caruana brings his king to 'maximum safety' first.

48.Kf2 Bg8 49.Ke3 Bf7

The queen swap brings Black no salvation; 49...Qf7 50.Qxf7 Bxf7 51.Nb5 Kg8

52.Bc5 is hopeless.

50.Kd2 Bg8 51.Kc2 Bf7 52.Kc1

White's king is safe; now the knight will enter, forcing resignation.

52...Kg8

52...Bg8 is a similar story: 53.Nb5 and let's say Black hopes for some miracle

perpetual check: 53...Ne7 54.Na7! (54.Bxe7 is not a piece win after 54...Rb8!)

54...Qf7 55.Nxc8 Qf4+ 56.Kb1 Qd2 57.Nxe7. Black has lost all his pieces and only

has a few checks to give before resigning.

53.Nb5! Ne7

54.Na7! 1-0

Not 54.Bxe7?? when Black gets his piece back with 54...Rb8! and has good chances to save himself. An impressive and instructive game by Caruana. A dream situation for Black! Black has pushed his f-pawn, and the transaction exf6 Rxf6 has taken place. Black has timed his ...c4-pawn push well, gaining space and removing White's Bd3 from its active post. Black has also managed the difficult to execute improvement of his queen's bishop (...Bd7-e8-g6). White's bishops are passive (hitting their own pawns), while his damaged queenside structure is no longer an 'academic weakness'. This was a great game by Korchnoi, as we will see below. A true masterclass! Black plays ...f6 exf6 Rxf6 Game 28 Henrique Mecking 2630 Viktor Korchnoi 2665 Wijk aan Zee 1978 This game is very instructive for a good understanding of this type of positions and is another great example of how a game can be lost while playing only 'logical' moves.

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4 O-O 8.Nf3

As mentioned in this chapter, modern theory regards 8.Bd3 as best and in this particular line, 8.Bd3 offers White extra possibilities - see Anand-Timman, Game 29.

8...Nbc6 9.Bd3

Korchnoi now goes for another typical Winawer pawn structure:

9...f5 10.exf6 Rxf6

We have a theoretical position, seen in many top-level games. Let's try to take stock. Black has seemingly weakened his kingside (pawn structure). White, with his active queen, bishop pair and knight, is ready to attack (he definitely has enough attackers) and can force Black to play either ...h6 or ...g6, weakening his king position further. Based on these arguments, logically White should be doing very well here. However, in reality things are rather complex. White's attack is not easy to develop, and Black's king is safer than it looks. White's active queen can be easily targeted (the ...e5 break, the ...Nf5 jump), the seemingly well placed Bd3 can be easily removed from its post by the ...c4 push. Your computer engine will tell you that the position is complex and that Black is not worse. However, I remember analysing these positions about 35-40 years back - in pre- computer days, when I was already a strong junior player. Firstly, I did not exactly understand why a player like Korchnoi kept playing such 'stupid positions' as Black. Next, I was not able to find a convincing way for White to develop his attack, and ultimately I came to the conclusion that these positions were unclear and Black may easily get the upper hand.

11.Qh5

Mecking decides to provoke ...h6. White could also have decided to provoke ...g6 with 11.Bg5 Rf7: A) Parting with his bishop in order to force Black's rook to e7 does not bring White an advantage: 12.Bxe7 Rxe7 13.Qh4 g6 and Black's king is less weak than it may look: 14.O-O. Now we see an important part of Black's strategy in this type of position. White's bishop is removed from its post, while Black takes space! 14...c4! 15.Be2 Qf8

16.Rfe1 Bd7 17.Bf1 Rae8 (Black is harmoniously developed and soon it will be the

second player who explores his attacking options on the kingside) 18.Qg5 Rf7

19.Qd2 Qd6 (White has to start watching out for the ...Rxf3 exchange sacrifice)

20.Ne5 Nxe5 21.Rxe5 Ref8. Black's pressure on the f-file fully compensates for the

weakness of his e6-pawn and - very important to notice - White's weak a3-pawn needs to be defended(!). Black had a comfortable position and went on to win in Ljubojevic-Beliavsky, Tilburg 1984; B) 12.Qh5 g6 13.Qh4. At first glance, White has a great attacking position. The reality, however, is quite different. First, White's bishops will be removed from their attacking posts and then his queen suddenly becomes a target. Probably, the objective assessment of the position should be 'dynamic, complex play with mutual chances'. 13...c4! 14.Be2 Qa5! 15.Bd2 Nf5 16.Qg5 (readers interested in opening theory should explore

16.Qh3!? here as White is now more ready for his g4 pawn push, while 16...e5? does

not seem to work as after 17.Nxe5! Nxe5 18.dxe5 Black does not have a good jump with his Nf5) 16...Bd7. Now, aiming to seize the initiative, Ljubojevic makes a risky decision: 17.g4!? (the alternative was 17.O-O with unclear play after 17...Nd6 or

17...Raf8 followed by ...Nf5-d6-e4) 17...Nd6 18.h4 Ne4 19.Qe3.

A critical moment! Black can seize the initiative but, as usual in such sharp positions, precision is needed. B1) Korchnoi went for 19...Raf8. After 20.h5 gxh5 21.Rxh5 Rg7 the game was unclear and White eventually emerged victorious in Ljubojevic-Korchnoi, Linares 1985; B2) The immediate central pawn break is Black's best option here: 19...e5! and White is in trouble. His best option is to try to create attacking chances of his own with 20.h5 exd4

21.Nxd4. An important moment! Black should keep the h-file closed! 21...g5!

(21...Re8 22.hxg6 hxg6 23.Rh6 with unclear play and a later draw was seen in Ernst- Hansen, Ostersund 1992). Now White has to disturb Black's knight: 22.f3 (22.Nxc6? Bxc6 23.f3 is wrong as after 23...d4! 24.cxd4 Nxd2 25.Qxd2 c3 26.Qd3 Qc7 White's king is weak) 22...Nxd4 and Black gets a better endgame after 23.cxd4 (23.Qxd4? is asking for trouble in view of 23...Re8!) 23...Qxd2+ 24.Qxd2 Nxd2 25.Kxd2 Re8.

11...h6 12.O-O

Now Black takes an important and typical strategic decision in such positions which we already mentioned in the above comments:

[diagram]
White Bd3 is removed from its post while Black gains space! It is important to note that Black should not postpone this decision for too long as at some stage White will take dxc5.

13.Be2 Qa5 14.Bd2

A fancy move like 14.Bg5? does not work for White here: 14...hxg5 15.Nxg5 Ng6 and White will soon regret his decision to sacrifice.

14...Bd7

An important moment! White has to be careful not to become worse and needs to jump with his knight to e5 here.

15.Rfb1?!

15.Ne5! was needed and now:

A) 15...Be8! 16.Qh4 (White does not get enough compensation for his pawn after

16.Qh3 Nxd4 17.Bg4 Ndf5)

16...Nf5 (an interesting strategic decision here was to enter a 2 Ns vs 2Bs fight with

16...Bg6!? 17.Nxg6 Nxg6 18.Qg4 Raf8 where Black is definitely not worse)

17.Nxc6 (17.Qg4? Nfxd4) 17...Bxc6 18.Qf4 Raf8 with equality in the game Jaracz-

Khusnutdinov, chess.com 2021; B) 15...Nxe5 16.Qxe5 Nc6 is less convincing for Black as after 17.Qe3 Be8 18.Bg4 Bg6 19.Bxe6+ Kh7 20.Bd7 Bxc2 21.Rfe1 Raf8 22.f3 Qc7

23.Bxc6! though your engine will give you around zeros, this opposite-coloured

bishops position is, due to his safer king and more active bishop, easier to play for White who ended up victorious in the game Zelcic-Nisipeanu, Zagreb 2019.

15...Qc7 16.Nh4?

White wants to push f4 in order to stop Black's ...e5 push. The consequence of this strategic decision (a mistake that will cost White the game) is that White's Bd2 will be passive, surrounded by its own pawns, whilc Black's bishop will become a monster once it is transferred to g6. This was White's last chance to go for 16.Ne5! and after 16...Be8 17.Qg4 Nxe5... analysis diagram ... White needs to decide on the dynamic 18.Qg3! (18.dxe5 is better for Black after

18...Qxe5 19.Rxb7 Qd6). Now the position looks better for Black to me, however

Stockfish finds dynamic ways for White to keep the balance.

16...Raf8 17.f4 Be8! 18.Qg4

18...Ng6!

The right trade!

19.Nxg6 Bxg6

White is strategically lost! Korchnoi's execution is instructive and done with a steady hand.

20.Ra2

Black's Nc6 needs to be improved.

20...Ne7! 21.Rab2 b6 22.Qh3 Nf5 23.Re1 Qe7 24.Ra2

Note the poor Ra2 - out of play and defending the weak a3- and c2-pawns. Black's N+B totally dominate White's two Bs here.

24...Nd6 25.Bf3 Ne4 26.Bxe4

A sad neccessity. White has to enter a strategically lost opposite-coloured bishops position.

26...Bxe4 27.g3 Qf7 28.Qg4

Time for Black to open up the kingside and launch a direct attack:

[diagram]
Now White has to try to bring his rook into play, so Black can collect a pawn for free.

29.Raa1 Rf5 30.Rf1 Bxc2 31.Rf2 Qg6 32.Re1 Be4

White could have safely resigned here. Black threatens 33...h5 and White's position will collapse. The rest of the game does not need any comment: White gives an exchange and, probably driven by inertia, plays some more unnecessary moves.

33.Rxe4 dxe4 34.Kf1 Rb5 35.Qe2 Rb1+ 36.Kg2 Rb2 37.Qxc4 e3 38.Bxe3 Qe4+

39.Kh3 Rxf2 40.Bxf2 gxf4 41.gxf4 Rxf4 42.Bg3 Rf5 43.Qc8+ Rf8 44.Qc4 h5

45.Qb5 Qg4+ 46.Kg2 h4

And White resigned. A powerful instructive strategic lecture by Korchnoi! A happy scenario for White The pawn structure is almost the same as in the previous diagram, but with some small differences! Here, Black's bishop is passive on d7 while White's bishop is excellently placed on e5, and Black's king is potentially vulnerable. White is happy here. This was a great game by Anand. The advantage of White's knight still being on g1 Game 29 Viswanathan Anand 2771 Jan Timman 2650 Dortmund 1999

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 Ne7 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 c5 7.Qg4 O-O 8.Bd3

As we will see, this move-order gives White an important extra option compared to the game Mecking-Korchnoi we just saw.

8...f5 9.exf6 Rxf6

Now White first provokes ...g6, weakening the dark squares:

10.Bg5 Rf7 11.Qh5 g6

Now White uses the fact that he played 8.Bd3 instead of 8.Nf3:

12.Qd1!

Black now has a vulnerable kingside while, compared to Ljubojevic-Korchnoi (in the comments to the game Mecking-Korchnoi), White's queen is not exposed.

12...Nbc6

Black will place his queen on f8 in order to push ...h6. Another possible plan for Black was 12...Qa5 13.Bd2 and now: A) In case Black opts for 13...Nbc6 14.Nf3 c4 (opening the centre with 14...Qc7

15.O-O e5 plays into White's hands here as after 16.dxe5 Nxe5 17.Be2 Bd7 18.Re1

the open position suits the side with a bishop pair, and also Black has problems defending his central d5-pawn, e.g. 18...Nxf3+ 19.Bxf3 Bc6 20.Bg5 (20...Rd8, moving under the pin, is not really an option here) 20...Raf8 21.Bxe7 Rxe7

22.Bxd5+ Bxd5 23.Qxd5+ and White was a sound pawn up and went on to win in

Eljanov-Naiditsch, Douglas 2016) 15.Be2 Bd7. Yes, Black did close the centre, but compared to Ljubojevic-Korchnoi, White's queen cannot be targeted and the dark-square weaknesses in Black's camp become important. Black struggles to create counterplay: 16.O-O Kg7 17.Qc1! Ng8 18.Bf4. In this difficult position, Black sacrifices an exchange in the hope to get counterplay:

18...Raf8 19.Bd6 Qxc3. White is not in a hurry to take the Rf8 and will do so at a

moment of his choosing: 20.a4! Nf6 21.Rd1 Ne4 22.Ra3 Qa5 23.Bxf8+ Rxf8 24.c3 and White had a material advantage and went on to win in Topalov-Jussupow, Dortmund 1997; B) 13...Nd7 14.Nf3. Now Black follows a standard plan in this type position: 14...c4

15.Be2 Nc6.

White decides, similar to Mecking vs Korchnoi, to gain space and to disallow Black's ...e5 pawn push: 16.Ng5 (instead, White could have started an unpleasant immediate attack with 16.h4! followed by h5, Ng5, and Black's situation would not have been easy) 16...Re7 17.f4 Nf6 18.O-O. If we compared this to Mecking-Korchnoi (as we have the same central pawn structure), White is in considerably better shape as Black's bishop cannot be placed on g6. However White has also limited his own dark-squared bishop and game is balanced: 18...Bd7 19.a4 Rf8 20.Bf3.

20...Nd8! (Black wants to trade off the Ng5 and then jump with his own knight to the

central e4-square) 21.Qc1 (on 21.Bc1, Black has a promising exchange sacrifice:

21...Qxc3! 22.Ba3 Rfe8 with ...Nc6 to follow and a great game) 21...Nf7 22.Qa3

Ree8 (the position is about equal) 23.Nxf7 Rxf7 24.Rfe1 Bc6. Not seeing a better way to proceed, White simplifies into a drawn endgame: 25.Qb4 Qxb4 26.cxb4 Ne4

27.Bxe4 dxe4 28.c3 Bd5 and a draw was soon agreed in Karjakin-Carlsen, Sao

Paulo/Bilbao 2012.

13.Nf3 c4

We have one top-level game with an instructive strategic mistake. Let's see it:

13...Qf8 14.O-O c4 15.Be2 h6 16.Bc1! Bd7 17.Ne1 (there was no reason to hurry

with this knight retreat; 17.a4!, keeping all options open, looked promising) 17...g5

18.g3 Nf5 19.Ng2 Qg7. Now White would like to open the position for his dark

squared bishop: 20.f4 Nd6 And now comes a mutual strategic/ positional blunder:

21.Qe1? (good, and in the spirit of 20.f4, was 21.fxg5! Rxf1+ (or 21...hxg5 22.Rxf7

with 23.Ne3 to follow) 22.Bxf1 hxg5 23.Ne3 and White has a promising position: his bishop pair will start working, and the black king can become vulnerable)

21...b5? (Black misses a great opportunity to close the position and play for

domination on the light squares with 21...g4! with the simple plan ...h5, ...Ne4, ...Ne7, ...Nf5 and White's Bc1 may easily be reduced to a 'big pawn'). Now White did not miss his second chance and played 22.fxg5! Rxf1+ 23.Bxf1 hxg5 24.Ne3 Rf8

25.Bg2 and White had a better game and went on to win in Ponomariov-Ivanchuk,

Linares 2002. Vishy is going to use the power of his bishops combined with Black's weak king position and will win this game with great ease. It's really not clear where Timman might have made a mistake from here on.

14.Be2 Qf8

Now Anand cleverly delays castling and places his bishop on the dominant central e5-square:

15.Qc1!

Black has to push through ...h6 now.

15...Nf5 16.h4! h6 17.Bf4 Bd7

White makes sure his dark-squared bishop remains the dominant piece for the rest of the game:

18.Ne5! Nxe5 19.Bxe5 Ne7

Black needs to chase away White's bishop from e5.

20.Qe3 Nc6 21.Bg3 Re8

22.h5! g5

Now White will soon come with the f4 push; the kingside will be opened and Black's king will be vulnerable.

23.O-O Ne7 24.Be5! Nc6 25.Bh2 Rg7

Black has no counterplay, while White easily improves his pieces further.

26.Bg4! Qf6 27.Rae1 Qe7 28.a4 b6 29.Qh3!

Black's only chance here is to grab a pawn and hope...

29...Nd8 30.Re2 Bxa4

31.f4! Bd7 32.f5! Rf7 33.Rfe1

Black's position is collapsing so Timman seizes his best practical chance: he gives an exchange and hopes to reach a drawish ending.

33...Rf6 34.Be5 Rxf5 35.Bxf5 exf5 36.Bc7 Ne6 37.Qxf5

Black has to trade queens in order not to get mated:

37...Qf7 38.Qxf7+ Kxf7 39.Bd6 a5

Unfortunately for Black, his queenside pawns do not offer any real hopes of counterplay. Anand wraps up efficiently.

40.Rf1+ Kg7 41.Re5! Nf4 42.Rxe8 Bxe8

Now, an important check:

43.Be5+! Kg8 44.Bxf4 gxf4 45.Rxf4

46.Rf6 needs to be stopped, so Black has no time to take White's h5-pawn.

45...Kg7 46.g4 a4 47.Kh2 1-0

An instructive victory by Anand! A double-edged position This is a typical modern double-edged position. We have many recent top games here (Ruslan Ponomariov and Richard Rapport are currently the main protagonists for the Black side). This is a very popular type of pawn structure - take your time to study the next three games thoroughly! White doesn't need to worry yet about the a4-pawn or doubled c-pawns, but at some stage, he may. White has a considerable kingside space advantage, but the tricky bit is: at a convenient moment, Black wants to open the position with ...f6 or ...f5... so both sides are actually playing on the kingside! The ensuing positions are very complex and easy to misplay. Closed position, typical plans, exposed white queen Game 30 Zoltan Almasi 2650 Alexander Beliavsky 2615 Hungary tt 1996/97 This game is another great example of how strategically sensitive these positions are and how easy it is, even for a world class player, to get into trouble. In a similar way as in Mecking-Korchnoi, Almasi makes 'logical moves' and still finds himself in terrible trouble in no time!

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4 Qc7

This move usually leads to very sharp lines where theoretical knowledge and memory are of crucial importance. If White wants to avoid long, computer-prepared lines here, sometimes he opts for:

8.Bd3

Mainstream theory is 8.Qxg7 when after 8...Rg8 9.Qxh7 cxd4 White has an equally interesting choice between 10.Ne2, 10.Kd1!? or 10.Qd3. The resulting positions are sharp, heavily (engine-)analysed, and I have not included them in this book because (cloud) computer engines preparation, good memory etc. are more important elements here than understanding Winawer fundamentals.

8.Bd2 is another attempt to avoid theory; however, it is little played as White fails to

find an advantage in the lines after 8...cxd4 9.cxd4 Qxc2.

8.Bd3 is a tricky sideline where Black needs to know his stuff! Best here is to use the

standard way to immediately close the position in the centre:

8...c4!

8...h5?, trying to force White into sharp Qxg7-type lines, can lead to a disaster for

Black: 9.Qxg7 Rg8 10.Qh6 cxd4 11.Ne2. With White's bishop already developed to d3, Black has a terrible version of the 8. Qxg7 lines. After 11...Nbc6 12.cxd4 Bd7

13.Be3 O-O-O 14.Qxh5 White had a massive advantage and soon won in Velimirovic-

Uhlmann, Vrsac 1973. The pawn grab 8...cxd4 is not really a good idea either: 9.Ne2 analysis diagram

9...dxc3 (or 9...Qxe5 10.cxd4 h5 - (of course, not blundering a queen with

10...Qf6?? 11.Bg5) - 11.Qh4 Qc7 12.O-O when Black has problems finishing his

development and with his king in the centre; White has more than sufficient compensation for the pawn) 10.Qxg7 Rg8 11.Qxh7 Qxe5 12.h4. Black is a pawn up, but the h-pawn is fast. White has an excellent version of the 8.Qxg7 lines here.

9.Be2 Qa5

It would be a serious strategic mistake to compare this position to Mecking- Korchnoi, thinking 'White will play 10.Nf3 next' and castling kingside here. Beliavsky made this mistake and was swiftly punished for it two years prior to this game: 9...O-O?. Unfortunately for Black, White's Ng1 stays on its initial square for the time being:

10.h4! f6. Black hopes to open the centre and get counterplay - sorry, this will not

happen! The centre stays closed: 11.f4!. White now simply rolls his kingside pawns while Black does not have any meaningful counterplay. White has a massive advantage already: 11...Nbc6 12.Nf3

12...b5 (one of the earlier examples went 12...Qa5 13.Bd2 Qa4 14.Ra2 and now

White took action on the kingside and quickly won in Velimirovic-Lengyel, Vrnjacka Banja 1973) 13.h5 a5 (Black has futile hopes of counterplay; in case of

13...h6, White builds up a kingside attack with the simple 14.Qh3 a5 15.g4) 14.Bd2

(the immediate 14.h6 was also good) 14...Rb8. Given the absence of counterplay for Black, White has different ways to proceed here. Polgar is not in a hurry: 15.O-O. Now Black does not have much of a choice but to push his b-pawn: 15...b4 16.axb4 axb4 17.cxb4 c3 (in case of 17...Nxb4, Black lands in a strategically lost position after 18.h6 g6 19.exf6 Rxf6 20.Bxb4 Rxb4 21.Ne5) 18.Bxc3 Nxe5 19.fxe5 Qxc3

20.Bd3 (20.Ra7 wins as well) 20...h6 (or 20...Rxb4 21.Ra7) 21.b5 and White is up a

pawn and has the better position on top of it. White quickly won in Polgar- Beliavsky, Linares 1994. The immediate 9...Nf5 was also possible, leading to a type of play similar to the text.

10.Bd2 Nf5

11.Nf3

In a higher sense, this natural developing move is the start of White's troubles as Almasi is not aware of the exposure his queen may be subjected to. The position is dynamically balanced. Black is going to castle queenside and prepare the opening of the kingside (most probably with the ...f6 push) while White also needs to watch out a bit on the queenside, given his pawn structure weaknesses there. Computer engines respect space in such positions, so your engine will give you a 'White's advantage' assessment but things are far from the way they initially seem and 'dynamic balance' is a better assessment here. I will now give a recent example of another very strong grandmaster getting into trouble with White in this line: 11.h4 (Ivan Saric, in a game against Furlan, has a reasonable idea: he pushes pawns and gains space on the kingside) 11...Qa4 12.Bd1 Nc6 13.h5 h6 14.Qf4 Bd7 15.g4 Nfe7. It's time for White to develop the Ng1. Compared to Almasi's queen in our game, White's queen is far from exposed here, so Saric is in good shape: 16.Nf3 Rg8 (preparing queenside castling) 17.Nh4 O-O-O (Black wants to play ...Rdf8 and ...f6 so White makes this standard rook lift to stop it) 18.Rh3 Rdf8 19.Rf3

19...b6 (Black has to be patient as White has an advantage in case of 19...f6 20.exf6

Rxf6 21.Qd6) 20.Qg3. The position is strategically balanced, and both sides find it not easy to improve. Black, playing an opponent who is more than 300 Elo points higher rated, is happy with the status quo. Note that Black could have immediately opted for the game plan of bringing his knight to d8, or for ...a5 followed by ...Na7, ...Nb5, which is another standard plan here. 20...Qb5 21.Bc1 Qa4 22.Kf1 Kb7. A logical run of play in such positions. The queenside is blocked while White, despite his space advantage, has problems improving on the kingside. 23.Rf4 (the 'active' 23.g5 is not well timed as Black has excellent play after 23...hxg5 24.Bxg5 Be8 or 24...f6) 23...Be8 24.Qf3 Nd8! (this move enables some tactical ideas based on the fact that Black is the one who will be opening the kingside!) 25.Rb1. A) Here Black had an interesting aggressive option, the motifs behind which are useful to remember, in 25...g5!? 26.hxg6 f5! (the kingside opens up and Black is ready for it!) 27.gxf5 (after 27.exf6 Black, with his well-coordinated pieces, gets excellent compensation with 27...Nxg6) 27...exf5. analysis diagram Now we see all the advantages of placing the black knight on d8! 28.Qh3 Ne6

29.Rf3 Bxg6 30.Nxg6 (in case of 30.Bxh6? Rf7 31.Nxg6 Rxg6 32.Bc1 f4! we have

another excellent example of White playing all the logical moves and everything going wrong! Black has a close to winning advantage here as the two knights are clearly superior to the two bishops) 30...Rxg6 31.Rg3 with complicated play in a dynamically balanced position; B) Black continues with his wait-and-see strategy: 25...a5. And now, out of frustration due to a combination of factors: not being able to make progress while playing a considerably lower-rated opponent with White, does its job and Ivan Saric takes an irresponsible decision: 26.Ng6? (a strategic mistake which should have been losing. White helps Black to obtain excellent play on the kingside) 26...Nxg6

27.hxg6 Qd7. Most probably by now, Saric understood what he had done and now

he hopes to maintain the position by playing neutral moves: 28.Be2 (28.gxf7 Nxf7 plays further into Black's hands) 28...Ka7 29.Ra1

29...Qe7!. No more jokes! White is stuck between a rock and a hard place and has to

decide between taking on f7, opening the f-file to Black's advantage, and losing a pawn for nothing. Saric opted for the latter: 30.a4 fxg6 and Black was a pawn up for nothing though White ultimately saved a draw in Saric-Furlan, Slovenia tt 2022.

30.gxf7 leads to a bad position for White after 30...Nxf7 31.Qg3 Ba4! 32.Ra2 Ng5

(White cannot surrender the f-file here, while 33...Ne4 is a threat) 33.f3 Rb8 and White is in terrible shape as he will need to give material in order to save his Rf4.

11...Nc6 12.Qh5?!

This certainly does not help White.

12.h4 Bd7 13.h5 h6 14.Qf4 with 15.g4 to follow was needed, leading to play similar

to Saric-Furlan from the previous comment. Again... do not draw any easy conclusions based on your computer engine giving White a slight advantage here!

12...h6

Now it's high time for White to be careful!

13.O-O?

13.g4 was needed, keeping the king on e1.

13...Bd7 14.Rfb1 O-O-O!

By now Zoltan most probably understood the trouble he'd got himself into! Black is clearly better. White queen is terribly placed. One of Black's ideas is ...Rdg8, ...g7- g5-g4, ...Be8 and ...f6. Almasi now continues according to the logic, 'if I have to suffer, I'd better grab a pawn':

15.Qxf7 g5

16.Be1?

This loses decisive material. The only way for White to stay in the game was with the drastic measure 16.g4! and after 16...Rdf8 17.Qh5 Be8 18.Qh3 Nfe7 White is still in the game. However, with ideas like ...Ne7-g6-f4 with ...h5 to follow Black has plenty of compensation: White's position can collapse at any moment.

16...g4

Now it's over. White's queen cannot be saved.

17.Nd2 Rhg8 18.h3

Or 18.a4 Rdf8 19.Qh7 Nce7 with ...Rh8 or ...Rg7 to follow.

18...Rdf8 19.Qxf8+ Rxf8 20.hxg4 Nfe7 21.Nf1

Black is up a queen for a rook and has the better position too.

21...Be8! 22.Bd2 Bg6 23.Bxh6 Rh8 24.Bd2 Bxc2 25.Rb2 Bg6 26.Ng3 Qc7 27.Bd1

Many moves win here. Beliavsky finishes with a simple tactic:

27...Nxd4! 0-1

Black plays ...c4, fixing the pawn chain Game 31 Ivan Saric 2668 Mateusz Bartel 2630 Germany Bundesliga 2022/23 The pawn structure in this game can be compared to that in Almasi-Beliavsky and Karjakin-Grischuk. This game is another example of how easy it is, even for a very strong player, to go wrong in these strategically complex positions.

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Nc6!?

A relative sideline. We will, however, not focus on the opening here but will try to understand the strategic compexities of the ensuing positions.

7.Qg4

Arguably White's main line here - in any case, the most direct line. White is asking a direct question to Black, who now has to either weaken his kingside or lose his right to castle. At a high level, White players have tried different moves here: 7.Nf3, or 7.a4, or my personal favourite 7.h4.

7...g6

The future of Black's king will probably be on the queenside. At some stage (soon), Black will close the centre with the standard ...c4 push. We have many top-level games here. I have chosen a few examples that I thought to be instructive, outlining possible plans and objectives.

8.h4

One high-level game saw an interesting struggle here: 8.Bd2 Bd7 9.h4 (for the time being, Black has to keep the kingside closed) 9...h6 10.Bd3 Qe7!? (Black places his queen on e7, hoping to be better prepared to create counterplay by pushing ...f6 or ...f5) 11.Nh3 O-O-O 12.O-O. Black needs to be careful: if he doesn't close the centre on time, White might take dxc5: 12...c4! 13.Be2 Be8 (Black is getting ready to open up the kingside and create counterplay) 14.Nf4 Kb8 15.a4 Ka8 (getting all set to push his f-pawn) 16.Bc1!? Anand is asking Ponomariov a tough question! If Pono pushes his f-pawn, it will be a difficult-to- calculate pawn sacrifice, while if not, Vishy will play the unpleasant

17. Ba3.

Most probably White's best option was the prophylactic 16.Qh3! because 16...f5?? now blunders a pawn for nothing since after 17.exf6 Nxf6 White's queen is not attacked and he can simply take 18.Nxe6, with a winning advantage. Ponomariov makes the right call: 16...f5! (for the sacrificed pawn, Black gets a kingside attack)

17.exf6 Nxf6 18.Qxe6 (the zwischenzug 18.Ba3!? was worth considering) 18...Qg7

(Black will soon push ...g5 and start attack on the white king; he definitely has sufficient compensation here) 19.Qh3 Bd7 20.Qg3. An important moment. Ruslan underestimates White's strategic threat of trading the kinghts: 20...Bf5 21.Nh5! and with the knights off the board Black's situation is not nearly as good. Suddenly White is better, though Black managed to save a draw in Anand-Ponomariov, Leon 2007. More precise was 20...Rhg8!, preparing ...g5 while not allowing the knight trade:

21.Bf3 Qf7! and Pono's pawn sac idea would have worked to perfection - White

would have been in serious trouble here! A logical continuation might be 22.Nh3 g5

23.hxg5 Bxh3 24.Qxh3 hxg5 and White has only one move to avoid immediate

annihilation: 25.g4; however after 25...Qg6 he is in serious trouble. The power of his bishop pair is contained, while his king is weak and prone to immediate attack. Black now has to opt for the standard reaction to White's h-pawn push:

8...h6 9.a4

Another interesting recent high-level game went 9.Qf4 Qa5 10.Bd2. As usual, here Black correctly closed the centre: 10...c4! 11.a4 Bd7 12.Be2 Rh7 (Black needs to castle queenside) 13.Nf3 O-O-O 14.O-O

14...Re8 (given the fact that Black wants to open the kingside to create counterplay,

it looks more logical to play 14...Rf8 immediately, as Rapport did later in the game. My explanation for Richard not doing this is that maybe he could not evaluate the pawn sacrifice 15.Bc1!? Qxc3 16.Ba3) 15.Rfb1 (Black's king is reasonably safe, and White's 'attack plan' only loses time) 15...Kb8 (the immediate 15...Qd8 followed by ...f6 was good too). Now White 'forced' Black to execute his plan with 16.Rb5? (16.Nh2 with Ng4 to follow, trying to slow down Black's f-pawn push, made more sense): 16...Qd8 17.g3 Ka8. White now admits that his 'attacking plan' was a loss of time: 18.Rbb1 Rf8 with ...f6 to follow (perhaps it was even more precise to start immediate kingside action with

18...f6!) and Black had a great game. Later, the game Santos Latasa-Rapport,

Mayrhofen 2022, ended in a draw.

9...Qa5 10.Bd2 Bd7

11.Ne2

White could now have decided to totally change the character of the game with

11.dxc5!? after which we suddenly get a 'blow for blow' tactical battle! Play may

continue 11...Nxe5 12.Qd4 f6 13.c4! Qc7 14.cxd5 exd5 with complications. Here, White's bishop pair is an asset!

11...O-O-O 12.Nf4 c4 13.g3

13...Nge7

Black had an interesting and unusual tactical idea here that is worth remembering:

13...Nf6! when the most principled reaction is to accept the pawn sacrifice, though it

rather seems like White is looking for trouble: 14.exf6 (Black is certainly not worse after 14.Qf3 Ne4) 14...e5 15.Qf3 exf4 16.Qxf4. analysis diagram White has got a pawn, but his king is stuck in the centre. The position is complicated and difficult to evaluate (though my Stockfish gives zeros). A logical continuation is

16...g5 17.Qf3 Rhe8+ 18.Kd1 Re4 19.hxg5 Rde8! (Black wants to play 20... Nxd4;

19...Bg4? blunders into the simple 20.Bh3) 20.Rh4! Nxd4 21.Qh1.

analysis diagram In a game between humans, something is bound to go wrong here for one of the sides. Stockfish assesses it as a dynamic balance. 21...Re1+! 22.Bxe1 Rxe1+

23.Kd2! Rxa1 24.Rxd4 hxg5. Now White has to be clever and understand the need

to open the h2-b8 diagonal for Qh2+: 25.g4! (25.Rxd5?? blunders into 25...Rxf1)

25...Be6 26.Qh8+ Kd7 27.Bg2 with unclear play, certainly for humans, while the

silicon brain still gives zeroes.

14.Bh3

This is a typical kind of position we can get in this line. In the game, White finds it difficult to make progress, while Black gets ready to push the f-pawn and create kingside activity. Again, I advise you: do NOT draw any 'easy conclusions' based on your computer engine giving White some plus here. The reality in human play is very different - we have a complex, unclear game here! In human play position may in some sense be easier to play with Black. Objectively, White probably has some advantage, but Black has a relatively clear plan: to push ...f6 or ...f5 and take action on the kingside, favouring him. At the same time, White needs to be clever and has to improve his position while anticipating Black's actions. Ivan Saric did not manage to find a clever way to regroup, and in the game Black's plan worked to perfection.

14...Kb8 15.Qf3 Ka8 16.Ng2

A better way to regroup was probably 16.Ne2 Rdf8 17.g4 Ng8... analysis diagram and now White can improve his bishop with 18.Bc1! f6 19.Ba3 Rf7 20.Bd6. The position is dynamic and tense, but White should have an advantage after, for example, 20...Rhh7 21.Qe3.

16...Rdf8 17.Ne3 Ng8

18.O-O?!

18.Nxd5 could have proved a risky decision after 18...Nxe5 19.dxe5 Bc6, though our

silicon friend gives some complicated lines leading to around zero. White no longer has an advantage, but he has to stop Black's 'perfect execution' of the f-pawn push: 18.Ng4! Qd8 19.Nf6 Nxf6 20.Qxf6 Qxf6 21.exf6 with approximately equal play. Now the time has come for Black's kingside action:

18...f5! 19.exf6 Nxf6

Black has taken over the initiative.

20.Qe2 g5

An important moment! How should White react?

21.hxg5?

White helps Black's attack by opening the h-file for him.

21.h5 was necessary, when Black has a great game but the fight is very much on.

21...hxg5

In a higher sense, this position is winning for Black. He has an attack 'free of charge' with many different motifs, while White does not have even a glimpse of meaningful counterplay. In the following, Bartel could have executed differently, or perhaps faster, but the end result is never in doubt.

22.Bg2

22.Kg2 loses to 22...Ne4 with terrible threats like ...Nxd4 or ...Qc7 followed by

...Rxf2 and ...Qxg3+.

22...Bc8 23.Rfc1 Qc7 24.Nf1

Black has a winning attack, and many different options.

24...Qg7

Also good was 24...Qh7 25.Bxg5 Ne4 or 24...Ne4 25.Be1 g4.

25.f3 Nh5 26.Re1 Qg6

Black could also win with the thematic sacrifice 26...Nf4 27.gxf4 gxf4 with the unstoppable idea of ...Qh6, ...Rfg8,...Qh1+.

27.Bc1 Rf7 28.Qf2 Rfh7 29.Ne3 Ne7 30.Ba3 Nf5

Black has a mating attack and full domination. White's bishops are just a pair of two big pawns here.

31.Nxf5 exf5 32.f4 gxf4 33.Qf3

33.gxf4 loses to 33...Nf6 34.Kf1 Ne4.

33...Nxg3 34.Bc1 Ne4 35.Kf1

35...Qg3

An immediate tactical win was 35...Rh1+! 36.Bxh1 Rxh1+ 37.Ke2 Rh2+ 38.Kd1 Qg4 39.Qxg4 Nxc3#.

36.Bxf4

36.Qxg3 fxg3 is equally hopeless for White.

36...Rh1+ 37.Ke2 Nxc3+ 38.Kd2 Ne4+ 39.Ke2 Rxe1+ 40.Rxe1 Qg6

The time control has been reached. Black could have won faster, but nothing has been spoilt. Black is two pawns up and has an attack.

41.Kf1 c3 42.Kg1 Rg8 43.a5 Bd7 44.Qh3 Ba4 45.Re2 Qf6 46.Be5 Qg5 47.a6 Bb5

48.axb7+ Kxb7 49.Re3 a5 50.Kh2 Rg6 51.Qf3 Bc4 52.Bf4 Qh4+ 53.Kg1

53...Rb6! 54.Bh3 Rb1+ 55.Kh2 Rf1 0-1

Closed center with ...c4, black king on the queenside Game 32 Sergey Karjakin 2747 Alexander Grischuk 2745 Moscow 2022 In this game, the pawn structure and plans are comparable to the games Saric-Bartel and Almasi-Beliavsky. Karjakin goes for a slightly different set-up as White, pushing his pawn to f4 to try to control the space.

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7

White now chooses for a popular variation which was introduced on high level by Garry Kasparov in his game vs Anand in Linares 1992.

7.h4 Qc7

The above-mentioned game featured White playing a typical pawn sacrifice:

7...Nbc6 8.h5 Qa5 9.Bd2 cxd4 10.cxd4 Qa4.

White is not obliged to sacrifice a pawn here, but Kasparov does it as his development advantage, bishop pair, and initiative will more than compensate for the minimal material investment: 11.Nf3! (your engine will tell you that White has some advantage after 11.c3 Qxd1+ 12.Kxd1) 11...Nxd4 12.Bd3 Nec6 13.Kf1! (14.Rh4 is a threat now, so Black needs to decide what to do with his Nd4) 13...Nxf3 14.Qxf3. Compare this to the typical pawn sacrifice in the game Anand-Nikolic. White has a development advantage and Black's king is vulnerable. Anand is in a hurry to complete his development, and for good reason: 14...b6 (Black cannot afford to lose time with 14...h6? as after 15.Qg3 Black cannot defend his kingside - the rook lift Rh4 is coming) 15.h6 Ba6 16.hxg7 Rg8 17.Bxa6 Qxa6+ 18.Kg1 Rxg7 19.Qf6 Rg8

20.Rxh7. Material is equal while Black's king problem is still not solved. White had

a clear advantage, but Black managed to survive in Kasparov-Anand, Linares 1992.

8.h5 h6 9.Rb1 b6

Black wants to play ...Ba6, trading the light squared bishops. White resorts to a typical way to avoid this:

10.Bb5+

In another (well-known) top-level game, White opted for a different strategy:

10.Qg4. White immediately bothers Black on the kingside so that Black will lose his

right to castle and his king remains on the queenside: 10...Rg8 11.Bb5+ Kf8 (11...Bd7 does not improve the situation as after 12.Bd3, 13.Bh7 is a threat and Black has to play ...Kf8 anyway) 12.Bd3. Even though quite a number of very strong players have opted for a similar set-up as Black, I am not fond of it as Black will have to spend a considerable amount of time to solve his Kf8 problem and bring his Rg8 into play: 12...Ba6. White wants to open up the queenside to make Black feel the problem of activating his Rg8, so he decides to change the central pawn structure: 13.dxc5 Bxd3 14.cxd3 Nd7 (an alternative was 14...Qxe5+ 15.Ne2 Nd7, though the Rg8 problem remains and White should be better) 15.d4 bxc5. White's queen has done her job of disrupting Black's development on the kingside: 16.Qd1! Qa5 17.Bd2. White had some advantage and went on to win in Vachier Lagrave-Nepomniachtchi, Yekaterinburg 2020.

10...Bd7 11.Bd3 Ba4 12.Rh4

A typical rook lift, asking Black to decide about the pawn structure.

12...c4! 13.Be2 Nd7

The structure is similar to Saric-Bartel and Almasi-Beliavsky. Black will castle queenside and at some stag aim for counterplay with ...f6. Other than Saric and Almasi, Karjakin decides to take more space by pushing his f-pawn. This is a logical strategy, but he won't find it easy to build further on it.

14.f4 O-O-O 15.Nf3 Kb7 16.Rh3 a5 17.Be3

Pay attention now to the way Grischuk manoeuvres his Nd7 - typical play in such positions!

17...Nb8!

White is trying to improve his pieces, starting with his king, but he doesn't find it easy to make progress:

18.Kf1 Nbc6 19.Kg1 Na7! 20.Qc1 Nb5 21.Qb2 Ka6

Black has no reason to complain as his Nb5+Ba4 are keeping White's queen out of play (i.e., busy defending pawn weaknesses).

22.Nd2

Now Black has to be careful not to blunder into some Nxc4 type sacrifice.

22...Rc8 23.Bf2

White wants to manoeuvre Nd2-f1-e3 while also being able to bring his bishop to h4. Grischuk now goes for an interesting queen manoeuvre:

23...Qd7!?

Black's queen will travel all the way to h7. Actually, he could have opted for 23...f6

24.Nf1 (24.Bg4 brings White nowhere for various reasons, e.g. 24...f5 (or simply

24...Qd7) 25.Be2 g5 26.hxg6 Rcg8) 24...fxe5 25.fxe5 (25.dxe5, opening the diagonal

for the Bf2, has the drawback that White's centre is undermined after 25...Rcf8

26.Qc1 g5!). The position is dynamically balanced and strategically complicated.

Black has nothing to complain about, and can continue 25...g5 or 25...g6.

24.Ra1

This is more or less a loss of tempo. The immediate 24.Nf1 looked more consistent and more logical. Grischuk continues with his plan of bringing the queen to h7:

24...Qe8

24...f6!? was certainly an option.

25.Nf1 Qg8 26.Ne3 Qh7 27.Re1

27...Rhf8

A logical follow-up of Black's plan to bring his queen to the h7-b1 diagonal was to harass White's knight (and accentuate the c2 weakness) with 27...Nf5! 28.Nd1 (28.Ng4 contains Black's kingside counterplay, but it's rather unclear how White should continue; allowing the knight trade is not good here as after 28.Bd1?! Nxe3

29.Rexe3 Rhg8 Black opens up the kingside and has a great game).

analysis diagram Black now has a good choice between repeating moves with 28...Ne7 29.Ne3 (or

29.Bh4 Nf5 30.Bf2) and starting wild complications with 28...g5!? 29.g4! gxf4!

30.gxf5 Qxf5 31.Kh2 Rhg8 32.Bf3 Bxc2 with razor-sharp play (my Stockfish gives

zeroes). Karjakin now makes some smart bishop moves, gaining the upper hand:

28.Bg4!

So as to be able to push ...f6, Black needs to protect his e6-pawn.

28...Rc6 29.Bh4! f6

Having reached an advantageous position, White does not show any ambition now.

30.Re2

Black would have been in an unpleasant situation after 30.Rf1! (White wants to push

31.f5) 30...f5 (30...Qe4 is no fun for Black after 31.f5! exf5 32.Bxf5 Nxf5 33.Rxf5

and White is clearly better, e.g. 33...Rcc8 34.Bf2!) 31.Be2 Rf7 (31...Rc7? blunders into the already mentioned trick 32.Bxe7 Rxe7 33.Nxc4!) and now White makes a good strategic trade: analysis diagram

32.Bxe7! Rxe7 33.Rg3 and Black has a problem as White has a clear plan to open

the structure in his favour, e.g. 33...Nc7 34.Rg6 Rf7 35.g4!.

30...Rf7

Karjakin decides not to show any ambition, which is a pity as this was a strategically very interesting game so far.

31.Qa1

31.Rf2!?, planning the f5 push.

31...Rf8 32.Qb2

32.Rf2!?.

32...Rf7 33.Qa1 Rf8

Draw agreed. No counterplay for Black The diagrammed position is great for White. He has a safe king, f-file pressure, space... Black has no counterplay and no good way to solve the problem of his king in the long term. Closed centre, the plan with ...Nf5 and ...h5 Game 33 Leonid Stein Tigran Petrosian Moscow ch-URS Final & Zonal 1961

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4

In the 1960s, the following Black set-up was popular at top level:

7...Nf5 8.Bd3 h5

Big names like Petrosian and Korchnoi had it in their regular repertoire. Black's idea is to build a stable kingside with his Nf5 supported by the pawn on h5 (aimed against White's g4 pawn push). As it will transpire, however, Black's problem is that pawns can't move back, and his kingside will be vulnerable in many cases due to his pawn already being on the h5-square. Leonid Stein slowly improves his position, underlining the deficiencies of Black's set-up. As we will see, Petrosian could have played better but was never close to equality and never had any meaningful counterplay. After this game, Black's set-up disappeared from top-level play.

9.Qf4!

Mikhail Tal, true to his style, applied a more direct approach (albeit a bit chaotic) with 9.Qh3. White wants to push g4, harassing the Nf5 as soon as possible: 9...cxd4

10.Nf3 (10.Bxf5 exf5 11.cxd4 does not bring White any advantage as Black is okay

after 11...h4!) A) 10...Nc6 11.g4!? (Tal loved this approach here; the alternative was 11.cxd4 Ncxd4 12.Nxd4 Nxd4 13.O-O and White has good compensation, among other things because Black's pawn is on h5, making the evacuation of his king more difficult)

11...Nfe7 12.gxh5 with a complicated game, won by White in Tal-Petrosian,

Moscow 1957; B) 10...Qc7 11.Rb1 (Tal insists on the same idea as in his game vs Petrosian (see the comment above); better was the typical sacrifice 11.O-O! dxc3 12.a4 Nc6 13.Ba3 with excellent compensation for White) 11...dxc3 and Tal went for his favourite idea: 12.g4 Ne7 13.gxh5. Now, best for Black was to disturb the Bd3 with 13...b6! (the game Tal-Korchnoi, Riga ch-URS 1958, went 13...Nbc6 and after quite a number of ups and downs was eventually won by Black). 14... Ba6 is an often-seen unpleasant positional threat, and White does not have a good way to stop it as after 14.Qg4 Black gains the upper hand with 14...Nd7 15.Bf4 Nc5.

9...Nc6

A) After 9...Qc7... A1) One game by young Magnus Carlsen went 10.Ne2. Black (Yannick Pelletier) understood that White's positional threat was 11. Bxf5 and correctly responded with

10...Ne7!. White now has little else but to to change the central pawn structure

(similar to Shirov-Polgar in this chapter) and go for 11.dxc5. Black was fine after

11...Nd7 12.O-O Qxe5 the game Carlsen-Pelletier, Biel 2005, later ended in a draw;

A2) White should go for a change in the pawn structure and gets a clear advantage with 10.Bxf5! exf5 11.Ne2 (or immediately 11.Qg3) as Black now has a problem stabilizing his kingside (here it would have been helpful if he had his pawn on h6!)

11...Be6 12.Qg3.

B) Ideas like 9...Ne7? do not make sense here as the situation is not comparable to Carlsen-Pelletier above - White's knight is not on e2. White has different ways to get a clear advantage; for example, 10.dxc5 now works much better than in Carlsen's case above; 10.Nh3 looks very promising as well.

10.Ne2

Stein plans to open the f-file. A good alternative is 10.Nf3, combining two ideas: either, in the right circumstances, taking on dxc5 or on Bxf5. Black has a hard life here: 10...c4 (or 10...Nce7 11.dxc5!)

11.Bxf5 exf5 12.Qg3 and White has different plans here. Black is doomed to passive

defence, hoping to salvage a draw, e.g. 12...Rg8 13.Bg5 Qa5 14.Kd2 Be6 15.a4 Kd7

16.Rhb1.

10...Nce7 11.Ng3 Ng6 12.Qd2 Bd7 13.Rb1

Immediately 13.a4 and then pursuing Stein's game plan was perhaps more accurate. I guess Stein wanted to provoke ...b6 or ...Rb8 so that queenside castling becomes difficult or even impossible for Black.

13...Rb8 14.O-O c4

To take on f5 or to retreat?

15.Be2!

The correct decision. 15.Bxf5 exf5 would not have worked as in the previous comments as Black has consolidated his kingside in this case. Black's considerable problem is that due to his pawn placement on h5, he cannot really say 'pass'.

15...Nxg3

Trying to say 'pass' and playing 15...Qh4 does not solve any of Black's problems:

16.a4! when a logical continuation might be 16...Bxa4 17.Ra1 b5.

analysis diagram Black has grabbed a pawn, but his bishop is out of play.

18.Nxf5! exf5 19.Bf3 Rd8 20.Re1. White has many ideas here, while Black cannot

defend his weaknesses, e.g. 20...Nf8 21.Ba3 Ne6 22.Bd6.

16.fxg3

Black's pawn on h5 will be hanging, so Petrosian tries to resolve the situation.

16...h4

Stein continues to improve his position:

17.Bg4

The silicon brain thinks 17.Qe1 is more precise as Black then has a tough choice: A) 17...hxg3 18.Qxg3 Qh4 leads to a queenless position that is difficult for Black:

19.Qxh4 Rxh4 20.Bg5 Rh8 21.Rf2 Kf8 22.g3 and in the long term Black cannot

hold; B) 17...Ba4 falls under a crushing attack: 18.Qf2 Qe7. analysis diagram White's execution is largely tactical: 19.Bg5! Qxg5 20.Qxf7+ Kd8 21.Qxe6 Qe3+ (21...hxg3 loses to the obvious 22.Qd6+ Kc8 23.Rf7) 22.Rf2! (the final accuracy;

22.Kh1? would ruin White's winning after position 22...hxg3 23.h3 Qxe2 and White

has nothing better than a draw by perpetual check with 24.Rf7 Bc6 25.Qd6+ Ke8

26.Qe6+) 22...hxg3 23.Qd6+ and White wins.Stein's choice looks more logical to

me though.

17...hxg3 18.hxg3 Qe7

This allows White to place his bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal, deciding the battle.

18...Ba4! was necessary, but Black faces a long, passive defense and will probably

still lose in the end.

19.a4!

With White's bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal, Black cannot protect against the threats.

19...Bxa4 20.Ra1 b5 21.Ba3 Qd7 22.Rf2 Rb7

22...Rh7 loses to 23.Raf1 Nh8 24.Qg5 Rb7 and White can choose between the flashy

25.Rf6 and the simple 25.Bh5.

23.Raf1 Qd8 24.Qd1

The threat is 25.Be6 followed by Qg4.

24...Rh6 25.Bc1 Rh7 26.Bxe6!

And Black resigned as 26...fxe6 loses to the obvious 27.Qg4. A beautiful, easy- looking win by Leonid Stein. AI, be it Stockfish, Alpha Zero, Scorpio or some other program, may simply 'close' certain lines in the French (and also in other openings). Next, I will give two games, both with Anand playing White, where the former verdict of 'White has compensation' is likely to change into 'Black players should not enter these positions'. Well-known lines killed by technology Game 34 Viswanathan Anand 2753 Curt Hansen 2610 Middelfart 2003 Modern technologies (engines, the cloud...) are going to 'close' some of the sharp tactical lines in the Winawer. Here is an example of a variation played by Botvinnik (as Black) in two different World Championship matches (meaning that he and his team analysed it a lot!) against Tal in 1960 and 1961. In the next game, Anand- Nikolic, we will see some more examples of technological advances probably 'killing' well-known lines played by very strong players.

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Qc7 7.Qg4 f5 8.Qg3 Ne7

9.Qxg7 Rg8 10.Qxh7 cxd4

This variation became well known after the Tal-Botvinnik matches (1960 and 1961). White won both games; however, Black's play could have been improved). Anand's dynamic play in this game is the product of 'modern support'. Computer engines (see also Anand-Nikolic) on behalf of White here, as the position has been opened and White's bishop pair is a great force.

11.Ne2!

11.Kd1 was Tal's choice in both matches.

11...Nbc6 12.Qh5+

This leads to White's advantage, however White also had a rather good alternative. White's h-pawn is a force here while putting it on h4 also enables the development of his rook to h3, so a good alternative was 12.h4 Nxe5 (12...Qxe5? is wrong as after the relatively simple 13.Bf4 Rh8 - or 13...Qf6 14.Bg5 - 14.Qxe7+ Kxe7 15.Bxe5 Nxe5 16.cxd4 White is a sound pawn up and has a technically winning position)

13.cxd4 Nf7 (Black has a drawing threat with ...Rh8, ...Rg8) 14.Qh5! Qxc2 (material

is equal, however White's h-passer now becomes very annoying) 15.Qf3 Bd7 16.h5 Bb5 17.h6 and the position is sharp but better for White.

12...Ng6

13.Bg5?!

An inaccuracy. The precise move was 13.h4! and here White is better prepared for a tactical battle after 13...dxc3 (13...d3? 14.cxd3 Ncxe5 is now simply wrong due to the obvious

15.Rh3+-) 14.Rh3.

13...Qxe5?!

Black does not take his chance. He could have obtained excellent counterplay with 13...d3! 14.cxd3 Ncxe5 with an unclear game, e.g. 15.Qh3 f4. Anand is now in his element and plays a great game:

14.f4! Qg7 15.h4!

This move is almost always good for White in such positions. Rh3 is enabled, Bg5 is extra protected, and pushing the h-pawn further can throw Black off balance.

15...dxc3 16.Rd1

Black is temporarily a pawn up, however he has one huge problem: his king! White's Bg5 is excellently placed, making the evacuation of Black's king impossible. Also, Black's extra pawn is likely to fall (to Rh3 followed by Nxc3). Black attemps to create counterplay by using his central pawns:

16...d4

If 16...Bd7, White is clearly better after 17.Rh3 Rc8 18.Nxc3 (Stockfish's first line, first securing the king and then grabbing the c3-pawn, also makes a lot of sense:

18.Kf2 Kf7 19.Kg1) 18...Nd4 19.Rd2 Nb3 20.cxb3 Rxc3 21.Qe2 and Black's king is

badly placed while the h-pawn push will disturb his coordination.

17.Qf3! e5

In case of 17...Bd7 White gets a large advantage with 18.h5 Nge5 19.Qg3 Nf7 20.h6. Black's biggest problem is his king. Anand executes with great precision:

18.Qd5! Nge7 19.Qd6 Bd7

19...Qf7 lands Black in a lost ending: 20.fxe5 Rg6 21.Bf6 Nxe5 22.Qxe5 Qxf6

23.Qxd4 Qxd4 24.Rxd4.

The time has come for the final execution. Vishy sacrifices a piece to open routes to the black king:

20.Nxc3! Nc8 21.Qc7 dxc3

Not accepting sacrifice was not really an option as Black's position quickly collapses after 21...Be6 22.Qxg7 Rxg7 23.Ne2. Black's Rg8 is now directed to h8, so that the Qg7 will be unprotected.

22.Be2! Rh8 23.fxe5

The simple threat is 24.e6.

23...Qf7

23...Nxe5? loses to 24.Qd8+ Kf7 25.Rxd7+, while in case of 23...Qh7 White can win

with a motif similar to the game: 24.Bh5+ Qxh5 25.Qxd7+ Kf8 26.Qxf5+ Kg8 27.0- 0. Anand finishes with a flourish:

24.Bc4! Qxc4 25.Qxd7+ Kf8 26.Qxf5+ Ke8

Or 26...Qf7 27.Qg4.

27.Qd7+

Black resigned; he did not care to wait for 28.Rf1+. Minor sacrifices - pawn sacrifice for development Game 35 Viswanathan Anand 2765 Predrag Nikolic 2630 Groningen FIDE Wch KO 1997 This game is a good example of the influence AI will have on certain variations and concepts. Predrag Nikolic is a strong GM who has played risky lines in the French Winawer over the years against the very world top, and took some rather 'poisoned' pawns. Twenty-five years ago, the verdict was that White had compensation and Black is taking a considerable risk snatching such a pawn. Today's verdict will be: 'Black is playing a losing variation'. Any player with a good feeling for the initiative, armed with a strong 'second' (read Stockfish or any other top engine) has a good chance to simply 'close' most of these lines. In most cases, a pawn sacrifice for the initiative in the type of lines we will see in this game, is worth considerably more than just 'compensation'. Let's study a couple of examples.

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3

Now Black attempts to avoid mainstream theory:

6...Qa5

Another attempt to avoid theory is 6...Ne7 7.Qg4 Kf8?! (the main moves are 7...O-O and the nowadays most often played 7...Qc7). Playing this move, depriving himself from his castling rights, Black banks on the closed nature of the position. The problem is that in case the position opens up, his weak king and poor development will play a major role while any extra pawn Black may collect in the process will have merely psychological importance: 8.h4 and now: A) In case of 8...Qa5 we have a relatively recent top game in which the White player was well prepared: 9.Bd2 Qa4

10.Rh3! - the standard way for White to develop an initiative in such positions

10...Nbc6 (the pawn snatch 10...Qxc2? is bad due to the simple 11.Bd3 Qa4 12.Rg3

g6 13.Nh3 and Black comes under a crushing attack) 11.h5 h6 12.Qf4 Ke8 (White is certainly happy if Black plays 12...cxd4 13.Rf3). White now changes the character of the position and forces a favourable ending with

13.dxc5! (in this type of position Black should watch out for such changes in the

pawn structure!) 13...Qxf4 14.Bxf4. White has tripled c-pawns, however one of them is a plus pawn. White is clearly better. Black hopes to create counterplay with 14...f6

15.Nf3 g5 16.hxg6 Nxg6 17.Rxh6 Rxh6 18.Bxh6 fxe5 19.Rb1 and White had an

advantage and went on to win in Nisipeanu-Suleymanli, Reykjavik Ech 2021. Perhaps even stronger was 17.Bh2 Ngxe5 18.Nxe5 Nxe5 19.Bxe5 fxe5 20.c4! and Black has problems: his pawn centre is shaky while his rooks are not coordinated:

20...Bd7 (or 20...Ke7 21.O-O-O) 21.cxd5 exd5 22.Rh5;

B) 8...Qc7. Now we have a standard pawn sac: 9.Rh3!. This is a strong move, almost a novelty, that probably closes the variation. White sacrifices a pawn under very good circumstances. An old pawn sacrifice that was once considered the 'main line' (in this sideline) is

9.Qd1 cxd4 10.cxd4 Qc3+ 11.Bd2 Qxd4 12.Nf3 Qe4+ 13.Be2 b6. White's sacrificial

idea is similar to Anand's in our main game (considerably less convincing here, however, as Black's pawn is still on g7!). White had compensation at this stage of the game but probably not more, and went on to win in Kasparov-Nikolic, Horgen 1994. B1) One of the very few games we have with 9.Rh3! went 9...b6 10.h5 h6 11.Rf3 cxd4 12.cxd4 Nf5 13.Qf4! (the obvious threat is 14.g4; the game we have went 13.c3 Ba6 14.Ne2. White is clearly better here as well, but later he messed it up and lost in Plazuelo Pascual-Moskalenko, Barcelona 2021) 13...Qxc2 14.g4 and now forcing an ending does not save Black: analysis diagram

14...Qe4+ 15.Qxe4 dxe4 16.Rc3 Ne7 17.a4 with Ba3 to follow, with a large

advantage for White as Black cannot coordinate his pieces; B2) If Black is to suffer, he might as well explore the pawn grab: 9...cxd4 10.cxd4 Qxc2 when a logical further continuation might be 11.h5 h6 12.Ne2 Nbc6 13.Nc3 (Black's only counterplay here is the attack on the d4-pawn) 13...Nf5 14.a4 Nfxd4 (14...Ncxd4 runs into 15.Ba3+ Kg8 16.Rc1 Qb3 17.Ne4 and White wins) 15.Ba3+ Kg8 16.Rg3 and now: analysis diagram B21) 16...Rh7 17.Rd1 Nf5 18.Rd2 Qb3 19.Nxd5 wins for White; B22) 16...Qh7 looks terribly ugly and loses in various ways: 17.Bd3 Nf5 18.Qf4 (18.Qe2 should win as well) 18...Bd7 19.Rb1! (provoking ...b6 proves advantageous for White here) 19...b6 20.Rf3. So as not to lose a piece to 21.g4, Black has to play

20...g5 but now he loses for a different reason: 21.hxg6 fxg6 22.Bxf5! gxf5 23.Rg3+

Kf7 24.Qh4 Rag8 25.Qf6+ Ke8 26.Nb5 and Black gets mated, e.g. 26...Bc8 27.Rc1 Kd7 28.Rgc3!.

7.Bd2 Qa4 8.Qg4

White's main move here. Black is now forced to either weaken his kingside by playing 8...g6 or give up castling by playing 8...Kf8:

8...g6

This move is less often played, because the weakened dark squares on the kingside prove difficult for Black to deal with. 8...Kf8 is arguably the better of two unpleasant choices.

9.Qd1

Anand takes a typical decision, judging that the weakening of Black's kingside is worth two tempi. The text also 'invites' Black to accept the pawn sacrifice.

9.h4 is a typical alternative, played in a number of top games.

In case of 9.Nf3, Black closes the centre with 9...c4, hoping to get something similar to the game Saric-Bartel (in case of 9...Nc6 10.Qf4 h6, like Nisipeanu in the comments above, White can orchestrate a favourable change in the central pawn structure and obtain an advantage with 11.dxc5 as in Karjakin-Zhang, Khanty- Mansiysk 2007). But now we have 'AI at work' more or less closing the line: 10.Kd1! (10.Be2 was played, for example, in Grandelius-Merry, Douglas 2015). This idea, which was novel at the moment of writing, has an interesting tactical motif behind it: A) 10...Nc6 11.h4 h6 12.h5 g5 analysis diagram and now comes tactical idea behind 10.Kd1!: 13.Bxg5! hxg5 14.Qxg5. The position looks complicated?... hmmm... not exactly if you were helped in your preparation by a silicon friend. White has a large advantage, e.g. 14...Qa5 15.Qg7 Qxc3 16.Ra2 or

14...Nge7 15.Qf6 Rf8 16.h6 Qa5 17.Kd2;

B) If Black suspects White's tactical idea and goes for 10...Qa5, White gets a clear advantage with 11.h4 h6 12.Nh2! Bd7 13.h5 g5 14.Qf3 (White has to watch out not to fall for the typical motif 14.f4? f5!) 14...Nc6 15.Ng4 and White has a 'free roll'; C) 10...Bd7 fails to the same tactical motif as 10...Nc6 in line A: 11.h4 h6 12.h5 g5

13.Bxg5! hxg5 14.Qxg5 with Qg7 to follow and White wins (note the importance of

10.Kd1 - the pawn on c2 is protected!)

9...cxd4?

Risky and wrong. White gets much more than just compensation for his sacrificed pawn... not even taking into account that Vishy Anand is one of the worst possible opponents on the planet to face in such a position! Closing the center with 9...c4? does not help Black here as White has 10.h4 h6

11.h5! g5 12.f4!. Had White's queen been placed on g4, then Black would have

12...f5 here, but as it is, Black is in terrible trouble.

Best was 9...b6, though White has an advantage after 10.h4.

10.Rb1

How to assess this pawn sacrifice? Well, at the time game was played, it would have been something like: 'Black has made a very risky choice, White has sufficient compensation at least, and most probably more'. The assessment of today: 'Black is more or less lost, White is close to plus two'.

10...d3

10...a6 11.cxd4 Qxd4 12.Nf3 does not change much.

11.Bxd3 Qxa3 12.Nf3

For his sacrificed pawn, White has a massive development advantage , and the dark squares on Black's kingside are weakened. It may sound a bit over the top, but in a higher sense White has a winning advantage here. Anand goes on to play a nice attacking game crowned by an elegant execution. Yes, there are moments when White could have played better - more accurate perhaps, but Black never really gets a chance to escape.

12...Qc5 13.h4 h6 14.O-O Nd7 15.Re1 a6

Time to open up the position.

16.c4! dxc4 17.Be4

Black wants to stop 18.Bb4.

17...c3 18.Be3 Qc4 19.Bd4 Nc5

Vishy decides for arguably the most logical human move:

20.Re3

My Stockfish has an interesting idea: 20.Bxc5 Qxc5 21.Re3 Ne7 22.h5! g5 and now the Ne7 proves to be badly placed after 23.Qd6! Qxd6 24.exd6 and White has a winning advantage, e.g. 24...Nc6 25.Rxc3.

20...Nxe4 21.Rxe4 Bd7 22.Re3 Ne7

22...Bc6 does not help as White gets a winning advantage with 23.Rxc3 Qd5 24.Rd3

Qd8 (or 24...Bb5 25.Rd2) 25.Bb6 Qe7 26.Rd6.

23.Rxc3 Qd5 24.Rc5! Qe4 25.Rc7 b5 26.Bc5

A logical, human decision, not letting anything go. Your computer engine will tell you that the alternatives 26.Rb4 and 26.Nh2 are even stronger.

26...Nd5?

This allows an elegant finish. 26...Qd5 was more stubborn, but it does not save the game: 27.Qe1 Rc8. analysis diagram A) Now the most human solution is quite efficient: 28.Rxc8+ Bxc8 29.Bxe7 Kxe7

30.Qb4+ Ke8 31.Rb3 and Black simply cannot coordinate his pieces - the Rh8 is

doomed; B) The silicon brain suggests as the most precise 28.Bxe7 Rxc7 (or 28...Kxe7

29.Rd1 Rxc7 30.Rxd5 exd5 31.Qb4+ with a winning advantage as Black cannot

coordinate his rooks) 29.Bf6 Rg8 30.Rd1 and Black's position collapses.

27.Rxd7!

An elegant 'petite combinaison à la Capablanca' nets a queen.

27...Kxd7 28.Rb4

The rest of the game does not require any comment.

28...Qxb4 29.Bxb4 Rhc8 30.Bd6 Rc4 31.Nd2 Rd4 32.c3 Rd3 33.c4 Rxd2 34.Qxd2

bxc4 35.Qxh6 1-0 Tripled pawns for White This position type was hotly debated in the final Candidates Match between Spassky and Korchnoi in 1977. White has ugly pawns, but one of them is 'extra'. This semi- open position may also favour White's bishop pair. The battle is strategically very complex. I would rather be White, but in the mentioned match Korchnoi was quite successful as Black.

One of White's main choices versus the Winawer. As mentioned throughout the chapters of this book, where I find it relevant to provide useful information about opening theory, I do. But this is a middlegame book, so this game serves to show a frequently seen change in the central pawn structure caused by White taking dxc5.

7...Bd7

Black has tried many moves here, and readers interested in theory should also study

7...Qc7, 7...Nbc6, 7...b6 and 7...Qa5 - all lines that are played by (many) top players.

So any reader/player interested in opening theory has a lot of work to do here.

8.dxc5

White voluntarily creates 'Irish pawns' for himself, so what does he get in return? First of all, one of those pawns is an extra pawn, and secondly the position gets an open character, which should benefit White's bishop pair. Black gets one of his pawns back (collecting either the e5- or the c5-pawn), but this opens diagonals for White's dark squared bishop. This particular line was hotly debated in quite a number of games in the Spassky-Korchnoi Candidates match in 1977 and I advise any reader who is willing to broaden their knowledge of this type of position to go through those games.

8...Qc7

Black wants to place her bishop on a4 and then develop her knight to c6. The immediate 8...Nbc6, intending to take White's e5-pawn, was played in a number of top (rapid) games: 9.Bd3 Ng6 10.Rb1 (10.O-O leads to equality; after 10...Ncxe5

11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Bf4 Qf6 we have an approximately equal opposite-coloured

bishops position: 13.Qd2 Nxd3 14.cxd3 d4 15.c4 O-O 16.Bd6 Rfe8 17.f4 Bc6 with a later draw in Shirov-Nikolic, Monte Carlo 1995) 10...Ncxe5 and now: A) 11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Rxb7 leads to equality after 12...Qc8, but when Black in a classical time control game gave a 'healthy pawn' to reach a position with opposite- coloured bishops with 12...O-O? 13.Bxh7+ Kxh7 14.Qh5+ Kg8 15.Qxe5 f6 16.Qg3, he probably hoped that he would hold it despite the two-pawn deficit, but he blunders a full piece: 16...e5?? (16...Rf7 was needed) 17.c6 1-0 Beliavsky-Uhlmann, Sarajevo 1982; B) Anand wanted to create dynamics, and a possibility to throw in the h4-h5 push at the moment of his choosing, with 11.h4: 11...Qc7 12.O-O. An interesting situation! To take on d3 and improve White's pawn structure, or to take on f3 and grab a pawn on h4? Black goes for the latter: 12...Nxf3+? (correct was

12...Nxd3 13.cxd3 f6 and White has just a slight advantage at best) 13.Qxf3 Nxh4

14.Qg3!.

Most probably, Black did not take this option seriously enough as White's pawn structure now looks horrible: 14...Qxg3 15.fxg3 Ng6 16.Rxb7. White has a terrible pawn structure, but his rook on the 7th is a tremendous force here. White has a clear advantage and went on to win in Anand-Nikolic, Monte Carlo 1995.

9.Bd3 Ba4 10.Rb1

A useful move: the rook is on an open file plus White has Rb4 ideas.

10.O-O and 10.Be3 were tried in the mentioned Candidates match Spassky-Korchnoi,

Belgrade 1977.

10...Nec6

Polgar wants to hit the e5-pawn while stopping Rb4 ideas.

10...Nd7...

allows the rook lift 11.Rb4!, and ideed after 11...Bc6 12.O-O Nxc5 (12...Nxe5? is a bad idea as Black's queen gets exposed and it loses too much time: 13.Nxe5 Qxe5

14.Re1 Qc7 (14...Qxc3 15.Bb2) 15.Bf4+-) 13.Rg4 and White had an initiative and

the advantage, though Black eventually emerged victorious in Spassky-Korchnoi, Belgrade 1977.

11.O-O Nd7 12.Be3 h6

White has the advantage here, but this time loss will prove important.

12...Ndxe5 is wrong due to the simple 13.Nxe5 Nxe5 14.Bf4 and Black does not

have a satisfactory way to solve the pin problem. Black's best was the immediate 12...O-O-O when White should go for the game idea

13.Rb4! Nxb4 14.axb4, but here Black's survival chances are better than in the

game.

13.Re1 O-O-O

Black did not have much choice as after 13...O-O? White removes the pawn defences in front of Black's king by means of a piece sacrifice: 14.Qd2 Ncxe5 15.Nxe5 Nxe5 analysis diagram

16.Bxh6! Nxd3 17.cxd3. White now threatens a double rook lift and has a winning

attack; for example, 17...f6 18.Re3. Shirov now executes a thematic exchange sacrifice to improve his pawn structure:

14.Rb4! Nxb4 15.axb4 a6 16.Nd4

White has a clear advantage here and easy play. He has sacrificed only a pawn, so his attack is almost 'free of charge', combined with central domination and a queenside pawn roll. Black is in bad shape here. Polgar does her best to regroup and put up a defence.

16...Nb8! 17.Qa1 Bc6

18.f4 g6 19.Bf2 Rhg8 20.Rb1 Kd7 21.Bh4 Rc8 22.Bf6 Ke8

23.b5

White is in a hurry to win. The prophylactic king move (similar to Kasparov-Short earlier in this chapter) was perhaps the best practical execution: 23.Kh1!. White's b4-b5 push will now come with more power (as Black doesn't have the ...Qxc5 check) and Black doesn't have a good defence, e.g. 23...Nd7 24.b5 axb5 25.Nxb5 Bxb5 26.Bxb5 Qxc5 (26...Kf8 loses to 27.Bxd7! Qxd7 28.Qa7 Rc7 and Black's king is boxed in and his Rg8 is hopelessly placed; 29.Rb6) 27.Qa4 Qc7 analysis diagram Black is under a deadly pin. White now easily wins by opening the position further with 28.c4! and Black's position collapses.

23...axb5 24.Nxb5

Since Black doesn't have any useful moves, the silicon brain prefers to improve White's position before capturing on b5 with 24.Qa7!.

24...Bxb5 25.Bxb5+

25...Nc6

The only way to stay in the game was 25...Kf8! with ...Rg7 to follow. Yes, White is better but he would still need to 'bring it home'. Now White's queen enters forcefully, the terrible position of Rg8 tells, and the game is over:

26.Qa7! Kd7 27.Bxc6+ Qxc6 28.Rb6! Qxc5+ 29.Kh1

White has two terrible threats: 30.Rxb7+ and 30.Rd6+, and sadly Black has to move her king back to e8, disconnecting the rooks.

29...Ke8 30.Qxb7 Rc7 31.Qa6

Black does not get the time to threaten perpetual check or something similar.

31...Rc8

32.Qa4+! Kf8 33.Rb7

The threat is 34.Rxf7.

33...Rg7 34.Qd7 1-0

Chapter 6 Italian, Petroff, Ruy Lopez For the huge area of 1...e5 systems, I have opted for examples that were likely to occur in the reader's practical play, coming from the often-played openings the Italian, the Petroff, and the Ruy Lopez. The 'Italian Dilemma' White's Bh4 pin is annoying for Black, and the most clear-cut way to solve it is a radical one - pushing ...g5. The problem, next to the weakening of the kingside, is that White may sacrifice a piece on g5. Most of the time, this is easy to calculate, but it may simply work for White. After facing (and not successfully solving) this dilemma often in my career with Black, I ended up playing ...h6 most of the time, to stop the annoying Bg5 pin. A typical Italian sacrifice We have an instructive recent top-level game (and one in the comments) where the piece sacrifice on g5 works excellently for White. Game 37 Anish Giri 2768 Ding Liren 2788 Bucharest 2023

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6

Probably Anish was inspired by the following game played by Magnus Carlsen six years prior: 3...Bc5 4.c3 Nf6 5.d3 O-O 6.Bg5. This standard pin is a bit unpleasant for Black. Like in our main game, the pin cannot really be ignored. Retreating bishop to e7 looks a bit passive, while the most radical way (chasing White's bishop away by pushing ...g7-g5) gives White tactical possibilities like in our main game.

6...d6 (due to his pawn still being on d7, Black can opt for 6...h6 7.Bh4 Be7 with

play similar to the recent game Yu Yangyi-Dardha - see the comment to 6...d6 below)

7.Nbd2! (a well-thought-out move-order. By delaying castling, as Anish will also do

in our main games, White keeps sacrificial possibilities on g5, while by defending his e4-pawn he also - sort of - rules out Black's ...Ne7 plan solving the pin on the h4-d8 diagonal. In case of 7.O-O, Black has a well-known plan to solve the pin by playing 7...Ne7!. Black wants to play ...Ng6 with ...h6 to follow, and is not worried about the doubling of his f-pawns: 8.d4 Bb6 and now, compared to 7.Nbd2!, White's e4-pawn is hanging. After 9.Nbd2 Black plays 9...Ng6 with ...h6 to follow, while after 9.Bxf6 gxf6, Black's bishop pair, the open g-file (for Rg8) and the potential ...f6-f5 pawn push compensate for the doubling of the f-pawns) 7...h6 (now, the unpinning 7...Ne7 does not work as White's e4-pawn is defended and White gets a stable advantage after the simple 8.d4. Black is forced to make a concession, giving up the centre with 8...exd4 - with the e4-pawn defended, 8...Bb6? now simply drops a pawn after 9.dxe5 dxe5 10.Nxe5 Qd6 11.Nd3 - 9.cxd4 Bb6 10.Bxf6 gxf6 11.O-O and White has a pleasant advantage) 8.Bh4. Now, Karjakin opts for the most radical way to solve the annoying pin: 8...g5

9.Nxg5! If I remember correctly, when watching this game live, Magnus was still

blitzing out his moves here. He goes for a well-known tactical theme (though it was at the time a novelty in this particular position), and was most probably still in his opening preparation. Karjakin now took his time (interestingly enough, he had underestimated this known sacrificial idea just like Ding) 9...hxg5 10.Bxg5. As the usual result of this thematic sacrifice, White has already grabbed two pawns for the knight, while Black is still far from solving the annoying pin) 10...Kg7 (10...Be6

11.Qf3 Kg7 transposes to the text) 11.Qf3 Be6 (nowadays, theoretical preparation

has advanced to lower-section Olympiad teams and at the Chennai 2022 Olympiad we saw 11...Rh8 12.Nf1 (12.O-O-O is a better execution) 12...Na5 (12...Be6 transposes to 11...Be6 12.Nf1 Rh8) 13.Ne3 Nxc4? (13...c6! was necessary) 14.Nd5 Nxd5 15.Bxd8 Rxd8 16.exd5 and later White won in Mwadzura-Montes Orozco, Chennai 2022). White has a big advantage here, however the execution is far from easy, even for a World Champion. White can successfully capitalize on his pin and gain a full point, but precision is needed. Flashy Stockfish or other top engine assessments are not easy to prove in a human game. Magnus went on to get an advantage, but did not derive the most from it and Karjakin ultimately escaped with a draw: A) 12.b4 Bb6

13.Bd5!. An unpleasant move! The 13...Bxd5 14. exd5 transaction is not really an

option here, as White will get a great outpost on e4 for his Nd2, while the standard ...Nb8-bd7 plan will cost a pawn on b7. Karjakin goes for the best defense: 13...a5!

14.b5 Nb8 15.Bxb7 (White got a third pawn for his knight while the pin on the h4-d8

diagonal still persists) 15...Ra7 (Black's most precise defence was 15...Nbd7! and after 16.Bc6! (White should not be greedy as after 16.Bxa8 Qxa8 the h4-d8 pin has been solved while Black's pieces start to coordinate nicely) 16...Rh8 17.h4 Qf8

18.Nc4 Rc8. White has three pawns for a piece and clear pressure, but Black has

decent survival chances). A1) 16.Bd5 was a logical move, but not the best: 16...Nbd7 17.Nc4 Bxd5 18.exd5 Qe8 (other options were 18...Rg8 or 18...Rh8). The pin has finally been solved! White has pressure, and Black was certainly not out of the woods yet, but Karjakin defended well and the game ended in a draw, Carlsen- Karjakin, Wijk aan Zee 2017; A2) Strongest for White was 16.Bc6!, insisting on eliminating the Nb8 and making it harder for Black to solve the pin. Black is in big trouble, e.g.: A21) 16...Bd7? does not work after 17.h4! Nxc6 (17...Rh8 18.Nc4+-) 18.bxc6 Bxc6 19.Rh3 with Rg3 to follow, with a winning advantage for White; A22) In case of 16...Nxc6 17.bxc6, the only way to get out of the pin here is by giving an exchange: 17...Rh8. Now White takes space: 18.d4! Rh6 (18...exd4?? blunders into 19.e5 dxe5 20.Ne4) 19.Bxh6+ Kxh6 20.d5 Bg4 21.Qg3 and White has a material and positional advantage and should win; A23) 16...Nbd7 17.Bxd7 Bxd7. Here it looks to me that the most logical human continuation is 18.h4 (my Stockfish wants me to play 18.Nc4 Bxb5 19.h4 and says White has a winning advantage) when Black tries to solve the pin with 18...Qe7: analysis diagram

19.h5! and the next couple of moves look forced: 19...Qe6 20.h6+ Kg6 21.h7! Kxg5

22.h8R Rxh8 23.Rxh8 Qg4 24.Ke2. Black's pieces have no coordination - the Ra7 is

hopelessly out of play. White should win this, e.g. 24...Bxb5 25.Rah1 Bd7 26.R8h6; B) The best execution was 12.Nf1!, provided that White is precise. analysis diagram Black cannot solve his problems here: B1) 12...Bxf2+? does not really help as after 13.Ke2! (13.Kxf2? is wrong due to the simple 13...Nxe4+ 14.dxe4 Qxg5) Black has won a pawn but has opened the f-file, so White now easily gets a decisive advantage, e.g. 13...Bb6 14.h4 Rh8 15.Nh2. The open f-file indeed comes in handy for White here, and the only way for Black to resist a bit longer is 15...Nb8 16.Raf1 Nbd7; however, Black loses material after the simple 17.Bxe6 fxe6 18.Ng4 Rf8 19.Bh6+ Kh7 20.Bxf8 Qxf8 21.Nxf6+; B2) Black's best defence is to improve the knight and rook: 12...Nb8 13.Ng3 Rh8. analysis diagram Here White has an important idea that will be repeated in the main Giri-Ding game:

14.Nf5+! Bxf5 (14...Kg6? is out of the question due to the simple 15.h4) 15.Qxf5

Nbd7 and the combination of the h4-d8 pin plus pressure on the f-file (the f7-square) proves decisive here. White opens files and gets his piece back with a winning advantage: 16.O-O-O Qe7 17.h4 Rag8 18.d4! exd4 (or 18...Bb6 19.f4+-) 19.cxd4. Black is forced to give his piece back: 19...Qxe4 (or 19...Bb6 20.Rhe1) 20.Bxf6+ Nxf6 21.Qg5+ Qg6 22.Qxg6+ Kxg6 23.dxc5 with a winning advantage for White.

4.d3 Bc5 5.Bg5 h6 6.Bh4

6...d6

With the pawn still on d7, one thematic way for Black to solve the pin problem is

6...Be7. At the moment of writing, we have one recent top-level game that went

7.Bg3 (strategically Black is happy with the trade after 7.O-O d6 8.a4 Nh5 9.Bxe7

Qxe7=) 7...d6 8.a4 O-O 9.Nbd2 (counterplay for Black? Push the f-pawn!) 9...Kh8! (given that Black has a change of heart in a few moves, he could have opted for the immediate 9...g6 10.a5 a6 11.O-O Nh5) 10.a5 a6 11.c3

11...g6!?. Not a mistake, however I don't like Black's unnecessary mixing of plans.

Black wants to play ...Nh5 but has weakened his kingside. 11...Nh7 is perhaps not precise because White probably has some advantage after 12.Qb3 f5 13.exf5 Rxf5

14.O-O, but consistent and strong was 11...Ng8!. Black has active counterplay and is

not worse, e.g. 12.Qb3 (or 12.d4 f5) 12...f5 13.exf5 Bf6! with ...Nge7 to follow. After 11...g6, White takes central action: 12.d4 exd4 13.cxd4. Black reacts correctly:

13...Nxe4 14.Nxe4 d5 15.Bxd5 Qxd5 16.Nc3 Qc4 17.d5 Re8 18.dxc6.

A tough decision: which check should Black give? 18...Bf6+ (18...Bb4+! was stronger when after 19.Ne5 f6 20.Qd2 Kg7 21.O-O-O fxe5 we have an unclear, dynamically balanced game) 19.Ne2 Bg4 20.O-O Qxe2. White has an advantage here, but does not play accurately: 21.cxb7 Qxd1. Now after 22.Rfxd1 Rab8 23.Ra4 Bxf3

24.gxf3 Rxb7 the endgame was drawish, but thanks to a few mistakes by Black

White managed to win in Yu Yangyi-Dardha, Sharjah 2023. The double attack on Black's f7- and b7-pawns would have yielded White an advantage: 21.Qb3! Qe6 (or 21...Bxf3 22.gxf3 bxc6 23.Qxf7) 22.Qxb7.

7.c3 a5

I assume that further theoretical discussions will be in the direction of 7...g5 8.Bg3 a6 9.Nbd2 Ba7 as in Giri-Keymer, Wijk aan Zee 2023.

8.Nbd2 Ba7

Probably inspired by Magnus's game, Anish keeps delaying his kingside castling:

9.a4!

We have had 9.O-O g5 in a couple of top-level games.

9...O-O

If Black wanted to push his g-pawn, it was a good idea to do it now. For example,

9...g5 10.Bg3 Qe7.

10.h3!

Similar to Karjakin, Ding Liren now goes for a radical solution to the h4-d8 pin problem:

10...g5

If Black plays 10...Qe7, we see another idea behind 10.h3: 11.g4! and Black is in trouble: 11...g5 12.Bg3 (12.Nxg5!? comes into consideration even here) 12...Kg7

13.Qe2 Be6 14.O-O-O! with h4 to follow. White has a strong attack - Black may

collapse in a few moves. Probably Black's best option was 10...Be6 and after 11.g4 (11.Nh2!? is another plan to consider) 11...Bxc4 12.dxc4 (12.Nxc4 leads to an equal ending after 12...d5!

13.exd5 Qxd5 14.Bxf6 e4! 15.dxe4 Qxe4+ 16.Qe2 Rfe8 17.Qxe4 Rxe4+ 18.Kf1

Rxc4 and a draw is the most likely result) 12...g5! 13.Bg3 Qd7. analysis diagram I prefer White here, but my Stockfish gives me zeroes after 14.Qe2 Ne7 15.O-O-O Ng6! (15...Qxa4? is not a good idea as White is fast with his attack after 16.h4)

16.h4 Kg7 17.hxg5 hxg5 18.Nxg5 Rh8 with apparent equality.

11.Nxg5!

Bingo! Giri gets a Carlsen-Karjakin kind of situation.

11...hxg5 12.Bxg5 Kg7 13.Qf3 Be6

Similar to Carlsen-Karjakin, White should emerge victorious here with precise play, but it's not easy! Like Carlsen, Giri does not execute in the most precise way and gives his opponent a chance to escape. Probably still in his home prep, Anish started with a precise move:

14.Nf1! Rh8

Another logical way to defend was 14...Nb8 when after 15.Ng3 Rh8 16.Nf5+! Bxf5

17.Qxf5 Nbd7 we reach a situation similar to what could have happened in Carlsen-

Karjakin: the h4-d8 pin combined with pressure on the f-file (the f7-square) should prove decisive. White opens files and gets a winning advantage with 18.h4. 18.Rf1 is also good, and 18.O-O-O should also work well for White.

15.Ne3

Black has different options to try to solve his problems but, provided White plays accurately, none of them seems to work.

15...Qe7

15...Nb8 16.Nf5+! transposes to lines given in the previous comment.

If Black removes White's annoying knight with 15...Bxe3 then White takes advantage of the open f-file: 16.fxe3 Nb8 (16...Bxc4 doesn't work due to 17.O-O)

17.O-O Nbd7 18.Qg3! and White wins: 18...Nh5 19.Bxe6 Nxg3 20.Rxf7+ Kg6

21.Bxd8.

A different order of capturing with 15...Bxc4 does not work either due to 16.Ng4!. Black prevents an immediate annihilation with 16...Bxf2+ 17.Nxf2 Be6, but the f- file and the pin now prove decisive: 18.O-O Kg6 19.h4 Nb8 20.d4 and White should win. Giri has the right idea but does not execute in the most precise way:

16.O-O-O

More accurate was to 'pro-actively' start the pressure on the f-file with 16.Rf1!. Black has nothing better than 16...Nb8 and now White goes for the already mentioned idea 17.Nf5+! Bxf5 18.Qxf5 Nbd7 19.O-O-O and he will push f4, opening the f-file. Black can't get out of the pin or create real counterplay, e.g. 19...c6 20.Kc2 (removing his king from the ...Be3 check; now White is ready to push f4) 20...b5

21.Ba2 bxa4 22.f4 and Black cannot defend against White's multiple threats.

The immediate 16.Nf5+ is not clear as after 16...Bxf5 17.Qxf5 Black has 17...Nd8! with ...Ne6 to follow.

16...Rag8

Ding Liren does not take his chance. If the f-file is now opened, White does not have an imminent threat, so this was the moment for Black to remove White's knight: A) 16...Bxe3+! 17.fxe3 Nb8. Black is on time now, and we probably have a dynamic balance: 18.Rhf1 Nbd7. analysis diagram The position is tense, and it is easy to go wrong, White needs to be smart to keep the balance here! A1) 19.Qg3 is wrong due to 19...Nh5!; A2) 19.Rf2 does not work in view of 19...Bxc4 20.dxc4 Qe6! 21.Rdf1 Nh7 and Black wins, e.g. 22.Qg3 (or 22.Qxf7+ Qxf7 23.Rxf7+ Kg6) 22...Nxg5 23.Qxg5+ Kf8 24.Rxf7+ Qxf7 25.Rxf7+ Kxf7 and Black has too many pieces for the queen; A3) After 19.Bd5! the engine gives zeroes, while in case of 19...c6 (also possible is

19...Rh7 or 19...Kg6) we see the reason why White inserted 19.Bd5! as now 20.Qg3!

leads to a balanced position: 20...Nh5 (alternative, Black can go for an interesting, materially unbalanced position with 20...Kf8!? 21.Rxf6 Nxf6 22.Qf3 Nxd5!

23.Bxe7+ Nxe7 with unclear play) 21.Bxe7+ Nxg3 22.Bxe6 Nxf1 23.Bxd7 Nxe3

24.Re1 Nxg2 (24...f6? loses to 25.Rxe3 Kf7 26.Bxd6 Rad8 27.Rf3 Rxd7 28.Bxe5)

25.Rg1 f6!. White cannot collect black knight and keep both of his bishops: 26.Bf5

Kf7 27.Rxg2 Kxe7 28.Rg7+ Kf8 29.Rxb7 Rg8 and it is easier for White here, but a draw is the most likely result. B) In case of 16...Nb8 analysis diagram White goes for a well-known solution: 17.Nf5+! Bxf5 18.Qxf5 Nbd7 19.Rhe1! (ruling out Black's ...Be3+ and getting ready for the files to open) 19...Rh5 20.f4 exf4 21.d4 and White wins soon. Anish understands that he has given Ding a chance, and now he continues precisely!

17.Rhf1!

Now White has a winning advantage, and Giri executes with a steady hand.

17...Nb8

White goes for a direct execution, immediately opening the centre.

18.d4

The idea we already established as good for White, 18.Nf5+ Bxf5 19.Qxf5 should work here as well as after 19...Nbd7 20.Kb1 with f4 to follow, Black cannot keep his stuff together.

18...exd4 19.cxd4 Nbd7

20.e5

Direct and strong. White gets his piece back while the attack continues.

20.h4 was probably working too.

20...dxe5 21.d5 Qb4 22.Qe2 Bxh3

Another way to give back the piece was 22...Bxe3+ 23.fxe3 Bg4 (23...Nxd5 loses to

24.Bxd5 Qc5+ 25.Qc2) 24.Bxf6+ Nxf6 25.hxg4 Rh4.

analysis diagram Black's king remains weak: 26.Rf5! Rxg4 27.Bd3 Nxd5 28.e4 Nf6 29.Rdf1 Rg6

30.g4 with g5 to follow, and Black will soon get mated.

23.gxh3 Kf8 24.h4

Ding Liren hopes to create practical survival chances:

24...Bd4 25.Rxd4!

25.Bb5 also looks good.

25...exd4 26.Nf5 Rxg5

26...Ne5 loses to 27.Bb5.

27.hxg5 Ne5

27...Ne8 loses to 28.Re1 Ng7 29.d6.

28.Bb5 Nfg4 29.Kb1 Kg8 30.Nh6+! Nxh6 31.Qxe5 Ng4 32.Qxc7

Now White is up material while his attack still continues.

32...Kg7

33.g6! Rf8

Or 33...Kxg6 34.Rg1 f5 35.f3.

34.gxf7 d3 35.Rg1 Rxf7 36.Qc3+

And facing a piece-down endgame, Black resigned. Rook lift ideas in the Petroff The Petroff Defence (or in some opening manuals 'the Russian') has a reputation of a quiet, solid choice where Black aims to equalize the game. Well, in many lines of the Petroff, this reputation is entirely mistaken, as we get sharp dynamic play. One of the ways for White to seize the initiative is by using a rook lift. Sometimes the rook is lifted via the fifth rank (Rb1-Rb5) and sometimes also via the second rank (Ra2-Re2). Usually we get sharp play, and the games I have selected show the dynamics. Game 38 Nigel Short 2650 Valery Salov 2630 Amsterdam 1989 The rook lift ideas we are about to see in this game were novel at the time and were difficult to evaluate in the pre-computer era. The positions we will reach are very dynamic, with razor-sharp tactics - perhaps not what you would expect in a 'quiet Petroff'.

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Bd6 7.O-O O-O 8.c4 c6

9.Nc3 Nxc3 10.bxc3 Bg4

Nowadays, theoretical discussions go in the direction of 10...dxc4 11.Bxc4 Bf5.

11.cxd5

If White places his rook on b1 with 11.h3 Bh5 12.Rb1, we can get different types of positions: 12...dxc4 13.Bxc4 b5 14.Bd3 Nd7 with comfortable play for Black, as for example in Ljubojevic-Khalifman, Reykjavik 1991.

11...cxd5 12.Rb1 b6

Black's best move is considered to be 12...Nd7. We can get dynamic positions where White sacrifices a pawn: 13.h3 Bh5 14.Rb5 Nb6 (modern theory considers that

14...Nf6 equalizes) 15.c4! Bxf3 16.Qxf3 dxc4 17.Bc2. We have quite a number of

top-level games with this position. White definitely has compensation for the sacrificed pawn but perhaps not more. White now goes for a nice rook lift that is worth remembering:

13.Rb5!

Nowadays, armed with strong engines, we all understand that White stands better here. In the ensuing positions we have sharp tactical play, offering plenty of ideas to a gifted player and very difficult to assess clearly without silicon assistance. In the late 1980s and early 1990, this was a hotly debated line on top level.

13...Bc7

Black can opt for a positional pawn sacrifice here, provided they understand the dangers: 13...Nd7 14.Rxd5 Nf6 15.Rb5 Qc7 16.h3. analysis diagram And now Black can play for a light- square blockade with 16...Be6 17.Qc2 Bc4

18.Rf5 Nd5.

14.c4

Direct, but best for White was to ask Black a difficult question about his bishop!

14.h3! Black does not have a good retreat, so he has to harass White's rook: 14...a6

(14...Bh5? loses to the simple 15.c4 Qd6 16.g4 Bg6 17.Rxd5) when White's best option is to go for an exchange sac with 15.hxg4! (my Stockfish is also enthusiastic about the slightly different exchange sacrifice 15.Rxd5! Qxd5 16.hxg4 Nd7 17.Qc2 with more than just compensation for White) 15...axb5 16.Qc2 g6. It is obvious that White has great compensation here, but in pre-computer days, judging the size of it was far from easy. It took top players quite some time to understand that White has a clear advantage here. Precision is needed! Black's biggest problem is that he is unable to coordinate his pieces. In the following game, Ivanchuk masterfully increased the pressure and finished with a direct mating attack: 17.Bxb5! (in a top level game two years prior, White opted for a more direct but less precise continuation: 17.Bh6 Re8 18.Bxb5 Re4 19.g5; the Bh6 stands great if aided by more forces to mate Black's king, but the way the game went, the bishop remained out of play and Black saved a draw in Short-Gelfand, Brussels Candidates 1991) 17...Qd6 (on 17...Nd7, White should, like Ivanchuk, continue limiting Black's pieces with 18.g5! as getting the exchange back with

18.Bh6 allows the good defensive resource 18...Nf6! 19.Bxf8 Kxf83) 18.g3! and

now: A) If 18...Nc6, White can continue similar to Ivanchuk in the game: 19.Kg2 f5

20.Rh1! and Black is in trouble (20.Bf4 Qd7 21.g5 is less good; White gets a

dominant knight but trades off too many pieces: 21...Bxf4 22.gxf4 Qc7 23.Bxc6 Qxc6 24.Ne5 Qd6 25.a4 Ra5 26.Rb1 and the game Sokolov-Nikcevic, Vrnjacka Banja 1998, later ended in a draw) 20...Rae8 21.Ng5 Re7 22.Rh6 and Black cannot keep his kingside intact, e.g. 22...Nd8 23.Bd3! Nf7 24.Nxf7 Rexf7 25.gxf5 Qd7

26.g4;

B) 18...Ra7 19.Re1 Nd7 20.g5! (limiting the Nd7 and preparing the Nf3-h2-g4 manoeuvre) 20...Rd8. Sensing that Black does not have any counterplay, White takes his time: 21.a4! Nb8. analysis diagram Now the time has come for a mating attack! 22.Nh2! Qf8 23.Ng4 Bd6 24.Kg2 (Black's situation is hopeless, White's attack wins by itself) 24...Kh8 25.Rh1 Qg7

26.Nf6 h5 27.Qd1 and not willing to wait for 28.Rxh5, Black resigned in Ivanchuk-

Bareev, Linares 1993.

14...Qd6?!

This lands Black in trouble. A few months later, Jan Timman vs Nigel Short came up with the best continuation for Black here: 14...dxc4!. The position is very tactical, and dynamically balanced. In the pre-computer era, it could easily take days of analyses to investigate all the possibilities in such positions. A) 15.Bxc4 should not worry Black: 15...Qd6 16.g3 Nc6; B) Jan must have unvestigated the tactical 15.Bxh7+!? Kxh7 16.Rg5. analysis diagram B1) 16...Bxf3? is a blunder that loses by force: 17.Qxf3 Nd7 18.Qh3+ (18.Qh5+ also wins: 18...Kg8 19.Rxg7+! Kxg7 20.Bh6+ Kf6 21.Bg5+; Black gets enough material for the queen but his pieces coordinate badly and king is overexposed)

18...Kg8 19.Rh5 f6 20.Re1!, cutting off the escape route; Black's king will soon be

mated; B2) Modern-day silicon brain analyses point out an interesting tactical line ending in equality: 16...Bc8! 17.d5 and now Black needs to make a prophylactic decision:

17...Kg8! (moving the king to a safer place) 18.Qd4 f6 19.Rh5. White has a strong

attack, but he is also a piece down. Best play probably leads to a draw: 19...Nc6!

20.Qxc4 b5! 21.Qxc6 (21.Qh4 Ne7 doesn't look like a winning attempt) 21...Qe8

22.Qxa8 Qxh5 23.Qxa7 Bd6 24.Qd4 Bb7 25.Rd1 Rd8 and Black has enough

compensation to hold; C) Short went for arguably the most logical continuation: 15.Be4. Here Timman missed a beautiful positional sacrifice: 15...Nd7! (15...Nc6 was played in Short-Timman, Hilversum m 1989) and if 16.Re1?! (Black has full compensation after 16.Bxa8 Qxa8) analysis diagram Black insists on sacrificing an exchange: 16...Nf6! 17.Bxa8 Qxa8 18.h3 Be6 and Black has a great game here, White faces a struggle for a draw.

15.Re1!

White is not afraid of ghosts and lets Black execute his threat.

15...Bxf3 16.Qxf3 Qxh2+ 17.Kf1

White is better developed as the black queen on h2 can easily be a liability here. However, the position is still complicated (a lot of tactics) and mistakes start to happen:

17...Nc6?!

17...Nd7 18.Rxd5 Nf6 19.Rf53 gave Black better surviving chances.

18.Rxd5 Rae8

18...g6? loses to 19.Rd7.

19.Be3?

Throwing away a relatively easy win. The way to execute was 19.Rxe8! Qh1+ (19...Rxe8? loses to 20.Rh5 Qd6 21.Ba3 (or 21.Bxh7+ Kf8 22.Ba3) 21...Nb4

22.Bxh7+ Kf8 23.Bg6! and Black loses decisive material or gets mated, or both)

20.Ke2 Rxe8+ 21.Be3 (the bad position of Black's Q, B, N plus K decides) 21...Qa1

22.Qh3 g6 23.Qd7.

19...g6

Now Black is back in the game!

19...f5 was also possible.

White decides to stop 20...Nb4, but this costs time.

20.a3

20...Qh1+?!

This check actually improves White's king. Black had to exploit White's weak king with 20...f5!. Now the Qh2 is suddenly well placed, and White's best option is to simplify into a drawish endgame: 21.Qh3 (21.g3 f4 22.gxf4 Bxf4 does not look like a winning attempt) 21...Qxh3 22.gxh3 f4

23.Bd2 Rxe1+ 24.Kxe1 Rd8 25.Rxd8+ Bxd8 and a draw is the most likely outcome

here.

21.Ke2 Qh4

Now White pursues a good idea to utilize the h-file, but he does not do it in the most precise way:

22.g4

Correct was 22.Kd1! (removing Black's 22...Nxd4 threat). Now White's king is relatively safe while he has different threats - Rd7 or g4 followed by Rh1: 22...Qe7. analysis diagram Naturally, White is not going to allow 23... Qxa3: 23.c5! bxc5 and now is the time to utilize the h-file: 24.Rh1! cxd4 25.Qh3 f5. Black escapes mate, however lands in a bad position: 26.Bc4 Kh8 27.Bg5 Qg7 28.Bh6 Qe7 29.Bxf8 Rxf8 30.Re1 Qg7

31.Qd3 and White has a large advantage and should win.

[diagram]
Black now has enough counterplay to hold!

23.Rd7 f4! 24.Rh1

24...Qf6?

A crucial blunder. This sharp game could have ended peacefully had Black gone for 24...Nxd4+!

25.Rxd4 Qg5! (25...Qf6? does not stop Qd5+ and loses to 26.Rd7) and we get a

drawish endgame after 26.Qd5+ (26.Qh3 is not a winning attempt as White may only get himself in trouble after the simple 26...Re7) 26...Qxd5 27.cxd5 Bd6 or

27...fxe3=.

25.Qd5+

Black now loses decisive material.

25...Re6

Or 25...Rf7 26.Rxh7.

26.g5

Too many black pieces are hanging.

26...Nxd4+ 27.Kd1 1-0

Game 39 Judit Polgar 2722 Anatoly Karpov 2693 Hoogeveen 2003 I like this game because, similar to Short-Salov, it contains a rook lift on the fifth rank by White. This time, however, the fifth rank is empty at the moment of the rook lift. White gets a choice between doubling on the e-file, keeping the pressure and building up a kingside attack, or a typical promising exchange sacrifice on e6. Judit decides to keep up the pressure on the e-file, developing a kingside attack and ending the game with a beautiful 'Lasker double bishop sacrifice'!

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Be7 7.O-O Nc6 8.c4 Nb4

9.Be2 O-O

10.a3

This move is no longer considered dangerous for Black due to the improvement on move 13. The current main line here (also involving a rook lift!) is 10.Nc3 Bf5 11.a3 Nxc3 12.bxc3 Nc6 13.Re1 Re8 14.Ra2! Nakamura-Nepomniachtchi, Madrid Candidates 2022. This rook lift idea, which is seen in a number of top-level games in these Petroff positions, is aimed at increasing the pressure on the e-file - see further on in this chapter.

10...Nc6 11.cxd5 Qxd5 12.Nc3 Nxc3 13.bxc3

13...Qd6

This devastating Karpov loss had such an impact that the text was not repeated in any subsequent top game! Theory considers 13...Bf5, preventing Rb1, to be Black's best option here, Kasparov-Adams, Linares 2002. Please check the comments in the next game Nakamura-Nepomniachtchi. Also possible is 13...Na5 14.Rb1 a6 (14...c6 should also be good for equality here)

15.Ne5 Bf5 16.Bf3 Qe6 (if Black wants less complications he can opt for 16...Be4)

17.Rb2 Bxa3 18.Re2 Bxc1 19.Nc6 Qf6 20.Nxa5 Bf4 21.Nxb7 Rab8 with a dynamic

balance, leading to a draw in Svidler-Adams, San Luis FIDE Wch 2005. White has a good central pawn structure here - while she improves the development of her pieces, her mobile pawn centre (due to White's pawn still being on c3!) does not give Black any target for counterplay against the d4-pawn.

14.Rb1

Polgar prepares her rook lift.

14.Bd3 was a good alternative.

14...b6 15.Re1 Be6

15...Bf6 was definitely a better choice, though White still has the intiative after

16.Bd3 Bg4 17.h3 Bh5 18.g4 Bg6. Here, White improves his position with a

standard rook lift: 19.Rb2! Rae8 20.Rbe2.

16.Bd3

White has a number of good options here; Polgar goes for the fifth rank rook lift.

16...Rae8

17.Rb5

My Stockfish advises the 'bold and direct' 17.Rxe6!. This typical exchange sacrifice, aimed to destroy Black's pawn structure, works well here: 17...fxe6 (17...Qxe6?? blunders into 18.d5) 18.Qc2! and here the best practical decision for Black is to sacrifice back an exchange: 18...Rxf3! (if 18...h6, 19.Qe2 and White builds up a powerful Q+B battery) 19.Bxh7+ Kf8 20.gxf3 Bf6.

17.Rb2 followed by Rbe2 is a more standard idea - see Nakamura-Nepomniachtchi

and similar examples in the comments to that game. White has the initiative after

17...Bd5 18.Rbe2! Bxf3 19.gxf3 Rd8 20.Bb1.

17...Na5?

In a higher sense, a losing mistake. Black had to go for 17...Bf6!. The logical decision for White here is to gain the bishop pair: 18.Ng5 (should White naively think Black had blundered into 18.d5?, he would only be in trouble after 18...Bg4!) 18...Bxg5 19.Rxg5. White has somewhat better chances, but there is a big fight ahead.

18.Rbe5!

White's pieces are ready to strike at the black king!

18...Nc6

Polgar has her dream position now. She can place her rook on e2, keeping pressure on the e-file, and has a great version of the Nakamura-Nepomniachtchi game, or she can opt for a very promising exchange sacrifice. Judit chooses the former. Happy with her position, she decides to keep all her options open:

19.R5e2

Here, the typical exchange sac 19.Rxe6! worked even better than two moves ago:

19...fxe6 20.Qc2 h6 (20...Rxf3 now leads to a lost position for Black after 21.Bxh7+

Kf8 22.gxf3 Bf6 23.Bg6 Rd8 24.Bh5) 21.Qe2 and the powerful Q+B battery should decide here.

19...Bd7

If Black plays 19...Bg4, White has a direct tactical refutation based on the e-file pin:

20.d5! Bxf3 (or 20...Na5 21.Re4 Bf5 22.R4e3 Bxd3 23.Qxd3 and tripling on the e-

file nets White a piece) 21.gxf3 Na5 22.Re5 with Qe2 to follow, and the e-file pin nets White a piece. Polgar feels that the time has come for the execution:

20.d5! Na5 21.Ne5 Bf6 22.Bf4 Bxe5 23.Bxe5

Very probably, Judit already had Lasker's bishop sacrifice in mind here. 23.Rxe5 also led to a crushing attack: 23...Qxa3 (or 23...Rxe5 24.Bxe5 Qxa3 25.Qh5) 24.Qh5 g6 25.Qh4.

23...Qxa3 24.Re3 Qc5?

Allowing a beautiful finish. Black had to stop the 'Lasker motif' with 24...g6; however, after 25.h4 White's attack should crush through (weak black king, knight out of play).

25.Bxh7+ Kxh7 26.Qh5+ Kg8 27.Bxg7 1-0

Game 40 Hikaru Nakamura 2760 Ian Nepomniachtchi 2766 Madrid Candidates 2022 We have quite a number of top-level games where the typical Petroff rook lift is predominantly aimed at controlling the e-file. White plays Ra2, most of the time to transfer this rook to e2, when the play often becomes tactical. The e-file pressure White gets is just one of the ingredients in the position, and White needs good tactical skills and a feel for the initiative to prevail. I will now show a number of top- level examples of such play. My aim is to show middlegame ideas; however, as usual I will try to provide some relevant opening information as well.

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Nc6 7.O-O Be7 8.c4 Nb4

9.Be2 O-O 10.Nc3

There is a game by Kasparov that is instructive for understanding this type of position: 10.a3 Nc6 11.cxd5 Qxd5 12.Nc3 Nxc3 13.bxc3 and now: A) For 13...Qd6 see the previous game Polgar-Karpov; B) 13...Na5 does not have the best reputation, and for good reason: 14.Ne5 Bf5

15.c4 Qd6

16.c5! and Black's forces suddenly lack coordination: 16...Qd5 17.Bf3 Be4 18.Bxe4

Qxe4 19.Bd2! Nc6 20.Re1. Black cannot prevent material loss: 20...Qh4. B1) Now Leko went for the human continuation, netting a clear positional advantage: 21.Nf3 Qh5 22.Rb1. Black has problems defending his queenside pawns. White had a clear advantage and went on to win in Leko-Adams, San Luis FIDE Wch 2005. It is perhaps good to note that 22...b6? (22...Rab8 does not solve the problems due to 23.Bf4) simply loses material to 23.cxb6 cxb6 24.Rc1; B2) Stockfish gives as more precise 21.g3 Qf6 22.Nd7 Qxd4 23.Nxf8 Bxc5

24.Nxh7! Qxf2+ 25.Kh1 and while it is easy for Stockfish to blink 'large advantage

for White' here, the position remains complicated and precise play is needed. For example, 25...Rd8 analysis diagram

26.Qg4! Qd4 27.Qf5! (the ending after 27.Qxd4 Bxd4 28.Rab1 Kxh7 is far less clear

as Black has decent drawing chances) 27...Qd5+ 28.Qxd5 Rxd5 29.Ng5 Rxd2

30.Re8+ Bf8 31.Rae1 and White should win.

C) 13...Bf5 14.Re1 Rfe8 15.Bf4 Rac8 16.c4. Now, compared to our main game, Black is forced to go with his queen to the centre: 16...Qe4 (16...Qd7? 17.d5 leads to a large advantage for White) 17.Be3

17...Bf6 (White's rook is still on a1 and here Black has an equalizing idea, shown by

Kramnik, in 17...Qc2!; Nepomniachtchi didn't have this queen trade option vs Nakamura as White's rook was already on a2: 18.d5 Na5 19.Nd4 Qxd1 20.Rexd1 Bd7 and the position was equal in Leko-Kramnik, Brissago Wch m 2004). Garry now went for a typical rook lift: 18.Ra2!. White does not have an immediate threat though and Black can choose between different useful moves: 18...b6 (18...Rcd8 certainly came into consideration) 19.h3 (preparing an interesting pawn push!)

19...Na5.

The way Kasparov tried to obtain the initiative here is useful to remember: 20.g4! Bg6 21.g5 Be7 22.Ne5 Bd6. C1) Here, an interesting idea was to try to lock out Black's queen: 23.Bf3 Qh4

24.Bg4 Bxe5 25.dxe5 (25.Bxc8?! looks very risky for White: 25...Rxc8 26.dxe5

Qxh3, though the engine still gives zeros). C11) It is quite possible that the situation after Black's exchange sac 25...Nxc4

26.Bxc8 Rxc8 did not look clear to Kasparov.

analysis diagram Yes, the silicon brain gives White a clear advantage, but precision is needed:

27.Qd7! (27.Qd4? is wrong as after 27...Qxd4 28.Bxd4 c5 Black's queenside pawns

are fast and Black is the one playing for a win) 27...Rf8 28.Bc1! c5 29.Rae2 with e6 to follow; C12) 25...Rcd8 26.Rd2 Nc6 27.Bf4. analysis diagram Black's queen appears locked out (though it's still difficult to catch it): 27...Bf5!

28.Rd5 Be6 29.Kg2 and though the engines give close to zero evaluations, to a

human the position looks promising for White! C2) The game went 23.Nxg6 hxg6 24.c5! (a dynamic pawn push) 24...Bf8 25.Bg4 Rcd8 26.Rae2 Qd5. Kasparov continues with 'initiative play'; basically each of his moves contains a threat - not giving the opponent a break: 27.Bf4! Rxe2 28.Qxe2. C21) 28...Qxd4? was wrong due to 29.Bxc7 Rd5 30.Bd6! and Black does not have a good continuation, e.g. 30...Bxd6 (30...Rxd6 31.cxd6 Qxd6 32.Rd1 Qxa3 33.Rd7 wins for White as Black soon loses material) 31.cxd6 Rxg5 (or 31...Rxd6 32.Qe8+ Kh7 33.Qxf7) 32.Rd1; C22) With precise defense Black could have kept equality: 28...Qc6! 29.Bf3 Qd7

30.Bg4 Qc6. Here, White's best winning attempt is 31.Qe4, but the position remains

balanced after 31...bxc5! (31...Qxe4? 32.Rxe4±) 32.d5 Qb7 (32...Rxd5? blunders into 33.Bf3) 33.Kg2. analysis diagram White has good compensation, but not more than that: 33...c4! (33...Rxd5? loses to

34.Rb1 Rd4 - or 34...Qc6 35.Bf3 Rd4 36.Qxd4 - 35.Qxb7 Nxb7 36.Be3 and Black

lands in a hopeless endgame after 36...Nd6 37.Bxd4 cxd4 38.Rb8) 34.Bf3 Qb6 35.h4 and it's time for Black to improve his knight: 35...Nb7! 36.Qxc4 Nd6 with approximate equality; C23) However, having been under pressure for quite a number of moves, Adams now slipped: 28...c6 29.Bc7 Ra8

30.Qe5 (after having played with great energy, Kasparov now misses the precise

execution: 30.Qa6! and Black is forced into a queen trade: 30...Qc4 31.Qxc4 Nxc4. analysis diagram Now, pawn dynamics decide: 32.d5! cxd5 33.c6 Na5 34.Rc1 Bxa3 35.Rc2 d4 (or

35...Bc5? 36.Rxc5) 36.Bf4 d3 37.Ra2 Bb4 38.c7 and Black loses decisive material)

30...Qxe5 31.Rxe5.

Black should draw this ending, but Adams was probably under time pressure here and some effort and precision are still needed. C231) Perhaps, a less complicated and easier draw could have been obtained by

31...Nb3. Adams was probably worried that his knight would get trapped, but this is

not a really likely scenario. For example, 32.cxb6 (or 32.d5 cxd5 33.cxb6 - 33.c6 drops a pawn to 33...Nd4 - 33...axb6 34.Bxb6 and the knight won't get trapped)

32...axb6 33.Bxb6 and now the most accurate way to draw is by chasing White's

dark-squared bishop: 33...Rb8 (Black should also hold with 33...Bxa3 34.Re3 Nd2)

34.Bc7 Rb7 35.Bd8 Rb8;

C232) After the game move 31...Nc4, Garry went for pawn dynamics (like in the previous comment) but now this should have worked less well: 32.d5! Nxe5

33.Bxe5.

33...cxd5? (the game could have been saved with 33...f5! 34.Bf3 - or 34.gxf6 gxf6

35.Bh2 f5 36.Bf3 Rc8 - 34...Re8 35.Bf4 Bxc5 36.dxc6 Kf8 and Black is just in time:

37.c7 Ke7 38.Bb7 Kd7 39.a4 Bd4 40.Kg2 Rc8 41.h4 Rxc7 with a draw; or 41...Bc3,

and neither side can improve) 34.c6 and now the passed c-pawn will cost Black a full rook: 34...f5 35.gxf6 gxf6 36.Be6+ Kg7 37.Bg3 Bxa3

38.Bxd5 Rc8 39.c7 Bc5 40.Bb7 Rxc7 41.Bxc7 a5 42.Bc6. White has a winning

advantage and he executed successfully in Kasparov-Adams, Linares 2002.

10...Bf5 11.a3 Nxc3 12.bxc3 Nc6 13.Re1 Re8

Now Nakamura goes for a standard idea, which he had already tried before in one of his games:

14.Ra2!

White has the initiative, but with precise play Black is very close to equality. He has a couple of options:

14...Bf8

A) 14...Na5 is probably not a good idea as White's initiative now develops fast:

15.cxd5 Qxd5 16.Rb2.

A1) The stem game (in GM practice) went 16...a6 and White sacrificed a pawn to seize the initiative: 17.Ne5! Bxa3 18.Bf3 Qd6 19.Rbe2 Bxc1 and here the game went

20.Qxc1 Nc6 and was later drawn in Shankland-Robson, St Louis 2014. White's

play can be improved with 20.Nc4! Qd7 21.Nxa5 Ba3 22.Bxb7 and White has a clear advantage; A2) If 16...c6 White, similar to previous lines, can sacrifice a pawn to develop an initiative: 17.Ne5! Bxa3 18.Bf3 Qd6 19.Rbe2 Bxc1 20.Qxc1 and the pressure on the e-file (tactical motifs) plus Black's stranded Na5 promise White more than sufficient compensation; A3) 16...b6 17.Ne5 Rad8 18.Rb5?! (Nakamura thinks he wins by force, but strongest was 18.Bf3 Qd6 19.Rbe2 f6 and now the Kasparov-type idea (as in his game vs Adams) 20.g4! Bc8 21.Nd3 with a tremendous initiative) 18...c5 19.Rxa5. Here Black has a great resource: 19...Qxe5!! with equality. In the game Nakamura- Akobian, Saint Louis 2016, White indeed won easily after 19...bxa5 20.Bc4. B) Black has a reasonable alternative: 14...dxc4 15.Bxc4 Na5 16.Bd3 (playing on the misplaced Na5 with 16.Bb5 c6 17.Bf1 does not work here as Black is fine after

17...Bf6 18.Rae2 Rxe2 19.Qxe2 Be6 20.Ne5 c5) 16...Bxd3 17.Qxd3 Bf6 18.Rxe8+

Qxe8 19.Re2 Qc6 20.Bg5 and White has some pressure, but the game Saric- Mastrovasilis, Greece tt 2017, ended in a draw; C) 14...Bf6 is another serious alternative, played by the 14th World Champion:

15.Rb2 (15.cxd5 Qxd5 16.c4 Qd6 looks unclear as, similar to positions we could

have reached in our main game, White has a mobile pawn centre but it's not easy to find a cleverl way to push his pawns) 15...b6 16.Bf4 (the fifth rank rook lift with

16.cxd5 Qxd5 17.Rb5 makes little sense here as it's difficult to find a follow-up after

the simple 17...Qd7) 16...Na5 17.cxd5 Qxd5 18.Ne5. White gives up his bishop pair and focuses on light-square control: 18...Bxe5!

19.Bf3 Qd7 20.Bxe5 Nc4! 21.Rbe2 c6 with approximate equality and later a draw in

Alekseev-Kramnik, Dortmund 2007.

15.cxd5 Qxd5 16.c4

An important moment! Where to go with the queen? Nepo takes a brave decision, trusting his calculation skills:

16...Qe4

16...Qd6! looks about equal as it's not easy for White to find a clever way to make

good use of his mobile pawn center; for example, 17.Rd2 Rad8 18.Bf1 Bg4 19.Rxe8 Rxe8 20.Bb2 b6 with a dynamic balance. Black's queen is now exposed and we get a lot of tactics. Nakamura asks his opponent some direct questions:

17.Bf1

17.Be3 was the alternative.

Black has two normal moves here. Which one to choose? A tough question!

17...Qg4

Not the best response. Black had to go for 17...Qb1!, holding with computer-like precision: 18.Rxe8 Rxe8 19.Rb2 Qa1 20.Rxb7 analysis diagram

20...Be4! (20...Bxa3? is wrong due to 21.Rxc7 Qxc1 22.Qxc1 Bxc1 23.Rxc6)

21.Rxc7 Bd6! 22.Rd7 Bxa3 23.Nd2 Qxc1! (23...Bf5 is wrong due to 24.Nb3 Qb1

25.Rb7) 24.Qxc1 Bxc1 25.Nxe4 Rxe4 26.d5 and this tactical tussle peters out into a

drawn opposite-coloured bishops endgame: 26...Re7 27.dxc6 Rxd7 28.cxd7 Bg5.

18.h3

Now Black's pieces are poorly coordinated, his queen is over-exposed, and he is in trouble.

18...Rxe1 19.Qxe1 Qe4 20.Re2 Qd3 21.Rb2 Qe4 22.Re2 Qd3

23.Re3

23.Nh4 was promising too, as after the relatively forced 23...Qb1 24.d5 Nd4 25.Rb2

Qa1 26.Nxf5 Nxf5 27.Rxb7 Bxa3 28.Bd2 White has a clear advantage due to his bishop pair and active rook.

23...Qb1 24.d5 Ne7

White does have a clear advantage, but we have lively piece play (a lot of tactics) and Nakamura lets it slip:

25.Nd2

Correct was 25.Nd4! and Black is in trouble: 25...Qb6 26.Qd2 (27.Rxe7 is a threat, and tactics do not save Black) 26...c5 (the relatively passive 26...Bg6 was perhaps best; White has a strong initiative after 27.Rb3 Qa6 28.g4 Rd8 29.Qb2 b6 30.f4)

27.dxc6 bxc6 28.Rxe7 Rd8. It may look as if Black is saved by tactics, but the weak

back rank decides: 29.Re8! Rxd4 30.Qe3 (31.Qe7 is a threat) 30...Bd7 31.Ra8 Be6. analysis diagram White's Bc1 comes into play with devastating force: 32.a4! c5 33.Ba3 Rd8 34.Bxc5 and Black loses decisive material.

25...Qa1

White is still a bit better, but the worst is definitely behind Black.

26.Nb3 Qf6 27.Bd2 Ng6 28.Na5

28.Bc3 was perhaps a better try.

28...b6 29.Nc6 Bd7

White's 'active' Nc6 is not causing much damage, and moreover it can be removed any time. Hikaru understood he had let his advantage slip.

30.Bc3 Qd6

Now the position is unclear. Black could also have considered 30...Qg5.

31.Bb4 Qf6 32.Bc3 Qd6 33.Bb4 Qf6 34.Bc3 1⁄2-1⁄2

Open files The advantage of controlling an open file is a well-known strategic concept. The diagrammed position shows the most common situation: White has the advantage since he exerts pressure on the pen file and controls it, and Black is trying to equalize by neutralizing that advantage. Barring unexpected factors (blunders), we usually have two basic scenarios: A) Black successfully trades pieces, making a draw, or B) Black suffers (and eventually loses). In our selected game Deac-Robson (see below), it was 'B'. An open file may also produce more dynamic and tactical play. In the other three games I have selected, White controls the e-file, but he connects this strategic trump card to tactical motifs and ideas. Game 41 Sanan Sjugirov 2663 Arjun Erigaisi 2634 Riga 2021

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Bd6 7.O-O O-O 8.c4

8...c6

8...Be6 has a bad reputation, and for a good reason. Black lands in a passive position

after 9.Re1 Re8. Now White takes space, a typical plan in such positions, and gains a comfortable advantage with 10.c5! Be7 11.Nc3 Nxc3 (here Black has an interesting and as yet untried option to make a positional pawn sacrifice, which in these circumstances may not be so bad: 11...Nc6!? 12.Nxe4 - White is, of course, not obliged to take the pawn and can continue his development with 12.Bf4 - 12...dxe4

13.Bxe4 Bd5 and for the sacrificed pawn Black has control of the central light

squares and should probably hold this) 12.bxc3 Nd7 13.Bf4 (Black's counterplay attempt does not bring him the desired result) 13...b6 14.Qc2 Nf8

15.Ne5! Bf6 (grabbing a pawn with 15...bxc5 is not advisable as after 16.Bb5 f6

17.Nc6 Qc8 18.c4! Black will soon start losing material) 16.Bb5 Bxe5 17.Bxe5 Bd7

18.c6. White had an advantage and went on to win in Kamsky-Jussupow, Tilburg

1992.

9.Nc3

For 9.cxd5 cxd5 10.Nc3 Nxc3 11.bxc3 Bg4 12.Rb1 see Short-Salov.

9...Nxc3

Trying to maintain the knight on e4 is not a good idea for Black here as after 9...Re8

10.Qc2 Bf5 11.Re1 Bb4 White has a strong exchange sacrifice: 12.Bg5! Qa5

13.Nxe4! dxe4 14.Bxe4 Bxe1 15.Bxf5 g6 16.Be4 Bb4 17.c5!. Black is in a bad

shape here: a bad king position combined with a locked-up bishop. He decided to give material: 17...Nd7 (17...Qa6 keeps the bishop alive but will not make Black happy either as White gets a large advantage after 18.h4 Nd7 19.h5 Nf8 20.Bd3! b5

21.a4) 18.a3 Bxc5 19.dxc5 Qxc5 20.Rd1 and White had a big advantage and won

easily in Grischuk-Rozentalis, Istanbul Ech 2003.

10.bxc3 dxc4

Black can also try to be clever and play a useful move with 10...h6. On the top level, this has been tried by Baadur Jobava) in mostly blitz/rapid games. An easy way for White to get a large advantage was demonstrated by Santosh Vidit. Similar to Kamsky-Jussupow above, White takes space with the typical 11.c5! Bc7. Now White starts a direct attack - easy logical play: 12.Bc2 Nd7 13.Qd3 Nf6 14.Ne5 Re8 15.Bf4 Black has no counterplay. 15...Re7 16.Rae1 Qe8 17.Re3! Be6 18.Rg3. White had a winning attack, but later he messed it up and lost in Vidit-Jobava, MrDodgy Online Inv blitz 2021.

10...Bg4 is another option for Black, when play usually continues 11.cxd5 cxd5

12.Rb1 - see Short-Salov.

11.Bxc4 Bf5

In case Black goes for a pin with 11...Bg4, White gets the advantage with 12.h3 Bh5 analysis diagram

13.g4! Bg6 14.Ne5 Nd7 15.Nxg6 hxg6 16.Bb3. White has the bishop pair plus a

space advantage, and his king is actually quite safe.

12.Bg5

Less played but quite interesting is 12.Ng5 when we get dynamic play: 12...h6

13.Qf3 Bg6. Now White goes for an interesting pawn sacrifice resulting in g-file

pressure: 14.Ne4! Bxh2+ 15.Kxh2 Qh4+ 16.Qh3 A) 16...Qxe4? is not a good idea for Black though precision is needed as usual:

17.Ba3! (the immediate 17.f4 does not bring White the desired result after 17...Bf5!

18.g4 - or 18.Qg3 Nd7 19.Ba3 c5 - 18...b5! with unclear play, while 19.Bb3?

blunders into the simple 19...Qe2+) 17...Rd8 18.f4! and White's pawn avalanche decides: 18...Qf5 (or 18...Bf5 19.g4 - 19.Qg3 is also strong - 19...b5 20.Rae1) 19.g4 Qc2+ 20.Kg1 and White has a winning attack; B) 16...Qxh3+ 17.gxh3 Bxe4 18.Rg1 Re8 (Black cannot keep his extra pawn as

18...Kh7? blunders into the prosaic 19.Ba3) 19.Bxh6 g6. White has some initiative

though Black should hold. White eventually won in J. van Foreest-Esipenko, France tt 2023.

12...Qa5

12...Qc7 runs into the tactic 13.Nh4! Bxh2+ 14.Kh1 Bf4 15.Nxf5 Bxg5 16.f4.

Black is not developed (the Nb8 is still on its initial square) and White's attack is fast. Black's next move, though relatively logical, is already a losing mistake:

16...Bf6? (more resilient is 16...Bd8 though White has great attacking prospects after

the typical rook lift 17.Rf3) 17.Qh5 g6 18.Qh6 Qa5 19.Rf3 (going for the win of Black's queen; interesting enough, White had all the time in the world here and

19.g4! was even stronger; White's attacking options are so great here that 19.Ne7+

Bxe7 20.f5 wins as well) 19...Qxf5 20.Rh3 Qxh3+ 21.Qxh3 and White went on to win in Idani-Gholami, Turkey tt 2022.

13.Nh4

The dynamic 13.d5!? has been tried in a number of top-level games. In my opinion, Black can hold here, but he needs to be well prepared. Readers interested in theoretical research are advised to investigate this dynamic option.

13...Be6

Let's stop here and take stock. We now get one of the typical Petroff pawn structures.

14.Bxe6 Qxg5 15.Nf3 Qa5 16.Bb3 Nd7 17.Qd3 Rae8 18.Rfe1 Nf6

White has a strong light-squared bishop, but is difficult to further exploit its active position. White has somewhat more space and mobile central pawns, but it's not easy to push them and Black may challenge White's centre by pushing ...c5. The only open file, the e-file, may be of importance, but at the moment it's not clear how either side can take control of it. Most probably, the objective assessment should be: 'dynamic balance/slight pull for White'. Both sides make a couple of useful moves first:

19.g3 g6 20.h4 Kg7 21.Kg2

Black decides to 'stay put', making neutral moves:

21...h6

A couple of months after this game, Ivic applied a different and probably better strategy, immediately hitting White's centre with 21...c5. The position is dynamic and White now looked for a tactical solution related to Black's f7-weakness:

22.Rxe8 Rxe8 23.Ng5 Re7.

White now restricted the black queen's retreat options: 24.Rb1! b6 25.Rd1 cxd4! (the immediate 25...h6 leads to a promising position for White after 26.Bxf7! Rxf7

27.Nxf7 Kxf7 28.Qc4+ - sadly, Black does not have ...Qd5 - 28...Kg7 29.Qe6 Bf8

30.Rd3!) 26.Qxd4 (26.cxd4 brings White nowhere after 26...h6 when White's knight

has to retreat, leading to equality: 27.Nf3 Qh5) 26...Be5 27.Qb4 Qxb4 28.cxb4 h6 Abdusattorov kept the game alive by taking an interesting decision to unbalance the material: 29.Nxf7!? Rxf7 30.Bxf7 Kxf7 31.b5 Ke7 32.f4 Bd6 33.Rd4 h5 34.Ra4 Bb8. The position is dynamically balanced and the game Abdusattorov-Ivic, Belgrade 2022, later ended in a draw.

22.Rad1 Qc7

Sjugirov now takes an interesting strategic decision, deciding that the control of the e-file is worth closing off his active Bb3:

23.c4!

Erigaisi goes for the most logical reply, stopping c5 followed by Ne5:

23...c5

Worth considering was 23...Rxe1!? 24.Rxe1 Qd8!, allowing the bishop retreat (to control the Ne5 jump) while preparing ...Re8.

23...Nh5, aiming for ...Bxg3, is not good as White gets a winning attack with

24.Ne5! Bxe5 25.dxe5 Rxe5 26.Qc3 f6 27.c5!. With a weak king and a hopeless

Nh5, Black's position now quickly collapses, e.g. 27...Rfe8 28.Rxe5 fxe5 29.Rd6 Nf6 30.Be6.

24.d5

White strategic idea is now clear: he wants to take control of the e-file with Ba4!

24...Nh5

Black looks for counterplay by creating the threat of ...Bxg3. Trading all four rooks is generally a good idea, but due to Black's potentially weak kingside it does not quite work here: 24...Rxe1 25.Rxe1 Re8 26.Rxe8 Nxe8 27.h5! g5. analysis diagram The perfect square for the white knight? Well, f5! 28.Nh2! Nf6 29.Nf1 Nxh5 30.Ne3 (White gets his pawn back while attack continues) 30...Nf6 31.Nf5+ Kf8 32.Nxh6 Qd7 33.Nf5 and due to Black's weak king White has a large advantage here.

24...Qd7, preventing White's Ba4 and keeping control of the e-file, has another

problem: the pin on the a1-h8 diagonal (another plus of 23.c4!) 25.Qc3! and the situation is unpleasant for Black. White says: 'I calculated well! Go ahead with your bishop sacrifice!'

25.Ba4! Re7

For better or worse, and certainly for practical reasons, Black had to go ahead with his piece sacrifice: 25...Rxe1 26.Rxe1 analysis diagram

26...Bxg3! 27.fxg3 Qxg3+ 28.Kf1 Nf4. White gets an advantage but needs to be

precise: 29.Qc3+ Kg8 A) 30.Re4 looks logical and temping, but after the forced 30...g5 31.hxg5 hxg5

32.Qe3 Qh3+ 33.Kf2 Qg2+ 34.Ke1 Black has a beautiful tactic based on the bad

position of White's rook on e4: 34...Qb2! (34...Qxa2 is less good as White has a clear advantage after 35.Qb3 Qg2 - 35...Qa1+ 36.Kd2 - 36.Kd1 a6 37.Qe3) 35.Qb3 and now: analysis diagram Black saves the game with the surprising 35...f5!. The smoke soon clears and we get a drawish endgame after 36.Qxb2 Nd3+ 37.Ke2 Nxb2 38.Re7 Nxa4 39.Nxg5 Nb6: White is active but not for more than a draw; B) 30.Re5, to weaken Black's position, doesn't really bring White anything: 30...f6

31.Re7 g5;

C) 30.Re7! and now we get a relatively forced sequence: 30...g5 31.hxg5 hxg5

32.Qe3 Qh3+ 33.Kf2 Qg2+ 34.Ke1 Qxa2 (34...Qb2? is wrong due to 35.Qd2)

35.Qb3 Qg2 36.Kd1 a6. White is better but play remains sharp and it's easy to err.

26.Rxe7 Qxe7 27.Re1 Qf6

28.Nd2!

White is not worried by Black's tricks. He has a strong initiative and the extra pawn is little consolation for Black. Sjugirov executes well. Black's queen is badly placed in case of 28...Qd4 29.Qc2.

28...Qxh4 29.Ne4

Also good was 29.Bd1 Qd4 30.Qc2. Black cannot prevent Bxh5, damaging his pawn structure, since 30...Nf6?? blunders a queen to the prosaic 31.Nb3.

29...Qe7 30.Qc3+!

An important check, disrupting Black's coordination.

30...Be5

30...Nf6 loses to 31.Nxc5 Qc7 32.Nd7, while 30...Qe5 lands Black in a lost ending

after 31.Qxe5+ Bxe5 32.Nxc5 Bc3 33.Rc1.

31.Nxc5 Qxc5 32.Qxe5+

32...Kg8

32...Nf6 was a better defence as White will still need to show accuracy: 33.Re4!

(33.Re3 is not good due to 33...Qxc4) 33...Rd8 (33...g5 leads to a winning ending for White after 34.d6 Qxe5 35.Rxe5 Rd8 36.c5). White's d-pawn push has been temporarily stopped, but now Black's rook is not well placed after 34.Re3!. Black has no counterplay and runs out of moves, eventually losing decisive material. Here are a few sample lines: A) 34...Qxc4?? 35.Rf3 Qa6 36.Bc6; B) 34...b6 35.Bc6 g5 36.a4 and White has a winning endgame after 36...Kg6

37.Qe7;

C) 34...g5 leads to a winning ending for White after 35.Qe7; D) A similar outcome is 34...Qd6 35.Qxd6 Rxd6 36.Re7; E) 34...Qb6 35.Rb3 and Black soon loses decisive material, e.g. 35...Qa6 36.Qe7 Rf8 37.Bb5. Now White's d-pawn simply queens.

33.d6! Qxc4 34.Bb3 Qc8 35.Qe7

Note the terrible position of Black's Nh5.

35...Kg7 36.d7 Qc6+ 37.Kg1 Qf6 38.Qxf8+ 1-0

Game 42 Bogdan-Daniel Deac 2693 Ray Robson 2689 Prague 2023 Modern theoretical/middlegame discussions in the Ruy Lopez Anti-Berlin variation are centred around White's attempt to prove that only the control of the open e-file is sufficient to put Black under long-term pressure. This game is a good example, and I will also put some other relevant examples in the comments. White tries to combine the control of the e-file, more space, and tactical elements, to put long-term pressure on Black. With precise play Black should be okay, but in human play it's easy to err. Also, in normal circustances, White has pressure while being on the safe side - Black rarely wins those positions, and this often puts White in a psychologically comfortable situation.

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.O-O Nxe4 5.Re1 Nd6

6.Nxe5

Recently, White players have also tried 6.a4!?, which is based on a strategic idea: White tries to get a favourable pawn structure on the queenside after 6...a6 (6...Be7 is considered Black's best - see the next game, Grandelius-Howell) 7.Nxe5 Be7 8.Bf1 Nxe5 9.Rxe5 O-O 10.d4 and compared to our current main game we have the moves

6.a4 a6 included. This favours White in quite a number of lines, for example

10...Ne8 11.Nc3 Bf6 12.Re1 d5 13.a5 c6.

White's pawn being on a5 and Black's on a6 clearly favour White here as Black's queenside can be easier targeted. Grischuk achieved the same and got a nice advantage in his game vs Gukesh (see the comments to 13.Qc3!? in this game)!

6...Be7 7.Bf1 Nxe5 8.Rxe5 O-O 9.d4 Bf6 10.Re1

Though the pawn structure is symmetrical, White has some advantage. He has more space and easier development, and controls the only open file. Black aims to exchange a few pieces, finish development and equalize. In practical human vs human play, Black's road to equality is not exactly straightforward, as precision is needed and it is easy to err. We regularly see quite a number of top players stumbling on this road as Black.

10...Re8

At the moment of writing, the text is the most played move here. Black's plan is clear: trade a pair of rooks and finish development. Black's main alternative is 10...Nf5. Here, the most ambitious for White is to take space: 11.d5 Re8 (if Black starts with 11...d6, White plays 12.Nd2 and after 12...Re8

13.Ne4 the situation is not pleasant for Black as White has more space while Black

has problems to develop his cramped pieces) 12.Rxe8+ Qxe8 13.Qd3 d6 14.Nd2. An important moment! Black (Aronian) follows the logic: 'I have less space, let's trade some pieces'. It's sound logic but it doesn't work here. As I said, in human over-the-board play the road to equality is not easy as Black needs to be precise!

14...Bg5 (Black needed to hit White's centre to look for immediate activity with

14...c6! 15.c3 - very probably, Levon did not like 15.Ne4, but Black has suffient

dynamics for equality after 15...Be5! - 15...cxd5 16.Qxd5 Qc6! 17.Qxc6 bxc6

18.Ne4 Be7 and the position is equal; the game Jones-Jakovenko, Khanty-Mansiysk

2019, later ended in a draw) 15.Nf3 Bxc1 16.Rxc1 and Black has a difficult life ahead! White will control the e-file, and keep and increase his space advantage while Black struggles to find any counterplay: 16...Bd7 17.Re1 Qd8 18.Qc4. White's pieces are well coordinated, he has firm grip on the position, and counterplay with ...c6 will work less good now, e.g. 18...g6 19.h3 Ng7 20.Re3 a5

21.a4. It's not easy to give Black good advice, so Aronian says: 'Okay, I don't have

any counterplay but my position is solid, show me your plan'. 21...Ne8 22.Qd4 Ng7. Now White (Magnus Carlsen) took space on the kingside with 23.g4!. Black hopes that with the pawn on g4, White's king position will be weaker and his central counterplay has better chances to work: 23...c6 24.c4! Ne8 (if 24...cxd5 25.cxd5 Rc8, White targets Black's weak pawns with 26.Qf4 Qf8 27.Rb3 Rc7 28.Rb6 Ne8

29.Nd2! and Black's problems continue) 25.Qf4 Kg7 26.Rb3 Rb8 27.Ng5

27...Nf6? (a decisive mistake in a difficult position. 27...Qf6 28.Qd2 h6 was

probably Black's best, but the problems remain; Black is still doomed to passive defence: 29.Ne4 Qd8 - or 29...Qe7 30.Re3 - 30.Qd4+ Kg8 31.Rf3) 28.Rf3! A typical logical and clean execution by Magnus! (if 28.Qxd6 h6 - 28...cxd5 loses to

29.Rf3! Bxa4 30.Qe5! - 29.Ne6+! - 29.Nf3? leads to a draw after 29...cxd5 30.cxd5

Bxa4 31.Qxd8 Rxd8 32.Rxb7 Rxd5= - 29...Bxe6 - 29...fxe6?? blunders into 30.dxe6 Be8 31.Rxb7+ - 30.Qxd8 Rxd8 31.dxe6 fxe6 32.Rxb7+ there is still some technical work ahead). Black has a set of combined problems: f-file pressure, the d6-pawn hanging, the threat of a Qd4 pin... 28...h6 (28...cxd5 29.cxd5 b5 30.Qd4 and the pin decides; 28...Qe7 loses to 29.Re3 Qd8 30.Qxd6) 29.Ne4 Nxe4 30.Qxf7+ Kh8

31.Qxg6 1-0 Carlsen-Aronian, Stavanger 2018.

11.Bf4 Rxe1 12.Qxe1 Ne8

Black's plan is clear: push ...d5, develop the Bc8, preferably trade a few more pieces and make a draw. White has different options, and he can choose between a technical and a tactical approach.

13.c3

A) The tactical option is 13.Nc3!?. White wants to build on his development advantage and does not mind sacrificing (a) pawn(s) in the process. We now get interesting tactical play where White is taking risks too. This has been tried in quite a few games at top level. The ensuing positions are probably dynamically balanced. For readers with a good memory who are willing to put in some serious computer- supported work, it can be rewarding. I will give a couple of interesting examples. The most principled decision, accepting the sacrifice, is Black's best here: 13...Bxd4! (White has a safe advantage after 13...d6 14.Bd3) 14.Nd5 and now: A1) 14...c6 leads more or less by force to a slight technical advantage for White:

15.Ne7+ Kf8 16.Nxc8 Qf6! 17.Rd1! Rxc8 18.Qe4

18...Bc5 19.Rxd7 Rd8 20.Rxd8 Qxd8. White has the bishop pair advantage and a

safe long-term pull. It does not hurt to mention that this is one of those typical positions where the bishop pair brings White an advantage while 'pure bishop vs knight' would be equal. In the few top games we have, White pressed a bit but ultimately it ended in a draw as in, for example, Dominguez Perez-So, Zagreb rapid 2022; A2) 14...d6 15.Bg5 f6 16.Bh4 (on the top level, White has also tried other moves here, like 16.Be3, 16.Qe4 or 16.Bc4) 16...g5! (16...Bxb2 is certainly playable; however, after 17.Rb1 Be5 18.f4

18...c6! 19.fxe5 cxd5 20.exf6 Nxf6 21.Bd3 Bd7! the position looks slightly easier to

play for White; the game Karjakin-Anand, Stavanger 2017, eventually ended in a draw) 17.Qe4 and now: A21) Objectively best may be to grab another pawn with 17...Bxb2! 18.Re1 Be5. White has to open up the position: 19.f4 gxh4 (19...gxf4!? is something to explore)

20.fxe5 dxe5 21.Bd3.

Black has collected some pawns but has a weak king. White has full compensation but probably not more: 21...Kf8 (Black had an interesting alternative in 21...Bf5!? when there seems to be a dynamic balance: 22.Qxf5 Qxd5 23.Qxh7+ - 23.Re4 leads by force to a balanced ending after 23...Ng7 24.Rg4 Qd4+! 25.Kf1 e4 26.Qxe4 Qxe4

27.Rxe4 Re8 28.Rxh4 with a draw as the likely outcome - 23...Kf8 24.Re4 Rd8 and

White has compensation, but probably not more. The silicon brain gives zeroes, in human terms it's an 'unclear game') 22.Ne3 Qd4 (22...Qe7, protecting the h7-pawn, was perhaps a better idea) 23.Qxh7 Be6 24.Bg6 Rd8 25.Qh6+ Ke7 26.Qh7+ Kf8

27.h3! and Black's king problem is not easy to solve. White went on to win in

Kryvoruchko-Tari, Germany Bundesliga 2022/23; A22) If 17...Be5, as in the previous comment, White opens up the position: 18.f4 gxh4 19.fxe5 dxe5 20.Bd3 and compared to the comments above White's rook still needs to be developed but his b2-pawn still lives: 20...Kf8 21.Rf1 (White's rook is well placed on the f-file) 21...Be6

22.Nxf6! Nxf6 23.Qxe5 (also quite promising for White looks 23.Qxh4 Kg7

24.Qg5+ Kf7 25.Bxh7 and Black has to find only moves to stay in the game:

25...Qh8! 26.Bg6+ Ke7 27.Qxe5 Rd8! and in human practical play, White has better

chances here) 23...Kf7 24.Be2. Niemann wants to create motifs around the white king, hoping for counterplay: 24...h3 (my Stockfish 'easily' comes to zeroes with

24...Qe7 25.Bh5+ Kg7 26.Qg5+ Kh8 27.Qxf6+ Qxf6 28.Rxf6 Bxa2!) 25.g4 h6

(25...Qd5 26.Rxf6+ Ke7 27.Qxd5 Bxd5 28.Rh6±) 26.g5 hxg5 27.Bh5+ Kg7. An interesting moment! Find a 'prophylactic attacking move' for White!

28.c3 is the quiet move that wins. White threatens 29. Qxg5+ with Rxf6 to follow

while ...Qd4+ is no longer possible. Instead, the game Deac-Niemann, Sharjah 2022, went 28.Qxg5+ Kh8 29.Qxf6+ Qxf6 30.Rxf6 Rg8+ 31.Kf1 Bxa2 and was later drawn. B) 13.Qc3!? is an interesting alternative worth exploring! Let's have a look: B1) The active attempt 13...d6!? 14.Nd2 c5 probably equalizes, but Black needs to be accurate: analysis diagram For example, 15.Qb3! Bxd4 16.Bc4 Qc7! (16...Qf6? loses to 17.g3 followed by Ne4)

17.Nf3 Bf6 18.Re1 Bf5 (18...Bg4? is wrong due to 19.Ng5 Bh5 20.Qh3). White's

initiative looks promising but Black holds. A logical, consistent follow-up can be

19.h3 Bg6 20.g4 h6 21.h4 Qd7! 22.g5 hxg5 23.hxg5 Qg4+ (23...Bd8? loses to

24.Nh4) 24.Bg3 Bxg5 25.Nxg5 Qxg5 26.Qxb7 Rd8 (White's king is not great, so

White has to trade queens) 27.Qe7 Qxe7 28.Rxe7 d5 29.Bd3 Bxd3 30.cxd3 and White's active rook certainly compensates for the pawn deficit, but still a draw looks like the most objective result here; B2) 13...d5 14.Nd2 B21) 14...c6, and now Grischuk tries to achieve the pawn structure I was talking about in my comments to move 6: 15.a4!? Nd6 16.Re1 Nf5 17.Nf3 Be6 18.a5! a6 (White controls the e-file; Black's queenside is fixed and can easily be targeted. White has a good situation here) 19.h3 g6 20.Bd3 Rc8 (20...Ng7 was a better move, not allowing the motif in the game. Black parries the immediate threats, but after

21.Qb4 Qd7 22.Ne5 Qe7 23.Qb6 h5 White has obvious pressure).

An important moment! White had to sense which was the right trade: 21.Bxf5! (White went for a different trade: 21.Qb4 Qe7 22.Qxe7 Nxe7 with still some pressure, but the game soon dried up and Black held a draw in Grischuk-Gukesh, Dubai 2023) 21...Bxf5 22.Qb4!. Black has serious problems here as we will get a position with opposite-coloured bishops where White is in command. Such positions are long-term suffering for Black: 22...Qd7 23.Re3 (the immediate 23.Ne5 is also good). Black does not have a good solution here. He may try 23...Bxc2 24.Ne5 Bxe5

25.Rxe5 when his best chance to survive is 25...c5! (25...Re8? loses to 26.Rxe8+

Qxe8 27.Bh6 when the combination of Black's weak king plus his weak queenside will prove decisive) 26.dxc5 with a clear advantage for White; B22) A logical alternative for Black is 14...Bf5 15.Re1 c6 16.Nb3 Nc7. White has pressure here, based on his control of the open file. White combines this with targeting Black's queenside pawns: 17.Be5 (17.Na5!? is an alternative) 17...Ne6 (Black's best reaction was probably 17...Bxe5 18.Rxe5 g6, but this position is not entirely equal. White has pressure (e-file, safer king, potential to target Black's queenside pawns)) 18.Na5 Qe7. In Deac-Navara, Riga 2021, there followed 19.b4 Be4 and the game was later drawn. White was tactically not alert and missed a good opportunity with 19.Bxf6! Qxf6 (after 19...gxf6 it's not easy to estimate the size of Black's kingside weakening, but it is certainly an achievement for White) 20.Qb4! and Black does not have a good way to defend his queenside weaknesses, so White wins a pawn. The only way for Black to stay in the game is 20...Qd8! 21.Qxb7 Rb8 22.Qxa7! Ra8 23.Nxc6 Rxa7 24.Nxd8 Rxa2 25.c4! Kf8!. White will be a pawn up, but Black has drawing chances.

13...d5 14.Nd2

14.Bd3 has been tried in a number of top games (including Carlsen-Karjakin during

their World Championship match in New York 2016). Black responds with 14...g6 followed by ...Ng7 and ...Bf5.

14...Bf5

Black has alternatives in 14...c6 and 14...g6.

15.Qe3 c6 16.Re1

White has pressure here, based on his control of the e-file. He will combine it with pushing his kingside pawns. Can Black equalize? Yes, probably. Is it easy? No. Your engine will give you close to zeroes but do not mistake this for 'easy equality'! Black needs to be precise and it is easy to err.

16...h6 17.h3

One top-level game went 17.Qg3 Bg6 (after the logical trade 17...Bg5 18.h4! Bxf4

19.Qxf4 Black still needs to work to equalize fully) 18.Nf3 Qb6

19.b4 (this is not precise and allowing Black counterplay; 19.Re2! followed by Ne5

would have kept Black under pressure) 19...a5! 20.a3 axb4 21.axb4 Qd8. The open a-file gives Black counterplay, and the game was later drawn in So-Aronian, Istanbul ol 2012.

17...Bg5

White does control the e-file, but how to improve? Push the kingside pawns!

18.g4!

The alternative pushing idea is 18.Bxg5 Qxg5 19.f4 (19.g4 Qxe3! is fine for Black, as the queen trade brings him closer to equality here) 19...Qg6 20.g4 Nd6! with ...Re8 to follow - by pushing pawns White has also abandoned a few squares. Black should hold equality here, but in a game between humans, the position looks easier to play for White. The first question for Black is: should he still allow White to take Bxg5, changing the pawn structure, or not? Robson decides not to react.

18...Bg6

18...Bxf4 19.Qxf4 Bc2 was the alternative. After 20.Nf3, the engine will give many

lines that end close to zero. But the position still looks easier to play for White, who controls the e-file and has the plan to push his kingside pawns.

19.Bxg5 hxg5 20.Nf3 f6 21.h4 gxh4

21...Qd7 was the alternative, but White does have an advantage after 22.Bh3 Be4

23.hxg5 Bxf3 24.Qxf3 fxg5 25.Qe3. His command of the e-file matters, while Black

needs to protect his g-pawn and has to worry that the c3-c4 push, bringing White's bishop into play, does not come at an unfortunate moment.

22.Nxh4

22...Be4?

The decisive mistake! Having the pawn on f3 will come in handy for White. The immediate 22...Bh7 was necessary. Now, after 23.Bd3 Bxd3 24.Qxd3 (similar to the game) Black has 24...Nd6!. White's best reply is 25.Nf5 (now 25.Ng6 does not win as Black has an important tempo with 25...Qd7! and 26.Ne7+ - 26.f3 Re8 is equal - 26...Kf7 doesn't give White more than a draw: 27.Qg6+ Kf8 28.Qh5 Re8

29.Qh8+ Kf7 30.Qh5+ Kf8) 25...Nxf5 26.Qxf5 and the position is still not equal but

Black is moving in the right direction.

23.f3 Bh7 24.Bd3! Bxd3 25.Qxd3

Due to White's e-file pressure combined with Black's weak king, Black can no longer be saved.

25...Rc8

25...Nd6 now loses to 26.Ng6! Qd7 27.Ne7+ Kf8 and with his g4-pawn protected,

White now wins with the simple 28.Qh7.

26.Qf5

26.Ng6 also wins (Black's king is simply too weak): 26...Rc7 27.Qe2 Nd6 (or

27...Kf7 28.Qh2) 28.Qe6+ Nf7 and now White has a nice win: 29.Qe8+! Kh7

30.Nf8+ Kg8 31.Nd7+ Qxe8 (31...Kh7? 32.Qxf7) 32.Rxe8+ Kh7 (with this limited

number of pieces, White has a winning attack!) 33.Nf8+ Kh6 34.Re2! Rc8 35.Rh2+ Kg5 36.Rh5+ Kf4 37.Kf2! and White mates on the next move.

26...Nd6 27.Qe6+ Nf7 28.Ng6 Rb8

White has full control! Bogdan Deac first improves his position further.

29.Kg2 Qd6 30.Qf5 Nh6 31.Qh5 a5

How to crush Black? Push pawns!

32.f4! Kh7 33.f5! Kg8 34.Re6 Qc7 35.Ne7+ Kf8

With this final pawn push, Black's defences collapse.

36.g5! Ng8 37.Qh8 1-0

To prevent mate, Black will first lose his queen, and then some. Game 43 Nils Grandelius 2672 David Howell 2646 London ENG-SWE Challenge Match 2022

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.O-O Nxe4 5.Re1 Nd6 6.a4!?

As I explained in the comments to the game Deac-Robson, this line, which is still considered to be a relative sideline, has a strategic idea behind it. White hopes that Black will push 6...a6, when he will get a strategically favourable version of the main 6.Ne5 lines. David Howell ignores White and continues developing:

6...Be7

White's positional idea behind 6.a4!? becomes clear in the following continuation:

6...a6 7.Nxe5 Be7 8.Bf1

A) If Black plays 8...O-O, White takes space with 9.d4 Nf5 and here White has a choice between playing for a positional advantage or making an interesting pawn sacrifice. A1) With his development advantage and control of the e-file, White has interesting tactical ideas like the pawn sacrifice 10.Nc3!? Ncxd4 analysis diagram

11.Nd5 (11.g4? is not a piece win due to (simple) 11...Nh4 12.Qxd4 d6). White has

dynamic piece play and Black needs to be careful: 11...Bc5! 12.Nd3 Ba7 13.Qg4 (White has serious threats like 14.c3 or 14.Bg5) 13...Qh4! (13...d6? runs into the textbook tactic 14.Bg5 f6 15.Bxf6! Rxf6 16.Re8+) 14.Qxh4 Nxh4 15.Nxc7 Rb8. The smoke is slowly starting to clear; White does not have more than an a tiny advantage after 16.Be3 (playing for 'domination' with the inspired 16.Bf4 Nxc2 17.Bd6!? Nxe1

18.Rxe1 leads to equality after 18...g6! 19.Nd5 Nf5 and we will probably have a

peaceful outcome; for example, 20.Nf6+ Kg7 21.Bxf8+ Kxf8 22.Ne5 Kg7 23.Ne8+ Kf8 24.Nf6 Kg7) 16...Nhf5 17.Bxd4 Nxd4 18.Nb4 d6; A2) 10.d5 leads to a positional advantage after 10...Nxe5 11.Rxe5 d6 12.Re1 - compare this to the game Carlsen-Aronian (in the comments to Deac-Robson), White has a similar kind of pull here; A3) Another safe road to a small advantage for White is 10.Nf3 d5 11.c3. In general, Black would prefer to have some of the light pieces already traded in positions like these. B) 8...Nxe5 9.Rxe5 O-O 10.d4 Ne8 11.Nc3 Bf6 12.Re1 d5 13.a5!. The advantages White gets by the inclusion of 6.a4 a6 are becoming clear. White will have an advantage on the queenside, where the pawn structure is fixed, plus regular e-file pressure and kingside attack ideas. 13...c6 14.Bf4. B1) Now Aronian, playing Black, went for a standard bishop trade: 14...Bg5 15.Be5 Bf6 16.Qd2 Bxe5 17.Rxe5. White has a good situation here: e-file control, a nice outpost for his knight on the queenside (on c5), and the option to push his kingside pawns like in Deac-Robson. Also, we can compare this position to Grischuk-Gukesh from the comments to Deac- Robson: White has similar trumps here. After 17...Nf6 18.f3 Be6 19.Na4 Qd6 20.b4 Nd7 21.Re3 Rae8 22.Rae1 Black was doomed to passive defence but managed to survive to a draw in Niemann-Aronian, Saint Louis 2022; B2) The silicon brain suggests a radical solution to the problem: 14...b5!?, which is definitely not an easy decision for a human player. White should opt for a pawn sacrifice: 15.axb6! Qxb6 analysis diagram

16.Na4! (another option is 16.Bd3 Bxd4 17.Qd2 when White definitely has

compensation but perhaps not more) 16...Qxd4 17.Qf3 Qa7 18.c3. Black has won a pawn, but his Ne8 is badly placed, the a6-pawn is weak, and his piece coordination is not good. White will play b4 followed by Nc5 and despite the pawn he has better chances here.

7.Nc3 O-O 8.d4!

White has a development advantage and wants to keep the momentum.

8...Nxd4!?

Black accepts the challenge! A huge majority of top players decided on the relatively boring 8...e4 when we get a standard small plus for White after 9.Nxe4 Nxe4

10.Rxe4.

9.Nxd4 exd4 10.Nd5

Due to his development advantage, White has a strong initiative and Black needs to be careful - the price of each move here is high!

10...Re8?

This logical move is a mistake that should have been (almost) losing. Black's best is 10...Bh4!, but this is just the first in a series of accurate moves Black needs to play to keep the balance. Now the move that puts Black most to the test is

11.Bd3 (11.g3 c6 12.gxh4 cxd5! leads to equality, while 12...cxb5?? is a losing

blunder due to 13.Bg5 f6 14.Bf4). A) Pushing a pawn with tempo is usually a good idea in such situations, but here

11...c6 is a losing blunder due to 12.Nc7! and Black's position can no longer be

saved! 12...Qxc7 (12...Rb8? loses prosaically to 13.Bf4 Be7 14.Qe2) 13.Qh5! Bxf2+

14.Kxf2 and Black is three pawns up but cannot develop. One recent GM-level game

continued 14...f5 (14...g6 does not change much; White has various roads to victory here: 15.Qh4 Ne8 16.Bh6 Ng7 17.Re7 and Black's king is too weak while he cannot develop the queenside, giving White plenty of time for the kill) 15.Re7 Ne4+. Now White executes nicely: 16.Kg1! Qd8

17.Rxe4! g6 18.Rg4! fxg4 19.Bxg6 hxg6 (19...Qe7 loses to 20.Bh6 Rf6 - precision

is always important as White has only one way to win here: 21.Bxh7+!) 20.Qxg6+ Kh8. Here White has several wins, but he considers that grabbing a free extra pawn does not hurt: 21.Qh5+ Kg8 22.Qxg4+ Kh7 23.Qh5+ Kg8 24.Qg6+ Kh8 25.Bg5 Qa5

26.Rf1 Rxf1+ 27.Kxf1 1-0 Balakrishnan-Quesada Perez, Chesterfield 2022;

B) Black has only one move to keep the balance: 11...b6! 12.Qg4. Now Black needs another smart move: 12...f5! (12...Bb7? loses to 13.Bh6 Bf6 14.Nxf6+ Qxf6 15.Bg5 and Black's queen is trapped) 13.Qxd4 Bb7 14.Bf4 Ne4. The position is still sharp, but Black should hold the balance.

11.Qg4

Black's problem is his undeveloped queenside. White's development advantage is simply too big here.

11...f5

11...c6! is perhaps the most resilient here, however after 12.Bh6 g6 (12...Bf6 loses to

13.Nxf6+ Qxf6 14.Bg5 Qg6 15.Bd3 f5 16.Qxd4) 13.Nxe7+ Rxe7 14.Bd3 Ne8

15.Qxd4 ...

analysis diagram Black has indeed avoided an immediate annihilation, but his situation is far from good, for example 15...d6 16.Bg5 (16.h4 also looks promising) 16...f6 17.Bd2 and with h2-h4-h5 to follow White has plenty of compensation here, as Black's king is weak while his pieces still coordinate poorly.

12.Qxd4 Bf6

12...c6 now loses to 13.Nxe7+ Rxe7 14.Bg5 and the end picture after 14...Rxe1+

15.Rxe1 Qxg5 16.Qxd6 perfectly illustrates Black's poor development.

13.Nxf6+ Qxf6 14.Bc4+! Kh8 15.Rxe8+ Nxe8

Black has escaped an immediate slaughter, but his queenside is still not developed. White has a winning advantage but, of course, precision is needed! Grandelius lets it slip:

16.Qe3

White should have realised how huge his development is (and it is not diminished after a queen trade) and should have gone for the strong and precise 16.Be3!. Black has to try to develop: 16...d6 (16...c6 loses to 17.Re1 d5 18.Bg5! Qf8 analysis diagram

19.Qc5 Qg8 20.Bd3 - Black cannot develop and will soon lose decisive material; in

Stockfish language this position is plus four). Now White calmly brings on his rook to penetrate the e-file: 17.Re1!. Black has to trade queens: 17...Qxd4 (17...Bd7 loses to 18.Qd5! Qf8 19.Qxb7) 18.Bxd4 Bd7 19.Re7 (White has total domination)

19...Bxa4 (on 19...Rd8, White calmly keeps improving his position with 20.h4)

analysis diagram Black's king is weak, and White now goes for a tactical win: 20.Rf7! h6 21.Rf8+ Kh7 22.Be6! and Black either gets mated or loses a piece: 22...Bxc2 23.Bg8+ Kg6

24.Bf7+ Kh7 25.Bxe8. Black's ordeal is far from over as 26.Bg6+ is to come, so

Black will lose his rook too.

16...Qf8 17.b3

White is still better, but Black now has objective survival chances.

17...Nf6 18.Bb2 d5! 19.Bd3 c5

19...Bd7 was perhaps a better defence.

20.Bxf6 gxf6

21.Qf3

White misses the last chance to make Black's life difficult. Precise was 21.Re1 Bd7

22.Qf4! and Black is still far from a draw as 22...Re8? loses to 23.Rxe8 Qxe8

24.Qd6 or 23...Bxe8 24.Qxf5.

21...Be6 22.Bxf5 Bg8! 23.Re1 Re8 24.Rxe8 Qxe8

White does not have enough material to take advantage of Black's weak king.

8.Rxe5 O-O 9.d4 Bf6 10.Re2!?

This rook retreat is considerably less often played than the main line 10.Re1, but there is definitely logic behind it. White steers the game into slightly different directions as now Black reacts differently.

10...b6

Let's first try to understand the difference with the 10. Re1 retreat. Should Black stick to the same plan and continue 10...Re8, then the rook on e2 offers White a number of advantages because if Black captures ...Rxe2 and White recaptures Qxe2, White's queen will be considerably better placed on e2 than on e1. White has two ways to try to take advantage of this situation: A) 11.Bf4 Rxe2 12.Qxe2. Black is not forced to accept White's pawn sacrifice here, but then White has a risk-free advantage: 12...Bxd4. White has different options (move-orders) here, perhaps the most precise being 13.Bxd6 cxd6 14.Na3. analysis diagram Black needs to try to develop with 14...d5! (grabbing another pawn loses too much time: 14...Bxb2? 15.Re1 Qf8 16.Nb5 - Black cannot complete his development and White soon wins decisive material, e.g. 16...Bf6 17.Nc7 Rb8 18.Qb5! Be7 19.Re3! b6 20.Qe2) 15.Re1 Qf8 16.Nb5 Bb6 17.Nc3! Ba5 18.Qb5 Bxc3 19.bxc3. White gets his pawn back, and Black still needs to develop his queenside, so his problems are not solved yet; B) Another way for White to obtain an edge is 11.c3 and after 11...Rxe2 (we can also use the move-order 11...Nf5 12.Bf4 Rxe2 - not 12...c6?? as with White's rook on e2 instead of e1, this loses on the spot to the simple 13.Bc7! - 13.Qxe2) 12.Qxe2. White's queen being on e2 instead of e1 brings White a couple of advantages: his rook can move directly to e1, exerting immediate e-file pressure, the queen can move to f3 and also White sometimes has Qb5 ideas. For example: B1) If 12...Ne8, White can now take space similar to Carlsen-Aronian (see the comments to Deac-Robson): 13.d5 (another option is 13.Bf4 d5 14.Nd2 and now in case of 14...Bf5 we see the advantage of the queen being on e2: 15.Qb5!) 13...c6 and now it comes in handy for White to have 14.Qf3!, with an advantage in Kovalenko- Omelja, Bialystok 2017; B2) 12...Nf5 13.Bf4 c6. Now White has a good option in 14.g4! Nh4 - thanks to the queen being on e2, this knight jump does not pose any threat, so White can calmly continue 15.Bd6. C) The pawn sacrifice 11.Nc3 is more of a rapid play weapon as Black is fine after

11...Rxe2 12.Qxe2.

Black has to accept the sacrifice: 12...Bxd4! (12...Qe8 leads to an inferior ending for Black after 13.Nd5 Bd8 14.Qf3 Qe4 15.Qxe4 Nxe4 16.Bf4 c6 17.Nc7 Bxc7 18.Bxc7 d5 19.f3 and due to his bishop pair, White had a clear advantage and went on to win in Hansen-Hammer, PRO League rapid 2017) 13.Nd5 c6. Now, White has different ways to get sufficient compensation, but not more: C1) On 14.Bf4, a tactical resource keeps the balance: 14...Bxf2+! 15.Qxf2 Ne4

16.Qd4 cxd5;

C2) Or 14.Ne7+ Kf8 and White has many ideas but nothing substantial, e.g. 15.Bg5 (15.Bf4 Ne8!) 15...f6 16.Nxc8 Rxc8 17.Qd3 Qb6; C3) 14.Nc7 Qxc7 15.Bf4 b6. Now, to keep the momentum, it makes sense for White to sacrifice another pawn: 16.Rd1! (16.c3 looks about equal after 16...Bf6 17.Rd1 Bb7) 16...Bxb2 17.Bxd6 Qd8. White has great domination, but the silicon brain gives zeroes... in human play this can be unpeasant for Black. With the text, Black wants to play ...Ba6 followed by a trade of the light-squared bishops.

11.Re1

McShane first trades a pair of rooks and then develops his Bc8 - probably not the most precise order.

11...Re8

A more accurate development is 11...Bb7. We have a number of top-level games here, most of which end in draws. I would like to explore one a bit further: 12.a4!?. The next few moves are logical: 12...Bg5 13.Nc3 Bxc1 14.Qxc1 Qf6 15.Qd2. An important moment! Black continues his 'trading plan' but this allows White to get an edge: 15...Rae8 (it was better to stop White's a-pawn advance with 15...a5!. David Navara most likely refrained from this decision because he did not like his position after 16.Re5 Rae8 17.Rae1. But Black is able to neutralize White's e-file pressure and equalize with 17...Re6! 18.Nb5 Nxb5 19.Bxb5 and now the 'dynamic defense' 19...Rfe8! 20.Qc3 Rxe5 21.dxe5 Qg6 22.f3 Bc6 with equality) 16.a5!. Now White has an edge. Black continues his 'trading plan': 16...Ne4 17.Nxe4 Rxe4

18.Rxe4 Bxe4 19.Re1 Bf5 20.Qf4 d6.

White has an advantage here, but probably Grandelius did not get the most out of the position. Most precise looks 21.a6! - the e-file is important here! Endings will be unpleasant for Black, for example 21...Be6 22.Qxf6 gxf6 23.Bb5 and Black faces a difficult time (e-file, structural problems, space...). The game went 21.c3 Be6

22.Qxf6 gxf6 and White had an advantage but Black managed to survive in

Grandelius-Navara, Malmö 2022.

12.Bf4 Rxe1 13.Qxe1

A pair of rooks has been traded. Black faces problems similar to other examples in this chapter: White's e-file pressure, space, and Black's bishop on b7 will be passive too. Can Black equalize? Perhaps, but, as in several other examples in this chapter, though the silicon brain evaluates at close to zero, it's not easy in practical human play.

13...Ne8 14.Nc3 Bb7 15.Qd2 d5 16.Re1 Nd6

The counterplay attempt 16...c5 does not bring Black equality after 17.dxc5 bxc5. analysis diagram Due to the badly placed Ne8, this position with hanging pawns in the centre favours White. A) The easy positional way is 18.g3; Black needs to react and White has an advantage after 18...d4 19.Ne4 Be7 20.Bg2 Qb6 21.b3; B) White can also opt for more direct play with 18.Na4 Rc8 (this allows a tactical solution; the alternative 18...c4 also leads to White's advantage after 19.Nc3)

19.Nxc5! Rxc5 20.Qb4 Rxc2 21.Qxb7 and Black's best way to stay in the game is to

aim for an inferior endgame: 21...Bd4 22.Qxd5 Bxf2+ 23.Kh1 Rc8 24.Qxd8 Rxd8

25.Re2 Bb6 26.Rd2 Rc8 27.g3 and Black will struggle for a draw.

17.Bd3

Black goes for immediate counterplay, allowing a nice tactical idea:

17...c5

Changing the central pawn structure with 17...Nc4 18.Bxc4 dxc4 19.Be5 leads to positions that look pleasant for White to me due to the well-placed Nc3 and Black's doubled c-pawns. Probably McShane was thinking the same, but my Stockfish gives close to zeros after 19...Bxe5 20.Rxe5 h6 or immediately 19...h6. An interesting idea was 17...Bxd4!? 18.Bxh7+ Kxh7 19.Qxd4 Kg8. White spots the tactical solution!

18.dxc5! bxc5 19.Nxd5! Bxd5 20.Bxh7+ Kxh7 21.Qxd5

Black is still very much in the game, but precise defense is needed.

21...Be7

A) If 21...Nb5, White grabs a third pawn with 22.Qxf7 and Black's king is weak. After the arguably best 22...Rc8, 23.c3 is better for White, and 22...Bxb2? blunders a piece to 23.Qf5+ Kg8 24.Qe6+ Kh8 25.Qh3+ Kg8 26.Qb3+; B) 21...Ne8 22.Qxf7 Bxb2 does not work for Black due to his weak king: 23.Qh5+ Kg8 24.Rd1 Qc8 25.Qd5+ Kh7 (25...Kh8 loses to 26.Rd3). White has a winning advantage but he still needs to take care: 26.Qe4+! (on 26.Rd3? Black has 26...Nf6!)

26...Kh8 (or 26...Kg8 27.Rd3). Now, with Black's king on the eighth rank, 27.Rd3

wins as 27...Nf6 loses to 28.Rh3+ Qxh3 29.Qxa8+ check!

21...Qa5 was a good defensive resource, e.g. 22.c3

analysis diagram

22...Re8! 23.Rxe8 Nxe8 24.Qe4+ g6 25.Qxe8 Qxa2 - it's not easy to say, but Black

might be closer to a draw than White to a win here. Now White allows Black to escape:

22.Re3

White missed a nice solution with 22.Kf1!. White king is no longer threatened by a back rank mate, while also it will be hiding from checks. Black's best is 22...Rc8 (22...Rb8 loses to 23.Rxe7 Qxe7 24.Bxd6; 22...Kg8 runs into 23.Rxe7) 23.Bxd6 Bxd6 24.Rd1 Qf6 25.Qxd6 Qxb2 26.Qd3+. Now that the smoke has cleared, White is a pawn up in a technical endgame.

22.Bxd6 Bxd6 23.Rd1 leads to a draw after 23...Rb8 24.Qxd6 Qxd6 25.Rxd6 Rxb2.

22...Bf8

This move does not lose, but it forces Black to find a difficult defensive resource a few moves down the road.

22...Rb8! was a relatively easy draw: 23.Bxd6 (23.Rh3+ Kg8 24.Qh5 leads to a draw

by perpetual check with 24...f6 25.Qh7+ Kf7 26.Qh5+ Kf8) 23...Bxd6 (23...Qxd6 leads to a drawn endgame: 24.Qe4+ Kg8 25.Qxe7 Qxe7 26.Rxe7 Rxb2). White's best here is to agree to a draw by move repetition 24.Qh5+ (24.Qxf7 is not mate as Black has 24...Bf4!) 24...Kg8 25.Rh3 Kf8 26.Qe2 Kg8 27.Qh5 Kf8.

23.Rh3+ Kg8 24.Qh5 f6 25.Qh8+ Kf7 26.Qh5+ Kg8 27.g4!

White correctly decides to play on and put Black to the test!

27...Qe8?

The losing mistake. To stay in the game, Black had to come up with a difficult-to- find defensive resource: 27...c4! 28.g5 Qa5!. Black's queen is active and White's king is exposed - Black saves the game! White's best chance is 29.Qh7+ (29.Bxd6 is equal after the easy moves 29...Qe1+ 30.Kg2 Qe4+ 31.Kf1 fxg5=) 29...Kf7 30.Bxd6 Bxd6 31.Qh5+. analysis diagram Black still needs to play a few only moves: 31...Ke6! 32.Re3+ Be5! 33.Qg4+ (or

33.f4 Qd2!) 33...f5 34.Qxc4+ Qd5 35.Qa6+ Qd6 and the game is saved.

28.Qh7+ Kf7 29.Qh5+ Kg8 30.Qh7+ Kf7

Naturally White plays on!

31.Re3! Qc6

As usual, to get to the opponent's king, pawn defences need to be removed:

32.g5! fxg5 33.Bxd6 Bxd6

33...Qxd6 loses to 34.Rf3+ Ke7 35.Qe4+.

34.Qf5+ Kg8 35.Qe6+ Kf8

And White concludes the game with a nice move:

36.Re5! 1-0

A typical Ruy Lopez Breyer position Diagrammed is a typical Ruy Lopez position. This particular position comes from the Breyer Variation but we may get something similar from other closed Ruy Lopez variations. Black has a well-placed knight on the c5-outpost, while White has almost everything else. Many great players, Magnus Carlsen included, have opted for this position as Black. I have some experience with it, and I did not like it because White has different plans while Black does not have clear and easy to execute counterplay. One of White's main plans is to open up the kingside and get an attack there by pushing his f-pawn to f4. The selected game and those included in the comments show White's plans and the problems Black faces in these positions. The f4 push in a closed centre Game 45 Maxime Vachier-Lagrave 2780 Bassem Amin 2704 France tt 2019 In this game I will show a typical type of position coming from the Breyer Variation - as said, similar positions may come from other classical Ruy Lopez variations. The central structure is fixed, Black's knight is (sort of) well placed on c5, while White has many other things! White's main plan is to push the f-pawn to f4, opening up the kingside to get an attack. As a consequence, Black will get a central outpost on e5 (usually for a knight) but nevertheless Black struggles to find active counterplay. I never felt comfortable in such situations as Black and ended up playing a different type of Breyer where the central structure was not fixed with 15...c5 16.d5 c4. This game, and a number of examples given in the comments, illustrate well the kind of problem Black faces or may easily face.

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 O-O 9.h3

Nb8 10.d4 Nbd7 11.Nbd2 Bb7 12.Bc2 Re8 13.Nf1 Bf8 14.Ng3 g6 15.a4 c5 An important strategic decision, fixing the pawn structure. Black does not have to do this - he can keep the central pawn structure fluid and opt for other main lines here, like for example 15...Bg7.

16.d5 c4 17.Bg5

A typical pawn structure in this line. Black is happy getting his knight to c5, White is preparing a kingside attack, mostly introduced by the with f4 push. White has more space and can combine kingside and queenside plans, as he does in this game. Black's Bb7 often turns out passive, while it is strategically clever for him to trade off his dark-squared bishop - but on the other hand, that bishop protects his king. This strategically complex position has been played in many top-level games. I am personally not really fond of Black's strategy and after years of experience, I think that with this fixed central structure we have to favour White here, primarily due to his space advantage and the options to play on both sides of the board. Let's see how the play develops.

17...Nc5

Black can also place his knight on c5 in a slightly different version: 17...h6 18.Be3 Nc5 and now: A) 19.Qd2 h5 and now: A1) You may wonder what happens if White changes the pawn structure and doubles Black's pawns with 20.Bxc5 dxc5. We have some top-level games here. Yes, White did double Black's pawns, but he has also parted with his bishop pair. White has somewhat better chances. I like the following idea Anish Giri demonstrated in a blitz game: 21.Qe3 Rb8 (White's area of action will be the queenside) 22.Nf1 Bc8 23.N1d2 Bd7 24.axb5 axb5 25.Ra6. Black needs to worry about a timely b3-pawn push by White: 25...Rb6 26.Ra7 Qb8 27.Rea1 Qd6. White is doing great, Anish comes up with a nice idea: 28.Bd1! (28.b3 also leads to White's advantage as the queenside is favourably opened for him after 28...cxb3

29.Bxb3 with 30.c4 to follow and if 30...b4, 31.Ba4 with a favourable bishops trade)

28...Bg7 29.Be2! Reb8 30.Bxc4! (game over!) 30...bxc4 31.Nxc4 Qe7 32.Nxb6

Rxb6 33.b4 Bf8 34.R7a5 Bb5 35.bxc5 Qxc5 36.Qxc5 Bxc5 37.c4 Nxe4 38.Rxb5 and White won easily in Giri-Karjakin, Flor & Fjaere 2014; A2) 20.Bg5. Now where to place black bishop is not an easy choice: 20...Bg7 (20...Be7 is the alternative) 21.Rf1! (White is getting ready to push the f-pawn)

21...Qc7 22.Bh6. Fabiano Caruana faces an unpleasant dilemma: to trade or not to

trade? Both decision do not really look good for Black: 22...Bh8. White now had the right idea, but did not get it done in a precise way:

23.Ng5 (strongest was 23.Nh4!, for example 23...bxa4 24.f4! exf4 25.Rxf4 and

White has a winning attack. In Stockfish language, this is close to plus two) and now: A21) Black's best chance to get counterplay was by timely disturbing White's Ng3 with 23...h4! when after 24.Ne2 bxa4 25.f4 analysis diagram Black does not react in the centre but plays 25...Rab8!. White now struggles to get his attack going: 26.f5 Bc8! 27.Rab1 and here it is clever to trade a pair of rooks (fewer potential attackers, less headache!) 27...a3! 28.bxa3 Rxb1 29.Bxb1. analysis diagram Black's king is safe here, so now he can force the strategically good trade 29...Bg7! with a good game; A22) 23...Nh7 24.Nxh7 (the immediate 24.f4 was strong too) 24...Kxh7 25.Be3 Qe7

26.f4! (it is important to have both rooks on the board as f-file pressure is essential

for a successful attack here) 26...exf4 27.Bxf4 (27.Rxf4 was perhaps even stronger:

27...Be5 28.Raf1!.

analysis diagram A standard situation - Black's king is weak, the Bb7 is out of play, the Nc5 is standing there nicely and doing more or less nothing: 28...Bxf4 29.Rxf4 Nd7

30.Nxh5! and White wins after 30...gxh5 31.Qd1 or 30...Rh8 31.Qf2) 27...Kg8. Now

White doubles on the f-file, so having both rooks on the board is important here:

28.Rf3 Bg7 29.Raf1 Nd7.

Now White traded off the defender with 30.Bh6! Bxh6 31.Qxh6 Qf8 32.Qd2 (32.Nf5 was more efficient) 32...Ne5 33.Rf6 and we have a typical situation. Black has a nice knight on e5, while White has everything else. The knight on the e5-outpost is not enough to hold Black's position. White went on to win in Zherebukh-Caruana, Saint Louis 2017. You may wonder what Fabiano did wrong to get into such trouble? Actually, not much. The position is simply easier to play for White and it is easy for Black to get into terrible trouble. The game we are following was a classical time limit game in the United States Championships. B) White can also play slightly differently, though following a similar plan, with

19.Kh1!? (White plans to push f4 later on and places his king on a better square)

19...Rb8 20.Qd2 h5 21.axb5 axb5

22.Ng5! White is now ready for the f-pawn push: 22...Bg7 23.f4! exf4 24.Bxf4. As

already seen, most of the time Black's counterplay idea in these positions is to timely disturb White's Ng3 and this is what Short, playing Black, does now: 24...h4 25.Nf1 Nh5 26.Be3 Bf6. It looks as if Black has sufficient tactical resources as White's king on h1 can now also come under check. How should White continue? 27.Nh2! Bc8 (the pawn grab

27...Ng3+ is not a good idea here as White develops a strong attack after 28.Kg1

Ncxe4 29.Nxe4 Nxe4 30.Bxe4 Rxe4 31.Ng4: analysis diagram

31...Bg7 32.Ba7! Rxe1+ 33.Rxe1 Ra8 34.Bd4 and Black's king has no defenders, his

Bb7, Ra8 are out of play - actually a typical situation in this line; White has a winning attack) 28.Nhf3 (White has the right idea, but he could have executed it in a better way. Pro-actively removing the king from check first with 28.Kg1! was strong here. You may wonder, after Black's knight jump to g3, what difference does it make? 28...Ng3. analysis diagram Well, it does as White now has a nice tactic: 29.Nxf7! Kxf7 30.Bxc5 dxc5 31.Nf3 and since the e-pawn push is coming, Black will have to give some material back, White has a clear advantage) 28...Ng3+ 29.Kh2 Ncxe4 30.Nxe4 Nxe4 31.Bxe4 Rxe4

32.Ba7! (White did not want to get greedy with 32.Bb6 Qxb6 33.Rxe4 Bf5 when

Black would have some compensation for the exchange) 32...Rxe1 33.Rxe1 Ra8

34.Bd4. White has a promising attack. Black's king is weak, his Ra8 is out of play,

his Bc8 is not doing much and his pawn on h4 is likely to fall... still, Black managed to survive to a draw in Stellwagen-Short, Hoogeveen 2004.

18.Nh2

White can also play a bit differently. Executing a simlar plan starting with 18.Qd2 also looks promising. The Nf3 will move and the f-pawn push will come. A few top games went 18...Be7 19.Bh6 Nfd7. Black's queenside counterplay is rather slow and White can quickly develop a promising attack: A) 20.Nh2 and now: bxa4 A1) In case of 20...Nxa4, the following variation illustrates how easily things can go wrong for Black: 21.Ng4!? (White can of course opt for 21.Bxa4 bxa4 22.Rxa4 a5

23.Be3 with an advantage - here he can combine queenside play with the f-pawn

push) 21...Nxb2. Black is now two pawns up, and White starts action: 22.f4 Bh4 (White has a promising attack, minimally worth the sacrificed material, after

22...exf4 23.Qxf4) 23.Bg5! Bxg5 24.fxg5 Rf8 25.Rf1. Now Black has to react:

25...f6 26.gxf6 Nxf6 27.Nh6+ Kh8 (again, the f-file is important; having both rooks

on the board is essential for White's attack) 28.Rf3 Qe7 29.Raf1. Black cannot hold his kingside, this position is plus three according to Stockfish! It's very easy for Black to get into trouble in these positions!; A2) If 20...bxa4, White goes for the attack with 21.Ng4 (21.Bxa4 also leads to White's advantage) 21...Nb3 22.Bxb3 axb3

23.f4! Black's Bb7 is a 'dead piece'. 23...Nf6. Here, strongest for White was 24.Rf1

with an attack that should have resulted in a full point. The game went 24.Ne3 exf4

25.Bxf4 and White had an advantage but Black survived to a draw in Borisek-Amin,

Batumi 2018. B) Starting off with 20.Rf1 with Nh2 and f4 to follow is fine for White too; C) An example of 'non principled play' by White was seen some years ago at the Qatar masters (with a classical time limit): 20.a5 Bc8!. Now White placed both of his rooks on passive positions because was overly concerned about losing his a-pawn:

21.Ra3? Nb7 22.Rea1 Ndc5. Now White wants to attack, but without rooks it does

not work the same way: 23.Nh2 Bd7 24.Be3 Bh4. Despite placing both his rooks in passive positions, White's worries about the a5-pawn are not over as Black can play ...Na4 and still collect that pawn. Black easily won in Mista-Giri, Doha 2014;

18...h6 19.Be3 h5 20.Qf3 Nh7 21.Qe2 Qc7

Retreating the knight with 21...Nf6 is not an easy move to make but it would have stopped the development in the game.

22.Ngf1!

A strong move! The knight goes to d2 when: a) after the f4 push, the move ...h4 can never disturb White; and b) Black also needs to worry about a timely b4 or b3 pawn push, opening up the queenside.

22...Rab8 23.Nd2 Bc8

23...Nf6 24.Rf1 Bg7 is aimed against the immediate f-pawn push, but White gets the

upper hand with 25.Nhf3 (White wants to play 26.Ng5 followed by f4) 25...Nh7 and now White can switch to queenside action: 26.Ra3 Bc8 27.axb5 axb5 analysis diagram

28.b4! cxb3 29.Nxb3 and Black is in trouble on the queenside: 29...Na4 30.c4 with a

strong initiative.

24.axb5 axb5

MVL correctly feels the time is right!

25.f4! exf4 26.Bxf4 Nf6 27.Qf1!

Well played! 27.Qf2 may look more logical, but after 27...b4! Black's c4-pawn is not hanging.

27...Nfd7

Now after 27...b4 28.Nhf3 (28.Qxc4?! is premature and throws away the advantage after 28...Ba6 29.Rxa6 Nxa6 30.Qxa6 bxc3 31.bxc3 Nxd5) 28...bxc3 29.bxc3 Black's c4-pawn is weak and Black does not have a good way to solve this problem:

29...Rb2 30.Nd4 and the attempt to get counterplay with an exchange sacrifice does

not really work due to 30...Rxc2 31.Nxc2 Ncxe4 (31...Nfxe4? loses to 32.Qxc4)

32.Be3. White stands clearly better here.

28.Nhf3 Bg7

29.Qf2!

White's queen goes to a better square, preparing a doubling on the f-file double. Trading a pair of rooks is in general a good idea for Black (in similar positions) and this is what Bassem now does:

29...Rb6 30.Be3!

Moving the bishop from f4 to d4 is a standard plan for White in such positions!

30...Ra6 31.Rxa6 Bxa6 32.Bd4 Bf8

Black wants to keep the defender and retreats his bishop.

32...Ne5 does not solve Black's problems as White is clearly better after 33.Nxe5!

Bxe5 34.Nf3 and Black does not have a good way to keep his stuff together:

34...Bxd4 35.cxd4 Nd3 36.Bxd3 cxd3 37.Qd2.

33.Rf1 Bh6

34.g4!

A swift execution - damaging the opponent's king defences! The silicon brain points out that 34.Ng5 f6 35.e5! dxe5 36.Bxg6 works as well.

34...hxg4 35.Qh4 gxf3 36.Qxh6

A standard situation: Black's king is weak, his Ba6 is out of play and the Nc5 is standing nicely doing nothing.

36...Ne5 37.Nxf3 Ncd7 38.Ng5 Nf8

The execution is easy tactics, netting White a queen:

39.Nxf7! Qxf7 40.Rxf7 Kxf7

Black cannot build a fortress here.

41.Bd1! Re7

If 41...Bc8, 42.h4 followed by 43.h5 decides.

42.Bg4 1-0

A typical Ruy Lopez piece sacrifice in the centre This position, coming from a recent game, shows a typical piece sacrifice idea available to Black in many closed Ruy Lopez positions. I have tried similar sacrifices as Black and can advise you to explore these ideas. Black sacrifices a piece (usually a knight) to eliminate White's pawn centre. Black gets active play and his mobile pawn centre fully compensates for the sacrificed piece. Game 46 Arthur Pijpers 2465 Max Warmerdam 2602 Utrecht ch-NED 2023 I definitely wanted to include the type of sacrifice described above in this book, but I was looking for a fresh example. Help came from Max Warmerdam, who messaged me while I was writing: 'Hey Ivan, remember the sacrifice idea you were showing us at the Papendal (Dutch Olympic Centre) training last November? I played the same idea in my game yesterday! Have a look!'. Well, I did have a look and indeed - thank you Max, I like the game!

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 O-O 9.h3

Bb7 10.d4 Re8 11.a3 Less played than 11.Nbd2, but definitely also seen at top level.

11...h6

12.Ba2

There is a positional idea behind this bishop retreat. After pushing 13.d5, White wants to be able to build a pawn chain by playing b3 followed by c4.

12...Bf8

And now indeed White goes on to execute his strategic idea:

13.d5

Where to go with the knight?

13...Ne7

I think this is the best option. A) After 13...Nb8, Shirov, playing White, decided to keep the centre dynamic with

14.c4 (White should have some advantage by building the pawn chain with 14.b3 c6

15.c4) 14...c6. Shirov insists on keeping the centre dynamic: 15.Nc3 bxc4 16.dxc6

Bxc6 (16...Nxc6 was the alternative so as after 17.Bxc4 playing the dynamic

17...Nd4!.

analysis diagram White has some advantage though after 18.Nxd4 exd4 19.Qxd4 d5 20.Bf1 dxe4

21.Be3) 17.Bxc4 Qc7 (17...Nbd7 was better). Shirov does not need a further

invitation and goes for a direct attack! 18.Nh4! Bd7 and now comes a piece sac, the point of the previous move: 19.Nd5! Qxc4 20.Nxf6+ gxf6 21.Qh5. A1) If 21...Kh7, White wins by force with a beautiful variation: 22.b3! (the less forcing 22.Bd2 should bring White success as well) 22...Qxb3 23.Bxh6! Bxh6 analysis diagram

24.Reb1! (Black's queen has to defend the f7-pawn but cannot retreat to e6 due to

the Nf5 jump) 24...Qc4 25.Rb4! Qc3 26.Qxf7+ Bg7. What now? White is two pieces down while the Ra1 hangs with check. 27.Nf5! Qxa1+ 28.Kh2 Bxf5 29.exf5 and White wins, e.g. 29...e4 30.Qg6+ Kg8 31.Qxe8+ etc.; A2) Black played 21...f5 and now the great attacker Shirov missed the strongest continuation: 22.exf5! (the game itself went 22.Bxh6 Bxh6 23.Qxh6 f4 and White emerged victorious in Shirov-Erdös, Terme Catez Ech-tt 2021). The problem is that after 22...Be7 White now needs a strong follow-up: 23.Ng6!. Now Black has to give his extra piece back: 23...Nc6 24.Bxh6 Bxf5 25.Qxf5 Qe6 26.Qxe6 fxe6 27.Nxe7+ Rxe7 28.Rac1 and White is a sound pawn up in a technically won endgame. B) 13...Na7 leads to an easy and typical positional advantage for White after 14.b3 c5 15.c4. White gets a typical safe space advantage: 15...a5 16.a4 b4 17.Nbd2 Nc8 18.Bb1 Ne7 19.Nf1 Ng6 20.Ra2 and Black has no counterplay. He had to struggle for a draw in Ter Sahakyan-Azarov, Sharjah 2022.

14.b3

White sticks to his strategic idea of building a central pawn chain. Playing like Shirov in the comment above does not produce same result as Black's knight is now well placed on e7: 14.c4 c6 15.Nc3 bxc4 16.dxc6 Bxc6 17.Bxc4 Qc7 with equality, e.g. 18.Qb3 Ng6.

14...c6

If 14...c5, White gets an easy advantage with 15.c4! bxc4 16.bxc4 Ng6

17.Bb3! Bc8 18.Ba4 Bd7 19.Nc3. White has a favourable version of the Czech

Benoni, but it was a rapid game and Black later turned things around and even won in Firouzja-Le Quang Liem, Chessable Masters rapid 2021.

15.c4 cxd5 16.cxd5

A critical position! White wants to stabilize the queenside, in the ideal world by pushing 17.b4, and will be having a long-term positional advantage. Max comes up with a very interesting idea, first sacrificing a pawn to sentence White's Ba2 to death, and then sacrificing a piece to remove White's pawn centre, getting dynamic pawns of his own. Black will get only a pawn for his the piece, but White's pieces will coordinate poorly.

[diagram]
16...a5 was tried before. White continues 17.Nc3 b4 18.Nb5 Qb8 19.a4. White's B

will not stay on a2 forever, it will quickly be improved by Ba2-b1-d3, and White has the advantage here. The immediate sacrifice 16...Nxe4? does not work as the Ba2 is not 'killed' and White has a clear advantage after 17.Rxe4 Nxd5 18.b4! - the most human way.

17.axb4

The silicon brain understands the problem of the passive Ba2 and intially suggests

17.Bd2. Black can now sacrifice the piece but he also has another interesting option

in 17...a5!? (White is hoping for something like 17...bxa3? 18.Nxa3 when his pieces start coordinating excellently; the piece sac 17...Nxe4 18.Rxe4 Nxd5 19.axb4 transposes into the comment to 19.Bd2) 18.axb4 axb4 19.Bxb4 analysis diagram White has grabbed a pawn but has terrible coordination - the Ba2 is dead while the Bb4 is also clumsy. Black should play aggressively: 19...g5!. Now, before developing his knight, White first has to solve the Bb4 problem: 20.Bd2 (20.Nc3?? loses to the simple 20...Qb6 while if 20.Nbd2? the bishop on b4 is also trapped by

20...Nfxd5 21.exd5 Nxd5μ) 20...g4! 21.hxg4 Nxg4 22.Nc3. White's Ba2 is terribly

placed and Black has good compensation after 22...Qb6 23.Be3 Qb4. Now comes the point behind Black's previous move:

17...Nxe4! 18.Rxe4 Nxd5

An interesting position! For the piece, Black got only one pawn, but he has full compensation! Excellent judgement! White's pieces are terribly discoordinated while Black has perfect coordination, combining his active pieces with mobile central pawns. In practice, this position is perhaps easier to play with Black.

19.b5!?

White wants to activate his Ba2 as soon as possible. Another logical move was

19.Bb2, developing the bishop and covering c3 - White wants to play Nbd2. Black,

as usual in such situations, pushes his pawns: 19...f5! 20.Re1 (if 20.Rc4, 20...e4

21.Nd4 e3! and now the only move that keeps White in the game is 22.Nd2!) 20...e4

(20...Nf4 is also possible) 21.Nd4 Qg5. analysis diagram White's king has hardly any defenders, while the Ba2, Bb2 and Nb1 are all doing nothing - an excellent example of White's pieces being only 'technically' on the board while Black's pieces are actually playing. White has to be accurate to stay in the game: 22.h4! (22.Ne2 Nxb4 looks bad for White) 22...Qxh4 23.Nxf5 Qg5

24.Ne3 Nf4. Now finally White develops his Nb1: 25.Nc3 (interestingly, even after

the queen trade 25.Qg4 Qxg4 26.Nxg4 Black still has full compensation as White cannot develop, e.g. 26...Nd3 27.Re2 Rec8 28.Na3 d5) 25...d5. Here, best for White is probably 26.Ne2 when Black has a pleasant choice between going for a line ending in perpetual check or just playing for the attack: 26...Nh3+ (the attacking option was 26...Nd3!? 27.Bd4 Bd6) 27.Kf1 Nxf2 28.Kxf2 Bd6. analysis diagram Unfortunately for Black, he is slowly running out of pieces and a draw will probably be the result after 29.Nd4! Rf8+ 30.Kg1 Qh4 31.Ndf5! Rxf5 32.Nxf5 Qh2+ 33.Kf1 Qf4+ 34.Kg1 Qh2+ 35.Kf1 Qf4+ 36.Kg1 analysis diagram with a draw. Playing for a win is probably asking for too much: 36...Rf8?! 37.Ne7+! Bxe7 (37...Kh7? is not good due to 38.Qh5) 38.Rf1 Qe3+ 39.Kh1. White is not exactly getting mated and his 'big pawn on a2' will become a bishop again one day. If White plays 19.Bd2, we have an unclear game after 19...Qf6! (19...f5?! is not precise because the bishop on d2 covers the e3-square and White is better after

20.Rc4 e4 21.Nd4) 20.Na3 Nf4 21.Rxf4 exf4.

analysis diagram

22.Bb1!. Improving the bishop. Black should now damage White's structure:

22...Bxf3! 23.gxf3 Re5 or 23...d5 and we have an unclear, materially imbalanced

game.

19...axb5

The fancy 19...Nf4 20.Ra4 Nxg2 21.Kxg2 e4 does not work as Black has no good follow-up after 22.Nbd2!.

20.b4

The Ba2 is finally active, but there is still the a-file pin!

20...Ra4!

Black wants to play ...Qa8.

21.Bxd5

White decides to solve the a-file pin tactically. In case of 21.Bd2, the pin is unpleasant for White; for example, 21...Qa8 22.Qb3 Qa6 23.Nc3 Ra3 24.Qb2 Ra8 and after 25.Re2 Nxc3 26.Bxc3 Be7 it is not clear how White is going to unpin.

21...Bxd5

Black wants to keep his strong bishop. The alternative was 21...Rxa1 when we get a different material imbalance that may result in equality: 22.Bxb7 Rxb1 (Black has a viable alternative in 22...Qc7 23.Bb2 Qxb7 and after 24.Re3 Ra4 25.Rb3 we have an unclear game. Black has potentially great central pawns, but it's not easy to push them) 23.Qc2 Ra1 24.Qb2. analysis diagram Of course, Black is not going to allow White to have a great blockading bishop on d5: 24...d5! 25.Rxe5 (25.Qxa1? is wrong as Black forces a better ending with

25...dxe4 26.Bxe4 Qd1+ 27.Kh2 Rc8! 28.Bb2 Qxa1 29.Bxa1 f6. White is in deep

trouble here and can lose in a few moves, e.g. 30.Bd3 Bd6 31.g3 and now White loses a piece after 31...Ra8). Now the storm clears and it all ends peacefully:

25...Rxc1+! 26.Qxc1 Rxe5 27.Nxe5 Qb8 28.Qc6 Qxe5 29.Qxb5 Qe1+ 30.Qf1 with a

draw.

22.Rxa4 Bxe4 23.Ra1 d5

The position looks unclear to me. Yes, at the moment Black only has two pawns for the piece, but Black's central pawns are strong, and the bishop pair is good in this type of position... my Stockfish, however, gives a slight plus to White.

24.Nfd2

The alternative was 24.Nbd2 Bg6 25.Bb2 f6 when the position looks unclear to me, my silicon advisor slightly preferring White.

24...Bg6

24...Bf5! is apparently more precise as after 25.Nc3 Qd7 26.Qb3 the bishop can

change diagonals with 26...Be6.

25.Ra5?

The start of a bad plan. White is too focused on collecting material - he should have focused on his piece development and coordination.

25.Nc3! was needed, and after 25...Bxb4 26.Qb3 Bxc3 27.Qxc3 Qb6 28.Qb3 d4

29.Nf1 the position looks okay for Black to me, though my Stockfish gives White

some plus.

25...d4 26.Rxb5 e4

Black has only one pawn for the piece, and still White needs to find only moves to stay in the game! White probably underestimated his bad piece coordination and the power of Black's pawns:

27.Qb3?

This is a mistake that should have lost the game.

27.Na3 is not good due to 27...e3.

Best was 27.Nc4! but the problem is that after 27...e3! 28.fxe3 Bxb1 analysis diagram Black has his piece back and White looks to be in bad shape. The only way to stay in the game is 29.Re5! (29.exd4 loses nicely to 29...Bd3! and after 30.Qxd3 Re1+ Black either gets mated or loses decisive material: 31.Kf2 Rxc1 or 31.Kh2 Qc7+

32.Ne5 Qxc1) 29...dxe3 30.Qxd8 Rxd8 31.Nxe3 Bxb4 32.Rb5.

analysis diagram Unfortunately for White, he does not win a piece: 32...Rc8! 33.Rxb4 Rxc1+ 34.Kf2 and Black is a pawn up, although White might draw.

[diagram]
All White's pieces are uncoordinated and on the wrong side of the board; the white king fights alone. Black has a decisive attack.

28.Nf3 Qc7

White now has to make a sad move, removing another piece from the defence of his king.

29.Ba3 Bc2 30.Qb2

Black has a winning attack, but precision is still needed. Now comes the first missed win.

30...Bd3

30...exf2+ 31.Kxf2 Bd1! was winning on the spot as White cannot bring his pieces to

the defence of his king 32.Qxd4 (giving back a piece with 32.Re5 only delays resignation as after 32...Rxe5 33.Nxe5 Qxe5 Black still has a mating attack)

32...Re2+ 33.Kf1 Qg3 and White gets mated: 34.Qg1 Rc2.

31.Ra5 Qf4?

The second win was more difficult than the first one: 31...exf2+ 32.Kxf2 (32.Qxf2 loses to the simple 32...Bxb1 and Black has his piece back while his mating attack continues as White's Ba3 and Ra5 are still terribly placed). analysis diagram Black has a winning position, but in time pressure (which is likely to be the case) it's not easy to find 32...Re3! with the terrible threat of 33... Rxf3! which, after a series of checks, will mate the white king. It's also not easy to understand that after

32...Re2+ 33.Qxe2 Bxe2 34.Kxe2 Qc4+ 35.Kf2 White's pieces are so poorly

coordinated that he will start losing material after 35...Bd6 36.Nbd2 Qc3.

32.fxe3 Qxe3+ 33.Kh1

33...Qe1+!

Not the best move, but it deserves an exclamation mark for its artistic beauty! Objectively stronger was 33...Bd6 (34...Qe1+ is a threat) 34.Qc1 Bf4!. White has to give his piece back with 35.Qxe3 dxe3 36.Nc3 e2 37.Ne1 Bg3 38.Nxe2 Bxe1. Black is clearly better; White's struggle continues.

34.Nxe1 Rxe1+ 35.Kh2 Bd6+ 36.g3 Be4

This is the position Max had in mind - White is a full queen up but the position is objectively equal! Very probably, both players were under terrible time pressure now. White makes it easy for Black:

37.Qg2?

This prevents mate but gives Black a risk-free advantage. The only (and much better) alternative was 37.Qc1! when Black's next two moves are forced: 37...Re2+ 38.Kg1 Bxg3. analysis diagram An amazing position! Yes, Black does threaten many checks but there is no immediate mate and White is still a full queen up! White's pieces are so poorly coordinated that the position is dynamically balanced: A) 39.Ra8+ leads to a forced draw after 39...Kh7 40.Re8 Rg2+ 41.Kf1 Rf2+

42.Kg1=;

B) 39.Nd2 leads to a forced draw: 39...Rg2+ 40.Kf1 Rf2+ 41.Ke1 Rh2+ 42.Kd1 Rh1+ 43.Ke2 Rh2+=; C) 39.Qc8+ Kh7 40.Rf5!. analysis diagram White is bringing in defenders. There is no mate or perpetual but now the d-pawn is Black's trump! 40...d3! (40...Rh2? blunders into 41.Rf3!; Black does have a threat and it is mate in two: 41...Bh2+ followed by 42...Bg2#) 41.Rf3! Re1+! 42.Kg2 Rxb1. analysis diagram Again, an amazing position! Black does not have an immediate deadly threat and for the queen has only a bishop - and a strong passed pawn! C1) After 43.Kxg3 White is again a full queen up, but... 43...d2! and now the only move is 44.Qc4! f5! (or 44...Rg1+ 45.Kf4 d1Q 46.Qxe4+ g6 when the engine gives zeroes... human play is obviously a different story) 45.Rf1 Re1 46.Qd4! and now we get a different kind of material imbalance after 46...Rxf1! 47.Qxd2 Rf3+ 48.Kh2 Rxa3 and the evaluation is zeroes, but probably it's easier to play for Black; C2) If 43.Bc1, 43...Be1! keeps the pins, threats, and the balance; C3) 43.Qc4 f5! 44.Qa2 (44.Kxg3 transposes to the dynamically balanced line we had in the comment above: 44...d2 45.Rf1 Re1 46.Qd4 Rxf1 47.Qxd2 Rf3+ 48.Kh2 Rxa3) and again we transpose to the positions from the comments above after 44...d2

45.Qxd2 Rb3 46.Kxg3 Rxf3+ 47.Kh2 Rxa3.

37...Bxg2 38.Kxg2 Rxb1

Black now has a risk-free endgame advantage.

39.Rd5 Bc7

Probably a better decision was to go for a rook ending with 39...Bxg3 40.Kxg3 Rb3+.

40.b5 Rb3 41.Bd6 Bb6

White can save the game but needs to be precise:

42.Be5?

A losing blunder. 42.h4!, preventing Black from pushing ...g5 and thus securing the bishop on f4, saved the game, e.g. 42...f6 43.h5.

[diagram]
White's bishop is running out of a good squares.

43.Bf4 g5! 44.Bb8

Or 44.Bc1 Rc3.

44...d3

Black's d-pawn queens.

44...Kf7 also wins.

45.g4 Ba5 46.Kf3 d2+ 47.Ke2 Rb1 0-1

Zaitsev dynamics I have decided to conclude this book with a famous game. The diagrammed position shows a principled battle between the two great Ks. Anatoly Karpov loved this structure as Black since it is fundamentally sound while offering Black active play. There is some resemblance with the Benoni, but the pieces are placed differently. Black wants to plant one of his knights on d3, gaining the bishop pair, and often doesn't mind sacrificing a pawn in the process. Black also has the idea of pushing ...f5, hitting White's centre. Black's potential problem? His weak king. Anatoly Karpov was famous for defending his king with a minimum of resources and has done so throughout his matches with Kasparov. I advise the reader to go through their match games while paying attention to this strategy of 'minimum resources' - it will be both interesting and rewarding! Game 47 Garry Kasparov 2740 Anatoly Karpov 2705 London/Leningrad Wch m 1986 In their heritage World Championship matches, the two great Ks battled out a principled 'Zaitsev Variation' fight, and this game is the one I like the most. You may wonder why I included this 'over-analysed' game in my selection... Well, I would like to offer some personal insights and hope they will be beneficial to the reader.

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 O-O 9.h3

Bb7 10.d4 Re8 11.Nbd2 Bf8 12.a4 h6 The main line Zaitsev - the battleground of the two great Ks!

13.Bc2 exd4 14.cxd4 Nb4 15.Bb1 c5 16.d5 Nd7 17.Ra3

Over the years, Anatoly Karpov, not only against Kasparov but also in many of his other games, would be choosing here between two principled but strategically rather different options. I like Black's choice in this game, and I think it is enough for equality.

[diagram]
I like Black's ideas here. Black wants to jump ...Nc5 followed by ...Nd3, forcing White to part with his bishop pair. Without his light-squared bishop, White will find it more difficult to build up an attack. Bear in mind, however, that in this game, and often in this line, Black is going to be defending with a minimum of resources! The other principled choice is 17...f5. Black weakens his kingside but wants to eliminate White's pawn centre. The reason why we no longer see this variation at top-level events is the silicon brain's suggestion 18.g4! (Kasparov's choices were

18.Rae3 or 18.exf5). In the few top-level games played with this move, White has

had excellent results. The idea is that 18...fxg4 (to readers willing to invest more time in analysing this position, I would say that in my opinion the positions after

18...f4! are more complicated than the initial computer evaluations tell us) is

answered with 19.Nh2! and White swiftly gets a strong attack. White is now on an important crossroads; he has to chose between three main continuations. I will try to provide some middlegame insight combined with opening information. In this game, Garry attacks Black's pawn on b5 while keeping the option of swinging his Ra3 to the kingside, which is a typical attacking idea in this line.

18.Nd4

A) The alternative, also seen in the K-K matches, is 18.axb5 axb5 19.Nd4. Now Black should eliminate White's attacking rook: 19...Rxa3! (ignoring the danger by playing 19...Qb6 20.Nf5 Ne5 is rather risky as after 21.Rg3! White develops a strong attack, a great example being the game Anand-Adams, San Luis Wch 2005)

20.bxa3 and now is the time for Black to kill White's light-squared bishop: 20...Nd3!

21.Bxd3 cxd3 and the position is about equal. 22.Bb2. Here, modern theory prefers

22...Nc5! (the old classic was 22...Qa5 23.Nf5 Ne5 with complicated play, White

emerging victorious in Kasparov-Karpov, London/Leningrad 1986). In one relatively recent top-level test, White hoped for a kingside attack but it did not materialize and White got in trouble: 23.Re3. The defences of Black's king are limited, but in this game White's attack does not get off the ground: 23...Qa5. White now goes for a sophisticated 'prophylactic attacking move': 24.Kh2 (more straightforward alternatives are 24.Nf5 or 24.Rg3) 24...b4 25.N4b3 Qa4 26.axb4?! (the start of White's problems; he had to opt for 26.Rg3! Nxe4 27.Nxe4 Rxe4

28.Qf3) 26...Qxb4 27.Nxc5 dxc5 28.Qc1 c4 and Black's pawns are strong. Black

was better and went on to win in Huschenbeth-Bu Xiangzhi, Douglas 2019. B) Modern theory follows the silicon brain's suggestions, and top-level games currently feature 18.Ree3!?. The rook runs away from ...Nd3 tempi and is ready to switch to the attacking square g3. We have quite a number of recent top-level games here. The position is very sharp, and probably dynamically balanced. I advise readers interested in theoretical verdicts to investigate in the direction of 18...Nc5! 19.b3 and now: B1) 19...Rc8 leads to White's advantage after 20.axb5 axb5 21.bxc4! (now the Ra3 is fully in play) 21...bxc4 22.Bb2 Nbd3. White now went for a pawn grab with

23.Nxc4 (also promising is 23.Bd4 - White wants to grab the pawn on c4 for free, so

Black has to react: 23...f5 24.exf5 Bxd5 25.f6! and Black is reminded of his potentially weak king) 23...Nxb2 24.Nxb2 g6 25.Na4 Nd7 26.Bd3 and White is a sound pawn up but Black managed to hold a draw in Ivic-Fedoseev, Krasnaya Polyana 2021; B2) Black should sacrifice a pawn with 19...c3! 20.Rxc3, and as a result of the pawn sac, the Ra3 is out of play so Black can open up the position further with 20...f5! with complicated play; Black won in Aravindh-Visakh, Moscow 2020.

18...Qf6 19.N2f3

Karpov now continues his plan to plant the knight on d3:

19...Nc5 20.axb5

A) White has an interesting alternative in 20.Ree3!? with ideas similar to 18.Ree3. We have here an interesting rapid game Anand-Kasimdzhanov played in the final match of a Corsica K.O. event: 20...Nbd3. A1) Here, White had an interesting option in 21.Bxd3 and if 21...b4 (Black has alternatives in 21...cxd3 or 21...Nxd3), White sacrifices an exchange with 22.Bc2! bxa3 23.bxa3. Now Black has to stop Bb2 with 23...c3 and White has sufficient compensation, we have an unclear game after 24.a5 or 24.Ne2; A2) In the game, White went for a pawn grab: 21.axb5 axb5 22.Nxb5 Rxa3 23.Nxa3 Rxe4 24.Nxc4. analysis diagram Rustam now went for an interesting tactical idea, taking a risk: 24...Nxf2!? (24...Rxc4 25.Bxd3 Nxd3 26.Rxd3 Qf5) and it paid off as Vishy now blundered:

25.Qe2? (White had to continue with 25.Kxf2 Rxc4 26.b3! when the black rook does

not have any good squares so an exchange sac is needed: 26...Rxc1! 27.Qxc1 Bxd5 and Black has decent compensation, perhaps White has some plus). Now the tactics are working for Black: 25...Nxh3+! 26.gxh3 Qg6+ 27.Kf2 Rxe3! 28.Bxe3 Qxb1 and Black was material up and went on to win in Anand-Kasimdzhanov, Bastia rapid 2006; B) 20.b3 Nbd3 21.Bxd3 Nxd3 leads to satisfactory play for Black. The position is dynamic while the Ra3 still needs yet to be brought into play.

20...axb5 21.Nxb5 Rxa3 22.Nxa3 Ba6

We have a typical situation for this line. White is a pawn up, Black has the bishop pair and will have a strong knight on d3. The evaluation? A dynamic balance. My personal preference? Black. Kasparov improves his rook and moves away from ...Nd3 tempi:

23.Re3

Karpov says: 'The b2-pawn will be mine.' Please note that Black is not concerned about his king safety and will use a minimum of forces to defend his monarch!

23...Rb8

The alternative was 23...Nbd3!?. White understands that his chances are connected to a kingside attack:

24.e5! dxe5 25.Nxe5 Nbd3

A) 25...Ncd3 was the alternative, covering c2; B) 25...Nxd5!? was an interesting tactical option. B1) 26.Qxd5 leads to a forced draw: 26...Rd8 27.Qf3 Qxf3 28.Nxf3 Nb3!. Black gets his piece back and it ends peacefully: 29.Ba2 (hanging on to the piece with

29.Re1 Bb4 30.Rf1? is not a good idea as Black wins after 30...c3 31.bxc3 Bxa3

32.Bxa3 Bxf1) 29...Nxc1 30.Bxc4 Bxa3 31.Bxa6 Bxb2 with a draw;

B2) I guess Karpov did not like 26.Ng4 when the engine shows zeroes, but to a human the position looks dangerous for Black as the defending forces around his king are limited: 26...Qd6! 27.Rg3 Kh8 28.Qc2 Nd3! 29.Nxc4 Bxc4 30.Qxc4 Nxc1

31.Qxc1. Here, Black is active enough to compensate for the pawn deficit: 31...Nf4

32.Re3 Qd4 with a probable draw.

26.Ng4

One of many critical moments in this game! 26.Qc2! was a better move.

26...Qb6!?

Totally unconcerned about his king safety, Karpov moves another piece away from his monarch. He had a strong resource in 26...Qf5! when Black is better! White has a lot of tactics here but none seems to work, e.g. 27.Rf3 (or 27.Rg3 Kh8) 27...Qxd5. analysis diagram The pawn on b2 will fall, and White does not seem able to create enough on the kingside - after all, his Na3 is out of play while his Bb1 is blocked by Black's Nd3: A) 28.Nf6+? does not work due to 28...gxf6 29.Rg3+ Bg7 30.Bxh6 Ne6 and Black wins with 31.Nxc4 (or 31.Rxg7+ Nxg7 32.Qg4 Kf8) 31...Ndf4!; B) 28.Bxh6 loses to 28...Ne4! and now the Bh6 hangs there is no good retreat:

29.Bc1? Bxa3;

C) After 28.Rg3, now the engine is not afraid to lose a pawn on h6: 28...Qe6! (or

28...Ne4! 29.Nxh6+ Kh8 and Black is better; the safe human move 28...Kh8 is fine

but perhaps it promises no more than a draw after 29.Ne3) 29.Nxh6+ Kh8 30.Re3 Qd7 and Black is better; his Nd3 is simply too strong.

27.Rg3 g6 28.Bxh6

Cold blooded Karpov goes for his pawn:

28...Qxb2 29.Qf3!

Again, a critical moment! White obviously has an attack but, also obviously, he will lose at least a piece - his Na3.

29...Nd7

Anatoly brings one defender closer to his king. The first question, however. is: Can Black grab 29...Qxa3 ? The answer is yes! 29...Qxa3! leads to a draw by perpetual check: 30.Nf6+ Kh8 31.Qh5 Rxb1+ 32.Bc1+ (32.Kh2 leads to a draw too:

32...Rh1+! 33.Kxh1 Nxf2+ 34.Kg1! Qxg3 and White has to force perpetual check

with 35.Bg7+ Kxg7 36.Ne8+) 32...Kg7. There is no mate, so White has to agree to a draw: 33.Ne8+ Kg8 34.Nf6+. Most probably Karpov calculated these lines but rejected them, considering that his position should offer him more. Garry now needs to show great attacking skills indeed!

30.Bxf8 Kxf8

White does not have any immediate threats while he is about to lose decisive material. Kasparov now plays the famous 'prophylactic attacking king move':

31.Kh2!!

Now, in crucial lines, the bishop on b1 will not hang with a check! The position is extremely complicated, and objectively dynamically balanced. It's one of those typical positions where the better calculator wins! Karpov goes for material gain, continuing his strategy of 'minimum defensive resources'. In a World Championship match with one of the greatest attackers in history, using such a strategy takes great confidence!

31...Rb3

A) A player concerned about his king safety may play 31...Qd4. Without the Bb1 and Na3 White can't expect his attack to succeed and a draw is a likely outcome, e.g.

32.d6 (or 32.Qe3 Qxe3 33.Nxe3 Nxf2 34.Bxg6 fxg6 35.Rf3+ Ke7 36.Rxf2 c3 when

the play is still sort of dynamic but a draw is likely) 32...N7e5 33.Nxe5 Nxe5

34.Qc3=;

B) The piece grab 31...Qxa3?? is a blunder: 32.Nh6 N7e5 (or 32...f5 33.Rxg6)

33.Qf6! and White wins as 34.Rxg6 is a terrible threat, e.g. 33...Qb2 34.Rxg6 Ke8

35.Rg3 etc.;

C) Trading an attacker, the Ng4, also makes sense: 31...N7e5 32.Nxe5 Qxe5 and we get a drawn ending after 33.Nxc4 Bxc4 34.Bxd3 Bxd3 35.Qxd3 Rd8.

32.Bxd3 cxd3

Bringing the rook closer with 32...Rxd3 leads to a better ending for White: 33.Qf4 Qxa3 34.Nh6 Qe7 35.Rxg6 Qe5 36.Qxe5 Nxe5 37.Rxa6 Rxd5 and White is a pawn up; the c-pawn is dangerous.

32...Rxa3!, taking the 'insignificant' Na3, is not an easy move to make; it leads to

equality after 33.Qf4 Rxd3 34.Qd6+ Kg7. analysis diagram Which piece to collect? 35.Qxd7! (after 35.Qxa6? Rxg3 36.fxg3 c3 the c-pawn is too strong) 35...Rxg3 36.fxg3 Bb7! (36...c3? is not good as Black's king is weak: 37.Qc7 c2 38.Ne5) with a drawn queen ending after 37.Ne3 Qd4 38.Qxb7 Qxe3=.

33.Qf4

33...Qxa3?

The losing mistake! Karpov probably missed White's 37th move.

33...d2! was needed. This is difficult to calculate and the game was also in the time

trouble phase. Black seems to be able to hold! 34.Nh6 Nf6! (34...Qf6? blunders the pride of Black's position after 35.Qxd2!) A) Now 35.Qd6+ looks very temping but does not win: 35...Ke8 36.Qxa6 d1Q!

37.Qc8+ Ke7 38.Qc5+ Kd7 39.Qc6+ Ke7. Now the only way to continue the fight is

[diagram]
analysis diagram And now the cold-blooded 40...Kf8! (Most players will play 40...Qxd6 but after

41.Qxd6+ Kxd6 42.Nc4+ Ke7 43.Nxb2 Rxb2 44.Rf3! Black still needs to work for

the draw) 41.Qc8+ Kg7. Black has a massive material advantage, but his king is defended with a 'minimum of resources': 42.Nf5+ Kh7 43.Qf8. analysis diagram Black stays alive with 43...Ng4+! 44.Rxg4 (44.hxg4 is not a winning attempt as Black has 44...gxf5 45.f3 Rxf3! and the outcome will be a draw after 46.Qxf7+ Qg7

47.Qxg7+ Kxg7 48.Rxf3 fxg4 49.Rg3 Qxd6 50.Nc2 etc.). Luckily for Black, he has

enough material to give! 44...Rxh3+! 45.Kxh3 Qh1+ 46.Kg3 Qe5+ 47.Rf4 g5

48.Qxf7+ Kh8 49.Qf8+ Kh7.

analysis diagram White still has a funny winning attempt here: 50.Qe7+!? Qxe7 51.dxe7 gxf4+

52.Kxf4

analysis diagram Only White can play for a win here, so Black should now secure a funny draw by stalemate with 52...Qxg2 53.e8Q Qg4+ 54.Ke5 Qe4+ or 54.Ke3 Qe2+; B) 35.Rxb3 Qxb3 36.Qxf6 Qxd5. The d-pawn is strong and Black's king is weak:

37.Nxf7 d1Q 38.Nd6+ Kg8 39.Qxg6+ Kf8 40.Qf6+ Kg8.

analysis diagram

41.Nf5! Qxf5 42.Qxf5 Qd6+ 43.Kg1 Qxa3 White will obviously try here for a bit but

the game should end in a draw.

34.Nh6 Qe7 35.Rxg6 Qe5

The defensive resource Karpov was banking on - White's queen is pinned!

36.Rg8+ Ke7

And now comes the famous move that destroys Black's coordination!

37.d6+!

Black will now first lose his queen, and then some.

37...Ke6 38.Re8+ Kd5 39.Rxe5+ Nxe5 40.d7 Rb8 41.Nxf7 1-0

Show in Text Mode Chapter 7 Exercises Exercise 1 - easy Black to move How should Black proceed? What is the right plan for Black here? Show/Hide Solution Solution 1 Answer: Black first needs to fix the central pawn structure, gain space, and remove White's Bd3 from its good post:

12...c4! 13.Be2

Now, activating the bishop on c8 is the right answer. Korchnoi (in his game vs Mecking, Beverwijk 1978) did it in the most precise way:

13...Qa5 14.Bd2 Bd7

Black has a clear plan (improving his bishop) and is at least equal. Exercise 2 - easy White to move With this fixed Winawer pawn structure, is it clever for White to take immediate action with 11.h5 and after the forced 11...g5 play 12.f4, quickly opening up the kingside? Show/Hide Solution Solution 2 This pawn structure can be compared to that in Almasi-Beliavsky and Karjakin- Grischuk elsewhere in this book. This game is another example of how easily even a very strong player can go wrong in these strategically complex positions. Answer: No, it is not as after

11.h5?! g5 12.f4?

White's queen on g4 is badly placed and Black responds with

[diagram]
and is better as after

13.Qg3

(in case of 13.exf6 Nxf6, Black develops fast and takes the initiative)

13...g4

the kingside is fixed and White's bishop pair is useless, while Black has the advantage on the queenside. Exercise 3 - easy White to move Black has already castled and arguably has a development advantage. He wants to open up the centre with the standard push ...f6. Should Black be happy with his position here? Show/Hide Solution Solution 3 Answer: No! White knight is still on its initial g1-square so White can comfortably keep the center closed:

11.f4!

White now simply rolls his kingside pawns, while Black does not have any meaningful counterplay. White has a clear advantage. Exercise 4 - easy/medium Black to move White has grabbed a pawn, but is his queen getting trapped? Evaluate the position. Show/Hide Solution Solution 4 Answer: Yes, it is!

17...Rhg8 18.h3

Or 18.a4 Rdf8 19.Qh7 Nce7 with ...Rh8 or ...Rg7 to follow.

18...Rdf8 19.Qxf8+ Rxf8 20.hxg4 Nfe7

And Black soon won in Almasi-Beliavsky, Hungary tt 1996. Exercise 5 - medium Black to move Kasparov had his bishop on d3 and has just played Be4. Was this a good decision? Show/Hide Solution Solution 5 Answer: No, it was not because due to White's back rank problems this blunders a piece:

45...f5! 46.Bxf5 Ra8

Luckily for White, his piece blunder was not fatal and he escapes into a drawn ending:

47.Bb1 Qb2 48.h4 Ra1 49.Kh2 Qxb1 50.Qxe5 Qh1+ 51.Kg3 Qe1+ 52.Qxe1 Rxe1

With a theoretically drawn ending, though a number of mistakes were still made before White eventually saved a draw in Kasparov-Kramnik, Moscow 2001. Exercise 6 - easy/medium White to move White's chances are clearly on the queenside, but how to proceed? Propose three candidate moves for White. Show/Hide Solution Solution 6 Answer: White has a great position (a clear advantage) and a number of options. It is very good if one of your three candidate moves was the thematic exchange sacrifice:

14.Rb4! Nxb4 15.axb4

And White's pawn avalanche will run Black over, Shirov-Zs.Polgar, Pardubice 1994. Exercise 7 - medium White to move White is doing great on the queenside. Black has just pushed 20... h3, trying to create counterplay. How should White react here? Show/Hide Solution Solution 7

21.gxh3!

Black has many tactical ideas that don't work, White has a large advantage here. In the actual game (Agrest-Nisipeanu, Batumi Ech-tt 1999) White reacted with

21.g3?. Now Black's pawn will stay on h3 until the end of the game and due to the

weakness of White's king Nisipeanu managed to save the game: 21...axb5 22.cxb5. Putting his queen on c7 was not a good idea for Black in the first place. 22...Qd8!. White now creates a strong passer on c6 and may have thought he had a winning advantage... 23.Bxe5 dxe5 24.Qxd8 Rexd8 25.Nc6 Bxc6 26.bxc6 ... but Black saves the game due to White's weak king - the pawn on h3 doing an excellent job:

26...Rd2 27.Ba6 (or 27.Bf1 Rbb2 28.Ne2 Bd8! 29.c7 Bxc7 30.Rxc7 Rxe2 31.Bxe2

Rxe2 with a draw as in the game) 27...Rbb2 (the silicon brain will tell you 27...Ne8 was good as well, but the text is more human) 28.Ne2 Bd6 29.c7 Bxc7 30.Rxc7 Rxe2 31.Bxe2 Rxe2. analysis diagram White king is 'in the box' and the extra exchange does not matter here. 32.Rf1 g5

33.g4 Kg7 34.Kg1 Rg2+ 35.Kh1 Re2 36.Rc3 Nd7 37.Rfc1 Rf2 38.Kg1 Rg2+

39.Kh1 Rf2 1⁄2-1⁄2

Exercise 8 - medium White to move Anatoly Karpov was famed for defending with a 'minumum of resources'. Here he has gone a step too far. How did Judit Polgar destroy Karpov here? Show/Hide Solution Solution 8 Answer: Judit went for the famous 'Lasker sacrifice':

25.Bxh7+! Kxh7 26.Qh5+ Kg8 27.Bxg7!

Exercise 9 - medium/advanced White to move This position could have come from the game Ponomariov-Kramnik, Wijk aan Zee

2005. The position looks complicated; Black has just sacrificed an exchange on c4.

Can you find the win for White here? 'Mating net imagination' helps! Show/Hide Solution Solution 9 Answer: White crushes Black with

26.f5!!

and Black does not have a good response as

26...Ne5

runs into a nice mating net:

27.Rxg7+! Kxg7 28.f6+ Kg8 29.Rh8+! Kxh8 30.Qh1+ Kg8 31.Qh6 Qf8 32.Ne7+

Qxe7 33.Qg7# Exercise 10 - medium White to move White (Kasparov) is doing great here. Can you find an 'instant kill' for White? Show/Hide Solution Solution 10 Answer: White gets the job done with a 'single swipe of his sword':

27.Ng4!!

Black resigned as mate or decisive material loses cannot be avoided, Kasparov- Lautier, Moscow 1994. For example: 27...Rxg5 28.Nxe5, 27...Qe6 28.Rd8! or

27...fxg4 28.Qxe5+.

Exercise 11 - advanced Black to move Black has a winning attack, but precision is needed. There is only one road to victory here! Try to calculate a win for Black without moving pieces. Show/Hide Solution Solution 11 In their game in Belgrade 1989, Nigel Short could have posed Zdenko Kozul more 'execution problems' by playing 28. Rxd6. Answer: You did very well if you calculated this line correctly:

28...Rb2+! 29.Kxb2 Qa2+ 30.Kc1 Qa1+ 31.Kd2 Ra2+ 32.Ke3

Now Black needs a last precise check - you did an excellent job if you saw it from the starting position:

32...Qc3+!! 33.Rd3

Or 33.Bd3 Qd2+ 34.Kf3 when Black can afford the luxury to take everything:

34...Qxg2+! 35.Ke3 Qd2+ 36.Kf3 Qxh6.

33...Qxe1+

And again White loses everything:

34.Kf3 Qe2+ 35.Kg3 Qxg2+ 36.Kh4 Qxe4+

Exercise 12 - advanced Black to move Black has a typical powerful Rauzer attack. However, he has sacrificed a piece. White's Rh3 and Ng3 are out of play but this may quickly change. How should Black proceed here? Try to calculate as far as you can. Show/Hide Solution Solution 12 Answer: White's pawn defences need to be removed! It is excellent if you managed to calculate the winning line until the end:

29...Rxa2!! 30.Bxa2

30.Kxa2 runs into a forced mate: 30...Qa5+ 31.Kb1 Qa1+ 32.Kc2 Be1+! 33.Kd3

Qa6+ 34.Bc4 Rxc4 35.Ke2 Rxe4#. Now the logical follow up is to clear the path to annihilate White's king:

30...b3! 31.Bxb3 Qa3 32.Kc2 Qb2+ 33.Kd3

Black has only one way to win here! It is great if you found this win calculating from the starting position. If not, test yourself here.

33...Ba5! 34.Bc4 Rxc4! 35.Ne2

35.Kxc4 runs into checkmate: 35...Qc2+ 36.Kb5 Qc5+.

35...Qc2+ 36.Ke3 Bb6+

And White resigned in Hou Yifan-Li, Danzhou 2011. Exercise 13 - advanced White to move White has sacrificed a piece for a great attack. The rook lift 23.Re3 has excellent chances to succeed, however a forced win is always much more desirable. Can you find a forced win for White here? Show/Hide Solution Solution 13 Answer: You did great if you spotted the following forced win:

23.Bxh6! Bxh6

Black's queen defends the crucial f7-square, so it needs to be removed from its post:

24.Reb1!

24.Re3? loses to 24...Qc4 25.Rf3 Kg7! 26.Rg3+ Bg5.

24...Qc4

24...Qc3 loses to 25.Qxf7+ Bg7 26.Nf5 Bxf5 27.Qh5+! Bh6 (or 27...Kg8 28.Qxe8+

Bf8 29.exf5+-) 28.Qxf5+ Kg8 29.Rb7 Qxa1+ 30.Kh2 and Black, though a rook and two pieces up, cannot prevent checkmate, e.g. 30...Bf4+ 31.g3 Bxg3+ 32.Kg2.

25.Rb4! Qc3 26.Qxf7+ Bg7 27.Nf5! Qxa1+ 28.Kh2

Though being massive material up, Black cannot save this position either:

28...Bxf5 29.exf5

And White wins:

29...e4 30.Qg6+ Kg8 31.Qxe8+

Exercise 14 - medium/advanced Black to move Black has sacrificed a full rook. How should he continue? Try to visualize/find a mating net. Show/Hide Solution Solution 14 Answer: It's good if you spotted the mating net Petrosian weaved here:

49...Qh4! 50.Be2 Rh7! 51.Kf1?

This allows a beautiful finish. Computer engines give White survival chances after 51.Bh5!! Rxh5 52.Kf1.

51...Qxf4+!! 0-1

Exercise 15 - easy/medium White to move From a famous game Larsen-Petrosian, Santa Monica 1966. It 'feels' as if White's attack should be winning. Can you find the way 'The Great Dane' crushed 'Iron Tigran'? Show/Hide Solution Solution 15 Answer: It's nice if you found the beautiful queen sacrifice:

25.Qxg6!! Nf4

25...fxg6 26.Bxe6+ does not change anything.

26.Rxf4 fxg6 27.Be6+ Rf7 28.Rxf7 Kh8 29.Rg5

White has all the time in the world to mate Black, as Black's pieces are completely cut off.

29...b5 30.Rg3 1-0

Exercise 16 - easy/medium White to move This position is from one of the legendary Kasparov-Karpov Zaitsev battles. The defensive resource Karpov is banking on here is the pin on the white queen. Did Karpov miss something here? Try to find the attacking resource for the legendary 13th World Champion! Show/Hide Solution Solution 16 Answer: It's great if you found the following attacking idea for White:

36.Rg8+! Ke7

And now, a small pawn move destroys Black's coordination!

37.d6+! Ke6 38.Re8+ Kd5 39.Rxe5+ Nxe5 40.d7 Rb8 41.Nxf7

And Black resigned. Exercise 17 - advanced Black to move This position could have come from the K-K game from the previous example. White is a piece down, he might lose even another one, however Black's king has almost no defenders. Calculate the lines, assess the position! What is the objective evaluation? Show/Hide Solution Solution 17 Answer: It's excellent if you came to the conclusion that the position is equal, it's a draw by perpetual check, and you saw the following lines:

31...Rxb1+ 32.Bc1+

It's nice if you spotted that 32.Kh2 leads to a draw too after 32...Rh1+! 33.Kxh1 Nxf2+ 34.Kg1! Qxg3 and White has to force perpetual check with 35.Bg7+! Kxg7

36.Ne8+.

32...Kg7

There is no mate, so White, being too much material down, has to agree to a draw:

33.Ne8+ Kg8 34.Nf6+

Exercise 18 - advanced Black to move We are following the game R. Svane-McShane, Germany Bundesliga 2019/20. Luke McShane is under a terrible attack. However, he does have a hidden defensive resource! How can Black save the game? Show/Hide Solution Solution 18 Answer: It's excellent if you managed to find the following 'top-level' defence for Black here:

[diagram]
27...Qe8? was a losing mistake - see the games section.

28.g5

And now comes the point!

28...Qa5!

Black's queen is active and White's king is exposed - Black saves the game! White's best chance is

29.Qh7+

29.Bxd6 is equal after the easy moves 29...Qe1+ 30.Kg2 Qe4+ 31.Kf1 fxg5.

29...Kf7 30.Bxd6 Bxd6 31.Qh5+

Black still needs to play a few only moves now:

31...Ke6! 32.Re3+ Be5! 33.Qg4+

Or 33.f4 Qd2!.

33...f5 34.Qxc4+ Qd5 35.Qa6+ Qd6

And this way the game could have been saved. Exercise 19 - medium White to move A position from the game Vachier-Lagrave-Amin, France tt 2019. White has a strong attack which is in the 'execution phase'. Think of three candidate moves for White and see if one of your candidates is the move MVL played. Show/Hide Solution Solution 19 Answer: Congratulations if one of your candidate moves was the direct

34.g4!

and Black's position collapses in a few moves:

34...hxg4 35.Qh4 gxf3 36.Qxh6 Ne5 37.Nxf3 Ncd7 38.Ng5 Nf8 39.Nxf7! Qxf7

40.Rxf7 Kxf7

Black cannot build a fortress here.

41.Bd1! Re7 42.Bg4 1-0

Exercise 20 - advanced Black to move Assess the position and find the best continuation for Black. Show/Hide Solution Solution 20 Answer: It's excellent if you assessed the position as equal and found the only move for Black that does not lose:

24...Nxd4+!

The game went 24...Qf6? 25.Qd5+ (Black now loses decisive material) 25...Re6 (or

25...Rf7 26.Rxh7) 26.g5 (too many black pieces are hanging) 26...Nxd4+ 27.Kd1

and Black resigned.

25.Rxd4 Qg5!

Thus, this wild game could have petered out into a peaceful endgame. 25...Qf6? does not stop Qd5+ and loses to 26.Rd7.

26.Qd5+

26.Qh3 is not a winning attempt as White will only be in trouble after the simple

26...Re7.

26...Qxd5 27.cxd5 Bd6=

Or 27...fxe3=.
