Introduction
Introduction              there is no single opening or  variation
that is able to magically give a clear ad-
vantage  to  White,  or  easy  equality  to
Black. Instead there are various systems
that are  more or  less equal in  terms of
statistical  success  in  tournaments,  but
that are  very different  indeed  in  terms
of  style and  the  type of  positions  they
create.
Some, could  say  that  the  Sicilian  is
the best defence against  ] ,e4Tgiven that
Black  wins  47%  of   the  games,  com-
pared  to  44% for  the  Open  Games, or
45%  for  the  Caro-Kann.  But this  begs
the question why  a player such  as Kar-
pov, who  was World Champion for  J 0
years, virtually  never  plays rhe Sicilian.
Evidendy such an aggressive defence is
not suited co his solid positional style.
For  this  reason  it  is  important  to
know,  at  least  in   general  terms,   the
characteristics of  all the openings, so as
to choose  the one that is best suited to
your own. personal taste and style. And
once  we  have decided  on  an. opening,
should  we remain faithful  to it  for  the
rest  of  lives,  or  should  we  frequently
flirt with other systems? Here opinions
differ
Needless  to  say  if  a  player  always
uses the same opening they will end up
knowing   it   very   well   (Grandmaster
Wolfgang  Uhlmann s dedication  to  the
French  Defence  comes  to  mind).  On
the other hand, in die age of  computers
and the Internet, it only takes a few sec-
onds   to   find   the   details  of   another
player's  repertoire.  As a  result,  players
with  a  predictable  repertoire will  find
themselves  sitting  opposite adversaries
who  are  very  well  prepared.  The  re-
nowned English grandmaster and. ope-

What is the best move in this position?
Our  great-grandparents  would  not
have  hesitated  for  a  second:  the  move
1 .e4L It occupies the centre and  allows
for    the   development   of   the    kings
bishop  and   the  queen.  This  book   is
about this move, and ah of  Black s prob
able   replies.   We   will   discuss   dosed
games in  the  later  volumes  of  this se-
ries,  thus  completing  this  overview  of
the  ideas and objectives of all the ope-
nings.
And what is Blacks  best response to
1 .e4? Once  again  there  used  to be  few
doubts :    k..e5 h   This   fights   against
White's expansion in  the  most  natural
way or so it was thought at the end  of
the 19th century. Indeed, until that time
the  vast majority  of  games  had  begun
with  these  two  moves.  Why  then  is  it
that  today  only  10%  of  games  begin
l.e4  e5,  which  are  the moves  that  de
fine   the   branch   of   opening   theory
known as the Open Games? The answer
is that over  a hundred years of  tourna-
ment experience has demonstrated, that
Chess  Opening  Essentials      Volume 1
ning expert John Nunn wrote that until
recently  the  advantages  and  disadvan-
tages  of  a  limited  opening  repertoire
balanced  themselves  out,  but  with  the
advent of the computer age the balance
was new  clearly in  favour of  rhe player
with a large repertoire. Indeed, today it
is very easy to familiarize yourself  with
a new system with the help of  a book or
DVD that explains the opening’s general
concepts, a good  database, and  a varia-
tion  table. This  preparation allows  you
to surprise your  opponent and  to  play
the  variation  most  suited  to  the  occa-
sion. and also perhaps io your mood  at
the time. It is no mere coincidence that
a  player  like  Karpov.  with  his  highly
limited  opening  repertoire,  has  diffi
culty in  die opening  phase when  play-
ing   against   the   younger   champions
who  were  born  in  the  computer  age.
Obviously, most of  us are not champion
players, and  we  have neither  the  time,
nor  the  desire,  to expand  our  opening
repertoire.  However, we would suggest
-  if possible — that you use a minimum
of two opening systems for both  White
and  Black. This  will  also  enlarge  your
understanding  of  the  game,  and   you
will  see  the  benefits  of  this  in  an  im-
proved   performance   in   the   middle-
game.
As   the    Dutch    grandmaster   Jan
Timm an wrote, fA wide opening reper-
toire  keeps  your  thinking  flexible'.  It
comes  as   no  surprise   that   this  great
player knows,  and  plays,  almost  all  of'
the openings.
In these books we will discuss all of
the openings, so as to give the reader a
broad  but  not  superficial overview We
will   not   only   give   you   the   specific
moves played, but more importantly an
understanding of the ideas behind each
system. To  help  us  with  this  goal  we
will   observe   the   traditional   division
into   open,   semi  open    and    dosed
games;  not  only  for  clear organization
but   also   because   it   makes   learning
about them easier

With  this  move  (suggested  by  the  Syr-
ian player Stamm a in the 1 Sth century*)
White  prevents the  feeing  move  d5  by
Black and  prepares £jc3, J&d2. followed
by 0-0-0 with good piece play
4<                       £g8-f6!
White is playing a  type of  Scandinavian
with  an  extra  tempo  (the  pawn  is  al
ready  well  placed  on  e4,  while  in  the
Scandinavian  it  is  rare  that  Black  man-
ages to get his  pawn  to eS). White  pre
pares  for   a  quick  0-0-0.  White   will
have  active  piece  play  and  he  will  be
able   to   exploit   the   space   advantage
which   arises   from   the   central   pawn
structure with a  white pawn  on  e4 and
a black pawn ond6.
Of course Black  has  bis own  trumps  to
play: after the natural
3.                        &b8-c6
The  white queen  is forced to move and
White  loses  a tempo. This  in  itself  was
sufficient reason for the Centre Game  to
quickly become a  museum piece and to
be  scoffed  at  for  decades. However,  its
recent  adoption, even  if  occasional, by
very    strong    players    the    likes    of
Morozevich,  Adams  and   Judit   Polgar
has, in  part, led to a re  evaluation of  the
opening.
Black must  play actively so as not  be left
with   a   structurally   inferior   position
without compensation.

The  strongest  response  to  this move is
8..JSxe4!
The   resulting   positions  are  dynami-
cally  balanced, and even if  against cor-
rect  play White  cannot expect  an  ob-
jective  advantage,  it  is  clear   that  in
practical play the opening is still an ex-
cellent  surprise  weapon.  Most  of  the
time  black  players will  be  unprepared
for an opening that is so rarely played,
and which is very much  better than its
reputation would suggest.

contains  winning possibilities, as  both

The  bishop on  c4  also has the advantage
of   helping   to   prevent   his   opponents

frees Black's position in  the Open Games.
The only negative aspect is that Black, not
having yet developed the  bOmght, can
ambitiously plan to push  die  pawn  to d5
by  advancing  his  c7-pawn  to  c6,  How-

Black should not have many problems if

After

Black has a more complicated task, and
must  choose  between  two  very  differ-
ent continuations:
A)         3.                        £tf6xe4
White controls the d5 -square and plans
the advance of the fpawn  The Vienna
Game was developed in Vienna around
1850  by Carl Hamppe, as an attempt to
play an improved version  of the King’s
Gambit.
However, in  the  modern  approach  the
choice  of  Z.£k3  is  not  always  made
with   the  intention  of  advancing   rhe
fl -pawn,  but  rather  as  part  of  a  more
solid  deployment  with  the  move  Ac-k
or even g3, developing the fl -bishop by
way of  a fianchettcx
However,  after                  White  can  in
fact  create  some   headaches  for  Black
with 314 L
An apparent knight  sacrifice: However,
in reality after 4.$Ixe4 dS TBlack regains
the piece, with a fluid game
if  White, instead  avoids  the  pawn  fork
by   first   sacrificing   the   bishop   with
4.5kxf74*t   then  4,„Sfrxf7  5.$?ixc4 dSf
and  Blacks  dominant  centre  is  more
than  sufficient  compensation  for   the
exposed king.
However, the best move for While is
4,   Wd1-h5!
Tins  move leads to a long  setpence of
forced    moves   with    the   inventively
picturesque  name  Frankenstein-Dr a-

possible to respond to rhe thematic 3.f4

King’s Gambit Declined

The King’s Gambit is one of  those ope-

was  enormously  popular  in   the   19ch
century  at  chc  height  of  the  Romantic
era. However, it all but disappeared with
die advene of the positional school at the
beginning  of  the  20th  century.  In  the
1930$  there  was  a  partial  re-evaluation
thanks to die Swedish grandmaster Gdsia
Stoltz,  who   highlighted  the  positional
merits of this gambit. The King s Gambit
was  now   no   longer  seen  simply  as  a
means    of    violently    attacking    the
(7-square  via  the  f-file  and   the  usual
.Ac4,  but  as  a  way  of  conquering  rhe
centre, without ruling out  the possibility
of  later simplification  and  an  early end
game.  Its  occasional  use  by  cliarnpion
players such as Keres, Spassky, Bronstein,
and  even  the  great  Bobby  Fischer,  and
more   recently  Gallagher   and   Fedorov,
lias made  the opening popular with lov-
ers   of   sparkling   and   aggressive   phy
However,   the   Kings   Gambit   is   still

the  most  popular,  Black has eight  per

has   been   undervalued   because   of   a
beautiful   victory   by   Fischer   playing
with  the  white  pieces.  In  reality  this
knight  move  is  much   better  than  its
reputation  would  suggest:  it  supports
d5   and    it   prepares   to   defend   the
f4-pawn from g6 or dS.
Now   the   natural  moves  are  4,d4  d5

D)         3,   ...                   tf8-e7

solidly with             Otherwise he could
risk   giving   check   with   ...Ah 4.  This
would  prevent White from castling  but
leaves the bishop badly placed on h4. In
both  cases  the  resulting  positions  are
complex and difficult to evaluate.

is the Schallopp Defence, which conn-
terattacks  the  e4~pawn and  which  also
allows the knight to transfer to hS sup-
porting the 14-pawn. After 4.e5 (4.®c3
is interesting) 4..,Cih$ 5.d4
Black has  denied  White  tile  pawn  ad-
vance  to e5,  which  is so  dangerous in
the King's Gambit. However. after

Black needs to be careful: a well-timed,
even  if  unnatural  exchange  on  d.S by
the  bishop  could  give  White  a  slight
positional  advantage,   and   at   times   a
dangerous initiative. Nevertheless, with
correct  play  Black  maintains  equality.

Strange in  an  opening  where develop-
ment is the most noteworthy character-
istic!  This  is  a  clear  example  of  the
modern interpretation of  this opening:
White seeks  to exploit the weakness of
the pawns on f4 and g4 positionally, re-

The key position of the Classical Varia-
tion of  the Kings Gambit Accepted.
It  seems  to  go  against  common  sense
to concede the e 4- pawn for the one on
t4: m addition Black has an extra pawn
and  an  active  knight  on  e4.  Nonethe-
less,  White  receives  good  compensa-
tion: Black s kingside  has  many  weak-
nesses,  the  g4'pawn,  even  though  a
material  advantage,  has  the   negative
quality of  restricting  black activity  on
that wing, and  perhaps Black would  be
better off  without it  (as  is  the  case in
the    S..d6   variation).   In    addition,
Whites  rooks  on  el  and  fl  will  exert
unpleasant   and   ongoing   positional
pressure. This is also the  case in  varia-
tions   in   which   the   queens   are   ex-
changed.  Black  almost  always  castles
queenside.   White   sometimes   castles
queenside too, and  on other occasions
he  moves  the  king  to  d2  or  otherwise
to  fZ. In  conclusion, after  8...We7  or
8„.Jtg7,  the  position  is  dynamically
balanced.

White  moves  the  knight  several  times,
but gains the g4  pawn or the one on f4,
at times losing  the e4-pawn. The pawn
push  to  h4  weakens  White s  kingside
(in some variations a black knight lands
on g3 via h5) t  but Black s king is also in
a rather  precarious position. As a result
the continuations that arise are tactically
complex and have strategic possibilities
for both players.
Black can continue with 5...d6 t  sacrific-
ing  the g4“pawn in exchange for good

vourable for White.
[f  White tries to aggressively punish the
Latvian Counter G ambit, Black's positi-
on    will   prove   to   have   unexpected
resources.
This   is  sometimes  called   the   Greco
Counter™Gambit,  after   the  Calabrian
Gioacchino Greco, who analysed a vari-
ety oflin.es in the early part of the 17 th
century II was later revived by the Lat-
vian Karl Behring, who studied it at the
beginning of  the 20th centu ry
To play a type of King s Gambit with a
tempo less is certainly not a particularly
appealing choice for Black: the only ad-
vantage is that there is not  the possibil-
ity  of  a  queen  cheek  on  hS  and  dius
Black is genuinely threatening 3...fxc4,
whereas  fxe.5 in  the  King's Gambit  is
only an illusory threat.
The  best policy  for While is 10 content
himself  with  the  good  positional  ad-
vantage that comes from

White should be able to maintain some
advantage  here  by either  taking  on  h8
or g6. Nonetheless, the introduction of
4...dSj? brought about a brief  period of
popularity   for   the   Latvian   Counter-
Gam bin Today it is almost never played
at a serious level, except  by correspon-
dence players, who in  general like long
forced  lines of play The Latvian in Is the
bill nicely  in  this  respect and  thus  en-
joys  a   certain   popularity   with   this
group of  players.

This last move was the subject of  analy-
sis by Damiano in  the  16 th century. A
brief  examination  of  this  move,  apart
from  being  of historical interest, is in-

The Philidor Defence is named in hon-
our  of  the  famous  1 Bth century  chess
theoretician -composer,  who  advocated
this  defence,  albeit  with   the  idea  of
pushing  the pawn  to fS  as early as the
third  move;  a  concept  which  today  is
viewed  with  great suspicion. Philidors
aggressive  approach  could  have  some
validi ty   after   the   moves    3.<$?ic3   or
3,Ac4,  which  is  the  very  reason  that
Morphy s favourite move 3,d4E is so ap-
propriate, The modem treatment of this
defence tends towards a more solid ap-
proach,   with   Black   developing    his
pieces   on    the    back   ranks,   usually
„j£bd7 5 ,,,£.gf6±.,.Ae7_x6, ...Wc7>
2,..d6  has the obvious defect of block-
ing  the  f8- bishop.  Nonetheless, such  a
natural  move  could  not  be  considered
bad,,. on more precisely; not really bad!

Blacks  solid   but   passive   position   is
reminiscent  of  several  Pirc  variations
and  the Old Indian Defence. White has
to content himself with  a small advan-
tage that may arise from  his possession
of  the  d-file  and  rhe  weakness  of  the
<16-square.  It  is   for   this   reason   that
White should strive to exchange on e5.
33
Chess  Opening  Essentials -   Volume  1
As    this    grants    mobility    to    the
e7 -bishop,  the  exchange  should   take
place  at  the  most  opportune moment.
More   rarely,  White   succeeds  in   the
course  of  the  game  in  preparing  the
pawn  advance  f2-f4,  with  the  idea  of
undermining Black's centre.
Black, for his pan, has to play a waiting
game -  putting his faith in  the solidity
of  his position.
Tire following sequence has become an
increasingly  popular  way  of  reaching
this position:  i.e4 d6  2.d4 4if6 3.4hc3
eS!? (with  3...g6 we land  in  the  Pirc)
4,<£jf3 (exchanging  queens  does  not
give  White  any  particular  advantage)
4...‘?jbd7 S.M:4 Ae7,etc.
In conclusion, this is a defence that is in
the  process  of  being  re-evaluated. It  is
certainly not as bad as has been thought
in  the  past.  It  is suitable for  solid,  pa-
tient players, and it has the advantage of
not requiring a lot of  theoretical study.

Petroff Defence

sufficient  for  it  io  be  considered  un-
playable. Only the Italo“Hungarian Bela
Toth   played   it   m   those   years,   after
which it  began  to appear in  the reper-
toires of  Yusupov, Karpov, Hart, Hubner
and other clumpions.
From  the  beginning  of  die  1990s  the
Petroff  Defence has been appreciated as
one  of   the  most   effective   means  of
drawing  with  the  black pieces -  espe-
cially by top-level players.
The Petroff is often  called  the  Russian
Defence. Alexander Petroff. who popu-
larized  it  at the  beginning of  the  19th
century  and  Carl  Jaenisch,  who  also
contributed a great deal to its develop-
ment, were both Russians. At the begin-
ning of  the  20th century the American
Frank  Marshall believed  in  the  validity
of  several lines  where  Black plays very
aggressively  Other  very  dynamic play-
ers,  such   as   Harry   Nelson  Pillsbury,
have also used the Petroff  Defence with
success. This  makes you  reflect  on  the
common  notion  that  certain  openings
are always solid  and  passive by nature,
whereas others are always dynamic and
aggressive.  Fortunately,  die  possibility
of  personal  interpretation  in  so  many
openings is so great that there is always
room for creative play.
Now we will have a close look at some
specific variations. After the defence of
the   e4-pawn   with    3 ,$k3 ,   there   is
3...#x6, and  you  transpose  to  the  in-
nocuous Four Knights Opening.
For this reason, if  White wishes to travel
along  more  promising  paths,  there  re-
main effectively two alternatives: either
to take the pawn on eS or to look for ac-
tivity with 3.d4,
a«A»*&    .. .fj
Ab AAA   i A A A I:
With 2..,fef6 TBlack docs not defend the
eS-pawn,  but  attacks  the  e4-pawn  in-
stead.
We are therefore talking about a defence
which is conceptually ambitious and ac-
tive  However, in  practice, the  resulting
variations  tend  to  lead  to  symmetrical
and quiet  positions, and  tile  number of
drawn games is unusually high.
if  Black  is  looking  for  a  win,  other
defences  would  be  more  suitable.  On
the other hand, it could be an. excellent
choice if you are  black against a stron-
ger   player,  or   one   who  plays  ambi-
tiously: indeed, if  White  plays too  ag-
gressively  he  may  find  that  the  more
tactical variations will backfire on him.
The Petroff  Defence is one of the most
extraordinary examples of opening re-
evaluation of all time: you only need to
consult a 1970s opening book to realize
how  little it  was appreciated  then. The
prospect  of  playing  symmetrical  posi-
tions  with  one  or  two  tempi  less  was

The move 4<4ixf71? looks like the work
of  a drunken Irishman. Yet it is a part of
chess theory and is even dignified with
a  name:  the  Cochrane  Gambit  How-
ever,  against  correct  play  White   will
have his work set out for him  trying to
find   sufficient   compensation   for   the
sacrificed piece.

In   this   almost   symmetrical   position
White must exploit the presence of the
black knight on e4, which appears to be
actively  placed,  but   which  in   reality
renders Black s centre somewhat unsta-
ble. It is worth noting that if the knight

Italian town of Modena, analysed various
important lints  m  the  18 th  century  lie
was  also  a  member  of  die  Pope's  inner
circle  The c2-c3 push is logical in  that it
supports  d2-d4.  But  it  has   two  draw-
backs: it  leaves the  e4-pawn undefended
and  it  prevents  the  development  of  the
queen's knight to c3. Black’s two best re-

In  the  standard  Scotch  Game,  White
takes on  d4  with  the £3-knight. If yon
wish   to  be  more  aggressive,  you  can
sacrifice a pawn for quick development

fice  option  by  developing  the  bishop

often  has  difficulty  even  to  maintain

4.W3xd4-
there is a drawback: with the pawn on c7
instead of  on e 7 the f8-bishop is ready to
enter the fray on cS or on  b4, exerting a
pressure on White’s centre that is rare in
the   Sicilian.   This   is   the   reason   why
Scotch  lines  often  have  great  positional
tension: if  White  succeeds in  neutraliz-
ing Black’s active piece play, he can begin
to  exploit  his  space  advantage and  pos-
session of  the centre.
After  4.®xd4,  Black  can  choose  from
two  main  lines  and  three  minor  ones.
We  will   begin   with   the   three  minor
variations:
A)         4.   ...                  >d8-h4
The Scotch Game  picked  up its name af-
ter  its use in  a match  between the  Edm-
burgh and  London Chess Clubs in 1824,
This  opening  has  had  many  highs  and
lows over rhe years. After its employment
by Jacques Mieses and Savieily Tartakower
at the  beginning of the  20th century, the
Scotch Game was a rarity until its success-
ful   adoption   by   Garry   Kasparov  from
1990 on. Another extraordinary example
of  a completely reassessed opening Today
the  Scotch  Game,  along  with   the  Ruy
Lopez, is considered  to  be  the only  seri-
ous attempt for  White  to gain an advan-
tageafe I.e4e5.
in a certain sense 3,d4is the most logical
move:  as in  the  Open  Sicilian  (i.e   the
variations with  3,d4), White, obtains the
classic space  advantage  (4  ranks  versus
3 )  and  does  not  have to  worry  about an
enemy  central pawn  majority such  as is
typical of the Sicilian Defence,  However,
Steinitz*s move seeks to profit from the
absence of  the knight on f3 to attack the
e4~pawn I  which  it  usually wins! There-
fore, in a certain sense the Scotch Game
is  a  gambit! However, the  pawn  comes
at too high a price, and this variation re-
mains a rarity. The best line for White is
probably

and    the.   lead    in    development,   the
bishop  pair  and  the  black  king  on  d8
4.5
Chess  Opening  Essentials ..  Volume  1
If   we.  exclude   die   dubious   5.4?jfS,
White can now continue with:
D1)       5.   Ac1-e3        Wd8-f6i
The   pressure  on  d4  forces  White   to
make the disagreeable move
6<  C3
and  after  6.„®lge7  or   6,..Wg6T  Black
has good piece play with equal possibil-
ities for both sides,
D2)       5.   Td4-b3       Ac5~b6
6<  a2“a4           a7“a6
Z    £&1-c3        d7-d6
8.      c3-d5        &b6-a7
White has a space advantage,  but  Bhck
has  no  weaknesses and  he  can develop
his forces smoothly.
D3)       5,      d4xc6
Another move that has been completely
reassessed: the old  Ime of’thinking was
that after

tive,

are  more  than  enough  compensation
for the pawn.
B)         4.                        &f8-b4+
A  paradoxical  move  that  is  becoming
increasingly   popular,   After    5,£ic3 t
transposes to the 4,,.&f6 varia-
tion t   reducing  Whites  options.  After
5x3, Blacks bishop retreats to e7 or  to
cS hoping that the move c3, which  pre-
vents  £k:3 s  will  prove  to  be  to  Black’s
advantage. It  is  not  dear  if  this  is  the
case, but at least in  this way Black suc-
ceeds    in    avoiding    many     highly
theoretical lines.
C)         4.   »                  Wd8-f6
This usually  transposes  to Variation D3
after 5,®xc6 Ac5,

even  if  it  locks in  his  own  f8 -bishop.
However,   White   must   imprison   his
own bishop, too,
Z    Wd1-e2       ££6-d5
8.   c2-c4
There  is  a  lot  of  play  for  both  sides:
Black  has  easy  development   but  the
doubled  pawn  on  the  cdile  will  give
White  a  favourable endgame. This is  a
recurrent  theme  in  open  games.  Prac-
tice seems to slightly favour White.
E)         4.   ...                  £g8-f6
and at tins point Black can immediately
retreat  his  knight  with  8...ftb6,  or  he
can  pin  the  c4-paw'n  with  8..J&a6,  In
both  cases  there  is  complex  play  with
chances  for  both  sides.  This  becomes
dear   when   you   consider   that   both
White and  Black can castle either  short
or long, and that the pawns on eS and c4
are weak but they also have the potential
to  stifle  the  opponent,  who  is  rather
lacking in space. In short, a typical posi-
tion  where  the  stronger  player  should
win. This  also  holds  true  because ope-
ning   theory   has  not  explored  all  the
available possibilities  yet  and  therefore
there is still room for creative play
This is the most ambitious move. Black
encourages White to  push the  pawn  to
eS, hoping to then undermine the cen-
tre. If  White decides not  to  jump to the
bail,  he  can  continue  with  5,fcc3x  or
otherwise he can exchange on c6 to fa-
cilitate the pawn advance to e5:

If  White  decides  on   4,d4,  then  after
4...exd4 you transpose to an innocuous
variation  of  the Scotch  Game  that  we
have discussed  in  the  previous chapter.
If  Black is not pleased by the prospect of
playing  the  somewhat sterile  positions
that ensue, he can try 4. ,Ab4, but after
5     xe5 t    the   resulting   complications
seem to favour White.
ft is worth mentioning the minor varia-
tion 4.g3. However, by far die most fre-
quent continuation is:
4.   &f1’b5
ilAlil            A
The  Four  Knights  Opening  is  one  of
Whites   most   solid   set-ups   against
L..e5, arid it was very widely played at
the beginning of  the 20th century. Then
it  all  but  disappeared  until  the  1980s
and   "90s,   when   it   made   a   hesitant
comeback, its  cili.ef  use  being  to avoid
highly  theoretical  lines.  Black has  few
problems  achieving  equality  if  White
plays   4 Ab 5   (sometimes   called   the
Spanish Four Knights Game)  or  4.d4,
which  is  in  the  spirit  of  the  Scotch
Game.
That fact that Black has few problems is
not surprising, as practice has taught us
that  if  White  wishes  to gain  a signifi-
cant  advantage  in  the  open  games  he
must   usually  occupy  the  centre  with
pawns. However, this is  rarely  possible
without the support of the £.3-pawn: in
this   context   the   move               made
purely as a developing move, is too me-
dianical ro offer concrete prospects.
Now,  unlike   in   the  Ruy   Lopez,   the
e4~pawn is defended, and therefore the
threat 5 Axe 6 and 6.£jxeS is real Black
can respond in two completely different
ways.
A)        4,                       Af8-b4
is  a  solid  continuation  that  indirectly
defends eS by attacking e4,
5.   0-0                0-0
5.,.d6? allows 6       51.
6.   d2-d3          d7-d6
7.   Ac1-fl5
Now  threatening  ®d5 r  and  Black can-
not   go   on   copying   Whites   moves.
Therefore:

opening. However,  in  this  case  the  at-
tack  is  specifically  aimed  at   bS  and,
above all, the presence of the knight on
c3   renders  a  capture  on   d4   unwise.
Moreover,  it  prevents  the  pawn  push
c2-c3.  This  gives  Black resources  that
are not present, for example, in the Bird
Defence of the Ruy Lopez (3.,.  3d4) d a
borderline   variation   in    terms    of
playability.
5,    Ab5‘84
Probably  best.  It  maintains  the  pin  on
the d7-pawn and reduces the impact of
Blacks counterplay with ...c6 and ...dS.
Now  Black usually  makes  a  positional
sacrifice of  a pawn in one of  two ways:
B1)       5.   ...                   c7-c6
Enabling

with compensation, or, more violently:
with the idea of  ., J$jd8-e6 co lift die pin
by the gS-bishop.
9.    2f1~e1          Tc6-d8
10. d3-d4            £d8-e6
11.  &g5*c1
With   the   possibility  of  repositioning
the bishop on a3. Now we reach a stra-
tegically  complex  position   in   which
White  has  good  control  of  the  centre
and  the  bishop  pair, while  Black has a
solid   position   with   good   endgame
prospects.
B)          4.   ...                                                 B2)       5.   ...                   £f8-c5
6.    4tf3xe5        0-0
7.    Te5-d3
Here one of the disadvantages of  ...$.c.5
is  revealed;  White  now  gains  a  tempo
with this move.
7.                          Jtc5-b6
At the moment Black threatens 8„,d.S.
8.    e4-e5            £f6-e8
<bc6~d4
Rubinsterns move  (who was usually a
very   solid   player’)   is   appropriate  if
Black wants to unbalance the position.
It would appear  that  this  move contra-
venes the general principles of  opening
theory   which   always   advise   against
moving  the  same  piece  twice  in  the
Four   Knights  Opening
Whites kingside is a little exposed and
White now plans to protect it with
9.      c3-d5l
and then 4£e3, keeping the extra pawn.
9,                        d7-d6?
Opening the game and putting his trust
in  his  superior  development,  his  con-
trol of  the e-fite and White’s weakly-de-
fended  king. The position after 1 0.#te3
is difficult to evaluate, even if  the results
are slightly in White's favour.
we. have had  it  drummed  into  us  that
we mustn’t place our bishop in front of
a  centre pawn,  as only  the  advance of
these pawns allows us to develop freely.
We  are  not  suggesting  for  a  moment
that  such  general  strategic  guidelines
are  no longer  valid. It  is  just  that  they
should  never  again  be  viewed  as  the
Word of God.

return to the Hungarian Defence after
4<d4     7 , given  that  4...   g4 is  dubi-
ous because of  5.h3 .
Let s go back a little, so as to explain the
idea behind the Hungarian Defence. The
development  of  the  c4-bishop  on  the
3rd  move,  even  if  slightly  inconsistent
with  the previous move, was one of  the
primary moves in the early development
of opening  theory. The  vulnerability  of
die 17-square and related tactics have at-
tracted  and  delighted  players and  chess
scholars  for centuries. Such  is  the  bril-
liant   quality   of   the   playing   style  so
closely associated with the Romantic era.
But the  advent  of  the  Positional School
and the realisation that Black has nothing
to fear from  the  most  violent  lines, di-
rected Wliite s attention towards the Buy
Lopez and also towards the Scotch; ope-
nings  that are  configured  with  a  more
correct  strategic  concern  in  mind;  the
control of  the centre.
However,  3.   Lc4 has  not  disappeared
from  practical  play  and  it  still  has  a
charm, perhaps because of  its  associa-
tions  with  a golden past,  even  though
by  playing  3...<hf6  (Two  Knights)  or
3,...fix5, Black obtains completely play-
able  positions  with  good  prospects  of
equality
OK then. Why play the Hungarian? The
answer  is  simple:  die  variations  to  re-
member if you play 3...©f6  or 3...<fi.cS
are  so  numerous,  that  there  are  many
who  prefer  a  quiet  position  which  is
slightly  inferior  to  the  risks associated
with the more violent alternatives.
The move 3...Ae7 has never been  pop-
ular since it first appeared in the middle
of  the 1 9th century in a postal game be
tween the cities of  Paris and Pest. It usu-
ally leads to strategic plans typically as-
sociated  with  the  Philidor Defence  or
the   Sceinitz   Variation   of   the   Rwy
Lopez: Black has  a  solid  position  but
without  any  real  prospects.  After  the

White has a little more room to breathe,
even  if  the  solidity  of  Blacks  position
must not be underestimated.
It is worth  remembering that  3,..d6 is

grandmaster  tournament  games.  An ex-
ception  was  the  Italian  Sergio  Mariotti s
victory  against  the  strong  grandmaster
Svetozar Gligoric (Venice 1971).
later, in  the  1990s, Kasparov,  the  great
scholar of  opening theory, won  a cou-
ple of  brilliant  victories employing the
Evans. This  led  to  a  partial  rebound in
the popularity of  the Evans Gambit.

Black can also decline with 4...  tb6 and
reach an acceptable position.
5.   c2~c3
To occupy the centre with  d2-d4. Now
the  idea  behind   (he  gambit  becomes
clear;  White  wants  to  play  an  Italian
Game  with   an  extra  tempo.  Avoiding
5,,,J&,c5, which makes <12-d4 easier, the
most  solid  retreat  was  always  consid-
ered  to  be 5.,.J  e7 r  returning the  pawn
after  6.d4  £)a5  Z.   xeS  ?5xc4  8.    xc4
dS,  with  equality.  However,  Kasparovs
introduction of 7JiLe2!? exd4 8.Wxd4!
has added new spice to this line.
The  ugly  S...J&.d6 also  seems  playable.
But Black s principal alternative remains
5+    „                 &b4-a5
which    maintains   the    pin    on    the
c3-pawn.  Whites  best  continuation  is
to  immediately  push  the  pawn  to  d4T
given   that  6.0-0  leads  to  the  famous
Lasker Defence 6.„d6 7.d4 £b6!
Invented  at  the  beginning  of  the  19 th
century,  the  Evans Gainbit  became  so
immensely popular that it threatened the
supremacy of the King’s Gambit. It was
repeatedly played, even in World Charm
pionship matches, by players of the cali-
bre  of  McDonnell,  De  la  Bourdonnais,
Morphy   Anderssen,   Zukertort   and
Chigorim  However,  with   the  develop-
ment   of   more   sophisticated  defensive
techniques at the  beginning of  the  20th
century its  popularity waned rapidly, To
understand why  just look  at  the  impact
made   by   the   Lasker  Defence,  where
Black returns die pawn in exchange for a
promising  endgame. As a  result  of  this
defence many a white player has lost  his
taste for this romantic style of play.
Even if later on a method  was devised to
avoid die Lasker Defence, the Evans Gam-
bit remains chiefly the property of corre-
spondence players  and  is  rarely  seen  in

The name Ginoco Piano (in Italian: the
quiet  game)  is  often  wrongly  consid-
ered    synonymous   with    the    Italian
Game, bur in fact the two openings have
game plans with very different strategic
characteristics.
The  reason  why  this opening is called
the  Giuoco Piano is  clear: White  does
not  seek  to  ambitiously  conquer  die
centre  with  c2-c3  and  d?.-d4, Instead,
he  concents himself  with  slow,  natural
piece   development:  Ad3,   $j€3,   0-0,
J&lgS, In   some   lines  White   puts   off
§.k3> reserving the  option  of  <?c3  in
order   to   calmly   prepare   the   d2-d4
pawn   advance,  with   slow   manoeuv-
ring  play
Sometimes  the   name   Ghioco  Pianis-
simo (in Italian: the very quiet game) is
used for  the lines in  which  White does
not  try  to  push  his  pawn  to  d4,  even
when   his  development  is  completed,
Next,   with   the  d3-d4-  pawn   advance
White   will   conquer   the   centre,   but
Black rs pair of bishops is adequate com-
pensation.
In   these  variations,  which  frequently
feature castling  on  opposite  sides,  be-
ginners will  be  wise  to  remember  the
old  maxim:  ‘Black should  never  castle
before  White  does1. In  other  words, if
Black  wishes   to  avoid   unpleasant  as-
saults  by  White, it  is  advisable  to  wait
and see where  the latter castles, so as to
castle on the same side!
Another  common  system  also  features
White   moving   the   pawn   to  c3.  It  is
most   often   reached   by   transposition

Black attacks the weak point in White's
position,  namely  the  e4-pawn,  which
can no longer be defended by          and.
concedes  the  centre  in  exchange  for
good piece play.
5.   d2d4
One   of   the   oldest   of   all   openings.
Black’s best continuation (4,<    f6)  was
suggested   by   the   Portuguese  author
Pedro Damiano in  15123 In  the Italian
Game  White  plans  to  rapidly  occupy
the centre  with  c2<3  and d2-d4, with
the    advantage,    compared    to    the
Ponziani  Opening, of  gaming  a  tempo
by attacking  the  bishop on  c5. Indeed,
if   Black   responds   with   the   passive
4,.d6,  after   5,d4   exd4   b.cxdl  Abb
73'13’, White achieves  his strategic ob-
jective of  occupying the centre with  his
d-pawri and e  paw n without having any
effective  pressure  on  them.  Black can
fight against White s plan with two very
different strategic set-ups:

5*   „                  e5xd4
6,   c3xd4          &c5-b4+
and  you reach a crucial position  where
White  has to make a fundamental stra-
tegic  choice:  sacrifice  a  pawn  in  ex-
change for the initiative with  7.#k'3> or
steer  the  game  towards  a  quiet  posi-
tional struggle with 7.Ad 2,

This   is   more   attractive   looking,   but
probably less correct than  7.Adi. It has
a   fascinating    history:   suggested   by
Greco as early as 1619 (J) it was revived
by Stein itz in  his  match  against  Lasker
in 1 896.

the  Lasker  match   mentioned   before,
Steinitz  tried  -  with  little success -  to
breathe new  life into die  Greco Varia-
Hon  by  playing  the  dubious   lO.AaS,
Fortunately   the   renewed  interest   for
this  line  led  to  Mollers  extraordinary
discovery of

as an  alternative  to  recapturing on  c3.
After years of intense theoretical study
the  following  came  to  be  considered
the main line
9.                        Ac3~f6
and   now   Black  closes   foe   e file   by
means of 15,,Jke6  16,dxe6 f6t ± with a
position  that  was  for  years thought  to
be advantageous for Black. However, in
foe in  1 980s there was yet another de-
velopment:  the  discovery  of   l7.Se3f
with  the idea of Uh 3 and a queen check
on  hS, The  resulting  position is not  so
clear. However, White's position contin-
ues to be viewed with some scepticism.

This position is reminiscent of several varia
tons  of  die  Queen’s  Gambit  Accepted.
White  has more  active pieces and a  slight
initiative. Still, the isolated d4-pawn and die
excellent outpost on dS for his knight give
Black adequate resources.

It was only at the beginning of the 20th
century;   when    the    playability    of
5„.&U5!   was   discovered    (as   were
5...b5*? and. 5...4bd41?) that the  popu-
larly of this defence  boomed, as it was
now seen  as an  effective way for  Black
to   fight    for    rhe   initiative.   Indeed,
3...  if6 has currently overtaken 3...AcS
in popularity.
Aga.mst the Two Knights White has fun-
damentally three lines to consider .. ex-
cluding  4. 2c3?l,  which iiites  4...®xe4f
with the idea of...37-35,
A)    4. d2-d3
The  most  solid  and cnnendy  the most
popular  move   It  is  in  line  with  the
modern tendency to play 3.Jlc4 with a
positional  approach. After 4..Jlc5, we
are back in the Giuoco Piano. However,
4...:&e7 is the more popular choice. It is
solid,  even   if  slightly  passive,  and  it
generally  leads  to  positions which  are
strategically similar to the Closed Span-
ish.
B)    4. d2-d4
is  a  natural  response  in  the  centre,  to
which
4. ...       e5xd4
is the best reply You may be wondering
why  3...$Axe4 is valid after  3,d4  in  the
Petr off  Defence,  whereas  in  the  Two
Knights 4...$>xe4? is  considered  to  be
so  bad,  The  answer  is  that  in  the Two
Knights   after   5.dxe5,   White   already
threatens 6,Wd5 with a clear advantage,
whereas   in   the   Petroff   after   4.dxe5 r
Black gains  easy  equality  with  4.. dS
(there is no bishop on c4 to prevent this
move).
This   defence   was    noted    by    the
Abruzzian Giulio Cesare Polerio In the
16ih century, and  discussed  again  by
Giambattista   Loll!   and    Domenico
Lorenzo Ponziani  two  centuries later.
In  the   J 9th  century  it  was  adopted
chiefly  as  a  means  of  avoiding   the
much- feared   consequences   of    the
then   reigning   Evans  Gambit.   Why
was  t(  used,  jus? as  an  expedience  in
the past, given its popularity today? It
should    be   remembered    that    even
though   3..j?)f6  is  the   most  natural
move    (it    attacks   the    unprotected
e4-pawn) J it is in effect a pawn sacri-
fice,., at least  from  the modern view-
point!
4.fig5 dS S.exd5 used to be automati-
cally followed  by 5...®xd5?h fcwf  af  this
point either 6.£jx/7!? (the celebrated Fried
Liver Attack - dss known by the original
Italian name Fegatello Attack), or 6.d4l    f
produces  positions which are undoubtedly
advantageous to W/hic.

Chess  Opening Essen lids       Volume  1
Before examining this line, let s look at
another   surprising   move   available  to
Black; 4_&c5!?
At this point the main move is
5-   „                  /jc6~a5
Also interesting are the Ulvestad Varia -
non   5— bSl?  and  the  Fritz  Variation
5,..$jd4, which often merge at various
stages: the following is a line that exem-
plifies  fee  furious  complications  feat
can arise from  5...$jd4: 6.c3 b-5 7.    fl ■
■&xd5 8.#>4  Wh41? (8 r..$3e6  is  more
solid) 9.£jg3 -S.g4 10.f3 e4*
which delightfully ignores fee attack on
f'7, so as to counterattack fZ This is the
Ikaxler   Variation   (or   Wilkes-Barre
for the Americans), and it dates back to
the   end   of   the   1 9th   century.   After
S.    xf?     .xf24f  Black seems  to  have
sufficient counterplay, even if  a hundred
years of analysis has not  felly explored
the resulting positions. Let s just say that
in  practice it is easier to play the  black
side,  It is  therefore  not  surprising  that
White  prefers  the safer  5,Jtxf7-fe  even
if   after   5„Afc>e7 (threatening   6,..h6)
6-   b3  or  6jkd5, Black receives  a cer-
tain   degree   of   compensation   with
>..Ifef8-Wd8-e8-g6  and   ,,,d7-d6  fol-
lowed  by  „.JLg4,  It  must  be  said  that
White,  in  addition  to  having  an  extra
pawn, should be able to  take advantage
of  the  unhappy  position  of  the  black
king on  e7 if he can  play a  well-timed
c3 and d4. In short, this counterattack is
perhaps not 100% sound, but it is dan-
gerous and greatly feared.
5.   e4xd5
As we  have  already  said,                       gives
White  the  advantage  after  either  6,%yxf7l?
(the Fegatetlo} or 6,d4k
clearing fee diagonal for  fee  f8  bishop
to  exploit  the  uncomfortable  position
of   fee   knight  on   g3:   ll.cxd4  J§Ld6

than ou fB), and now either the classical
13.0  0  or  the  more  recent  J3>«b3i?
J§Lxg34 H.'fedl  seems  to  give  White
the advantage.

For die  pawn  Black lias a  fairly signifi-
cant lead in development and he is ready
to  grab centre  space with  his pawns. If
White   doesn't   want   to   lose   another
tempo after  9.£if3  e4, be  can continue
with   the    unnatural   but    interesting
9    h3,  which  was  played  by Steiaitz,
and   later   by  Fischer  Remember  that
White is a pawn up and  that 9„,    xh3 -
to create bad doubled pawns for White -
removes   the   dynamic   quality   from
Blacks  position.  With  his  bishop  pair
and  the  weak c6  pawn,  White can  look
to  the  future  with  confidence.  Black's
best  option  is  to  ignore  the  4 h3  and
continue development with 9__.Jk5  and
...0-0 t  with good compensation.
The most common 9th move, however,
remains  9.5)f3 and now 9...e4 10.3he S

his  d-pawu  to  d6,  However,  this  puts
White  in  the  most  favourable  position
for expanding in the centre with d4. An
alternative  for  Black in  modem  varia-
dons is to free himself of the annoying
white   bishop   with    ,. ,a6   and   ,., bS,
which is not withom its negative conse-
quences.  It is  important  to  understand
what  the negative positional aspects are
of  this preventive measure, to defend the
eS -pawn with a queenside expansion.

The Ruy Lopez {also called the Spanish
Opening)  is  named  after  the  Spanish
clergyman who in 1561 declared 3.,&b5
to be White’s best 3rd move. In his study
he demonstrated that 3~/£i-ge7, which at
that lime was considered forced (!) Js in
fact unsatisfactory and he recommended
that 2..,d6 be played instead of 2.>J?)c6>
A conclusion  repeated  by  Philidor  two
centuries later? Naturally it  was quickly
understood   that  the  *threat* Jtac6  fob
lowed  by  £lxe5  is  not  real  because of
...Wd41  or  better still ,„Wg5 t  which re-
gains the pawn with an advantage. With
this  information  in  mind,  Black has  a
wide choice of  playable lines.
In this light, it has been correctly noted
that  the  Ruy  Lopez  is  quite  literally  a
’threatening* opening: in  the sense that
White is continually  threatening to ex-
change  on  c6  at  the  most  opportune
moment.
For this reason, at some point Black will
have co defend the efopawn by moving

sitions  would  you  choose?  If  you  see

the opening as a simple  process of  de-
veloping rhe pieces you will choose the
first;   Black  has   gained   space   on   the
queenside and is  ready  to continue de
veloping  with  ...AbZ. However,  this  is
not the best choice! Actually chess ope-
ning  theory assigns co White the advan-
tage in the first position and equal pos-
sibilities for both  players in  the second.
Why?
Because  on  b3  the  bishop  denies  Black
various tactical resources. One example is
that  in  response  to  the  natural  5...J  c5?
there is the very strong 6.&xeS! followed
by a fork, a sequence that is obviously not
available with the bishop on c4.
However,   the    real    problem   is    the
bS  pawn: its presence on drat square fa-
vours   a   White   queenside   attack;   a
timely a2-a4 can  be the  basis for an en-
during   initiative.   This   consideration
could seem esoteric, but for proof  of  its
practical importance look at  the follow-
ing diagram:
Here we  have the  main  line of the Mar-
shall  Attack  (dealt  with  in  more  depth
later) , one of  die most popular and  feared
of  Black s options against  the Ruy Lopez.
Black js a pawn down,  but  he  has a dan
gerous initiative on  the kmgside: Whites
only  resource is  the  advance a2-a4; and
he  hopes  that  energetic  conn ter play  on
the queenside will make it impossible for
Black to realize his aggressive plans on the
other  side  of  the  board.  If  Black could
play the pawn from b5 to b7  (!) his attack
would probably be winning, but alas, this
pawn move is against die rules.

We  will  now  start  to  look  at  specific
variations. After 3<Jslb5 r Black has many
playable moves at his disposal of which
3,„a6  is  by  far  the  most  common. We
will  look  at  that  move  later  Let’s begin
with  the  variations without  3„.a6T in
ascending order of popularity
A)         3.                       d7-d6
With a position similar to the Open Si-
cilian with the difference dial Black has
a  pawn on  c7 instead of on  c6  This re
duces  Black’s  possibilities  of  counter-
play  White has a good  space advantage,
greater control of  the centre and access
to   the   £5 square;   giving   him   good
kingside  prospects.  This  is  not   to  say
that Black s  position is lost, only  that  it
offers no exciting prospects.

The   Steinitz  Defence,  similar   co  the

The Sceinitz is solid, but a little passive.

given  how  natural it is for  Black to play
...J&cS in open  games. However, a natu-
ral move is not necessarily also the best.
Here the problem is evident. By placing
the bishop on this square Black encour-
ages White to occupy the centre with c3
followed by d4. An attentive reader may
well  ask:  "But  doesn’t  the  same  thing
happen  in  the  Italian Game?’. The  an-
swer is that with the white bishop on c.4
instead of bS  there are  two differences:
one strategic and the other tactical Stra-
tegically  the  bishop on  bS  is  applying
pressure on  the c64might; thematically
the idea is to apply pressure on the cen-
tre,  Tactically  in  some  lines  White  has
the extra resource, of  <?3xeS followed by
the fork on d4, a motif that is obviously
not available with the bishop on c4,

Black, in the spirit of the King s Gambit,
immediately      counterattacks      the
e4-pawn, relying on the fact that 4.e.xf5
will  give  him  good  counterphy  after
4...e4.  Radical  attempts,  such  as  4.d4(
have been  used in  an  attempt to refute
the   Jaenisch  Gambit;   they   have  not
borne fruit. In  the end, people realized
that Whites  best  plan  is  simply  to  de-
velop, relying on  the fact that the move
fS is not  a developing move and  that it
also weakens the kingside. In this light

the Ruy Lopez with  3...a6, as there  the
white bishop is on a4. At this point, af-

The queens are exchanged very early on
and    often   quickly   an   endgame   is
reached,  where  White's  superior  pawn
structure is not at all easy to exploit. It is
for this reason that some have christened
it  the   Berlin  Wall!  Il  is  a  consoling
thought that this symbol of die Cold War
now only exists on the chessboard.

we  have a  position  that  is  strategically
reminiscent of  certain sub -variations of
the   Exchange  Variation  of  the  Ruy
Lopez  in  which  the  queens  leave  the
board very quickly. As in  the Exchange
Variation, here  too  the  pawn  ending is
technically  winning  for  White4  given
the   doubled   pawn  on   c6.   However,
Blacks bishop pair and  unhindered de-
velopment  make  Whites  task  of  ex-
changing  ah  the  pieces  very  arduous,
Here too, Black has the added advantage
that the pawn on eS supplies Black with
outposts  on  f4  and  d4.  This  makes  it
easier  to  block Whites  kingside  pawn
majority  Statistically  the  percentage  of
draws is very high  (44%), At the same
time  the  number  of  black  victories  is
obviously well below average.

in some  cases the French, Some  varia-
tions of the Ruy Lopez can also  be rec-
ommended, such as the Jaemsch Gam-
bit, which was examined in the previous
section on die Roy Lopez without 3..,a6_
hi  the  Ruy Lopez with  3...a6  the  most
aggressive option  is  the  Marshall  At-
tack,  but  the  dynamic  possibilities  of
the   Archangel   and  New   Archangel
variations should not be forgotten. Nei-
ther  should  those of several  variations
of  the Open Spanish .
So  now   we   have  the  most  common
move,  3,..a6.  Before  continuing  with
his  development,  Black  prefers  to  re-
serve the option of  pushing the pawn to
b5, so as to rid  himself of the irritating
pressure being applied on the c6-knight
by White's bishop.
The  most  popular  of   the  various  re-
sponses  io  3...ah  is  4,Aa4. This  does
not   mean   that   the   exchange  on   c6,
which  we will  discuss in  the  next sec-
tion,   is   to   be   underestimated,   even
though  it  has been dismissed  by many
as  toothless.  Nonetheless, some  of  the
most famous white victories in the Ruy
Lopez have been  scored  with  this  very
variation,   such   as   those   of   Lasker
against  Ta riasch  and  Capablanca,  and
more  recently  some  brilliant  victories
with  it  by  the  nth  World Champion,
the American Bobby Fischer.
This move is the most popular response
to the Ruy Lopez, even though there are
other valid options, like the Berlin De-
fence.   The   philosophy   behind    rhe
Berlin is  very  hazardous:  I  will  accept
doubled  pawns,  I  will  give  my  oppo-
nent  space  and  a lead  in  development,
but,,,’!’  I have my  bishop pair  and  my
hope is that White s centre will be over-
extended.
The result is a draw rate which is much
higher  than  average, Black players who
want  a  more  ambitious  system  turn  to
more  active defences such  as the Sicil-
ian, the Modern/Pirc, the Alekhine, or

4.&xc6
Before,  castling   had   been  mistakenly
believed   to   be   dubious   because   of
5   Jptg4 (this  move  is  still  played,  but
has  now   been   overshadowed   by  the
classical    5 .. ,f6    and     the    modern
S...Wd6).
Now, castling is  a  move  chat leads  to  a
flexible position. Depending on  the dr
camslances. White keeps  the possibility
of  the d4 pawn advance, with or without
a  preparatory  c2-c3,  or  the  option  of
simply plonking the pawn solidly on d3.
After S.0-0, Black has many playable re-
sponses. If  w e can trust the statistics, the
results with at least five alternative vari-
ations  are  more  or  less  the  same.  We
will ignore the minor lines  that appear
to be of doubtful merit. The following
variations  are   in   ascending  order   of
popularity:
White usually retreats the bishop to a4,
but 4.&xc6, the Exchange Variation, is
also  a  relatively frequent  choice.  After
decades  of  stagnation,  it  became  tele-
bra ted  again through Fischer s success-
ful employment of  it during the 1 960s.
In the new millennium it still has its ad-
herents.  You  may  think   that   Whites
only  winning  strategy  would  be  win-
ning  the  pawn  endings  that  the  varia-
tion    produces.   However,   variations
characterized  by  opposite  castling  are
not rare, and in these cases the predom-
inate concern is the attack on the king.
4.                        d7xc6
Now  taking  ori  eS  is  useless,  as  after
5.,,Wd4,  Black  will  regain   the  pawn
with  an  advantage. In  the  past,  at  this
point either S,d4 or  S.<&c3 was played,
but Fischer s contribution was tn dem
onsnate the power of

Rtiy Lopez — Exchange  Variation
One of the most aggressive defences: it
doses  the  e -hie  so  that  the  queen  can
take on  e4 after  6.    xe5  Wd4. In addi-
tion, the knight is ready to go co the ex-
cellent square g6, or at times toc6,
in the event of 6.®xe5 Wd4 White can
try z.Wh.5?? g6 S.WgS  (also of interest

Black  would   be  in   a  crisis  situation

9.                        £eZg6
and  Black seems  to  have  a  dangerous
initiative. But now it is  time for  White
to play energetically (awid lt}.fexg4? hxg4

6.   d2-d4           e5xd4
7.   Wd1xd4!     f7-f6
8.    Ac1-e3
White has the freer game.
C)         5.   „♦                 >c8-g4
With  this move, White seeks to exploit
his   lead   in   development,  effectively
threatening  to  take  the  bishop  on  g4
(for   example,    1 0...0 -0- 0 ?   11-hxg4
hxg4    1 7.,£)h2    with    the    idea    of
1 3.®xg4+)   or    the    pawn    on    e.5
(]0..,exd4  ll.eSQ  with  optimum  re-
sults for White.
However,  chess   theory   is   constantly
evolving:   the   move                        was
considered to be lacking in the past, but
according to the latest analysis it would
appear   to   give   Black  suffid ent   re-

Now  Black  has  two  equally  effective
plans:
E1)       6.                        Ac8-g4
The classical  approach. Black  tries  to
maintain  the  outpost  on  e5.  Al  this
stage  White  can  choose  to  simplify
with  7.dxe5 t  which  gives -  after  the
queens are exchanged — a minute ad-
vantage,  However,  this  small  plus  is
difficult  to  exploit.  Alternatively,  he
could    continue   more    ambitiously
with
Z    c2-c3
D)         5,                        Wd8~d6
It   seems   unnatural   to   defend    the
e5  pawn  with  rhe queen, bur  in  doing
so  Black prepares for a quick ,,,0-0-0,
and  the results with  this plan appear  to
be encouraging.
An  interesting  way  to  try  and  exploit
the  exposed  position  of  the  queen  on
db is

edge,

Black’s position  is  solid.  He  does  not
need  to fear the weakening of the light
squares,   as   he   is   the   one   with   the
light-squared    bishop.   This   is   why
White usually proceeds with

lieved  — to  support  the  d4  pawn  ad-

tinuations  that  are  of  a  very  different

6,                        Ac8-b7
Tills  variation  has  the  plus  of  forcing
White  to  play He 1 if  he  wishes  to  oc-
cupy the centre with d4. The move 7 x3
is  in  fact  playable, but  it  amounts  to a
gambit.   The   bishop   on   b7   allows
7...$Jxe4! 8.d4  lSa5t  9.Ac 2 exd4! and.
Black's position  seems  to  be  playable.
Therefore,  7.d3  is  often   played.  This
robs die b/bishop of  much of  its effec-
tiveness and avoids a lot of  theory
However, the critical line remains

8.   C2-C3           d7-d6
9,   d2  d4           Ac5-b6
Blacks  most  popular  fourth  move
mains  4....4hffe. After  5.0-0,  (those  of
you who are not crazy about the idea of
having  to  learn  a  lot  of  theory  should
consider 5,d3 or 5.We2) the normal re-
sponse   is   5....S.e7,  or   5...    xe4   (the
Open Spanish), which  we will look  at
soon. However, the immediate 5...b5 is
being played more and more, and after
6 , Ab3 f  6... Ab 7 (the Classical Archan-
gel)  or  6.»Jkc5  (the  New  Archangel).
The  two  variations  are  similar,  in  that
re-
they both aim for more active play even
if  by  nature  this  involves  taking  more
risks  than   with   the  Closed  Spanish.
Both bishop  moves have good and  bad
points, and it is therefore difficult to de-
cide  which of  die  two  is  better: espe-
cially  as  the  two  variations often  cross
paths.
with   great   strategic   tension:  Whites
centre is impressive, but it also runs the
risk  of  collapsing.  The  Abb  increases
Black s pressure on the centre, but at the
same time his kingside is left weakened.

1 4. . ..&e6 (14,.J5 is rather inaccurate because

view of the weak e4-pawn and  his more
active pieces it is safe to say that White’s
two   minor   pieces   are   stronger   than
Black's rook and two pawns.
So  Black is  virtually  forced  to  weaken
his queenside.

represents  one   of   the   most   famous
chapters  in  the  history  of  the  Spanish.
Dr. Siegbert  Tarrasch  dogmatically  de-
clared it to be the only way for Black to
obtain   a   good    position.   However,
though it has always had many support-
ers, the Open Spanish has never been as
papular as the Closed. Its most illustri-
ous modern advocate is the Russo-Swiss
champion Viktor Kortchnoi.

Black   h as   sufficient   counterplay    to
maintain equality
The   black    pawn   on    bS   facilitates
White's opening of the queenside with
a 2 -a 4. The d 4-square is often occupied
by the f3  knight. Generally this is done
after  c3,  Jtcl,  which  puts  the  adver-
sary's   e4-knight   under   pressure,  and
®bd2-b3 in order  to  be able  to recap-
ture on  d4  with  the  knight ors  akerna-
lively  with  the  c3-pawn,  which  fixes
the  weakness  on  c7.  In  addition  the
move       f3-d 4   clears   the    w ay   fo r
White’s kingside pawn majority and rhe
pawn advance f4-fS can be devastating.
Needless to say Black has his resources.
His  pieces  are  active,  the  e5-pawn  is
weak,  and   his  counterplay  against  f2
could become unpleasant, especially af-
ter            which  opens  the  fdile  for  a
rook.  At  this  point  White  can  choose
between    three    main    a her natives:
9.We2, 9.($jbd2, and 9x3.
B)         9.   Sb1 d2
This   is   increasingly   popular:   White
does  not  vacate  the  c2 -square  for  his

ately attacks the outpost on e4,

ered to be
10. ...                  d5-d4I?
even if  in  the  light  of  recent  develop
mems, it  may be  preferable  to play the

this  has  been considered the  best  re-

ceived  its  most   famous  seal  of  ap-
proval  with   Kasparov's  famous  vic-
wry  over  Anand  in  the  1995  World

The  idea  is  to  vacate the  fj-square for
the  while  queen,  with   the  threat  of

and although the earliest games from
this  position seemed  to  suggest  that
Blacks  mass  of  pawns  is  not  suffi-
cient   compensation   for   the   piece,
more  recent  examples  like  Delchev-
Gyimesi,   Nova   Gorica   2004,   and
Mow Black, as is  often  the  case in  the
Spanish, has to decide whether to place
the bishop solidly on e? or aggressively

Rby  Lope/  -   Open Variation
The strange make-up  of  the  opposing
forces is something that you do not see
every   day:   queen   and   three   pawns
against  rook  and  two  bishops. Who  is
better off? This line was first played in
1 942, and no one is really any the wiser
after more than 60 years?
There is an interesting story relating  to
this  variation:  The   theory   until   the
move 1 6...$jg3 was well-established as
early  as 1904  and  many noted  players
(CoIm,   Maroczy,   Tarrasch,   Vidmar)
adopted  it   as  Black.  However,   Isaac
Boleslavsky was  the  first  to  appreciate
the  potential  of  1 7,hxg3,F  (previously
considered  to  be  losing)  followed  by
the queen sacrifice: he played this vari-
ation against Ragozin  in 1942  (1-0)  as
well  as  Botvimimk  in   1943   (Vz-Vz).
Two years later in  J 945, a radio match
was    organized    as    part    of     the
end  of-war   celebrations:   1 0   Soviet
players  against  10  from  the  USA in  a
double-round  march.  The  convincing
win by the Soviets came as a great sur-
prise:   1572-47*,   On    second   board
Vasily Smyslov  found   himself  facing
Samuel  Reshevsky  In  their  first  game
Smyslov   had   the   white   pieces,   and
Reshevsky allowed him  to employ this
very   variation,   which   was   so   well
known  to  the Soviet  players and com-
pletely unknown to  the  Americans, As
a  result  Smyslov  was  able  to  beat  his
formidable   opponent   with    unusual
ease.  This  demonstrates  how   slowly
news of chess developments spread  in
the days before the internet.
It is  understandable  that  White  would
want  to  seek an  advantage  without all
these  fireworks.  With  this  in  mind,  it
may be better to turn to
and   once   again   Black  concedes   rhe
bishop in exchange for die initiative ,
14-                       ,&b6xd4t
At  this  point,  in  the  past  die  critical
variation, which contains an incredible
itidden   Black  sacrifice,  was   15,cxd4

play  actively  threatens  16 ,13.  White

The  question now  is:  how  do  you  de-

Chess  Opening Essentials  -   Volume  1
D)         6,   Wd1-e2
The  so-called  Worrall  Attack.  White
defends e4  with  the queen so  the rook
can  have  the  dl -square,  thus  making
the pawn moves to c3 and d4 more ef-
fective. This  plan  is  highly  logical and
dangerous,   and   Blacks   best   way   to
counter would seem, to be to play in the
spirit of  the Marshall:

tion Deferred  by some. It seems to go
against common sense to take on c6 af-
ter having lost a tempo with the retreat
to a4. However, in comparison with die
exchange  on  the  4th  move,  the  situa-
tion is different
6.                        d7xc6
The knight on  f6 and the bishop on  e7
are  not  particularly  active,  whereas  in
die  normal  Exchange  Variation  these
pieces are  usually developed effectively
by going respectively to g6 via e7 T and
to  d6. The  consequence of  this  is  that
Black also has to lose tempi in order co
harmonize his position.

At this point, 9,exd5 seems to be dangerous
because of  9„d£g4!f  the idea being 10.dxc6

and. after 9...Se 8  lO.&bdl Mf8 ll.Hel
(to make the fl -square available for  the

growing        reputation.       However,
Capablanca met  the  prepared  variation
with   sangfroid.   He   found   the   best
moves  over   rhe  board,  ‘refuting*  the
surprise weapon and winning.
The  refutation  was  so  convincing  that
the   original   move   of   the   American
player  1 L. fefh  has now  been replaced
by   n...c6,  as  suggested   by  the  very
same  Marshall  2.0 years  after  this  lost
encounter!  Almost  one  hundred  years
of  attempting  to  refute   the  Marshall
have not borne fruit. Indeed* the results
of  hundreds of games demonstrate that
die  Marshall  Attack  is  one  of  Black’s
best  systems. Certainly  the  forcing na-
ture of the line, in which a good mem -
ory   is  more  important  than   creative
play, is not  to all black players' tastes. It
also  does  not  appeal  to  some  because
there are various lines in  which White
can  force  an  early  draw,  As  a  conse
quence, this aggressive gambit is ironi-
cally seen  by many  professional  players
as  a  good  way  to  get  a  draw  against
players  of   their  own   strength,   while
preferring   the  Closed   Spanish  when
looking   for    a   win   against   weaker
players.
However,   we   should   take   one   step
back:
With  6.Hel,  White  has  defended  rhe
e4~pawn and  made  the  threat of  &xc6
and then £ixe5 real. Apart from the rare
6.. ,d6,  which  is  along  the  lines of  the
Steinitz Deterred, Black almost  always
proceeds with  6,„b5 r  and  after  7,jfe.b3
he has two possibilities:
1)  To head  into  the so-called  Closed
Spanish  with  ...d6  and  .  0-0  (or  first
...0-0 and then ...d6);
2)  To   continue   ambitiously   after
7...0,0   8x2 -<3*  playing   Frank   Mar-
shall s    idea:    the    aggressive    move
8.. ,d7-d5P,    Black    sacrifices     the
e5-pawn for a strong attack against the
white king. The story goes that Marshall
kept  the  idea  of  this  pawn  sacrifice se-
cret for  years, saving it  up  for a future
encounter  with  Capablanca,  He  played
it against him  (New York 1918)  in  the
hope  of   ruining   the   young   Cubans
101
Chess  Opening  Essentials ..  Volume  1
There  are  many  white  players who  do
not  enjoy  playing against  the  Marshall.
Among these is Garry Kasparov, who af-
ter   7....0-0  always  chose  one   of   the
so-called   Anti-Marshall  lines:   Le   a
variation in which White does not play
8.<;3, and  therefore the ..,dS advance is
less appealing.
The most  traditional Anti-Marshall line
begins  with  8*a4  (even  if  in  the  first
years of the new  millennium there  has
been  a  shift, towards 8.h3     .b7  9,d3),
During die 1990s, the .most popular re-
sponse  to  the  a4  pawn  advance  was
8,.,..id>7 9.d3  d6t  notwithstanding  that
after ICk  bdl!
7.. .0-0, reserving the  possibility of the
Marshall,  and  if   White   plays  unsus-
peering] y  he   can   continue  normally
with 8_d6. If  instead Black prefers the
positions arising  from  the  closed  sys-
tems  and  does  not  like  the  Ami ~Mar-
shall   systems,   he   will   usually   play
7...d6.
Let s see what happens after

Now we have the initial position of the
Marshall Attack,
(Kasparov’s move) White s win rate was
good. However, also  in  this case opin-
ions  have changed, and  the  alternative
move 8..db4l? is becoming more popu-
lar, even if  in  the past it was considered
to be amove of  du bions quality
Another quick look at some of the sub-
tle psychology  that  occurs in  practical
modern  chess: as already stated,  those
intending  to  play  the  Closed  Spanish
can play 7,..df> and 8..0  0 m any order
they  like.  However,  if  Black likes  the
positions   that   arise   by   employing
Anti’Marshall  lines,  he  can  set  off  a
smokescreen    by    beginning    with
The  dS-knight  is en  prize and  needs  to
be   either   moved   or   defended,   after
which  the white  rook  will  be exposed,
which   facilitates   Black's  coumerphy.
When   the   variation   was   first   intro-
duced,  I 1 ...<t)f6 was exclusively played.

Capablanca  over   the   board),   experts
agree chat White has a clear advantage.

sitions  on  which  we  have  yer  to  hear
the   last  word.  However,  the  general
opinion  is  that  the  positions  are  dy-
namically balanced.
Recently, in  the  diagrammed      sition
the move
15, £te1-e4!?
has  become quite  popular. The idea is
to  get  rid  of  the  intruder on  h3  with
the follow-up Hh4. Black prevents this
with
15, ...                  g7-g5!
This pawn cannot be captured. because af-
ter 16    .xg5  Hf5 Blrtck will win one of    the
two u ndefended white  pieces.
16. Wd1-f3        JLc8-f5
The usual follow-up
1t  -                  c7c6
By far the most popular move, and ob-
jectively the best. It has been used since
the  end  of  the  1930s -  after  Marshall
first   played   Ills  attack   it   took   some
twenty  years to  find  die  best  move! In
our age of  the internet and Fritz it could
take as little as 20 minutes!

Black can  either  accept  this  or  refuse
with  17...MP?,  After  either  of  these
options   the   position   is   difficult   to
assess.
Black has  an  obvious initiative against
the  weakened  position  of  the  castled
white king, For years, at this point peo-
ple   have   almost   exclusively   played
15.,   e3  >g4   16.W43  (the  only  op-
tion,  to  be  able  to  return  to  fl   after

some  lines  this  is  a  preparation  for  a
transfer  to  h6  -   18,a4.  White  seeks
coumerplay   on   the   qneenside,   and
now,   after    1 8...bxa4t      1 8...Wh5   or

Marshall   is   alive   and   kicking,   h   is
therefore    fully    understandable    why
many   white   players   try   to   avoid,  it
altogether.

W...C.5     followed by .11...c4, find the bishop on
b3 is captured.
So as not  to lose the bishop, the gambit
continuation   10x3!?  becomes  neces-
sary. It  gives  some  compensation,  but
probably  not enough. Now we can un-
derstand  in  what  sense  8x3   prepares
for d4: it makes the c?.-square available
for the fleeing bishop,
ft                         0-0
Here  White  usually  plays  the  prophy-
lactic  move   9,h3   anticipating   „.&g4
which would indirectly put pressure on
the centre.
It is  worth  mentioning  the  interesting
possibility to get off the beaten path  by
proceeding to a direct occupation of  the
centre with
9.   d2-d4           Ic8-g4
Let’s stop to look at the real reasons for
White’s last move, given  the  worrying
fact that so many opening books do not
explain die  thinking  behind  it. 8,c2-c3
could seem to be preparation for d2-d4.
However, the real reason is highly tacti-
cal. The  most  natural would  appear to
be  the  immediate 8,d2-d4± leaving  the
c:3-square for the knight, but this allows
an    unpleasant    tactical   intermezzo:
8...    xd4 9.    xd4 exd4 W f9xd4??
Thematic.    Black    already    threatens
10.. JL»d3T requiring White to recapture
with  the  g-pawn,  However, White  has
resources  with  which  he  can  liven  up
die game. This can be done in two ways:
A)         10. &c1-e3
defends d4 and keeps the position fluid.
At this point Black concedes the centre,
in order to attack it next with

This is the most solid, and the most popu-
lar move: White wishes to prevent ....  gl-
and   postpones  d2-d4   to  Ore  following
move.  This  is  the  initial  position  of  the
Cosed Spanish, the most popular system
of  all  the  open  games  and  a  chapter  of
fundamental importance in the history of
chess openings. The number of  arrows in
the  diagram  shows  the  unusually  high
number of  moves which can be played by
Black, which is testimony to how flexible
his  position  is. The  subsequent  game  is
usually characterized  by heavy manoeuv-
ring,  with  possible  complications  being
played  out  at  a  later  stage  in  the  game.
Now we  will have a quick  look ar Black s
options,  in  ascending order  of  popular-
ity:
A)         9.                         Wd8d7
The  position is  fluid  and  complex and
provides both players with possibilities.
B)         10. d4-d5
A  move  typical  of   the  Ruy  Lopez.  It
gains space and closes the centre, giving
Black a free hand on  the flanks.
10. ...                   £c6~a5
11.  5Lb3-c2
1 I„.c6! is a  pawn  move  of  fundamental
theoretical   importance,   White   cannot
support die pawn chain with c3-c4t as he
can  in  other  variations, and  must  there
tore   take   on   c.6,   After   H.hSf    $x8!
1 3,dxc6 Wc7  1  4.&bd2 Wxc6Tplay is dy-

position that is rich in opportunities for
both sides.

The   threatened   fork    by   the   pawn
obliges Black to exchange:
10* **.                 >e6xb3
11,  ®d1xb3
The  ambitious 1 1 axb3  is also  playable
because,  after   Il,„exd4  1 Z,cxd4,  the
badly  placed  pawn  on  b3  is  co m pen
sated  for  by Whites  piece activity and
occupation of  the centre.

Indeed, after 12,„exd4?! 13xxd4
Keres’s interesting idea: by  putting d4
under  pressure, you  prevent the  natural
4)bd2  because  the  d4-pawn would  be
left  undefended. However,  Black's  two
last   moves   were   non -developing   and
White  profits  from  this  with  the  the-
matic
11. a2a4           Ac8-b7

highlighting  the  Achilles' heel  of  many
Buy Lopez variations: the bS-pawn.
Ac this point Black usually responds with
12.                      e5xd4l?
13. c3xd4           £f8-e8
but  if the  truth be cold, White’s mobile
centre seems  to  be  more  of  a  strength
than a weakness.

We  have  a  post lion  reminiscent of  the
Chigorip Variation  (9,,,£?a5     see Vari-
ation T further on)  with  the usual slight
advantage   for   White.  Sometimes   the
knight goes  to b6 with  14...4k:4  l$.b3
£jb6,  which  controls  a 4  and  dS.  The
knight  is  certainly  better  placed  on  b6
than  on  aS,  However,  also  in  this  case
White has the freer position.

must  return  the  rook   to  fK  with  the
tacit  idea  of  a  draw  by  repetition  after

Here,  White  can  choose  between  two
very different plans:
G1)       12. &b3-c2
This  leads  to  strategically  and  tactically
complex  positions. White 5 centre, will
collapse, after which  the b7-bishop be-
comes active and  Black s mass of centre
pawns can begin to march down.
Blacks problem is the  safety of  his king:
The  manoeuvre £Mi2-g4,  the  Ha3  ready
to  slide  over  to  f3  or  g3T  and  the  two
white  bishops bearing down  on  the cas-
tled  black  king  are  ingredients for  truly
exciting play Some  of  the  best  examples
are    to    be    found    in    the    historic
Kasparov Karpov  matches. We are  yet to
hear the last word on. these variations, but
on the whole the results favour White.
H)         9.   ...                     c6-b8
The renowned Breyer Variation, which
was  advocated  almost  a  hundred  years
ago  by  the  strong  Hungarian  player of
the same name.
The positional approach. White defends
the   e4-pawm  but   above   all   prepares
d4-d5  followed by  b2’b3 and  cScl,  to
keep  the  pawn  chain  intact  when  Black
attacks its head with ...c6.

14. b2-b3           c7-c6
15. c3-c4            £b8-d7
Blacks  position is  solid, even  if  White
can patiently try to exploit his space ad-
vantage.

Ruy               — Closed  Van tin on

o
With  this  paradoxical  move  Black  in-
tends  to  regroup  his  pieces  more  har-
moniously The knight is heading for d7
to  give  support to  the  eS-pawn and  if
the bishop is developed to b7 , it will be
immediately   active,   furthermore,  the
way is cleared for the c-pawn.
Breyer’s move  is not  as  popular now  as
it was in  the  1 9 70s, when it was  played
at   the   highest   level   by   the   likes   of
Spassky and Karpov. However, it still has
its  supporters:  Kramnik,  Beliavsky  and
Mamedyarov,  just  to  name  some  nota-
ble advocates.

13. Cjd241
It  is  worth  noting  that  13,b3P  is  be-
coming  increasingly  popular,  with  the
idea of playing d4-d5 and c3~c4.
White  has  some  possibilities for  taking
the  initiative on  the  kingside,  and  also
at limes on the queenside with Sa3  and
Seal . That said, Black’s position is both
solid  and  flexible  and  tournament  re-
sults   have   been   satisfactory   for   the
second player
The  Chigorin  Variation,  which  is  the
oldest, and over  the  years also the most
popular line,  However, it  is  not  neces-
sarily  the  best.  Black  immediately  be-
gins to £)ecome active on  the queenside,
which would appear to be the most nat-
ural plan. But on aS, the knight remains
sidelined  for  a  while  and  more  often
than  not  Black’s pieces are  less  harmo-
niously  coordinated  in  comparison  to
other variations of  the Closed Spanish.

Now we enter  the blood-stained battie
ground of  the sceptics who have dared
to challenge the sanctity  of  established
theory A word of warning: these minor
defences  should  not   be  taken  lightly
This is a lesson learnt the hard way by a
World Champion, Anatoly Karpov, in a
game  against   the  late  Tony  Miles  in
1980, The English grandmaster was an
aficionado of  minor systems, and to the
dismay of  Karpov as well as purists tile
world   over,  he   won   their   encounter
using the following minor defence:
White has good prospects in die centre.
In  addition,  with   the   pawn  advance
a2-a4, there are also attacking possibili-
ties on  the quecnside. However, the so-
lidity of Black s position should not  be
underestimated.
Even more provocative is Basman’s idea

called   an   "extended   fianchettoh   In
general  it   pays  not   to   be  dogmatic.
However, the lost tempo and, more im-
portantly, the weakening of  the kingside
seems   to   be  a   bit   beyond   the   pale.
Therefore,  with  correct  play  these de-
fects  should  guarantee  White  a  clear
advantage.

The most  respectable of  the minor sys-
terns   is    L..4hc6,   This   defence   was
championed    by    the    great    Aaron
Nmizowitsch,   and    thus   carries   his
name, Its ambitious objective is to apply
pressure  to  White’s  d4-pawn t    but  in
practice   this   doesn’t   usually   happen.
Placing  the  two  centre  pawns  Side by
side is  the  most  natural and ambitious
response for White,
2.   d2d4
You can also come across 2.$lf3, which
gives Black the  opportunity  to ‘repent’
and  to  transpose  to  a  more  common
member   of   the   Open   Games   with
2,,,e5. However, the type of  player who
opts for  L,3&c6 is not likely to enjoy a
mainstream opening, and will therefore
probably go for 2. .d6 or 2...d5.
The orthodox continuation is
2*  w                          d7*d5
You should note that 2,..e5t? is increas-
ingly  being  played, nowadays, but  after

It is still true that advancing his pawn to
d4  gives  White  a  certain  central  pre-
dominance, at  least  in  terms  of  space,
with  greater  piece  activity  as a  conse-
quence. It is no  surprise that  you  have
the   same   pawn   structure   as   in   the
Caro-Kann and  the  Rubinstein Varia-
tion  of  the  French  -   which  are  both

ambitious   to   be   realistic.   Another
choice is 5„ Jkg4 or S,,,AfS.
5.                        C7-C6
As with rhe Petroff  Defence, here 1$ an-
other  case of  recent  re-evaluation. The
move   ,,.d7-d5   is   the   typical  freeing
move  in  many  defences;  just  think  of
some of the examples from the Sicilian
or   the   Ruy   Lopez,   Here,   however,
tilings are not so simple: after J .exdS, if
Black takes back with  the queen  he re-
mains behind in development. If, on die
other  hand,  he  plays  2„J&f6  so  as  to
take on dS  with  the knight; after  3.d4,
White gets a nice centre with prospects
of  further  expansion  with   c2-c4.  At
least, that is what opening manuals have
blindly repeated for years and years.
However,  recent  practice  has  demon-
strated that this assessment is a little su-
perficial and that  there are structural el-
ements present which are favourable for
Black: to start with, Black frees himself
of    the    irritating    presence    of    the
e4-pawn,  which  in  King’s Pawn ope-
nings  lays die  foundation  for  kingside
attacks.  In   addition,  we   have  a   4:3
122.
Scandinavian  Defence
Despite   Whites   possession   of    the
bishop   pair   and   a   space   advantage,
Black's  position  is  solid  and  well  de-
fended, and  it is  therefore not surpris-
ing that this line is becoming more and
more popular among players who don’t
want  to  be  overwhelmed  by  the  ava-
lanche  of  theoretical  possibilities  that
awaits  them in  mote  mainstream ope-
nings in this computer age.
This   waiting  move   is  generally   pre-
ferred. It reserves the options of  moving
the  queens   bishop  to  fS  or   g4  and
opens  an  escape  rente  for  the  queen.
The position is now practically that of  a
Caro-Karan where  Black has lost some
tempi, and  he will  lose another with  a
further queen move. On the other hand,
White’s  knight  is  more  passive on  c3
than on e4, Moreover, by following this
virtually   forced   sequence   Black   has
avoided  the dangerous Advance Varia-
tion of  the Caro-Kann,

If  Black does  not  wish  to  expose  the
queen, he may prefer:

This is the Four Pawns Attack, unques -
tionably    the    critical    line    of    the
Alekhine, at least in terms of  the philos
ophy  behind  strategic  theory  It should
be noted  that instead of supporting the
centre  with  the  bpawn, it  has  recently
become   very   popular   for   White   to
adopt   the   quiet  alternative   S,exd6’?s
contenting  himself  with  greater  piece
mobility and a slight space advantage.
But let’s return to 5 f4, How do we eval-
uate such a position? Is White, with his
imposing centre, ready to start a mating
attack? Or is his centre a house of cards
that  is  about  to  collapse?  In  practice,
both  of' these  events  occur,  and  this is
why we are looking at some of  the most
complex   and   exciting   variations   in
opening literature.
Usually Black aims to put d 4 under im-
mediate pressure with
5. m             d6xe5
However,  5,..g6l?  or                are  both
also possible.

Z  &c1-e3f
I/7.fe/3? ,&g4, White's centre is in crisis.
This  is  one  of  the  most  theoretically
revolutionary openings in the history of
the  game,  First  made  famous  by  the
later World Champion Alexander Alek-
hine in  1921, it  is  based on  a startling
concept, which at the time bordered on
heresy: to provoke White to advance his
pawns in an attempt to prove that these
advanced  centre  pawns  are  in  fact  a
weakness rather than a strength,

compensate for the doubled pawns,

The  attack on White s pawn centre  be-
gins,   After     .dxeS   and   ...fee 6,   the
d4-pawn   becomes   the   target,   Now
White must decide whether to gain fur-
ther space in the centre or content him-
self  with a quieter approach.

that the percentage of  d raws in these lines
is very low. Nonetheless, years of  practical
experience, as well  as statistics  produced
by hundreds of  games, show  that White
wins more or less the same percentage of
games  as  he  would  by  employing  any
other opening Therefore, the Four Pawns

This is known  as  the  A l hurt Variation.
Tills  line  was  very   fashionable  in  the
1980s following its adoption by Fischer

White  lias a good  space advantage and
seems  to  have easy attacking possibili-
ties on  the kingside. However, the dou-

to break with f4-f5, and Black s position

the first move) and ...J&g7. He can push
his pawns  to eS or  to c:5 t  or  otherwise
to c6-bS or  a6-b5. Black may decide to
develop  the  b8  knight  to  d7  or  to  c6,
and the gS-knight to f6 or e7. White is
not  urgently required to defend e4 as in
the  Pirc,  and  therefore,  he  too  has  a
wide variety  of  approaches available to
him.
As a result of all this, it is very difficult
to  systematically  examine  this  chame-
leonic defence.

Now  White  can  play  3x4,  which  we
will  discuss  in  the  second  volume  of
this series. However, .it is more common
toplay 3.fef3 or 3 AV3.
The  development of  the  bishop on  g7      A)
and  the  pawn move  to d6 h signify  that
this is a close relative of the Pirc. How-
ever, die  difference is that in  the .Mod-
ern  the  knight  is  absent  from  fb,  or  it
develops to  this square later  on. When
White pushes his pawn to c4, the game
resembles  the Queen’s Pawn Opening:
in  other  cases  it  remains  more  in  the
realm of  the semi-open games.
Here  we  have  a  very  elastic  defence.
Black almost  ignores what  White  does
and develops cm his own account with a
wide number of  plans  to choose from.
This  makes  the  Modern  an  ideal  de-
fence  for  those  among  you  that  donk
want  a system  for  which  you  need  to
learn  a  lot  of  established  theory.  Black
sometimes  chooses  not   to   make   the
classical  pawn  move   ...db,  preferring
instead to sec up a Modern /Caro“Kann
hybrid with pawns on c6 and dS.
However,  usually   Black does  proceed

The  advance  of  the  opawn.  often  al-
ready  played  on  the  3rd  move,  is  an
option  not  available in  the  Pirc: White
supports  the  centre and  takes  the  bite
out  of  a  possible  ...b7-b5.  However,
this   is   not   a   developing   move   and
White must content himself  with a mi-
nuscule advantage in  the centre. How-
ever, for  players who enjoy a slow ma-

pones castling short, which could lead
to a re -entry in the Pirc, This  would not
be a  bad thing, if  it did not  give Wliite

Now Black can play
4.   ...                  a7-a6
or
4.   ...                  C7-C6
or otherwise transpose to the Pirc with
4.   ...                  £g8-f6
White   preserves  the  small  advantage
that is his birthright . but Black does not
have   to   deal   with   any   immediate
threats.  In   these   variations,  more   so
than in  the  others, the  player with  the
better   strategic   skill,  will   win.   Not
counting tactical mishap along the way,
of course.

If  Black now  takes on d4, he allows his
opponent   active   piece   play.  If  Black
plays  mechanically  White  obtains  an
unpleasant  initiative  with  moves  such
as 0-0 and fM4. Therefore this is a po-
sition  which  inspires  differing  assess-
ment     depending  on  the  taste  of  the
commentator    and     ranging    from
equality to a small advantage for White.

The  Pirc  Defence  is  named  after  the
strong  Yugoslav player  Vasja Pirc,  who
was born  in  the  early  pan  of  the  20th
century; and  it  is  characterized  by  the
kingside fianchetto. However, first Black
plays  L,.d6  to  prevent e4-e5 b and  then
2.„£jf6  provoking  3.£k3,  in  doing  so
preventing  While  from  playing  c2-c4,
entering into the  King's Indian. This is
not to suggest that the Pirc has proved it-
self  to  be superior  to  the King s Indian:
as always, it is simply a matter of  taste.
It  should  be  said  that  White  can  also
choose  not  to  play 3.£jc3, and  instead
go  for  313  or   3.   d3.   In  both  these
cases Black can decide not  to franc het to
his  fl?-bishop  and  instead  respond  in
the centre with 3,. re5, creating a differ-
ent type of  game. As in the Modern De-
fence,  Black  concedes  the   centre   in
hopes of undermining it at a later stage.
Therefore  this  is an  ambitious defence

lines of  the 4.A>e3 variation, Otherwise,
he can  continue with  fl 41,  aiming  to
play  an  Austrian  Attack,  but  with  the
bishop on  g5, given the pressure it ap-
plies on  e7,  the e4~e5 advance is more
effective. On the other hand, this takes a
tempo,  and  it  is  not  clear  if  all  (his  is
worth it,
Black, who may not appreciate rhe pres-
ence of  the bishop on  gS, can  give it a
kick with ,,,h6, and if  he chooses, elim-
inate  it  with  the  common  manoeuvre
,,,g5  and  ...£46-h5xg3, However, here
it is not dear  either if this is positive or
negative,  given  die  lost  tempi  and  the
weaknesses on the kingside,

Black immediately  begins  a  counterat-
tack on  the  queenside, It is difficult  to

The   famous   Austrian  Attack’s  great
popularity began in the  I 950s and grad
ually became the most frequently played
variation against the Pirc until die 1990s.
White  develops  his   pieces   (<&f3 and
Ad 3)  behind  a  central expansion „ pre-
paring for  a future assault  on  the  black
king,   which  is  generally  initiated   by
pushing the pawn to eS at an opportune
moment.  This  plan  is  very  dangerous
and Black must  respond  by advancing a
pawn to eS or cS; either immediately or
after suitable preparation,

Now Black can counterattack the centre
(with  ...c5) t   or  otherwise  make  non-
committal moves.
The idea is that if White opts for  Ah6,
Black will not waste a tempo, as he  has
not  played  ...Ag7. The  resulting  posi-
tions  are  complicated  and   they  offer
both sides chances.

Now  White  can  either  take  with  the

and in the event of  ed-eT it enables the

be premature. 6,Ae3 -  which  prepares

5,.&e3 is  also  popular. The  latter  tends
to lead  to the 4,&e3 variation  if While
continues  with  Wd2.  However,  a  spe-
cific line exists in which White chooses
a solid  plan  that starts with  h2-h3, An
example is the variation 5,..c6 6.h3 0-0
7.a4 febd?  (7,..d.S!? loses a tempo, but
it is interesting as it aims to take advan-
tage of  White s non -developing moves)

queenside initiative,
5.                        0  0
6.   0-0
We have reached the key position of  the
Classical Pirc,
various  strategic  plans.  These  gener
ally involve putting White's centre un-
der   pressure,  either  with  ....ig4  and
,..    c6,   or   more   directly   with   the
pawn  advance  ...c7-c5.  Alternatively,
Black   can   search   for   play   on   the
queenside  with  ...c6.  The  variations
below  are  indicative  for  each  of  the
three different approaches.
E1)       6.   ...                  c7-c5

The old  main line 8.Wd2  is a little out

White anything special,

is the most  popular. White can prepare
the   pawn   push   e4~e.S with   7Jh3  or
7.& 1 , but he usually proceeds with
7.   a2-a4
which  prevents  bS, and  White also has
a4-a5 in  mind. The aim is to take away
all of  Blacks manoeuvring space on  the
queenside.
In view of  this, Black plays
7.   ...                  a7-a5
8.   h2-h3           £b8-a6
9.   JLc1-e3       £ia6-b4
Now White can either  prepare the f2-f4
advance  with  l(k4bd2T or  develop  nor-
mally with  10.Wd2  and  11.Sad]  with
that  small  advantage  which  is  always
nice  to  have,  but  against  correct  play
doesnot guarantee anything substantia).
Black could  react  with  ...d7 -dS h  to ex-
change  off  the  e4“pawn and  make  the
f.5-square available for the bishop on c8.

Caro-Kahn Defence
m*M«7-c8
tected. And if we look a little closer, we
notice  that  the e4-pawn is the strategic
linchpin  around  wliich  ah  semi-open
openings are based. Let’s have a look at
the various starting positions,
•  in di&Aiekhine:
When  Nimzowitsch  wrote  during  the
1920s  that  the  Caro  Kann  Defence  is
the  refutation  of   Le4,  he  was  either
kidding  or  he  just  wanted  to  stir  the
stagnant   waters   of   a  theoretical   ap-
proach that resisted all attempts at inno-
vation  under  the  banner  of  Tarrase h’s
rigid     and      dogmatic     principles.
Nimzowitsch knew that  h  you want  to
rock  the  boat  you  need  to  exaggerate
somewhat.
The  proof  that  Nimzowitsch  did   not
fully   believe   his   pronouncement   is
demonstrated by the fact that he contin-
ued playing 1 ,e4 on a fairly regular ba-
sis  after  making  this  remark’ What  be
redly  meant  was  that  it  isn’t  compel
sory to answer  I ,e4 with 1   eS and that
there   are   many   potential   strategies
available      besides      pure      frontal
opposition   based    on    simple   space
control.
In this sense  1 ,.x6  is conceptually very
ambitious. The e4-pawn, unlike its col-
league  to  the immediate left, is  unpro-
with   L„£if6 d  the  e 4-pawn  is  attacked
immediately, but this leaves White with
a sound space advantage;
•  in (he Scandinavian :
with  U.d.S, Black immediately wants to
exchange his d-pawn and create a pawn
majority on  the kingside, but  hi doing
so he will either lag behind in develop-
ment  (Z.exdS WxdS  3,<5k3) or, in  the
line  Z.exdS Sf6  3,d4 T'udS 4x4  4ib6t
his  knight  on  b6  is  far  removed  from
the action;
144
Curo-KanD Defence
•  in the f  rench Defence:
after  L.x.S, Black prevents the two cen-
tral  pawns  from  standing  side  by side,
usually  attacking  the  e4-pawn  on  his
fourth, move (3.d4 cxd4  4,<&xd4 4if6) T
bur  often  at  the  expense  of  his  own
kings safety.
after  L..e.6 h  the  e4~pawn 1$ threatened
on the second move when Black contin-
ues  with  2,,,d5, However,  now  White
often advances the pawn to eS T keeping
the centre closed. In the Closed French,
it  is  a  good  thing  that  the  c8 -bishop
cannot speak, as it  has plenty to grum
b.k. about;
Presented  in  this light, the Caro-Kann
appears to be a perfect defence,
2>  d2-d4           d7-d5
♦  in the Pirc Defence:
Here White s options are limited by the
fact that the e4 -pawn is threatened. The
exchange 3,exd$ is excellent for White
in  the Scandinavian. In  the Caro-Kann,
after  3,„cxdS  Black achieves  a  central
pawn majority.
As for 3,e5, k  gains space, but unlike in
the Advance Variation of the French the
c 8’bish op   has   nothing   to   cornplain
about  here and  it can  go straight to fS.
The  remaining  option is to  defend  the
with  the  move   l...d6,  Black  prevents
the advance of the. e-pawn’s to e 5 in or-
der  to attack it on  his second move. But
the  drawback   of   this  system   is   that
White can successfully maintain his two
central  pawns  side  by  side  on  e4  and
d.4;
♦  in t he Sicilian Defence:
145
Chess  Opening  Essen Hals  -   Vohme   I
pawn  with  3.Sc 3  or  with  3.Sd2  and
after  3,,,dxe4  4,£bce4, Black  can  safely
continue his development, attacking the
unprotected knight on  e4 with  4...&f5,
or with 4„.Sd7 followed by 5,..Sgf6.
In real life, things are not so simple: in the
first place  3,e.5 and  3,exdS, even consid-
ering   die   previously   discussed   limita-
tions, do not  allow Black to  take equality
for   granted,  Furthermore,  in   the  main
line,   even   though   the   absence   of   the
e-pawn  takes  some  of  the  sting  out  of
White 5 play it is also true dut  m the en-
suing  long  positional  battle  White  ob-
tains  a  spatial  advantage  anyhow,  and  a
comfortable  position, This  might  not  be
so easy to convert into a win, but it is also
true that the risks of losing are minimal.
As a result, the Caro-Kann  has gained a
reputation as a very solid  defence suit
able  for  positional  players.  All  this  is
true,   but   beware   if   your   opponent
chooses 3.e5,  the  Advance  Variation  —
in   particular  if   he   replies   to   3,.,A,f5
with  the aggressive 4.4bc 3.

Compared  to  the  similar  line  in   die
Panov-Botvinnik  Attack,  White,  in-

nings, even if they are  nor part  of your
repertoire. For as much  as  we  study  or
prepare  for  a  particular  type  of  game,
sooner  or  ter   we  will  be  confronted,
with   unpredictable   and   ever-changing
situations  winch. require us  to  think  for
ourselves. Specialized preparation  is  all
very hue, but by cultivating a more gen-
eral awareness we  develop mental, 'elas-
ticity*, which  is a  fundamental  require-
ment for a good chess player.
Once  we admit that it is impossible to
know  everything about  everything, we
can   reach  a  suitable   compromise   by
learning  a  little  about  everything,  and
everything about a little.
A2)       5.   ...                  &f6xd5
hi order  to avoid  the  risk  of  not  being
able  to  recoup the  pawn, Black usually
captures on d5 right away.

ceptedl  In  addition,  from  the  Panov-
Botvinnik  Attack  we  may  transpose  to
the Nim zo-Ind ian.
AB of  this should suffice to convince us
tliat opening  theory is a coherent whole
and not a group of  segmented compart-
ments, as is commonly  believed. It is for
this reason  that, in  order  to  have a  hill
grasp of  what you are doing, you should
have  a  general  understanding  of  ope-
This is a typical move in  the King’s In-
dian  Attack, and  it  is  playable against
the French Defence and  some  Hues of
the Sicilian. But more frequently it fea-
tures in   I,4bf3  followed  by a  kingside
fianchetto and e4: therefore we re  talk-
ing about a King’s Indian with an extra
tempo, and hence the name.

Wince's  2nd   and   3rd   moves  can,  of
course,  be  played in  reverse order. The

So  we  have  finally  come  to  the  most

White must decide what to do about his
e  pawn.   Ignoring   the   curious   3.f3
which, by the way, is not to be underes-
timated, he has three choices:
1)  advance it: the Advance Variation;
2)   exchange  it:  the  Exchange  Varia-
tion and the Panov-Botvinnik Attack;
3)  defend it: the Main line.

For  decades,   opening   manuals   have
pronounced that Black is in effect phy
ing an improved version of  the French,
with  the  bishop  on  ft   instead  of  c8.
However, this has been revealed to be a
somewhat  blinkered  analysis,  Recently
we have come to realize that the loss of
two tempi  (.,,c6-c5 and  indeed ,„JiLf5)
make it possible for White to develop a
small   but  unpleasant  initiative  which
has produced encouraging results.
After 3 ,eS , the immediate
3.  ...                 >cB-f5
is the most natural, but 3..,c.5l? t  a use-
ful   move   for   players   who   wish   to
avoid  a  lot  of  theory, could  also  be  a
good  idea:  compared  to  the  French,
Black has lost a tempo, but  his  poten-
tially  bad  bishop  can  still  be  devel-
oped   to   fS   or   g4.   However,   after
4,dxc5! “ an ugly  but effective move “
Black has difficulty  winning  back  the
pawn  and  the  results are  sufficiently
in White s favour.
B)        4,   h2“h4l?
Lets return  to 3:.-,Af5. Now White can
play several moves.                                        With this poisonous move, White gains
space on  the  kings!de  and  threatens to
seriously  harass die  f5-bishop, Indeed,
die natural 4..e6?? loses the bishop after
g2  g4,  fZ f3  and  h4  h5.  After  4...h6
S.g4,  if  Black continues  with  the  nor-
mal-looking 5...A&7?/ (5   +jLd7! is the
right move), White obtains optimal  play on
the light squares with 6,e6!fre6 7.A43.

Car# ■■•Kann -   Advance  Variation
Black s most common move is
4.   ..                  h7’h5
and now it is not clear which of  the two
h- pawns  is  the  weaker.  At  this  point
White responds with the committal
5.   c2-c4!?
This  aggressive  move  allows  White  to
control e4f  reserving g2~g4 for a better
moment later on.
At  this  stage,  ah  sorts  of  moves  have
been   tried t     among   which   4,,,®d7,
4,..hS,  4,.,Wb6 +  and  recently  also  the
interesting   4,.,a6.  However,  the  most
popular move by far .is still
4,                        e7-e6
5*   g2-g4
Now yesf
5,                        &f5-g6
6,   &5g1-e2t
which is considered to be much  better
if  played at this point than on  the move
before,  because  White  has  more  com-
fortable access to the gS-square.
If  Black now  takes on c4, be gains con-
trol  of  the  key  d5-square,  but  at  the
same  time  he  gives  White  the  impor-
tant  e4 square.  If Black dithers,  White
will   have  the   usual  initiative  on   the
queens!de.   White's   results   are   fairly
good and it is strange tliat this variation
is   not   played   mom   often,  especially
considering that  there is not  too  much
theory to study.
White  seeks  to  liarass  the  gh-bishop
with $lf4 and/or h2-h4, However, this
takes several tempi  and  Black responds
thematically in the centre:
6.                        c6-c5
In  order  to  dissuade  White  from  the
idea of ®f4. 6,„®e7 and 6.,.fb are also
playable,
Z    h24i4
7,.$,e31? with  the  idea  of  8,dxc5  con-
tains a drop of poison  too, but the text
move  is  more   common.  Now  Black
gives  the bishop some  breathing space
by   advancing   his    h-pawn ,   or    by
capturing on d4. To give you an idea of
the  complexity  of  the  variations  that
ensue,  you  only  need  to  look  at  this
line:

Speaking of uncharted  waters, this was
played in  2002  by Garry  Kasparov. His
distinguished patronage is reason in it-
self to take this strange move seriously
Predictably  in  the  following  years  this
variation  became  very  fashionable  and
many of  the top players in the world are
now   exploring   its  deeper   mysteries,
Tile idea of 4 J&.e3 is to defend  h2 with
5?Wcl  if Black plays 4„,Wh6; die sec-
ond  idea  is  to  make  the  freeing  pawn
advance ...c6’C5 more difficult if Black
prepares for this with 4, .eh.

Who  is  better off?  It  is  difficult  to  say
Results   are   similar    to   those   of   die
Queen's Gambit White has  the slightly
better  statistical  performance  that  is  his
colour s privilege. Strategically it is as if
Black   has    played    „.Ac7-£5xd4   and
White has recaptured with  the e3-pawn.
It is true  dial the     cS advance is a free-
ing   move   in   many   variations  of   the
Queen s Gambit, but. it  is also  true  that
Black is in no hurry to take on d4, which
would facilitate White's development, in
particular of  the  bishop on c L This sub-
tle delaying strategy is common in many
lints of the Rubinstein Variation (4x3)
of  the  Nimzo-Indian  Defence,  which
we will look at in  the next volume < It is,
therefore,   no   surprise   that   there   are
many       transpositions      from       the
Panov-Botvinnik  Attack  to  the  Nimzo-
Indian when Black plays    jLb4 .
As said, a common transposition is to die
Semi-Tairasch ( 1 ,d4 d5 2x4 eh  3,(?jf3 d5
4.4k3 c5) f  but  this depends on  the will-
ingness  of  the   players  to  cooperate,  as
there  are  many  lines  here  that  preserve
die characteristics of die Panov-Botvinnik
Attack  -   in  which  White  advances  the
pawn to c.5, or Slack plays ,..Ag4.
4.                        feg846
5.   £ib1-c3
Here Black has three, options:
3.   e4xd5          c6xd5
No  one  ever  seems  to  think  of  it,  but
3..,WxdS  is  also  playable,  transposing
to the Scandinavian.
Recapturing   with   the   c-pawn   usually
leads  to  the  Panov- Botvinnik  Attack.
However, we would like to make note of
the  move  which  helped  Fischer  obtain
his  famous  victory against  Petrosian  in
the  USSR vs Rest of  die World  match  in
1970:  4„&d3,  the  so-called   Exchange
Variation, White prevents 4,>..&f5, After

Black    can    maintain   equality   with
7.. >d7  t 7.,,#c8, or also with 7-     aS.
4.   c2-c4
This   introduces   the   Panov  Botvinnik
Attack,  The  diagrammed  position  has
the characteristics of  a Queens Gambit,
with   the   difference   that   there   is   no
black  pawn  on  c7  and  no  white  pawn
one2.

Black  can   respond  to  this  direct  ap-

Bronstein /Larsen Variation T after  two
of its most illustrious exponents .. it is
no coincidence that  both players are as-
sociated with daring and creative chess.
Black enjoys  better  control  of  the  cen-
tre, he has his eye on  die g~fileT and  in
some variations he succeeds in  advanc-
ing his e~pawn to e.S. Black will usually
develop the c8-bishop to f5  or, less of-
ten, to g4; the knight goes co d7 and the
queen is moved to c7 or aS,
However, Black’s real problem is not his
pawn  structure     the  active  placement
of his pieces makes this academic -  but
the much  more urgent dilemma of  his

the  g7 -pawn  seems  unsafe;  and  after
Black castles  queenside,  White’s  pawn
advance  there  should  be  quicker  than

keeping   with   Nimzowitsch $  style  of

Now  White  has  to  decide  what  to  do
with  his knight on  el  in  the  next  two
moves. Practice has shown  that  neither
to defend it t  nor to exchange it with the
one  on  f'6, nor  to  move it  to g3,  gives
White any serious opportunities to gain
an advantage.
Strangely the best square has proven to

there  either  immediately  or  after  the
preliminary 5,&c4. Black cannot try  to
rid   himself   of   the  knights  ominous

ier  for  White  to  open  the  g-file  after
short  cashing     after  which  tire game
turns  into  a  slow  positional  struggle,
typical of  many  variations of the  Caro-
Kann. White has slightly more possibil-
ities  thanks  to  his space advantage,  but
Black's  position  is  solid  and  without
weaknesses.
Classical Variation
C)       4*                    &c845
This is the old  main  line. It suffered  a
slump  in  popularity  at  the  end  of  the
20th century because of the success of
the Smyslov Variation. However, in  the
first years of the new millennium it has
become   more   and   more   fashionable
again.  In  the  age of  the. computer and
the  Internet, in  which  new  moves are
available within seconds of  being made,
the  following  phenomenon  turns  up:
during   an   important  game   a  strong
player   employs   a   new   variation,  or
dusts  oft  a  forgotten one;  the  game  is
subsequently   discussed   and   analysed
around the world; other new moves are
proposed  and  discovered;  lower-rated
players  imitate  the  stronger  players by
using  the  variation in question; and in
no  time  at  all there  is such  a  big  data-
base  of  games  available that  it  is  very
difficult  to  surprise  your  opponent  ~
that is, until another creative player uses
something else that s new and off  we go
again. An example of  this is a move that
we  will   look  at  soon:   7...    f6.  This
move was even classified as a blunder in
the old opening manuals.
It would appear that as a result of these
developments there will soon  be noth-
ing left to discover in opening theory; a
An incredible move  which, by defend-
ing   the  rook  on   h8,  puts  the  while
queen in peril with the simple threat of

queen  some  space  there  remains only
12.&te5, which, however, loses a pawn
after 12...J  xeS 13,dxe5Wa5 + .
Enthusiasm  for  Karpov’s idea  waned  a
little  when  it  was discovered  that  alter
hkc3   Wxe5+    !5,Jske3,   White    has
greater  compensation  than  was  origi-
nally  thought and  probably enough  to
continue, with an unclear game.
Obviously, however, most white players
are looking for  an abjective advantage,
and thus prefer rhe more solid

conviction   chat   Capablanca   already
ventilated  in  the  1930s  (!’).  However,
fortunately  for  us,  history  has demon-
strated  that, this  is  far  from  being  the
case, and that there still exist large areas
that have yet to be explored, and much
from the past that need to be reassessed
in rhe light of  what we know now. Even
if  one day we do manage to sift through
everything  there  is  to  be  known  about
chess, human memory  is such  that  the
old  saying  'Everything  new  is  some
tiling forgotten" will prove itself  to be as
true as ever.
bishops after  rhe  possible  exchange  of
the f4-k night for  the  g6 -bishop is only
academic. This is because in the closed
positions that are typical of these varia-
tions it is nor rare that a knight is more
effective than a bishop. The sacrifice of
a knight or bishop on e6 in these varia-
tions is interesting but not really sound.
On  the other  hand, die idea of  advanc-
in g   the   f-pawn   is   a   dou ble -edged
sword,  because  if  the  subsequent  ad-
vance  to  fS  becomes  impossible,  the
pawn on f4 will become a pronounced
positional   weakness;  for  starters,   just
have a look at the poor bishop on cl.
White normally seeks co profit from the
position of the g6 -bishop to gain space
on the kingside with
6.   K2-h4
It is true that sometimes pawns that ad-
vance too far up the board can become
weak,  but  in  this specific case, experi-
ence  has  demonstrated  that  this  is  the
only  option  that  allows White  to hope
for a concrete advantage,

7,       g1-f3
White  threatens 8,®e5  before advanc-
ing  the h-pawn again. Here we come to
another  point  relevant  to our  previous
discussions  about  the  development  of
opening theory For decades in  this po-
sition Black automatically played
7,   ...                  7b8-d7
to prevent the very move ®e5.
Recently  it  has  become fashionable  to
ignore  this  threat,  and  play  7.„#lf6*?.
After 8.$3eS jSkh.7, the most solid move
is 9,iLd3i  (the  old  opening books be-
lieved the following line to be excellent

Now we have reached one of  the most
important positions of   the Caro-Kami,
White   can  choose  from  many  plans,
whereas Black’s scope for  development
is  restricted.  Usually  White  continues
with  6.h4,  but once  in a  while he  also
has plans that include 4be2’f4 -  with or
without $x4. The advantage of the two

We  have  reached another key  position
of  the   Caro -Kann  (a  so-called  tabiya,
an    Arabic   term    for    'key    position"
which  is  derived  from   the   medieval
predecessor of  the  game )   Experience
gained    from    thousands   of    games
demonstrates  that   the   best  move   for
White  is  either  of  the  following  two:
13. We?  or  13/Se4.
White  seems   to  have  gained  a  tempo
compared to variations of  the  old  main
line;  the  pawn  on  (he  h4 -square has  no
influience on  the  game compared to hS,
but  the  knights placement on  e S rather
than  f3 seems  to  be. an  advantage. How-
ever,  the  latter  may  in  fact  not   be  the
case. In certain variations of  the  Petr off
Defence also,  the  black  knight  is  belter
on   f6  than   on   e4,   where  it  facilitates
White’s   development).   The   resulting
positions are  typical of  the  Caro- Kann:
solid   but   examped,  and   arc   variously
described as equal or slightly to White s
advantage,  depending  on   the   taste  of
the commenta tor
Let s return to 7...&d7,

As the  pawn  has  already  been  played  to
h4,   you   may   as   well   advance  it   one
more   square   before   exchanging   the
bishops.

9.   kf1-d3         Ah7xd3
10.     dtxd3
Now,  to  stop  Mf4,  Black  usually  pro-
ceeds with
CD       13. Wd3-e2
Spassky’s aggressive idea: the  queen  de-
fends eS, enabling £je$ , to attack 17..
13.                      0-0-0
The  recent  idea  13.„c5f? is  intriguing,
as  it  undermines  the  control of  eS  be-
fore White can occupy h;
14, W3e5
And here Black generally plays
14.                      £d7-b6
to    defend    f7    indirectly,   given    that
H,._    xe5  has  not  produced encourag-
ing  results. Indeed, a white  pawn  on  eS
limits Black s mobility, also in a possible
endgame, and  the g3  knighi can imme-
diately become very active on e4.
Back  to   14 ,,,£jb6.  White  now   mostly
continues with
1 66
Curo   Kuna  -  Main  Lint!
15. Jkd2~a5
This  defends  d4  and  threatens  the  an-
noying c4-c5. Black responds energeti-
cally,
15.                      £d8-d5!
from  the fact that there are as many ex-
ceptions as there are rules: in  this spe-
cific  case  die  knight  on  g3  is  Whites
most  passive piece and it seems to be a
good idea to exchange it for the knight
on  f6,  which  is  playing  an  important
defensive  role.  In  addition,  the  move
makes  g2-g3  possible, with  control of
f4.
At this stage, Black almost always plays
13. ...                  OOO
against which the best response is
14. g2-g3l
liberating  himself  from  the  pin  with
every means available.
Now White can play the solid
16.  wa5xb6
cementing  himself  with  a  slight  posi-
tion aj advantage.
16. ...                  a7xb6
The defence of  17 must be main tamed.
17. c2-c4
Followed  by  18,®e4,  and  if  needs  be
f4.
Alternatively, White can accept the chal-
lenge  and  defend  the  aS-bishop  with
16b4.  Black must  then continue ener-
getically   with    1 6.,,Sxa5f    1 7.bxaS
J ,a34 1 8,s£?bl <ba4, but it is not dear if
Black has achieved sufficient compensa

16. c2-c4l          c6 c5
And after 1 7.    c3 or 1 7,d5!? the results
appear  to  be slightly  in  White s favour,
with   a  decidedly   high   draw   rate  of
around 50%.
This  type  of  variation  is  typical  of  the
Caro-Kann:  suitable  for  patient  players
who have no problem with the prospect
of  a probable draw.
C2)       13.£g3-e4
is the most  frequent and  probably  best
move.  This  is  despite  the  fact  that  it
seems  to  contravene  the  principle  that
in  a cramped position, every exchange
favours  the  defender. However,  as  you
know;  the  complexity  of  chess  arises

Many  champions  have  employed   the

Bareev,     Yusupov,     Dolmatov     and
Korte hnoi   are   noteworthy   contem-

The  price to be paid for  this is the pas-
sive   bishop   on   c8,    which   in    the
Caro-Kann develops without problems.
Conceptually speaking, the French is an
active defence -  contrary  to what  you
would imagine, the percentage of  draws
in the French is lower than in  the Open
Games -  even  if  many  quiet  lines can
ensue. The Exchange Varta don is a good
example.   Generally    Black   concedes

counterplay against  White's centre and
good  prospects  on  the  queenside.  We
could  simplify  things  by saying  that  if
Black  gets   through   the   middlegame
alive, his possession of  die cdile and the
weakness  of  the  white  d 4  pawn  give
him  excellent  endgame prospects.. This
is  a  very  general   assessment.  Clearly
there  are  some  specific  variations  that
have different characteristics. Just think
of  the  Tanasch  Variation  with   3,,x5..
Here  Blacks  isolated  dS-pawn  favours
White’s   endgame  chances  and   Black
must    play    all    his    cards    in    the
middlegame!
The  move  2.d3  introduces  the  King’s
Indian  Attack,  as we  have  mentioned
earlier in the section on  the Caro-Kann,
The King s Indian Attack is a King’s In-
dian  Defence  played  with   the   white
pieces.  Given  that   the  best   plan   for
White in the King's Indian is to advance
his  e-pawn  to  e4,  here  White  profits
from  the fact that Black has already ad-
vanced his e- pawn to e6 to establish the
same position with an extra tempo.

considering  that  in   the  Open  Gaines
you  are  worse off with  your queen  on
e2 than on d 1. For example, White now
has  a  problem if  he  wants  to  play  the
Ruy Lopez!
However,   as  already   mentioned,   the
most  popular  move  is  2,d4  and  after
2...45
we  arrive  at  the  initial  position of  the
French Defence. The e4-pawn is being
attacked  and  White  must  decide  what
to do: advance it, exchange it or defend
it.

An ambitious  black player could  break
the   symmetry   with    5,,cS!?,   which
gives his pieces activity at the cost of a
weak pawn on d 5.
The   Exchange  Variation  is  correctly
considered   co   be   unambitious   and
toothless.  After  3...exd.S  5  the  resulting
position  is  similar  to  the  Petroff  De-
fence.   However,   in   the   PetrofF  the
placement  of  the  black  knight  on  e4
with  the  accompanying  weakening  of
d.5 gives  White  some  chances.  In  the
present  case,  Black  achieves  complete
and    immediate   equality    However,
equality does  not  mean a drawn game.
In fact, Black has a better win  rate  than
White in this variation?
The explanation for this lies in compet-
itive   psychology:   sometimes,   when
facing  a  stronger   opponent,  a   white
player will choose this system, which is
famous for it drawish nature, to score a
precious half-point. Only  later does  he
realize chat thirty pieces still remain on
the board and that their presence gener
ally gives more than sufficient opportu-
nity for  the stronger player to win any-

extra tempo does not  give him any ad-

several  exchanges  of  the  major  pieces

unavailable in the greater part of  rhe last
century: statistics.
With  all  its  defecisT  statistical  analysis
can be very revealing and supply a lot of
useful  information.  If, as  in  this  case,
statistics are available for  thousands and
thousands of  games,  and  White s  per-
formance  is within  the standard  result
range  (lets  say 5 2  55%),  then  the  re-
sults arc normal and  harsh  judgements
are unwarranted.
Perhaps  the  truth  lies  somewhere  be-
tween  the  two  conflicting  viewpoints:
3.eS does not give White the net advan-
tage   that   Nimzowitsch   claimed,   nor
does  it  give  Black as  easy  a  game  as
Tarrasch would have us believe.
Black almost  always responds with  the

moves  that leave Black with a cramped
position. At this point, White keeps the
pawn chain intact by playing

on  the  idea  of  leaving  the d 4-pawn  to
its fate: 4...cxd4 5..&>d3 Ac6  6.0-0 and
if    Black    does    not    wish     to    be

This     is     sometimes     called      rhe
Nimzowitsch  Variation  -   as  if  there
weren't already enough variations with
that man s name -  and it represents one
of  Wlihe’s most ambitious options.
White gains space on  the kingside and
he  is  not  afraid  to  concede  Black  the
initiative,  Black will  apply  pressure  to
the  d4-pawn  for  several  moves,  and
White will  be forced  to defend it. This
is the heart  of  the  matter. Will  this at-
tack bring some concrete advantage, or
will it come to nothing and will White
then  be  able  to  exploit  his  structural
advantage?
This subject has  been a topic of debate
since  the time when  Nimzowitsch dis-
puted Dr. Siegbert Tarraschs claims (i.e.
that  3,e5  is strategically  wrong)  in  the
pages of  his  famous  book  My  System.
Nowadays,  we  do  not  have  to  rely  on
the  inevitably  subjective  opinions  of

Rubinstein Variation, which we will dis-
cuss later. In ascending order of' popular-
ity the variations at Blacks disposal are:
A)         3,   m                            4f8-e7
This  was   occasionally   played   by   Oleg
Romanishin  during  the  1970s  and  re-
mained a rarity until there was a boom in
its popularity at die end of  the  20th cen-
tury  in part  thanks to its adoption by big
.names such  as Morozevich and  Lputian.
The  idea,  besides  getting  off  the  beaten
path, is to wait and see what White does,
with the chance of  making ...c5 more ef-
fective than on the third move; for exam-
ple,  after  4.Ad3  c.5l 5 fexd5?  (S.dxcS is

seems  less  natural  than  to  do  so  with
3.£k3.  However,  tire  former  has   the
virtue  of  rendering               ineffective.
Tarr asch  began  to  play  it  towards  the
end  of  the  I 9 th  century, as  a  means of
avoiding    the    Winawer    Variation
3.&?3  &b4,  which  was  beginning  to
be   seen   as   a  valid  alternative  to   the
Classical French 3,£lc3
Another  phis  of  3.<$3d2 is  diat  in   the
face  of  the  thematic  and  omnipresent
...c7-cS  pawn  advance  in   the  French,
White  is  ready  to  support  the  centre

bishop  on  cl,  but  more  concretely  the
lack  of  pressure on  the  centre  (i.e. d5)
compared to #k3  allows for the imme-
diate  „x7-c5  advance.  Even  if  it  does
not solve all of  Black s problems, this is
one of the most popular moves.
The  fact  that  White  has  no  immediate

not  be  that  bad.  However,  voh.mta.rily

We  have reached  a strange  position in
which die cd -knight blocks the natural
advance of  the c-pawn. However, Black
is ready to attack the head of die white
pawn  chain  with  ... f7-f6.  In  addition,
the dZ-knight does not  have any partic-
ularly  inviting   squares   to   go   to;  so
much so, that it usually goes to b3 or fl .

A typical  "French7  centre lias  been  cre-
ated,  and  we  are  presented  yet  again
with   the   eternal   question:  is   this   a
strong or  weak  centre? There is a basis
for    a   white   kingside   initiative,   but
Black’s  counter play  with   ...c7-c$  and
...fZ-f6  can  be  very  dangerous. At  tills
point  Wliite  must  make  an  important
strategic  decision:  either  support  the
centre with  f2-f4 or  give  preference to
piece development with Jld3 .

With the idea of  going to g3* The move
12.g3  is also interesting -  always with
the      idea      of      exchanging      the

latest find here is
14. WdVc2f

Simply   continuing   his   development.
White almost always proceeds with  the
strategically appealing

which, however, allows  Black a certain
amount of  counterplay:

Among  the  various  moves  which  are
playable at  this  point  (14.g3 +  14.£te2
and  I4.*?jh5), the  most  popular  at  the
moment is the unnatural-looking
14. Wd1-c1
Defending  the f4~knight and  preparing
a  transfer to  the  excellent el-square. A
delightful though unforced line (hat of-
ten occurs is

15. <?3f3xg5     Wd8xg5

17. M4xe6
which  exploits  the  undefended  black
queen and the intermediate check on f8
to  obtain  a  rook  and   2  pawns  for  a
knight and a  bishop, If Black either ex-
changes  queens  or   defends   the  rook
with  the queen, the  resulting positions
seem to be easier for White to play, even
if  they are not objectively superior from
his point of  view
since  I4.   cl  g6!> with  the idea of ap-
plying  pressure  co d4  with  the  W  on

14. ...                  h7-h6

added advantage chat there is not  much
theory to study
After many years in a slump, the Rubin-
stein   Variation  has  become  relatively
popular on  the professional circuit as a
means of obtaining draws against play-
ers of die same level. However, it is rare
at  lower  levels, where  defensive  tech-
nique is not as refined,
4,                        sdb8*d7
The  direct  4..J&fc  can  be  followed  by
.5.41xf6-H ,   either   leaving   the    black
queen exposed on f6 or spoiling Black s
pawn structure in  the event of 5,..gxf6,
The  move  4,,„&d? pops  up every now
and then (compared to   .b6 and ..J&b?
diis  does  not  weaken  the  bS-  and  c6-
squares)  and  after  S.4f3  Ac6  6.Ad 3
Black has  a  solid,  but  perhaps  exces-
sively passive position,
Let us return to 4.,.4jd7.
5,   £g143         £g8d6

Simplifying   the   position,   but   White
does  not  lose  a  tempo  retreating  the
knight
6.                        cd7xf6

The most natural reaction. White will ob-
tain active piece play in an open position;
8.   d4xc5!         Af8xc5
9.   WdVe2
When White defends the e4~pawn with
Sc 3 or  £id2  on  his  third  move, Black
has an interesting joint variation (in the
sense that it can arise from both 3,4k!2
and  3,4)c3):  the  controversial  Rubin-
stein Variation 3..,dxe4. After 4,4ixe4t
the   position   is   reminiscent   of   the
Caro-Kann   with   the   difference   that
there is  a black  pawn on  e6 instead of
on  c6,  The  fact  that  die  light  squared
bishop can no longer develop to f5 is an
obvious disadvantage, yet it is also true
that  the  freeing  ...c7-c5  advance  takes
place  in  one  move  and  the  c8-bishop
can always develop later to b7  or  to c6
via  d7.  Obviously  White  has  a  freer
game  and  a  nice  space advantage  and
this was reason enough for Tarrasch to
condemn  the  variation, However, prac-
tice has shown  us  that  Blacks  position
is solid and that a patient player can ob-
tain   reasonable   positions,   with   the

Thus, White reserves the possibility of  a
solid   approach   with   0-0,   AgS   and
Sadi ,  or  a  more  aggressive  one  with
Jj.d2/gS and 0-0-0. In both cases, ope-

suing   positions   provide   each   player

A)         4,   e4*e5
The so-called Sieinitz Variation. White
gains space on  the kingside, but Black s
typical reaction of ,.x7™c5 is now more
effective because of  the knight on c3.

Now    While    usually   supports   the
e5-pawn with
5,   f2-f4
and   leaves  the  d4-square,  when  it  is
cleared by dxcS or ,,,cxd4, for fos pieces.
The very old move S,4ke2 has recently
become  fashionable,  thanks  to  the  ef-
forts of Shirov and  Anand, After .5,.,c5,
the centre can  be supported with  6x3.
The ensuing  positions resemble, and at
times  transpose  co, the Tarrasch  Varia-
tion with 3...®f6. After 6,,,4jc6 7.f4
Whites  third   most   played   move   re-
mains, even if  by only  a small margin,
3,4k 3
White  is not  worried about  the  knight
getting  pinned  or  about  blocking  his
c-pawn r His greater central control pro-
duces  sharper  positions, and  therefore
this variation is usually preferred by ag-
gressive players. Tills is not an academic
consideration,  as   is  demonstrated  by
the fact that 3...C5? is an excellent move
in the Tarrasch Variation, but here it is
a  grave  mistake.  4<exd5 exd5 and  then
5.dxc5! follows,  with  a  clear  advantage
for White.
Back to  3,4k3. The classical 3..,£if6 is
more solid  than  3„ JLb4,  the Winawer
Variation, At die  end  of  the  20 th  cen-
tury  it  experienced  a  revival, probably
because it is a way to avoid the excessive
amount of  accumulated theory pertain-
ing to the Winawer. White can now de*
fend  e4  by  advancing  the  pawn  or  by
pinning the ?jf6.

sitional advantage thanks  to  his  control
of  the d 4-square with a timely dxcS .
Black can  now’ exchange  twice  on  d4
and  continue  with  1 L.,Wb6;  but  the
resulting   endgame,   though   manage
able,  is  not  exactly  exhilarating.  Black
can also maintain the tension:
9.   ...                  0-0

Whites   apparent   central   control   is
something  of  an  illusion:  in  practice,
opposite -side   castling   and    Blacks
counterplay on the c-Hle will mean that
there are good chances for both players.
This   is   confirmed   by   the   statistics,
which   show   Black  doing   very   well.
However,  it  must  be  noted  that,  curi-
ously, the black players had a higher av-
erage Elo rating  than the white players.

The old main line  is positionally  justi-
fied by the fact that the exchange of the
bad  dark-squared  bishop for  the oppo-
nent s good dark■■■squared bishop is the-
oretically   recommended   for    White.
However, it is also true  that every piece

the player with. the more cramped posi-
tion; in this case, Black.
After 4.&g5, Black has three variations
at his disposal. All three are very differ-
ent  in  terms  of  their  competitive  and
strategic  characteristics.  If Black wants
to win,  then  the McCutcheon Variation
is certainly the right choice. In terms of
fighting spirit and strategic characteris-
tics, it is correctly considered to be  the
connecting  link  between  the  Classical
French and the Winawer.
both  kings  would  prefer  to  be  some-
where quieter There are evident  weak-
nesses  on   Blacks   kingside,   and   the
pawn  advance  h4-h5,  often  combined
with  the  manoeuvre  Kh3-g3,  can  be
very dangerous for Black. However, the
king on d?. gives Black chances of  quick
counterplay  with. ...cxd4  and  „<Wa5-h

quietly exploit his minute advantage, or
he  castles  queenside  and  tries  a  pawn

At a deep levd  this is very logical: Black
indirectly  attacks  the  e4-pawn  without
allowing White to gain a tempo with the
pawn advance e4  eS, and reserves e7 for
his king’s knight. The obvious drawback
is that die bishop on  b4 very often ends
up  being  exchanged for  the  knight  on
c3, with a consequent weakening of the
dark  squares, which  in some  variations
can result in the black kings safety being
put  in  jeopardy. However, Black enjoys
long term advantages thanks to die dou-
bled white pawn on c3 and the excellent
play offered on  the queenside — at least
in  the  Classical  Winawer.  Like all  the
openings , it has virtues which compen-
sate   for   its   defects.   Nonetheless,   the
Wfoawer manages to  polarize opinions
in   a  particularly   pronounced   fashion.

not prepared to concede the bishop?

French  Defence       Winuwer  Variation
The   Armenian  Variation,  which   has
been   very   fashionable   since   the   late
1990s  and  is  now  threatening  the  his-
torical   domination   of   the   Classical
WinaweF Yet, strangely it had not been
dignified with a name until a short time
ago,  on  account of  its  successful adop-
tion   by   the   Armenian   grandmasters
Smbat Lputian and Rafael Vaganian.
The  concept is  very  logical: instead  of
stabilizing the centre with an exchange
on  c3,  Black keeps the  tension, forcing
White to take extreme measures: we are
referring to Alekhine’s energetic move
6.   b2-b4!
In  the  past  this response was considered
so  strong  that  players  were  discouraged
from  playing  5...,&a5. However, as is of
ten  the  case,  many  of  opening  theory's
old  condusions have  been  proved  to  be
only   partially    true   or   even   outright
wrong. Still,  although  6.b4  remains  the
most  popular  move,  the  search for  alter-
native continuations that give an opening
advantage  is  becoming  more   frequent;
moves such as 6.J&d2f? or even b.dxcSP,
The idea of  6.b4 is that after the obvious,
but  probably  dubious 6..,cxb4  7.    b5’,
White obtains a clear advantage, at least
according to  the  opening  theory  of  tire
past.   However,   after   7„Ac61   S.axb4
.I.xb44 9,c3          !0.&a3
you  reach a distinctly  improved version
of  the  Sicilian  Wing  Gambit.  This  is
certainly   not   easy   for   Black  to   meet.
However, is cliis enough to justify speak-
ing of  an objective advantage for White?
Whatever the answer to that may be, the
best move is
6.   ...                  C5xd4!
White,  as  is  so  often  the  case  in   the

a                       &c8-d7!
Lets look at the interesting position that
has arisen, which is very reminiscent of
the analogous position in  the Classical
Winawer.
Material   is  equal   (the   aS pawn   will
disappear  soon),  hut  strategically  both
positions  have evident  virtues and  de-
fects. White  is  behind  in  development
and  must  defend  eS;  in  compensation
he has control of  the dark squares, and
in  the  endgame  the  h-pawn  may  be a
winning trump card. For his part, Black
quickly     prepares     ...0-0-0     with
...Wc7/a.S and ...Ad7 (  if necessary sac-
rificing  the 17 -pawn,  and  he  will acti-
vate his pieces -  in  particular his rooks
“  on  the  kingside,  and  the  e7-knight,
moving it to fS, or to dS after , . ,d5-d4.
Returning to concrete variations, White
usually defends e5 with the ambitious
11. 1244
This   move   does   not   contribute   co
White’s development, which  is already
lagging, and  the bishop on cl  becomes
had.  However,  it  reinforces  the  centre
and prepares the insidious $jf3-g5. The
move 1 1 .®-f3 is also playable, and after
1 |...Wc7! (preventing     g5)  I2.ji.f4 or
1 2.            the   resulting   positions   are
double-edged   and   give   both   players
possibilities. A good example is the fa-
mous drawn game between Fischer arid
Tai in 1 960.
Let's return to the position after 1 1 .14.

noeuvring struggle.
Naturally White has his own  trumps to
play; he  will seek  to  exploit  rhe  weak-
ness on g7, moving the queen to g4; or
develop his pieces more solidly and nat-
urally  hoping  to  put  his  dark  squared
bishop to good  use when  the game in-
evitably  opens.  Black can  caslie  either
kingside  or  queenside,  and  attack  the
head   of   the   white   pawn   chain   by
...fAfb, in  the  lines with  kingside cas-
tling, he can advance the pawn to c4 to
prevent  the  opening  of  attacking  lines
for  White; White sometimes opens  up
the game with the "sacrilegious" dxcS. It
is no wonder that the Classical Winawer
is considered  to be such  a strategically
complex opening.
Now, 6...   e7 is the natural move, dem-
onstrating that Black is not afraid of the
attack on g7 with Wg4. However, if  you
wish   to  avoid  the  complications  that
this involves, there are two alternatives:

In  theory, White has a small advantage
thanks   to   his   control   of    the   dark
squares, but in practice Black s kingside
initiative  means  that  both  players have
chances.
It  should  be  remembered  that  Black’s
7 th and 9th  moves can be played in  re-
verse order.
This  key  position  is  analogous  io  the
more  famous  one  from   the  Sicilian

He can take on c3 with the queen or the
knight, or he can move the cl -bishop to
e3  or  the  rook  to  bl.  Another  alterna-
tive  is  to  advance  the  h-pawn.  White
tries to organize his forces, which at the.
moment  are  not  harmoniously  placed.
He hopes to make the most of  the extra
pawn that he will have, the two bishops,
and the passed h  pawn.
For his part, Black will castle queenside
and seek  to activate his pieces by plac-
ing one knight on fS and  the other on
c4  by  way  of  aS.  Sometimes  he  will
play   . ..f7 -f6   to   un d erm in e   Whi te s
centre   and   activate   the   d'7-bishop,
moving  it  to  g6  via  e8,  and  he  often
pushes  ...dS-dl,  to   break   open   the
white king's position. It is not possible
here  to  examine  all  of  she  variations
exhaustively. We will therefore present
only  one  of  the  many  possible  lines,
which  is,  however,  indicative  of   the
strategic and  tactical complexity of the
system.

Classical Winawer -
Positional Lines
Now  we  will  have  a look  at  the  posi -
tional  lines  in  the  Classical Winawer,
where  White  does  not  seek  to  capture
the  g7-pawn,  bu!  instead  is  happy  to
emerge  from  the  opening  phase  with
his  pieces harmoniously  placed and, at
the most,  with  some  expansion on  the
kingside   without   decentralizing   his
queen.
The first of the  three variations that we
will examine is the least common:
A)         Z   h2-h4

9.   >cVd2        Ic8~d7l?
Black is  correct  in  continuing  to  de-
velop   without   worrying   about   the
weakening   of   the   dark-square   com-
plex.
Alternatively,   9...h6    10,Wg4      jf.5

At   this    point   White   must   follow
through with his idea, as after the banal
developing   move   10.£jf3   the   move
10...h6*  would  be  good,  since  Wg4  is
no longer playable.

White  does  not  play either  h2-h4  or

Black obstructs the pawn on a3: for  this
reason the variation with  _b6 t  which is
excellent here, is not as good  after  7.a4,
when  the a4-square becomes inaccessi
ble for  Black. For  this  reason, many  ex-
perts  consider  that  7,a 4  is  in  fact  the
most  accurate of  Whites solid  alterna-
tives.

drop of  poison to  the threat  of c4, The
idea is that if  Black plays 10  .a 6, White
can  take on  c6  or, better still, retreat  to

should  become apparent. This is a sub-
tlety  as something can  only  be consid-
ered a weakness if  it can be exploited.

This move is not played so much to open

to  prevent  Black  from   occupying  the

This is a tabiya position.
In this position, anything can happen.
The weakness on b6, which is absent in
the  analogous  variation  with  10,Jke2,
does  not  appear   to  be  significant.  If
Black  does   not   like   the   very   open
character of  this line, he can choose  to
close   the   position  with   10...c4t?>  or
protect  himself  against  the  c2-c4  ad-
vance  with  10...Wc7.  Alternatively  he
can safely continue with 10,.16,
All of  these alternatives lead to acceptable
games. This confirms  that in  most  ope
nings  the  number  of  playable moves is
much   greater   than   you   might   think.
Some variations are much  more popular
tiian  others  simply  because  we  tend  to
copy the moves played by champions.

French  Defence  — Winnwei  V’<j  ria Eion
Chess  Opening  Essentials -   Volume  1
Sicilian Defence           aWndh iteB ldaicrke cstse ehkiss  faonrceisn ittoi atthiev ekionng sitdhee,
queenside,   exploiting   the   semi  open
c-file. There  are,  of  course, die  inevita-
ble exceptions; a striking example is the
Sveshnikov  Variation,  in  which  Black
develops   a   strong   kingside   initiative
against the white king! This complexity
is  well   suited  to   the   taste  of   modern
players,  who  like  to  be  able  to  deter-
mine   the  strategy  of   their  own   game,
and   not  have  it  determined  too  much
by  the  strategic intentions of  their  op-
ponent, even  if  this  relative  autonomy
entails  greater  risks.  The   Sicilian  was
virtually  never  played  in  the  1 9th  cen-
*                                                                                                                                               tury 1  h  enjoyed a  boom  in  the  second
half  of  the  20th century, and  it is as vital
and  popular as  ever  at  the  beginning of
the  new   millennium,  Kasparov,  whom
many    consider   to    be    the    strongest
player  of  ah  time,  played  it  almost  ex-
clusively,  and   his   contributions,  espe-
cially in the  Na jdorf Variation, have led
to  the  creation of  a  very  large  body  of
theory.  However,  we  are  still  far  from
plumbing the depths of this defence.
Minor Variations
2/£T3  and  3,d4  leads to  the Open  Sicil-
ian, However, there are quite a few play-
ers  who, for one  reason or  another, pre-
fer  one  of  the  following  minor  varia-
tions. These variations may not  be  quite
as   sharp   as   the   main   lines,  but   they
should not  be  underestimated by Black.
In  particular,  the  Sicilian  with   2x3   -
otherwise known  as  the  Alapin  Varia-
tion -  has  become so popular lately that
it is only  because of convention that it is
still classified as a minor system.
In  die  Sicilian Defence,  Black  advances
his pawn to cS so as to make it as difficult
as  possible for  White  to achieve the ideal
pawn  centre, which  consists of pawns on
e4  and  d.4.  Until  the  end  of  the  1 920s ,
Black  almost  always preferred  to  directly
occupy die centre with die classical move
1 ...eS, However, the xSicilian Defence has a
big   advantage  over   this   move:   usually
White responds to ,„cS  by advancing Ins
pawn  to d4  and  then  recaptures with  the
knight  (the   Open   Sicilian),  Tins   gives
Black the advantage of a central pawn  ma
jority; an  e-pawn and  d-pawii against die
single  white  e-pawm  This  structure has
strategic   characteristics   that   are   more
complex than  those  of  die  Open  Games,
and  Black  can  end  up  with  a  variety  of
very  different  pawn  formations.  White,
for    his    part,    can    castle    kingside   or
<|ueenside. He can  play strategically or he
can   violently  attack   the   black   king   by
making  use  of  his  space  advantage  and
better   piece  development,  and   the   in-
creased mobility granted by these factors.

Sicilian  Defence
Wing Gambit
1.   e2-e4           c7-c5
2,   b$bb4
White,  usually  develops  Ins  pieces  very
aggressively  (usually:  4}£3,  4k 3,  <&f’4,
.&,c4 ± Se2,  Efd 1, Eacl)  and Black must
defend  with  precision, Black usually es-
tablishes a Scheveningen set-up (e6 b d6,
a6T               4k 6, AeZ, Ad 7, Wc7 or WbS)
and  normally delays  kingside castling, A.
modern treatment of the Morra Gambit
by Black involves advancing the pawn to
cS:  a  drastic  measure  to  prevent  e4-e5
(wliich  in   many  continuations  causes
Black serious problems).
More  rarely  Black  fianchetioes  on  the
kingside   in   the   style  of   the   Dragon
Variation. The  Siberian Variation has
become  a  very  fashionable  choice  re-
The Wing Gambit has never been popu-
lar  with  elite  players,  and  for   the  few
who   do   use  it  at  this  level  it  is  only
brought out as a surprise weapon. White
plays  2.b4  with  the intention  of  glv *n g

nature than most of  the other gain bi is:

White gives up a pawn for development,
and  above all  to make  the  c-  and  d-files
available  for   occupation  by  his   rooks.
Black, denied his usual active play on the
queenside, has  to  operate in  a cramped
and passive jiosition for many moves.

White docs not have suffk'tertt compen-
sadon for  the pawn. The Moira Gambit
is very popular at amateur  level, but  is
viewed with suspicion by grandmasters.
In view of this reservation, it is surpris-
ing how often these elite players decline
rhe gambit and prefer co continue with
3„.£M'6, transposing  co positions  from
the AUpin Variation. Other ways of  de-
clining the Morra are 3...d5 or 3,..d3.
In   conclusion,   Black's   extra   pawn
should count  in  the  long  term; at least
in theory However, as it happens, in the
ensuing endgames the extra pawn is not
always enough to guarantee a win.

allows  White  to  maintain  a  slight  ad-
vantage.
Here  is  a  more  detailed  look  at  these
five   approaches   that   Black   can   use
against the Alapin Variation,
A)         2.                        d7 d5
Aiming  to  exploit  rhe  fact  that  White,
having already occupied  the  c3-square,
will   not   be  able  to  attack  the   black
queen on d 5  This variation often leads
to positions with  an isolated d4-pawn,
with  the  usual  strategic  considerations

This variation, deservos special attention
because of its noteworthy current pop-
ularity
in a certain sense, 2x3 is the most logi -
cal way to proceed; White seeks to cre-
ate the ideal pawn centre, i.e. pawns on
the d4~ and e 4-squares, White wants to
play    3.d4:    if    then    3...cxd4,    he
recaptures with the c3-pawn.
The  move  2x3  also  has  its  disadvan-
tages: it is not a developing move, as is
the normal 2.?if3; but  the  main  prob-
lem is that it denies  the  bl -knight the
possibility   to   develop   to  its   natural
destination, the  c3-square. This is  nor
an esoteric point, as it  allows Black ef-
fective  coumerplay  against  the  unde-
fended e4-pawn, with  the opportunity
to   reach   improved   versions   of   the
Alekhine (2~.?jf6)s  the Scandinavian
(2...d5),  or   die   French   (2_..e6  and
3..d5),

versary s  'threat1  to conquer the centre

This  way, White  keeps  the  option  of
d2-d4 on the next move, transposing to
one of  the Open Sicilian variations. Al-
ternatively, he  can  prepare a lianchclto
with  g2-g3 (   transposing  to  a  kind  of
Closed Sicilian, The name of  the varia-
tion  is  inspired  by  its  chameleon -like
capacity  to  suddenly  transform  from  a
closed variation into an Open Sicilian,
This can  be a headache for  Black, who
might end up having to play Open Sicil-
ian variations which are not  part of his
repertoire:  for  example,  after  2,,,  2c6
3.&ge2  and   4.d4t    a  player  who  in-
tended  to  play  the  Najdorf  will  now
find  it  impossible  to  do  so. The  move

tricked  into  playing  unknown  or  lit-
and  after  playing  ...e7’C6,  the  kings
knight  goes  to  e7 . White,  for  his part,
continues with  4hf3. Ic4  (or  the  posi-
tional  Ab5),  At this point it  is not  un-
common for White to sacrifice a pawn
on £5 in  exchange for a dangerous ini-
tiative against the king in  the following
typical variation:

suggest  you  have a look  at rhe famous
1969   Saidy Fischer   game,   in   which
Fischer  played  the  positional  sacrifice

The  Grand Prix  Attack is  an  effective
weapon   to   use   against   fans   of   the
Najdorf  or Dragon Variations, as both
groups   generally    play   2...d6   after
2/£<3 T   thus   denying   themselves   the
opportunity   to   play   „ rd7“d5   in   one
move, as you would normally do m  the

It is  curious  that  the  idea  of  the  fj-fS

otherwise you must have good control
over it.
The  Closed Sicilian is characterized  by
White s intention to not open  the posi-
tion. with ftD  and d2~d4, but instead to
phy  a  manoeuvring  game  marked  by
the  development  of  the  bishop  to  gZ
and   expansion  on   the  kingside.  The
price  co  be  paid  for  this  is  a  certain
weakening   of   the   queenside.   In   the
main  line Black usually continues with
3 ...g6, to place the dark-squared bishop
on   g7,   from   where   it   can   support
counterplay oxi die  queenside  (...Sb8 P
...Ab7-b5-b4).
This system utilizes ideas from the Eng-
lish Opening  (with  reversed  colours) ;

in   the  Sicilian,   Whites  extra   tempo

Tn the past decades, the Closed Sicilian
was  popular  with   players  like  Vasily
Smyslov and Boris Spassky Today loo, it
has its admirers at all levels — from  be-
ginners to grandmasters.
By playing  2,&k3  before  opening  the
diagonal for  the  fianchetto,  White  an-
ticipates  on   ,„d7-d5,  which  liberates
Blacks  game.  The  most  common  re-
sponse  is  2.,„£jc6,  after  which  White
plays 3,g3, with  the idea of developing
the fl -bishop tog2.
Another  good  plan  for  Black is  Z„x6
(or  3.,.e6)  to  prepare  ...d7-d5:  this  is
good for players who do not mind play-
ing  with  hanging or isolated pawns, in
positions where  good  piece  play com
pensates for static weaknesses.
The bishop on  gZ exerts further influ-
ence  on  d5.  reinforcing  central  con-
trol, and only later will White shift his
focus to the kingside. Beginners should
note  that  to  attack  effectively  on  die
flanks, rhe centre should be closed, or
we have the typical Closed Sicilian po-
sition,
5.                         d7-dfc
As we will see, the most common plan
begins with 614. However, recently the
move:  6.   e3  has  become increasingly
popular, especially  with  players  at low
to medium levels.

seeks counterplay by expanding on  the
queenside with ...bS-bl.
Blac k    fun d am e n ta Uy   has   four    a p-
proaches:
- develop foe king s knight  to foe  natm
ral   f6-square.   However,   placing   foe
knight here has foe defect that it is a Be-
de  exposed  to  the  advance  of  White’s
pawns;
- prepare immediate connterplay on  the
queenside with ...fib8 and  ,„b7-b5-b4,
postponing the  decision of  how  to  de-
velop die kingside.
play  the direct „.e7-e5 along foe lines
of  the  Botvinnik  Variation  of  foe  Eng-
lish Opening, with reversed colours;
-  play  ...e7-e6  and  develop  foe  king's
knight tov7.
The  last  two  options are  the  most  fre-
quendy played:
The   manoeuvre   Ae3-Wd2-Ah6jl   with
the idea of  Axg7, h4-fo5--hxg6 and Wh6,
is very dangerous if  Black responds  nie-
chamcally  However,  White  needs  to  be
careful as well. There is a trap that he can
fall into: After 6,..e6 7,Wd2 &ge7 8  Ah 6
0-0  9.h4  Axil6   1 O.Wxh6  f6f   if  While
cwtimtes  with  the  thematic !Lh5??,
Blade wins the queen with 11,,gS  followed by
..,&h8 and ,J&g8, On  the  other  hand,  if
White plays die correct move 1 i .®d2, he
has a small plus.
A  good  plan  for  Black seems  to  be  to
leave the knight on  g8 and  to begin  im-
mediate   queenside   counter play    with
6...Eb8,  and  after  7.<?rge2 (threatening
d4)   7...    d4   8.0-0   e6   9.Wd2   b5   or
9. J®e7, Black has sufficient coamerphy
However, as we have already said,
6,   f2-f4
A)         6,   ...                  «7-e5
An   ambitious  continuation,   which   at
first  glance seems  illogical,  as  it  blocks
foe extended control of  the dark-squared
diagonal  and  helps  White  to  open  the
f-file. However, Black takes possession of
foe eS-square Play is more  fluid, and  it
is  suitable  for  players  who  prefer  posi-
tions that are more open  than  those that
are produced by 6,..e6.

which  is  often  chosen  because  of  the
following  traps  that  can  easily ensnare
an   unsuspecting   Black  player   White
aims  for  the  f4-ft  advance, and  there-
fore it is best if the knight does not in-
terfere  with  the  scope  of  the  rook  on
the f-fde after kingside castling.
After    natural   moves   like    7...    ge7
8.0-0, Black may play  as so  often  hap
pens,  the  natural -looking  8   0-0?.  Nott*
White  plays  the. sacrifice 9.f5!  obtaining  a
very good  position.
If  instead Black plays the more  prudent
fk.<bd4b again White can either offer a
sacrifice with  ?,fS!? or  play the quieter
9.&e3.
Probably the safest thing for Black to do
is  to  exchange immediately  on  f4, on
the 7 th move.
Z                        e5xf4
White cannot recapture with  die pawn,
because  of   8...    xh3   and   9...Wh4-4,
gaining a  piece. After White recaptures
with  the  knight or  the  bishop, he  will
control the d.5-square and have pressure
on the f file. However* Black will be left
with   some   trumps;   the   very   active
g7’bishop and  the  d4-  and  eS-squares
for the knights.
8)         6,                        e7-e6
The most common continuation. Black
fights  against  the  f4-ft  push  more  ef-
fectively this way and  in  the event  that
While  prepares  for  this  advance  with
g3-g4, Black has the option  of taking a
radical   step   to   prevent   it :   ...ft ;   the
g8  knight  develops  to  e7,  where  it  is
less exposed to White s pawn storm and
exerts influence on the key ft -square.
The  following   gambit  line  has  been
popular recently;
Z       g1-f3         £ig8-e7
a    0’0               0-0
9.   £c1  e3        4bc6*d4
lb prevent 10.<14,
10. e4-e5l?
White opens up the position for his two
bishops,  frees   the   e4-square  for   the
c3-knight,  forces  a  weakening  of  the
d6~  and  c5-squares,  and  if  Black cap
tures on  e5  he can exploit the fofile for
his attack. Black can defend himself, but
his task is not easy
This gambit is not  Whites only option.
Interesting   alternatives   are;   1 ft.Hbi
(used  by  the  young  Anatoly  Karpov),
10.Wd2 ±  or  the  new  idea  10,Af2,  in
order to be able to recapture on d4 with
the knight without being forked.
In conclusion, die Closed Sicilian, while
certainly not the antidote to the Sicilian,
has  a  big  plus:  it  is  not  necessary  to
memorize hundreds of  variations. It  is
sufficient  just to  develop a feel for  the
typical  positions  which,  because  they
are strategically complex, tend to favour
the stronger player rather than  the one
who is better prepared .

aim  of  transposing  to  an  Accelerated

some  Mardczy Bind  (white  pawns on
e4andc4).
3,   d2  d4           c5xd4
Now, the recapture by the f   3-knight in-

4,    Wd1xd4       £jgS46
Brons tern had the interesting idea of
5,   &f1-b5l?
The  idea is to  play e4-e5 without  hav-
ing to deal with ®c6.
To avoid this variation, some players try
3.,.Ag7!?, and if   White  plays 4,c4, hoping
to transpose into the Mardczy Bind, Black
can deviate with  the interesting and little-
explored 4,..Wh5+ or                 Naturally
White   has   other    options,   such   as
4.dxc5L
White  can  also  try  another  means  to
cake  the    game   away   from    typical
Dragon positions: 3.c3, with the aim of
creating  an  Alapin  position  in  which
Black has already played . -g7-g6.
In  response  to  2,<bf3, there  are  three
moves that are significantly more popu-
lar  than  any others. In ascending order
of  popularity they are:
-2„,#jc6
~2...e6
We will examine them in  reverse order
However, first we will look at the rarely
played 2,,,g6, 2,,,a6, and 2„.£}f6.
These  lines  do  not  have  good  reputa-
tions.  It  is  doubtlessly  true  that  White
can obtain a certain advantage, but, as is
so often the case with minor variations,
this is not alwap sufficient to bring vic
lory  against correct play. In addition, it
is not rare that their surprise valve shifts
the balance in Black s favour

In  many  Sicilian  variations,  Black ad
vance.s his  pawn  to  a 6  to prevent  Ab$
or  £ibS  at  various  stages  of  the  game,
and also with the intention to continue
with _bS and possibly ,.,b4 and ,..,.ft,b7.
If this is soT why  not immediately play
,.,a?-a6? Among other things, this con-
tinuation  offers  the  advantage  that  if
While   continues   with   the   thematic
3.d4, Black achieves easy equality with
3 _cxd4 4     xd4 eS! After all, unhke in
variations  such  as  the  Sveshnikov  or
the  De  La Bourdoimais,  the  knight  is
denied  the  b5-square,  and  after  S.    fS
we have 5.. dS ’ , and Black is better.
White s best  strategic option is to  for-
get  about  d2  d4  and  instead  directly
play  into  one  of  the  minor  variations
of  the  Sicilian  in  which   the  ,„a7  a6

with 3.c3 or 3,c4> However, in a dosed

thing, and  you avoid many highly the-

This move produces another interesting
system,     which     many      cal!     the
Nimzowitsch Variation.
Black plays a type of Alekhine Defence
in  which. White has his  knight already
on  f3  and  Black has  already  advanced
his pawn tocS.
It is not clear which of  the two players
benefits the most from this.
However, in the main line, White seems
to  maintain  a  certain  advantage  with
correct play

which arc closely related.
Otherwise there is 4,e3 Jfcb4P,
The  Rossolimo  Variation  is  the  most
important of  the minor variations avail-
able to White in response to 2..,    c6, It
is   named   in   honour   of   the   Ukrai-
nian-born player who successfully em-
ployed  it  from   the  1940s,  Ils  recent
popularity  would  seem  to  be  tied  to
white  players* growing  respect  for  the
Sveshnikov Variation , An ever-increas-
ing number of them will not  kisk’ 3,d4
and  would  rather  steer  the  game  into
complex strategic positions. which give
the  better  player  good  chances of  vic-
tory
Leading to  the same  positions with  an
extra  tempo ~ or one less ~ depending
on which way you look at it.
After  3,   b5,  Black  has  three  replies,
(ignoring 3,,,d6, which you usually ar-
rive  at  with  the  move  sequence  2.,.d6

Whites position is very flexible: he can
push  a  pawn  to c3  and  d4;  he  can ex-
change. the bishop for the c6-knight, or
otherwise bring it back to fl  after He I ;
he  can  try  co establish  strategic  posi-
tions, or  choose a violent  gambit  con-
tinuation, In short, it is ideal for players
who prefer to "play1 instead of  ‘remem-

bishop  is  compensated  for  by  a  big
lead in development.
Thus, White can  establish  an  insidious
set-up,  not withstanding  its  apparently
modest  appearance, The eS-pawn is an
irritating  intruder,  which   White   sets
about  to overprotect with  6,Hel , in  ac-
cordance    with    the    teachings    of
Nimzowitsch, This  gives  White  a  cer
tain initiative, and Black must phy with
great precision  to get  through  the fol-
lowing part of  the game unscathed.
B)         3,   ...                  e7-e6
A move that is often  played. The idea is
to avoid doubled pawns on  c6 by play-
ing 4,,,$jge7 (if  White does not imme-
diately play 4. Axe6). Al this point T the
natural  4,0  0  follows  (4.®c3  is  also
possible) .   However,   the   immediate
4,Axc6!?,  before  Black takes  the  mea-
sure   to   prevent  the  doubling  of   his
pawns,  is  interesting  and  increasingly
popular.
But Black s position is solid, and in  the
long  term  the  bishop  pair  could  be  to
his   advantage.   Strangely,   however,
White s   statistical   performance   is
above average?
Instead   of   playing   5,®3c3,  it   would
seem  to be more logical  to play 5.He 1  ,
to preserve  the bishop, which can  now
retreat to fl  after S,,,ab,

the  absence  of  White's  light -squared
Alternatively there is 5.c3, to enable the
bishop to retreat to c2, with  the second
ary  ambition  of  occupying  the  centre
with  the d-  and  e-pawns. The resulting
game is double edged,

centre by advancing ...,d5.
However, Black s most common choke
remains
Al   this   point    the   eccentric-looking
6BB.&h6! is the most popular move, and
it  is  also  probably  rhe  strongest.  The
knight  does  not  develop  to f6,  as  this
would invite e4-e.5. it does not go to e.7
cither,   because   the   advance   ...eZ-eb
needed   to  make  this  possible  would
weaken thedfi- and f6-squares.
After   6...£ih6    Black   proceeds   with
...17-16, always  with  the  idea  of  pre-
venting   e4-e5,   the   knight   on    h6
repositions to  f7, the  d-pawn advances
to d.6 and  his companion will possibly
go  to  eS;  and  then  Black should  have
reasonable prospects.

uation,

Black is now less afraid of  e4-eS, as (he
£if6 can go  to c7  by way of dS, attack-
ing  the bishop on  b5. Now  that White
has castled  kingside,  after  Axe6,  Black
recaptures  with  the  d-pawn  and  places
rhe  cZ-knight  on  e6,  aiming  for  the
outpost   <14, with   a   solid   position.
Therefore White usually chooses
6*   C2-C3           0-0
L    d2’d4           d7~d5I
Black plays this without first  exchang-
ing   on    d4 t     to   avoid   clearing    the
c3-square for the knight on b 1.
8,   e4’S5           4hf6-e4
And Black has a satisfactory position.

Sidfio     Defence   -   Variations  with   . ,.Wb6
Sicilian Defence
Variations with ...Wb6
One  of  the  minor  variations  for  Black
which  is  currently  reasonably  popular,
has rhe idea of  developing his queen  to
b6  in   the  first  few  moves,  in   other
words; before completing the develop-
ment of  the other pieces.
k is true that on  b6 the queen  is not as
well placed as it could be, especially if  it
blocks the path of  the  b-pawn  when  k
is still on  b7. However, it can always re-
position  to  c7,  which  is  the  square  it
most usually develops to in the Sicilian.
The  advantage  of  the  annoying  move
is that it applies pressure on  the
d4- knight,  usually  forcing  it  to  go  to
b3 , where it is less active and dangerous
than on d4.
And if  White brings the knight back to
<14 after the queen on  b6 repositions to
c7?  He  would  find  himself  playing  a
Sicilian   with   loss   of   a   tempo!  The
manoeuvre   ...Wd8-b6-c7   by   Black
requires   two    tempi,   while   Whites
-d4-I>3-d 4 requires three!
This is the most common line. Black di-
rectly  attacks  the  knight  on   <14. The
move „.W'b6 also makes sense in other
variations.
Those interested in  the move ,.,Wb6 in
various  Sicilian  fines  should  note  the
following:

Current  theory  claims  a  slight  advan-

queens  with  8/Bxfh, as well  as  when
he  refuses  to  simplify  and  retreats  the
queen with

It  is  worth  remembering  that  if  Black
plays  5..,£lf6  instead  of  5...a6,  White

resolve   Blacks   problems   connected
with  this opening as early as the fourth

It  was   once   thought   that   after   6x4
White  had  a dear  plus.  In  reality, here
also Black can obtain active piece play in
exchange for a positional weakness. This
variation  was  not   even  mentioned  in
opening manuals  before  the  1980s t   yet
now it has become very popular and it is
representative of  air rent trends: with the
advent  of computer  programs and  (heir
capacity  to  defend  difficult  positions,
many continuations that  had  been dog-
matically dismissed  as doubtful  or  un-
sound,  have  in  fact  been  proved  to  be
perfectly  playable.  Naturally   this  does

Black’s plans, and if  he readies the end
game, to try  and  make  the most  of his
structural advantage. White can also try
to advance die pawns on the queenside
with h2-b4-b.S,
not  mean  that  general  strategic  princi-
pals are no longer important
Lets  now  have a  look  at  some specific
moves.  White  can  choose  die  natural
6.    lc3,   winch  usually  transposes  to
the Sveshmkoy or the more thematic
6* c2-c4
If  Black responds with ,„axb5, he recap
cures with  the c-pawn and can then  try
to  exploit  his  pawn, majority  on  that
wing.
Alternatively    White   can   move   his
knight   to   d5 t    where   it   is   strongly
placed, and force  Black co exchange it,
then  recapture  witil  the  e4-pawn  and
prepare <4-c5 with b2-b4.
The last move Exes the weakness of the
d6-pawn by preventing its liberating ad-
vance to <15 for quite some  time. How
ever,    it    concedes    control    of    the
d 4- square  to  Black, White  often  makes
the knight  manoeuvre   AbS-a3-c2-e3 to
reinforce control  of dS and  thus  main-
tains a small but persistent advantage.
It Black is  to compensate for  this posi-
tional disadvantage, he must  guarantee
himself   active   play   with   the   minor
pieces, perhaps exchanging his  passive
kings   bishop   (with   the   manoeuvre
„..&f8-e7  gS), In addition  he  needs  to
try  and  carry  our  the  ,,,b7-b5  break,
which,  by  removing  the  head  of  the
white pawn chain on c4, lays the foun-
dations for an advantageous opening of
the  centre  with  ,.<d6~d5, Alternatively
there  is ...fZ-fS, perhaps after  .  g7-gh t
to obtain a kingside initiative.
Fundamentally   Whites   best   strategy
seems to be to prevent die realization of
This  last  plan,  which  is  highly  insidi-
ous,  was  used  more  than  once  by the
young  Karpov  in  the  analogous  posi-
tions  that  arise  in  the  Classical Varia-
don ofthe Najdorf (6. Jle2 e5).

true that the d 5 -square is weakened, but
Black’s good piece activity makes it diffi-
cult, if not  impossible, for White  to ex-
ploit this weakness. This system  remains
one  of  the  best  if Black is  playing  for  a
win,  even  if  that  entails  taking  greater
risks. In  addition, with  the  proliferation
of  open  tournaments, it  is  common  to
encounter players of all levels. As a result,
a  dangerous  opening,  though  perhaps
not completely sound, can be a very use-
ful  addition  to  your1  repertoire.  We will
now  liave a doser  look at specific varia-
tions.  After  5..,eS t   the  best  response  is
certainly
6,    £d4-b5
To try  and exploit the hole on d6. Black
continues with
6.                         d7 dG
because, unlike in  the  De La Bourdon-
nais   Varia don,   the   f6-square   is   not
available  to  die  queen  anymore. There-
fore 6...a6? would be a bad error.
Z    Jkd-g5
is the  most  popular move at  this  point.
However, we will  first  take a  brief look
at two alternatives:
A)  White can  prevent Black s planned
moves  ...a6  and  . .bS  by  immediately
playing 7.a4
u       A ? in
The    move    5 F*,e5   characterizes   the
Sveshnikov  Variation,  which   was   al-
ready  being  dabbled  with  occasionally
by  Bird  and  Worid  Champion  Emanuel
Lasker as early  as  the  end  of  the  1800s
and  die  beginning  of  the  1900s. How-
ever  it  was only  towards die end  of  the
1970s that it became genuinely popular.
At the beginning of  this new  century its
reputation is better than  ever: practically
all  the  best   players  — Kramnik,  Shiroy,
Topalov, Lauder, Ivanchuk. Leko (and to-
wards the end of his career, Kasparov) -
use  the Sveshnikov relatively frequently*
Not  bad  for  a  variation  that  was  origi-
nally  considered   to   be  unsound.  This
does not mean that assessments based on
positional  considerations are  no  longer
valid;  it  is  just  that  today  more  impor-
tance is given  to rhe dynamic features of
a  position. In  the  case  in  question, it  is
and  then  relocating  the  bS -knight  via
a3-c4.

B)  Akeinativefy White can completely
change the distinctive features of  the po-
sition with 7A2dS, which forces the ex-
change 7 ., /hxd $ > After 8 exd 5
Kasparov, playing with the white pieces,
has scored  some  brilliant  victories us-
ing this variation.
We will now go back to 7.Jig S,
we.  have   a   typical   position   with   a
queenside pawn  majority for White, lie
will try to prepare the c2-c4-c5 advance
and  Black will seek counterplay  on  rhe
kings!de, gaining leverage with  the  e5
and  f5-pawns, Many Black players con-
sider this continuation to be so unpleas-
ant  that  they  prefer  to  play  the  move
5,,,e6  instead of  the  thematic  S,..eS, In
this way, after 6     dbS (considered to be
the  best)  6„,d6  7,Af4  eS  8,   ,g5 T  you
transpose  into   the  main  line  of  the
Sveshnikov with 1..&g.5, with both play-
ers  having  made  an  extra  move.  How-
ever, there  is  a  price  to  be  paid;  after
5„,e6 t  Black must  be ready for  the  dis-
agreeable  possibility   that   White   will
continue with 6<£lxc6 bxc6 7eS.
As we said before, this is the most pop-
ular   continuation.   The    pin   on    the
f6-k night  accentuates  the  weakness  of
the dS -square.
This can he considered  the initial posi-
tion of  the Sveshnikov system.
7.                        a7-a6
White  now  usually  retreats  the  knight
immediately with
a    <bb5-a3
as  it  was discovered  that  the  'classical’
BJkxfb  gxf6  9A)a3  gives  Black good
play after 9.,.fsf
In  the  past  players now  continued  with
8,.d&,e6, However, from  the  1970s  on
wards players started to employ the move
8.                        b74>5!
This  followed  a  more  modern  inter-
pretation of  the  position  by  the  Rus-
sian  grandmasters  Evgeny Sveshnikov
and Gennady Timoschenko. It is often
called the Chelyabinsk Variation, to dif-
ferentiate  it  from   the  older  8.,,.4e6
variation.
Now   we   are   at  a   major   crossroads:
White  can  play the  ‘positional’ 9 Aid 5,
or the aggressive 9.Axf6,

However, this is fully compensated for by
several advantages: a strong central  pawn

attacking possibilities on the g-fik,

Now we have  another important cross-
roads, but  this  time for Black: the  mod-

seeks    to    immediately   remove    the

White can  choose between  I l.c3  (Black
will be wise to meet this with the imme-
diate ...f6-fS, with good play) and

ing   positions   have   inspired   varying
evaluations.
B2)       10, ...                  fG f5
This  can   be   defined  as  the   principal
move of  the entire defence.

structure,   especially   on    die    kingside.

master   Geza   Mardczy   (1870  1951),
who  was one of the strongest  Hungar-
ian  players of  all time. This formation,
which was first played at the beginning
of the  20rh century is renowned for its
great  solidity  and  reliability  Frustrated
by   the   difficulties   presented   by  die
Mardczy  formation,  players started  to
experiment with 2,,.d6,
Profiting from the fact that the knight is
still on  b i , White seizes firm control of
the  centre  with  5x4   (this  is  the  key
move of the Maroczy Bind) and greatly
reduces Black’s chances for counterplay
hi  the  beginning,  tins did  not  appear to
be so  worrying  for Black, in  that it  was
widespread  usage  io  first  play  4...#Vf6,
and  only  after  S.ftcB  to  continue  with
5,„g6, hi  this way White  no longer has

However, it did  not take long to discover
that after the sequence              bxc6 1 eS!
The Accelerated Dragon is one  of  the
oldest of the Sicilian variations. It made
its distant debut in 1851 in London.
The  venerable  age  of  the  Accelerated
Dragon should not come as a surprise if
you  stop  to  think  about  how  the ideas
behind  the  Sicilian  have  developed.  If
the aim of  L ,x5 is to take control of  the
d4-square>   (hen   as   a   consequence
2.,j§jc6 appears  to  be  the  most  logical
continuation ,  as  is  the  opening  up  of
the diagonal so as to control d4 further
with   the  fianchettoed   bishop  on   g7.
This  logic  was  irresistible  to  the  early
pioneers of opening theory; it is there-
fore understandable that the first exam-
ples  of  the  modern  Dragon  type  posi-
tions  with  2~.d6  did  nor  appear  until
the 20th century
In  the  preceding  years  Black tried  to
deal directly  with  the famous Maroczy
Bind, which takes its name from grand-
7...45g8 (sad necessity as the pawn sac-
rifice   7.,Z/>dS 8.&xd5  cxd.5  9>xd5

withstanding the fact that  the pawn on
e5  is  so  far  advanced  that  it  could  be
subject to a counterattack.
Then someone thought of substituting
2„.<ic6  with  2.,,d6  so  that  the  pawn

advance  to  eS  would   not  longer   be
possible. And this is how  the  'normal’
Dragon   came   to   make   its  debut   in
1924;  1 ,e4  cS  2.4rf3  df   3.d4  cxd4

the  Sth  as  occurs  with  the  ’standard’
Dragon.
This  means  that  the  standard  Dragon
has    the    virtue   of   preventing   the.
Maroczy Bind, but as we will sec in the
section  that deals  with  the Mardczy  all
that glitters is not gold. The problem is
that  there  is  less  central  influence  ex-
erted  on  the  centre  with  2...d6  com-
pared  to  2,.j£jc6 t   and  this  means  that
White can more freely choose continu-
ations  that  would  be  dubious  against
the  Accelerated  Variation. A  good  ex-
ample of  this is the popular 9.0-0-0  in
the   Yugoslav  Attack  in   the   standard
Dragon. As always, the final choice boils
down  to questions of taste and  style of
play. The Accelerated. Dragon  could  be
an excellent choice, if  a player does not
mind  the  positional  struggle  that  en-
sues   after    the   imposition   of    the
Mardczy Bind.
Maroczy Bind
We will look at

m some depth, both because it is popu-
lar, and  because it is also objectively the
best  move. You must  remember  that  it

called the Gnrgenidze Variation, and it
is  characterized  by  an  early  exchange
on  d4,  which  reduces White s options.

play a timely 4&d5 (without castling, so
the king can recapture on ci 2). If this is
followed, by an exchange of queens , an
endgame,  or   better  still,  a  queenless
middlegame ensues that is often favour-
able for White.
After the  likely exchange on  dS,  White
can choose e4xd5, which means lie will
then exert  a certain amount of  pressure
on   the   e7-pawn    by   means   of'   the
semi-open  e-file.  Alternatively, he  can
play c4xdS r hoping to control or exploit
the open c-file. When this file is open, it
is  common  for  the  major  pieces  to  be
exchanged on  tills file. The ensuing end
game is very often in White s favour, be-
came of  his space advantage and the pos-
sibility  to  exploit  the  weak  c6-square,
against which  Black will  be induced  or

Black  must  make  his  first  big  choice:

This continuation fell into slight  disre-
pure from  the  beginning of  the 1 9 70sT
but  now  it  is  again  considered  to  be
playable.

Now tiie best move is, curiously,

to safeguard die queen against the latent

and  you reach one of the key positions
of  the defence.

posi tion by means of the King's Indian

7.0-0 cxd4 8.£xd4    c6 9.Ae3 Jkd7.
In this position Black s typical plan is to
exchange on d4, move the bishop to c6
in order to force White  to play B;  then
transfer the  f6-knight  to c5  via d7;  ad-
vance the  pawn  to aS; and  to dose  the
game   by  placing  pawns  on  the  dark
squares.   Black's   defensive   strategy
would  make  it  advisable  to  exchange
the   dark-squared   bishops,    to   limit
White’s   offensive   possibilities,   and
leave him with  the "bad’ e 2 -bishop. For
his  part,  White  will  patiently  prepare
slow phy  on the queenside with Habl ,
Hfc I . Aa3 and  Ab4. That is, when it is
tactically feasible  to do so.  However, it
should  not  be  presumed  that  opening
he obtains the customary space advan-
tage  with  slightly  the  better  chances.
However, if he tries  to be clever, spec -
ulating  on  an  exchange on  g7  with  a
following  check  on  d4,  his  plan  will
backfire:                   &\Xii4 ll&xd4  $5f

After  2...e6,  White  can  decide  not  to
advance the pawn  to d4, to avoid some
of  the better-known theory.
With   3,d3   or   3.We2,  you   generally
transpose  into  variations  of  the  King’s
Indian Attack, which  is arrived at with
the  following  moves:  41f3,  g3,  ilgi,
0-0, d3, ?ibdl  and e4. The  precise or-
der  of  the moves  is usually not  so im-
portant. It is so named because White is
playing  a  King’s Indian  Defence  with
colours reversed.
White can also open the diagonal for his
queen’s  bishop  with   3.b3  or  seek  to
transpose to the Alapta with 3.c3 or, with
the non  committal moves 3.<?k3 or 3.c4,
to an Open Sicilian on the next move.

The  alternatives  are  inferior.  However,
the kingside weakness (g7) is more sig-
nificant  than  the  doubled  pawn  on  c3
and  there are  two ways White can  gain
a good advantage.
A)         7.   &c1-d2
The solid approach.
This   is  a   direct,  but   not   completely
sound  attempt  to  immediately  attack
the e4-pawiL Played  by Owen  and Bird
as  far  back  as  the  second  half  of  the
19rb  century this  variation  has  always
been  viewed  with  a  certain suspicion.
It   had   a  brief  revival   in   the   1970s,
when  it was  played with a new idea; an
exchange   sacrifice.  However,   it   was
soon   discovered  drat   White   gains   a
concrete  advantage  with  correct  play,
and  the variation returned to obscurity
However,  it   can   be   a   valid   surprise
weapon:  indeed, if  White  is  unaware
of  the  correct  antidote,  he  can  easily
lose  his  way  in  die  ensuing complica-
tions,
6.   e4-e5!
The  only  move,  that  can  give  Black  a
headache. It is a strange fact that the ef-
fectiveness of this  move was not appre-
ciated  until  die  1930s: for  decades  be-

sc  it  was  natural  diac until  die  1960s
opening   theory   would   include   their
contributions within die Paulsen Varia-
don.   However,   as   theory   developed
each  variation  acquired  its own  name,
even if this is not consistently observed
by opening manuals.
After Le4c5 2,£if3 e6 3 rd4 cxd4 4.   xd4t
we will use the following names:
4. .,a6 - Kan Variation;
4.. .4.6 -  Paul sen"Taimanov;
4...shc6  $.4k3   a6   6. Me 2  4&ge7 -
Tainiaiwv (m the strict sense) ;
4...#k6   5.4bc3  a6   6.jfee2  Wc7  -
Paulsen (in the strict sense).
From what we have said so far. you will
now realize how subtle the distinctions
are. For example, when playing the Kan,
Black only  needs  to  play .J?3c6 and he
will   suddenly   find    himself   in   (he
Paulsen -Taimanov variation .
It is interesting to know that in the past
the Paulsen Variation used to be reached
almost exclusively via the Kan (4, ..a6).
Nowadays,   black   players  more   com-
monly   prefer   to   reach   the   Paulsen
through 4„.£3c6, This trend is also be-
cause  modern  players,  who  are  well-
versed in  the intricacies of the Kan, like
to develop the  bS-knight to  c6. Other-
wise, its placement there is delayed.
To make  matters even  more  confusing,
it  should   be  remembered  that  when
Black plays ...d6  (either  after  4.„a6 or
after  4...4)c6 5.4k3)  and  develops  the
bishop   to   e7,   he   transposes   to   the
Scheveningen Variation. This is some-
thing that happens often, as in this way
Black   avoids   the   dangers   associated
with the Keres Attack.
The  move  sequence  Le4  c.5 2,SB   e6
3.d4  cxd4  4.£ixd4 a 6  leads  to  one  of
the  oldest  positions  in  the Sicilian De-
fence.  it  was  used  in  several  of  Adolf
Anderssens games in the middle part of
the  19th century and  by louis  Paulsen
towards  the  end  of  the  same  century
However,  it   only   started   to   become
popular   from   the   beginning   of   die
1950s  onwards,  due   to  good  results
achieved by the Soviet player Ilya Kan. It
is statistically  one  of  die  best  lines  for
Black in  the Sicilian. Though  this is in
part a comment on  its objective worth,
it  also  reflects  the  fact  that  the  Kan is
greatly  appreciated  by  strong  players,
who Bnd its flexibility attractive.
There  is  sometimes  a  little  confusion
about  the  nomenclature  of  die  ‘sister*
Taimanov  and  Paulsen  variations,  in
part  because of  possible  transpositions.
Both   Kan  and   Mark Taimanov   were
more  recent  players  than  Paulsen. and

Chess  Opening Essentials  -   Volume  1
We will consider S..&d3 to be the main
line of the Kan. Before we look at it, we
will examine the alternatives:
B)         5*   £b1*c3
This tends to lead to positions found in
the Paulsen-Tamianov Variation where
every    now    and    then    Black    plays
S...£k6. However, if Black wants co re-
main in the orbit of rhe Kan, he can play
die completely re evaluated
5.   ...                  b7-b5
In old  opening  books  this  was consid-
ered doubtful because of
6.      f1-d31
A)         5.   c2~c4
Adopting  the Maroczy Bind pawn for-
mation,   as   in   the   Kalashnikov,  the
AuikTaimanov   and   the   Accelerated
Dragon.
Now the advance ..,47-dS by Black will
prove to be difficult.
At first, this was considered to be a sort
of   positional   refutation   of   the   Kan.
However,  today  it  is  not  viewed  with
fear:  Black can  respond  directly  with
5..  j?jf6  and  then  6.£jc3  J .b4,  which
produces tactically complex play. This is
particularly   the  case  in   the   variation
7..6d3   $}c6  8,fixc6  dx<6  9,e5   WaS
10.exf6  JbccJ h  where  White s  inilia
tive used to be seen as  very promising.
However,, in reality Black has more than
sufficient  resources.  Also  good  is  the
solid  6,..Wc7 t   which  controls  e$  and
creates  a   rypical  Hedgehog  Defence
formation  (this  variation  acquired  its
name  because  the  e6-d6-b6-a6  pawn
formation   reminded   players   of   the
thorny   spines  of   a   hedgehog).  This
variation  is  willingly  used  by  modern
players   who    are    unconcerned   by
White's space advantage.
However, in  fact after  6.,,.Wb6 — a re-
cent  move that is very fashionable -  or
6...d6t  Blacks results have been accept-
able.
However, the  classical  5.„Wc7  is  also
playable.
C)         5,   £.f1-d3
The  principal  move  of  the  Kan Varia-
tion,
266
Sicilian  Defence  --  Kan  Variatio
C3)      5.  ...                 £b8-c6
is  the  classical continuation.  Now  it  is
seen more rarely, but this is only a ques-
cion of fashion.
This   is   not   such   a   natural-locking
move;   generally   we   are   advised   to
place  the  bishops on  open  diagonals.
However,  in  this  case  there  are  many
advantages that come with  this move.
Substantially  it  is  a  question  of  tim-
ing:  by  defending  the  e4-pawn  with
the  bishop, White  postpones  the  de-
velopment of  the  knight  co c3> to  re-
serve  the  option  of  c2-c4  for  a  more
opportune   moment    than    the    5 th
move,
Nonetheless,   this   flexible  developing
move allows White, if  he wants, to still
develop the knight to c3> transposing to
common   variations   of    the   Scheve-
ningen in which  the d3-bishop can be-
come a threat after pawn advances to f4
and  eS.  Moreover,  in  some  variations
the  white  queen  — unobstructed  by  a
bishop on          can relocate directly  to
the kingside.
After S.AdS, Black has an ample choice
of  moves  besides  5,, d6,  which  is  one
of   many   ways   to   transpose   to   the
Scheveningen Variation. Some  of  the
available   moves   are:    5,..bS,   S..,b6,
5».Ste7 or even 5„d5, which  until not
long  ago was considered  to be  prema-
ture. However, the most popular are the
following:
C1)      5.                       &f8-c5
To try to exploit the presence of  the un-
defended d-bknighc by attacking it im-
mediately  and  after  b.'SbS,  retreating
the bishop toa7 ore/.
C2)      5.                       Wd3*b6
Tins is all the  rage with Sicilian players
at the  moment. The resulting  positions
are still largely unexplored.
C4)      5.                       g7-g6
Here   a   student   could   protest,   "But
doesn't  everybody  say   that   with   an
c6-d7  pawn  structure  you  shouldn't
advance  the  pawn  to  g6,  as  it  creates
ugly weaknesses on d6 and 16?’ This is
true,  but  as always,  general  principles
must  be  considered  in  the  context  of
each  particular  case.  Here,  the  weak-
ness in question is not  easy to exploit,
since    the   d3-bishop   obstructs   the
d-fde.  In  addition,  the  move  .. AgZ
will gain a  tempo by attacking the un-
defended knight on d4.
C5)      5.                       £g846
267
Chess Opening  Essentials -  Volume  I
The most popular move at the moment,
taking advantage of White’s inability to
advance   the   pawn   to  e5   because  of
6...Wa5+ followed by 7...Wxe5.
After   6.0  0   (threatening   7.eS),   you
continue with  6...Wc7  or  6...d6  to es-
tablish. a  classic  Hedgehog  formation
in the event that White plays t:2-c4.

445x34 £ic6
On  the minus side, Black can  no longer
flexibly develop the b 8 -knight to d7, as
is the case in many Sicilian variations.
Black does  not  control  the  b5  square,
because  he  has  not  played ...a6. So  the
first continuation that will  be examined
is  S.sbbS,  which  some  refer  io  as  the
Anti-Taimanov  Variation.  This  is  not
as popular as it once was  (for example,
it   was   one   of   Fischers   favourites).
However,  it   remains   one   of   Whites
main lines; the second being 5Aic3.
A)         5,   £?d4-b5       d7-d6
It should be stressed that you can reach
the same position with  the move order
l.e4- c5  2Xdf3 fded  3.d4 cxdl  4.$ixd4
e6.
Every opening  has  its  good   and   bad
points. Compared to the Kan, the post
Jive feature here is that since d4 is con-
trolled by the $)c6, the most unpleasant
move    5 >Ad3   becomes   impossible.
Moreover, the  move 5x4  loses a lot of
its  effectiveness  here,  as  after  5„/£}f6
6.£k3  Jfb4,  Whites  centre  is  already
under pressure.
Another   reason   why   the   Paulsen-
Tumanov  Variation  is  so  popular  is
that  Black  always  has   the  option   of
. ,d7  d6  in  the  main  lines.  In  this way
he  can  transpose  to  the  Scheveningen
Variation, having  avoided  the  danger-
Ous Ke res and  English Attacks, which
can  be so  formidable  against  the stan-
dard Sc heveningen.
Now  there  are  two  continuations  for
White; 6x4and6,   f4.
A1)       6.   c2-c4
Bringing about the classic Maxdczy Bind
pawn formation (pawns on e4 and c4)
2.70
Sicilian  Defence  -   Pohen    I tri moor
and  Black responds  by  taking  up  the
Hedgehog Defence pawn formation.
Ix is true that White loses time with  the
manoeuvre ®d4-b5~c3 (or a3) in com-
parison   to   sister   systems   that   are
brought about by the English Opening,
the   Sicilian   Kan   Variation,   or   the
Queerfs Indian Defence. However, it is
not  uncommon  for  Black to  move  the
knight from c6  to d7  by way of bS! As
you   will   have  noted,   the   slow   ma-
noeuvring style of play which is typical
of  these  variations,  is  the  appropriate
way to handle all Hedgehog-like forma-
tions, even if they are produced by dif-
ferent openings. It is only  when  White
attacks b6  with  JZ.e3 and  Wb3  that the
variations  have  their  own  specific  fea-
tures.
The  importance  of  White’s  space  ad-
vantage  was overestimated  in  the  past.
In  practice, Black's position  has proved
to   be  difficult   to  attack;  either   with
gradual    manoeuvres,   where   White
maintains his  space advantage; or  with
aggressive   attempts   in   which   White
tries to attack Black s king with his f  and
g-pawns.  In  response  to  (he  latter  ap
proach,  Blacks  usual  countermeasure
is an  opportune pawn  advance  ...d5, If
White   plays   g2-g4,   the   manoeuvre
...h6, ...    h7 and ,„g5 is also effective.
When White plays the more solid f2-f3
and    takes   counter measures   against
Black’s ...d5  pawn  break with <&hl and
Afl , Black has the interesting sequence
„J&e7~d8~c7; or,  alternatively  ,,.    h8 h
...Hg8 and  then  ...g5~g4 to undermine
the white pawn chain.
A2)       6.   &c144

6.                        e6-e5
Z    if4-e3
We  have  reached  a  position  which  is
very reminiscent of the Lasker-Pdikan
Variation,  which  can  also  be  reached
by means of the Kalashnikov  (but with
one move less for both players!) ,
But  Whites  most  frequent  choice  re-
mains the natural developing move:
B)          5.    £b1c3
By  S,,.d6  Black can  now  transpose  to
standard  lines  of  the  Scheveningen  in
which   he   has   not   yet  developed  his
king's  knight.  Not  moving  the  knight
could be advisable, as you can avoid sev-
eral dangerous continuations by White.
At this  point  it  makes  virtually no  dif-
ference in  which order Black plays ...a6
and  ...Wc7.  However,  the  most  corrh
mon first move is
271
Chess Opening Essentials  -   Volume  1
5,   ...                 a7~a6
It is worth  noting  some  popular alter-
native lines for White  (regardless of in
which   order    ...a6   and   .,,Wc7    are
played);   6.,feel,   which   remains   rhe
most  frequently  played,  as  well  as  the
more recent 6.$.e3.
B1)      6.   fed4xc6
This is only usual in response to 5,..a6.
6.   ...                 b7xc6
Z   £f1-d3
It prepares for a kingside fianchetto (as
mentioned, in response to either S...a6
or   to  5,,,Wc7).  In  the  other  Sicilian
variations  this  indicates  White s  desire
for a quiet game that avoids the critical
lines. However, here rhe fianchetto con-
tains  a  drop  of  poison:  the  e4-pawn t
which  is  often  under  pressure  in  the
Paulsen,  is   now   well   protected,   the
g2-bishop  bears  down  on  the  queen-
side, and at times tactical motifs centred
cn  He I  and  the  sacrificial  move  fed 5
are possible, The game becomes funda-
mentally  positional  in  nature, but  cur-
rent  theoretical assessments give White
a  small  but  unpleasant  initiative.  In-
deed, so much so, that probably the best
option for Black is to play d7-d6 on the
7 th    move     (after    protec tin g    th e
c6 square  well  with  6...®c7 -  if  this
has been  played on  the  5 th move, now
fe..a6 is required  to avoid die irritating
move    fedbS),    transposing    to    a
Scheveningen  variation  that should not
cause Black great problems.
B3)      6.   McHe3        WdB-c7
Z    ®d1-d2       feg8-f6
8,   f2-f3
This  variation, running along  the lines
of  the English Attack, has recently be-
come more popular.
The position produced is different from
what you usually find in the Sicilian De-
fence.  Blacks  centre  is  reinforced  and
there  is   no  longer  a   knight  on   d4,
which is so unpleasant for  Black in  the
Sicilian.   However,   in   compensation
White can develop his pieces in an nat-
ural  and  active  fashion. Moreover,  the
move  ...ab  proves  to  be  pointless  and
the bishop on c8 is not a pretty sight. Tn
short,  virtues  and  defects  compensate
for each  other,  but  die relative  novelty
of the line is appealing  to those players
who  are attracted  to territory which  is
still theoretically unexplored.
B2)      6.   g2’g3
Another   variation   that   is   employed
quite a. lot by white players.

thought that the second  player  has easy
counterplay. However, things are not so
simple  and  White’s  initiative  remains
dangerous.
with a slight edge for White.

a    £cVe3
Now  we are in  the key  position of the
Paulsen F    in    which    Black   can    put
Whites   centre   under    pressure   with
8 . ,b$ or the more commonly played
8.
Prom a statistical point of view, 8. . .Jfb4
is one  of  Black s  most  trustworthy op-
tions, This should come  as no  surprise,
since  if  White  proceeds  mechanically
he. can  easily  find  himself in  difficulty
Therefore White's best move — unless of
course you  already know  what it is -  is
not very easy to find:
9.   £sc3-a4!
B4)       6.   J&f1-e2
This classical move remains the main line.
Instead  of  6,„Wc7, Black  can  continue
with   rhe  Tainianov  Variation   in   the
strict   sense   of   the   form,   by   playing
6,./bge7t   with  the  aim  of  exchanging
on   d4   and    bringing   out    the   while

However,

ing, This is particularly  clear when it is
compared  to the overall win  rate of  29
% (or  the Sicilian, higher  than  for  any
otherof  Black's defences, and testimony
to the Sicilian's combative nature,

It is true that Black has a weak pawn on
dS   and   is   without   his   dark-squared
bishop,  However,  after   the   usual  se-
quence
10. Jlf1-d3        00
11. 0’0               d5-d4
12. £c3e2
we have a position which is different to
the  classic  isolated  d  pawn  positions.
Here   the   pawn   has  advanced   to  d4.
Black has  gained  a  good  space  advan-
tage   and   control   of   the   dS -square.
White maintains a minimal  plus, but it
is difficult to gain anything concrete, as
is  apparent  from   the  unusually  high
draw rate.

Setting  up  the  Maroczy Bind pawn for-
mation (pawns on c4 and e4) either im-
mediately  or  after  5.0  0,  is  even  more
justifiable here  than  usual, as  there is no
light-squared   bishop  that   can   become
l)ad P   However,  Black  can   get   perfectly
playable positions by ftanchettoing along
the  lines  of  an  Accelerated  Dragon,  or
advancing  the  pawn  to e6  and  establish-
ing  a  Hedgehog Defence. For example,
Black has no problems after
The  most   popular  minor   variation  in
response  to   2„.d6  is  3_,&b5~H White
reaches quiet positions, which are com-
paratively   unexplored.  However,  it   is
important  to  have  a  positional  under-
standing of the various pawn structures
that can occur.
Whites  percentage  of  wins  is  not  ex-
traordinary;  and   the   high   number  of
draws  is  an  indication of  the  line’s so-
lidity-

This  non-committal  move  often  arises
from     the     Rossolimo     Variation
(2,./hc6 3.Ab5d6),

White can continue with

pares for a possible retreat of  the bishop

Alternatively   you   can   continue   with
5.c3 P and  then  d2-d4t  in  some  tactical
lines   sacrificing   the   e4~pawn   for   a

If    instead White immediately plays 4,d4,

White  immediately  opens  the  game so

Now   Black   has    basically   two   ap-
proaches■
C1)       5,   ...                  C5xd4
6.   Wd1xd4
Now    Black   regularly   advances   the
e  pawn chasing the queen away

C)         3.                        £>b8-d7
It  is  true  that  this  leaves Black  with  a
weak  backward  d6-pawn. However, in
an   age   when    the   Svechnikov   and
Kalashnikov   Variations   are   hugely
popular,  this  can  no  longer  scare  any-
one; even if White  keeps an unpleasant
initiative with correct play
C2)       5.   ...                  a7-a6
The ambitious approach, which aims to
gain  the  advantage of  the  bishop  paw:
however,  Black is  behind  in  develop-
ment after
6,   AbSxdZd-    £f6xd7
The  resulting  position  is  fraught  with
danger for Black, Ideas such as 5?id5 are
in  the air, and  Black must defend  him-
This  ambitious  move  is  the  riskiest  of
the  three.  Black puts  his  faith  in  the
bishop pair  and  the substantially  solid
nature of the position, but  the price he
pays is a cramped game  that  emails an
abundance of tactical dangers. The vari-
ation  is  therefore  playable,  but  Black
should  have  a  good  knowledge  of  the
lines involved.

the  e4-e5  pawn  advance  is  no  longer
possible and so  the  game  develops into
a slow struggle characterized by a lot of
manoeuvring.   White   can   start   with
4. JLeZ as 4„.‘?lxe4 is impossible on  ao
After  2 . L Ld 6 White can  play other  quiet      count of  5,Wa4-H
lines  and   avoid  a  lot  of  theory  Curi-
ously the beginner’s move

Now  a  look  at  some  ocher  minor  sys-
tems: after the normal
3.   d2-d4
Black sometimes continues with
3.                        £ig8-f6
has  become popular: with  the pawn  al-
ready  on  d6  the  freeing  pawn  advance
to   d5   is   not   usually   played,  as   this
would    require   another   tempo   and
Whitt   continues  solidly  with   d3 T  c3T
b3 s  4&bd2 etc,  along  the  lines of  the
Closed Variation of the Ruy Lopez.
By postponing  the  exchange on  d4  by
one  move,  Black  seeks  to  cake a  bit  of
the  sting  out   of   minor  continuations
such   as   4,Wxd4   or   5.f3,   since  after
4,£jc3  White  no  longer  has  the  possi-
bility   to   play  c2<4,  However,  White

can  deviate  with   4.dxc5f   with   good
prospects of  obtaining an edge.
3.   d2-d4           c5xd4
Here, there is another very popular mi-
nor variation:
4,   Wdtxd4
Every now and then (after 1 ,e4 c5 2/bf3
d6  3,d4 cxd4)  the following  minor line
will pop up in a tournament game:

5.   f2-f3
AMiH :;ES$  -4*3                     yS&r.■
White  protects  e4  with  the  f-pawn  to
delay  the  development  of  the  queens
knight,  and  in  so  doing,  he  is  able  to
play c7~c4. However, Black can respond
effectively in the centre with
5,   ...                  e7-e5l
obtaining good play
The  Hungarian Variation,  If Black at-
tacks the queen with
4.   ...                  Ab8~c6
5.   £JVb5
And  after  the  exchange  on  c6,  White
will   usually  continue  with   JstgS  and
0-0- 0, with a lot of  pressure on the cen-
tre  and  good  piece  play  For  example,
after

sates for his opponent s bishop pair
If  on the other hand, Black does not at-
tack  the  queen  immediately  (playing,
for  example,  4...a6),  White  can  con-
tinue  with  5.c4,  setting  up  the  classic
Maroczy  Bind  formation.  Or  he  can
develop normally with Sc3 , Jle3, etc.

Black is  the  one  who  can  get  off  the
beaten path with
5.   ...                  e7-e5
This move is not often played because it
does not have a good reputation. How-
ever, for now at least, there is no appar-
ent refutation.

well, given that ..Ub<i7 is a natural de-

This  was  frequently  played  by  grand*
master Viktor Kupreichik. Even though
5..,J&d7 is not played often, it does have
its objective validity, On  d7  the bishop
supports  the  knight  on   c6  and  it  is
ready  to go to c6 after  the exchange of
the enemy s knight in the centre, which
is a move that always makes Blacks po-
sition  less cramped. This  variation  en-
joys particularly  good  results,  perhaps
because of its surprise effect. An excel
lent idea  for White is to use an English
Attack set-up (fj> g4> h4 b      eS, 0-0-0),
in  which  the  d7  bishop  is  less  useful
than in other Sicilian variations.

A normal developing  move, which af-
ter  the  predictable 6„.e6, gives White
the  option  of  establishing  an  English
Attack   set-up   with   f2-f3 t     0-0-0,
g2-g4  etc.  That  is  even  more  danger-
ous here, as the black knight, which is
already on c6,  makes Blacks position a
little  rigid  (against  the  English  Attack
the  knight   is  better   placed  on   d.7)..
However,   Black   can    try    to    upset
Whites  plans  with  6,..e5  or  with, the
ambitious 6-.fig4 r  and  he should  not
have too much difficulty in  reaching a
balanced game.
We have reached  the  position which  is
best known as the Classical Sicilian,

In. old  opening  reference  books,  the
move  6.Jig 5  against  the  Classical  Si-
cilian   was   called   the   An ti- Dragon
System*  And  indeed  the  initial  idea
was to prevent 6,,,g6, as after 7,.Axf6,
Black is left  with  bad  doubled  pawns.
It was only  after  the  Classical Sicilian
had   been   developed   that   the   move
6.Ag5  was used for  its objective mer-
its.
After the  usual reply of  6..,e6 the Ger-
man master  Kurt Richter first thought
of    the   continuation   7.    xc6    bxc6
8.e5 ?  which  today is considered to  be
objectively  dubious.  However,  it  did
have  the  merit  of  kindling interest in
6 ,Ag5,  Later the  Russian  opening ex-
pert   Vsevolod   Rauzer   (1908-1941)
conceived  the  plan which  is still  con-
sidered to  be  the  best today: combin-
ing 6. AgS with the developing moves
An  unprepared  white   player  can   be
taken   by   surprise   when   confronted
with  this. The move is connected with
some   venomous   tactical   lines   with
...Wa5 t  ,„Hc8 and a possible exchange
sacrifice on c3 .

This  is  very  dangerous,  as  8...U6  has
created, a  target  that  White  can  utilize
to   open   up   lines   of   attack   on   the
kingside.
B2)       8,   m                            Tc8-d7
To  avoid   being   exposed   to   a   pawn
storm t  Black sometimes delays castling
and   (after   7„.a6   8.0-i’M))  plays  this
move  instead  of  8,„h6k  thus  reserving
the  possibility  of castling queenside  in
some cases.
9.   f244
Another option, is EO continue with  the
normal developing move
3,                        J§,f8-e7
In this last case, White usually proceeds
with
10,    d4-f3
Putting pressure on the d.6-pawm

1 1 .eSl? is also interesting, After the text
Black can  sacrifice  the  d6-pawn  with
1 1 ...Axf6, which was a popular conhn
nation  in  the  1960s; however, it is  not
completely sound. Alternatively he can
continue with the solid
11. ...                  g7xf6
Now   there  are  various  strategic  op-
tions:   Black   can   break   up   White $

producing  a  pawn  structure  which  is
common   in   these   variations.   White
seeks  to  put  the  c6pawn  under  pres-
sure   with   the  advance  f4-f5 T  g2-gX
Af  I -h3       and       the       manoeuvre
4ic3-e2-f4), in  order  to  force  Black to
play  ,.e6-eS with a resulting weakness
on  dS. Black has the  two bishops, usu-
ally   he   castles   queenside   and   grabs
space on that flank.
In  conclusion, die Richter-Rauzer is a
variation  that  does  not  involve  forced
tactical lines, which are common in  the
Dragon, the  Najdorf  and  the Sozin. It
is strategically subtle and complex, and
it is thus well suited to players who ex-
pect  co win  by  virtue  of  their  better
general understanding of  the gam e.

cxd4 4.®xd4 4j£6 S   k3  £jc6 with the
idea of  advancing the pawn to g6 on the
6 th move.
However,  Rauzer’s move                (see
the  previous  section)  with  the  idea  of
creating doubled pawns on  the f-fik in
the event of  6.     6,
meant  that this move sequence was not
very attractive for black players wishing
to fianchetto on the klngside.
The name Dragon came about at the be-
ginning of  the  20th century and  it  was
the  happy  brainchild  of  the  Ukrainian
master  Fedor Duz-Khotirnirsky  He  was
crazy about astronomy and he noted that
there was an  analogy between the form
of  the  pawn  structure  d6-e7-f7-g6-h7
and the dragon-shaped Draco Constella-
tion; as a result, the fire- breathing  beast
of Greek mythology  finds itself back hi
chess opening theory
As mentioned  before, the modern  ver-
sion of  the Dragon with die move order
2„,d6 and 5,..g6 did not make its debut
until  1924, when it  was employed in a
Reci-Tar ukower  game  played  in   New
York> It   was   created  as  a   means   of
preventing  rhe  Maroczy  Bind  (5>c4),
which White can use against the Accel-
erated Dragon ( 2 „ ,     6 and 4.*-g6).
In the past it was also common to use a
type of  Deferred Dragon via the Clas-

This   fianchetto   development   of   the
kings  bishop,  which  avoids lines  that
are  too sharp or  overly theoretical, has
always  enjoyed   a   certain   popularity
with players who  wish  to enter a more
strMegical ly -orientated game.
However,  with  correct  play, Black will
not  have  any  problems in  achieving  a
satisfactory  position  with  chances  for
both sides, for example:
Wliite intends to play WJLfl , with  the
idea  of  ??idS and  ,&g$. The  resulting
pressure  is not  enough  to give  him an
objective advantage,  bin  it  can  still  be
annoying for Black.

Naturally, White  is not  the  only  player
moving  his  pieces, and  on  the  queen-
side Black is often the first to be able to
threaten  the  safety  of  the  opponents

become some  of  the  most  complex in
opening theory

Or also the immediate 7 ...fec6.
a    Wd1 d2       febfic6
We have arrived at the first big theoreli-
cal crossroads.
The    Levenfish   is   another   variation
which has always had its admirers. This
is  perhaps because after the spontaneous
6„JL#7, the move 7.e5l gtufs White a dan-
gerous initiative*
If  Black does  not  have a  good  knowl
edge of  the  narrow path that leads  to a
likely draw,  there  is a  good  chance  he
will be beaten.
The safest option for Black is to prevent
the pawn advance e4-e5 with
6.                        feb8~c6
with a balanced position.
The  real  theoretical  revolution  regard-
ing the Dragon started in 1 936 with the
advent of

Black is  ready  to  play  the  freeing  ad-
vance 9,.,d5. White can try  to stop this
with either 9„&c4 or 9,g4, or otherwise
ignore it with 9.0 -0-0.
12. a2-a3           Ra8-b8
13. h2-h4           5f8-c8
Now   White   usually   simplifies   with
14,Sd$, followed  by  the  exchange of
queens.  He   contents  himself  with   a
microscopic  advantage,  without  risk-
ing  a  direct  assault  on  Black’s castled,
king.
A)         9.   g2-g4
B)         9,   0-0-0
This  prevents  9„.d5,  which  won Id  be
met  by   l0,g5,  after  which   1 L&xdS
simply   wins   the   d  pawn.   However,
compared  to 9 0-0-0, White's position
becomes more rigid. Usually the g2-g4
advance  as  part  of  a  general attack  on
the    kingside   is   played   only    when
necessary
The most common, continuation is;
9,                        Ac8-e6
10, 0-0-0
After  lO&hxed  fxe6 f  the  weakness on  f3 be-
comes apparent.
10-,..                  &c6xd4
11  xe3xd4       Wd8-a5
Ignoring Black’s ‘threat’ and putting his
faith in his lead in development and the
pressure on  the d-file. Black can decide
against    9„.dS 5      and    instead    play
9,..£htd4,

White has a slight advantage.

White’s  generally  preferred  continua-
tion is
12. &e3-d4        e7-e5
13- Ad4-c5
Now Black offers an exchange sacrifice
with
13.                      ic8-e6
banking  on  his  control  of  the  dark-
square   complex.   However,   White
rarely accepts this Greek  gift and  con-
tinues
14. Tc3e4
This is Blacks  thematic reaction in  the
Yugoslav Attack. The resulting position
is sharper than after  9...&xd4, Strictly
speaking,  the  d-pawn  push  is  a  pawn
sacrifice.:

White rarely  ventures to accept it; even
if  after 12.©xd5 cxdS B>x.d5
with a complex position.
C)         9.   &fVc4
This ‘standard’ move prevents „.d.5 and
places  the  bishop  aggressively  on  the
diagonal that points straight at the black
king.

the b-iile, Instead, White’s  plan is gen-
erally: h4-h5 ± a  possible g  -g4, &b]  -
which denies Black several tactical pos-
sibilities- .-&h6 r etc.
Nowadays, only  a few  enthusiasts  play
this line,
11, &c4-b3        If8-C8
However,  as  always  in  the  opening,  a
move  diac  brings  advantages  also  has
weaknesses:  rhe  bishop, be  it  on  c4 or
b3 -  its usual retreat square ~ is exposed
to an advance by Black s a and b- pawns;
and. then after the  thematic manoeuvre
..,®e5“C4, it is exchanged for  the black
knight.  Therefore,  it  is  worth  asking
yourself  whether it is worth moving the
bishop to bJ  only to have it exchanged
off   However,  Black  too   must  spend
time   — three   moves  -   to   move   the
knight  from  b8  to  c4.  In  these  varia-
tions, opposite-side  castling  is  normal
and an extra tempo can be decisive.
After 9d&c4, Black continues to develop:
9.                        ,fcc8*d7
10. 0-0-0
And now  Black has several plans at his
disposal. It is worth remembering  that
White can  advance  the  h-pawn  before
he  cashes,  but  this  usually  leads  to  a
transposition to the main line.

makes  you  doubt  the  validity  of  the
whole variation.

lowed  by  ...Exc4.  In  some  variations
that   were   created   later,   Black  plays

A thematic: exchange sacrifice which  is
practically forced,
Therefore  the  most  popular  move  has
become the preparatory
13,  Te3-g5
White removes the bishop from e3 and,
reserving the possibility to exchange on
f6, he  renders the  imminent pawn ad -
vance g2-g4 more incisive.
It look a long  time  before black players
found an adequate response in  this posi-
tion. The solution was the strange move
13,                      Hc8-c5!
First played by Genna Sosonko in 1976.
White sacrifices a pawn for a kings!de
initiative. After  I4.,.    xh$ 15,g4ftf6 t
White has many playable moves, rang-
ing   from   the   aggressive    I 6.e5   or
16.    h6  to  more  solid  moves such  as
U.&deZ,    16,£lb3    or     16.     bl.
Against  all  these  options,  Black  ap-
pears to have adequate resources with
which  he can  keep the game dynami-
cally balanced-
C22)    12...                  h74i5
The  Soltis  Variation, which  has  been
very popular recently.
In   the   early   days   of   the   Dragon   U
seemed  contradictory  to  play  a  move
that allowed White  to open files on  the
kingside  by  the  g-g4   advance.  How-
ever, practical  play  has shown  that  the
two moves that White needs to make in
preparation  for  gl-g4  allow  Black  to
find adequate counterplay,
The plan to remove the g7  bishop with
1 3.Ah6 does not seem to give White an
advantage   either   after   1 3 „ Ak.4,   or
13... Axh6 1 4.Wxh6 Sxc3 i
On the Sth rank this rook has both a de
tensive  and  an  attacking  role.  It  sup-
ports the advance ,,.b7-b5 and in many
variations prepares for an exchange sac-
rifice   taking   the   g5 -bishop,   or   the
knight after ftd5. Without this resource
the  Soltis   Variation   would   not   have
passed the test of  time.

rectly  to  aS. For  his  part,  White  has  a
good  space  advantage  and  this  allows
him  to implement a number  of  strate-
gies,  marked  by  then  varying  degrees
of  aggressiveness. However, most of  the
time,  White  concentrates  on  kingside
play  and  he  usually  limits  himself  to
preventive  measures  on  die  queenside
(such as a2-a4, to stop ,..b7- b5).
All of  this means that the Scheveningen
produces  positions which  are  strategi-
cally  highly   complex.  They   are   also
mom   flexible  than,  for  example,  die
comparatively  rigid  Dragon Variation,
even   if   in   some   variations   of   the
Scheveningen - such as the Veil mirovic
Attack  -  there are also long  sequences
of  forced  moves  that  leave little  space
for personal interpretation. Another ex-
ample   of   die  Schevcningen s   greater
flexibility is evident when you compare
it with its sister variation, die  Najdorf,
to which there are many transpositions.
The  fact  that  ,. a7-ah  has  not  yet  been
played allows for more options in some
lines. For example, it is not uncommon
to develop the bishop to c6 via d7, after
the exchange of  knights on d4.
Black also  has  an  advantage  compared
to the Najdorf  in rhe lines where While
develops   his  kings  bishop  to  c4,  as
Black can immediately put White's cen-
tre  under  pressure;  for  example,  with
the    manoeuvre   vbb8-a6-c5 d     from
where  the  knight  can  defend  e6  and
possibly  be  exchanged  for  the  bishop
on b3.
Another example is
6*  £c1-g5
which for  years has been  the main line
against the Najdorf  But. here it is not as
effectivef since after
This  variation,  characterized  by  black
pawns  on  e6  and  db,  which  control
many squares on  the  5th rank, can also
be  reached  by playing  Black s  2nd and
5di moves in  reverse order; in  particu-
lar, if Black dislikes the possible simpli-
fication with 3,Jkb.5-H
It  is  currently  very  popular,  especially
with  top  level players. It  bad its official
debut   in   1923,   when   Fuwe   used   it
against  Maroczy  in  the  Dutch  town  of
Schevenjngen,  which  is  how  it  got  its
name,  As with  other  variations  of  the
Open  Sicilian   (when  White  advances
his  pawn  to  d4),  Black is left  with  an
extra centre pawn.
The e6 and d6~pawns perform a defen-
sive  role and  Black s  counterphy is fo-
cused on  the queenside along the c-file;
and   the   use  of   the  a-  and   b-pawns,
which  are. generally  played  to  a6  and

ations, play can easily  become very ag-
gressive here. Once White stabilizes the.
centre, he can attack on the kingside by
advancing the g-pawn again m a kind of
Keres Attack Deferred,
The following line is a typical example:

on the motif  ...£lxe4.
However, it is  true  that  with  the  pawn
already  played  to  e6,  the  freeing  ad
vance. to e5 t  which is so frequent in the
Najdorf, requires an. extra tempo.
The variations that  we will look  at are:
6>g3 r 6,Ae3, 6,g4, 6.f4 and 6.JU2. For
the  lines in  which  the  king s  bishop is

We     really     should     call     it     the

oped  in  the  1980s,  it  is  above  all  the
work   of  a  group   of  English  Grand-
masters  -   most  famously  John  Nunn,
Nigel Short and Murray Chandler.

Chess  Opening ksscntifih      Volume  I
White plays 6.Ae3  (or  6..13) and  Black

the case — instead of  the thematic 6...e5,
or the modern 6..3&g4.
O O O, g4  and  h4,  in  order  to start  an
direct attack against Black s king.
Black cannot remain passive in  the face
of this initiative, so he usually responds
energetically in the centre, with ...a7  a6,
...b7--b.S + ...Ab7, .,Ad7-c5 and the the-
matic ...dh-dS.
The  resulting  positions  are  very  com-
plex, so you will need steady nerves and
a good  memory. With time die follow-

The  much-feared  Keres  Attack  is  the
principal   bugbear   for   Scheveningen
devotees.  White  immediately  expands
on   the   kingside   with   decidedly   un-
friendly intentions.
It   had   its   victorious  debut  in   1943
when   it   was   used   by   the   Estonian
champion Paul Keres in a game against
Efim Bogoljubow. This was  the  first of
many   victories   that   tilts   attack   has
notched up, and it has become so feared
that   many   prefer   to  first   play  5...a6
(Najdorf), so  that  the  g 4 -square is still
controlled by two pieces, and only after
White  replies  6.Ae2,  6„&e3 t   or  6.f4,
transpose     with      6,...e6     Io     the
Scheveningen. However, obviously, the
Najdorf  leaves  you  with  problems  to
deal with too. Number one is 6.Ag.S, as
we have already mentioned.
Back, to  6.g4. Now  the  moves  6...4foc6
and  6„,a6  are  playable; but  after  7,g5t
While lias achieved the space advantage
he was seeking. Eor this reason
and Black’s compensation for the pawn
is difficult to evaluate.
Please note  that  tins  variation is d assn-
fled under the Scheveningen because of
convention. In reality, most of  the time
you  will reach it  via the  Najdorf when

Aho   here   we   should  underline   that
there  is  another  possible  transposition
from the Najdorf If  after

is the most  popular move for Black. Il
has  its  advantages  and  disadvantages.
White's initiative is  slowed  down,  in
the   sense   dial   if   he   wants   to   play
hl-h.4 and  g4  gS he must first defend
the  rook  on  hl , and  when  the  pawn
advance  takes  place,  the  h8-rook  can
play  a  more  active  role.  In  addition,
the  extra  tempo  that  is  gained  allows
Black to  make  the  thematic pawn  ad-
vance . ..d6-d5 r
However,  by  playing  6 ,.,h.6  Black  has
weakened   his   kingside   and   castling
there is out of the question; yet castling
queenside also has its risks,
White's most common continuation is
7.   h24i4           £b8-c6
8.   Hh1-g1
Now Black usually responds with
8.   ...                  h6h5l?
the   position   has   transposed   to   the
Perenyi Attack. This has the ECO code
B81,  but  it  is  usually  reached  via  the
Najdorf (after  5„,a6  6.Ae3 e6  7.g41?),
and     rarely     by     means     of     the
Scheveningen (after 6.&e3 a6 7g4).
The  variation  is  very  dangerous  (for
both players!). A good example is:
7.   ...     "            e6  e5!?
8.   &d445         97-g6
Now  White is virtually  forced to sacri-

10. e4xf5
and   Black,  instead   of   retreating   the

However,  Black can  also  forgo  ...aZ-ab
and   play  other   promising  lines   with
..A3xd4  and   ,,,J&d7~c6 t    or   push   the.
pawn  to eS  at  the  right  moment. This
costs  a  tempo,  but  it  does  break  up

to play against the Scheveningen:

> ili
A AB
This remains a popular choice <
White  usually  proceeds  -with    ,e3d  f4 L
0-0 b and a possible a4, ‘ifehl , and  then it.
is not rare for him  to pul the bishop on
d3 r  die queen on  g3 h and after Hadi  or
Sae I , to get ready for the pawn advance
e4-e5. He can also calmly plan a possible
g2-g4-g.5 push. White s pieces are flexi-
bly  placed,  and  he  must  be  careful  to
prevent  Black’s eoumerpiay  which  can
become  very  menacing  in  case  White,
rushes ahead without sufficient thought,
for  his part, Bhck can continue in das-
This variation is characterized by White
playing   fairly   aggressively    without
burning all his bridges. This is  particu-
larly the case  when  While  proceeds  (if
Black allows) with Wf3 and 0  0  0. and
then  attacks  on  the  kingside  with  his
pawns. If  Black plays ...a7'-ah you trans
pose to variations more usually reached

sicai fashion  by  exchanging  on  d4,  in
order to put White $ centre under pres-
sure   with   ../#c7 b    _a7-atv   ...b7~b5,
...Ab? and . r,b5-b4.
If  White purs bis  pawn  on  a 4,  to hrait
Black s activity on  the queenside, Black
can  adopt  a  type, of  Hedgehog  forma-
tion  wliich  is very adaptable and difib
cult to dem.
Therefore, as in  the  6/4  line, it has re-
cently  become  more  popular  to  forgo
the  ‘Najdorf’  pawn   advance  .,.a7-a6,
and      instead      immediately      seek
counterplay in  rhe centre  with  ,,/&.xd4
(obviously  after  ...£>c6)  followed   by
.,.Ad7-c6. Alternatively Black can push
his  pawn  to eS,  which  simplifies,  and
gives Black a  playable position, even if
there are fewer prospects of  winning.
Another  modern  set-up,  which  in  the
past was underestimated, is for Black to
develop his knight to d7 instead ofcb. It
is certainly  more  passively placed  here
and  has  less  influence  on  the  centre.
However, if  Black manages  to success-
fully complete his development, he can
then relocate it actively on c5, or on  the
c4  square viab6.
Of the  many plans and  strategies avail-
able, we will  look  at the main  line,  by
which we mean the line that is most of-
ten played in tournaments:
6.   ™                  a7*a6
7,   0-0               Af8*e7
8-   f244             0-0
9,   &gVh1        Wd8*c7
10. a2-a4
White can. also refrain from this and in-
stead  opt  for  the  old  plan,  which  is
more   direct   and   entails   more   risk:
10.Wei  4k6   H.&e3  #Axd4 12.Axd4
bS 1 3.a 3 Ab 7 1 4.®g3 , with sharp play
10,                      ftb8-c6
11.  Ac1-e3
For  the  reasons  explained  above,  this
position  is more  often  reached  via  the
Najdorf
1
A
A®   SBAWA
Alii

:   AA   1    A A
Here is an  example of  the  type of  play
char can follow:
11. ...                  Mf8-e8
12. Ae2-f3         3a8-b8
13, g2-g4           £ic6xd4
14. Ae3xd4       e6-e5
15. f4xe5           d6xe5
16. Ad4-a7        Sb8-a8
17. g4-g5           Ee8-d8
18, WdVe2        ftf6-e8
19. ,&a7"e3          .c8-e6
with a complicated position.

sible  further advance co f5 t   in  order  to
rapidly  apply  pressure on  e6 t   and  thus
add  some  sense  to  the  development of
die bishop to the a2-g8 diagonal, where
it would otherwise be less influential.
It  is  not  without reason  diac  the  game
plan  of  the  highly popular English At-
tack,   i,e,   the   pawn   advances   £2-f3T
gl-g4  and  h2-h4 t  does  not  include the
development of  die  bishop  to  c4,  and
indeed in  the Sozin  this pawn  configu-
ration  proves  co  be  largely  ineffective.
The only exception, in  this sense, is the
main  line of the  Dragon, in  which this
set-up  does  include Ac4,  However,  in
this  case  the  bishop  only  has  die  pro
phy1actic role of  preve min g .„d 6 -d5,
Another  great  advocate  of  the  deploy-
ment of  the £1  bishop to c4 during the
1960s   was    rhe   future    1 Hh    World
Champion,  Bobby  Fischer,  who   came
up  with  many  new  ideas  for  White  -
an d   for   Bl ack1  In   recognition   of  his
many   contributions,  some  experts  at
tach his name to Sozin s when denoting
die whole system. However, we will cal]
it by its usual name,

7,Ab3 is called  the  Fischer Attack only
if  it is played in the Na jdorf; that ist after
5.         a7*a6
6. Athc4    e7 e6
or via the Scheveningen (S„,e6 6,<fi.c4)
when Black plays 6,,,a6.
Z >c4-b3l?
With  this  precautionary  retreat  by  the
c4  bishop  to  b3,  White  is   making  a.
move  that  will  be  necessary  sooner  or
later  (even  if  7,0-0  and  7,a3  are  both
playable) ,
In this section we will discuss die varia-
tions in. which  White  plays Ac4  on  the
6th   move   against   the   Scheveningen,
the Najdorf, or the Classical Sicilian. It
is evident  that  there are  many  strategic
similarities and transpositions, and thus
it  seemed  logical  to  look  at  them   to-
gether rather than in  the respective sec-
tions  for  each  variation.  The  develop-
ment  of  the  bishop  to  c4  gives  a clear
strategic quality to each variation,
Hie   Russian   master   Veniamin   Sozin
(1896-1956), whose name has become
attached to this system, was not the first
to play 6,Ac4. You can see examples of
it   being   played  occasionally  in   some
1 9th   century  games,  However,  Sozin
was the first  to show  what  White $ best
plan  is in some  games that were played
in  the  1930s, This  plan  is  to  combine
J&.c4 with  the advance EM4  and  a  pos-

counterplay on  the  queenside  with  the
manoeuvre    .,.4bbd7-c5,    or     with

We  will  first  take  a  look  at  7...   -bd7,
which  is  fashionable  at  the  moment,
but  which  was  considered  to  be  theo-
red cally  bad. in  the  past,  k  was  played
more   than  once   by  Kasparov  in   his
1993    World   Championship   match

This   has   now   become   ah   the   rage.
Played by Fischer in  1960, its real pop-
ularity began when Kasparov adopted it
in the 1 990s.
Here  we  have  a  rare  case  where  play
when  restricted  exclusively  to  pieces,
proves to be dangerous.
Blacks  problem  is  that   the  threat  of
10x5   cannot   be   prevented  with   the
natural-looking   9..J&b7   because   of
l0.Axe6! fxe6  1 l,4hce6, with  a strong
attack. Therefore play proceeds with
9.   ...                  Wd8-c7
10. Wf3-g3        0-0
11.    c1-h6!       £if6-e8
Now White has an unpleasant kingside
initiative.  However,  with  correct  play
Black should  be  able  to  maintain  the
balance.
practice has shown  that Black s position
is perfectly playable.

The  direct  8.f4  followed  by  f4-f5  is
playable,  bur  does  not  give  more  than
equality.

this position via the Classical Sicilian:

We can  call  this  position  the Classical
Sozin, as it  was played this  way in  the
1930s. White searches for a balance be-
tween  aggressiveness  and  solidity  and
he prepares an initiative on the kingside
without burning all his  bridges  behind
him.

Here is another famous variation where
White s light-squared  bishop  is  devel-
oped  to c4. You should note that White

This  is  a  prophylactic move,  which  is

Now  Black must  choose. He  can leave

it  for  the  bishop on  b3, but  this leaves

ular in 1965, following some brilliant
victories  by  its  creator,  the  ’Yugoslav
GM   Dragoljub   Veiimirovic,   It   was
sometimes played  by Fischer; he used
this  variation  in  a famous  game  with
Larsen  in  1970,  which  he  lost.  This
aggressive line  has never achieved  the
popularity   of   the   Rich ter- Ranker :
probably  because  most  players  prefer
not   to  play  such  a  one  dimensional
line,  and   instead  would   rather  play
something   strategically   more   com-
plex.
Black generally continues with

to the rook s placement on d4  by clear-
ing  the  way  to  h4  with  15.e5’?  Black
would  be wise  to  not accept  die  prof-
fered   pawn   immediately;   instead   he

Sicilian  Defence “   Najdorf  Variation
We are dealing with a very flexible con-
cept: Black plays the move ...a.6, which is
always useful  in  the  Sicilian; he  main-
tains die option to advance die pawn to
e6 (transposing to the Scheveningen) or
to  eS, depending  on  the  circumstances
and  the personal taste of the player. This
is Kasparovs approach, and he generally
opted for <„e6 when  Withe chose posi-
tional   continuations   such   as   6JLe2.
Fischer, on  rhe other hand,  preferred  to
remain in  the spirit of  Najdorf with the
thematic pawn advance to e5.
You should note that the move 5...a6 is
played to make  ,.,e7-e5  possible with-
out  receiving  check  on  b5: if  5...e5 is
played  immediately  it  gives the  white
knight   advantageous   access   to   the
f5-square,  as  explained  in  the  section
on minor variations after 2„,d6.
A reader may well ask why a move like
,..e.S is  so  important  in   the  Najdorf,
given the hole it creates on dS?
The   answer   lies  in   the   fact  that  the
Najdorf   is at lieart an ambitious line that
aims to put the e4-pawn under pressure!
In  the  Open  Sicilian,  with  die  white
d-pawn  gone, and the fepawn on 14, the
’poor1 e pawn is subject to attack by the
adversary $       pieces.       Wfo.rn       the
kypermodernists  provocatively claimed that
'Le4 was an error, they may have been  par-
tially correct! Black blocks the path of the
e4-pawn with ...eS, preventing that extra
step forward that is so dangerous in the
standard  variations:  he  then  exchanges
on f4 and begins to attack it with ,„b5 to
develop    the    bishop    to    b7 .    with
,. AW -c5 and sometimes with ..,Be8,
In  some  exemplary  games  by  Fischer
and  other  Najdorf  experts  this  plan  is
carried out brilliantly.

The advance „.a7-a6 on the Sth move is
the move that defines the Najdorf  Vari-
ation,  It has become the  most  popular
of  all Sicilian variations. This is hardly a
surprise, as it  was the  mythical cham-
pion  Bobby  Fischer s  favourite  choice
during  the  1960s and  1970s.  In  addi
non, from the 1980s on > Gary Kasparov
used  it  almost  exclusively  Champion
players have always dictated chess open-
ing fashion. We may not be able to play
like these guys, but we can at least play
their openings!
Played by  Esteban Canal as  far  back as
1929  (1),  S...a6  was  also  used  by  the
Czechoslovakian   Karel  Opoceasky   in
die  1930s.  It  became  popular  in  the
1 940s and acquired its name in honour
of  the Polish-Argentinian player Miguel
Najdorf' (1910-1997), one of  the stron-
gest non-Soviet players after die Second
World War.

Naturally, the .,,e5 push does not always
work  in  Black's favour  k  does not  take
much  to  find  yourself  in  strategically
lost  positions,  as  some  of  the  young
Karpov's   adversaries   discovered    rhe
hard way That said, it is understandable
that 6,Ag3 was the first and most pop-
ular   antbNajdorf   continuation,  since
with  the £6-knight already  pinned,  the
move  6..e5  creates  a  weakness  on  dS
which   is   more   easily  exploitable  by
White chan in the other variations.
This  could  be  a  good  idea  for  those
who do  not  want  to get  bogged down
in too much theory. It prevents ...b7-b5,
therefore it cannot be bad.
C)         6,   g2~g3
We will  now  have a look at White $ al-
ternatives on the 6th move.
A)         6-   KhVgl
The  Fianchetto  Variation is  relatively
popular with players who like quiet po-
sitions. After fe.eS,  the knight can  re-
treat to e2 or to b3 , in both cases with a
slow    positional   struggle.   Naturally
. ..e7'e6 leads to positions dealt with in
the section on the Scheveningen Varia-
tion.
D)         6,   h2-h3
Recently   this  strange   move   has   ap-
peared, which is played with the idea of
a g2-g4 advance.
B)         6,   a2 a4
This  is  the  move  that  Bobby  Fischer
played a few times when he had to fight
against   the   Najdorf   himself   White’s
idea  includes  a  g2-g4  pawn  advance

and, if  Black plays . . .e7-e5 t to retreat the
knight  to  e2  and  then  reposition it on
g3-
However, with. 6...e6i  Black can  trans-
pose  to  the  Scheveningen,  in   which
h2-h3 is of  doubtful use,
E)         6.   Af1d3
Of the minor variations, this best justi -
fies the idea of the Najdorfs 6,,,e5: af-
ter 7,4&de2
In Najdorf   style there is
6.   ...                  e7-e5
Black can  also  opt  for   6...e6,  which
transposes to  the Seheveningen,  or  he
can   choose   the   flexible   6.,.Wc7   or
6„Md7.

We shall now  turn  to  the ‘serious’ op-
tions,   at  least   from   a   statistical  fre-
quency viewpoint.
F)         6.   &f1-c4
We have already discussed this move in
the  section  on  the. Sozm-Veliimrovic
Attack,

We have reached a strategically complex
position  that is rich  in  possibilities for
both players.
Black can  gain  a  pawn  with  10,,.exf4
with  the idea -  after 1 1 „&xf4 -  to take
on   bZ  with  the  queen   (after   ..,Wb6
check),  Otherwise. in  the  event  of  the
prophylactic  1 1 .  ?h 1 , he can try to de-
fend    the   extra   pawn    on    f4   with
ll,..    hS.
Naturally    such    greediness   has   its
risks. Black can instead play the more

White  has  some  prospects of  an  initia-
tive on the kingside, but Blacks piece ac-
tivity gives him sufficient counterplay.
You should also note another possibility
on the 8th move for Black:
8.                       Wd8-c7
This   queen   move   prevents  the  white
bishop  from  establishing  itself  on  c4.
The  objective  is  a  kingsitie  fianchetto,

White can continue with the aggressive
9.   4cl ~e3
the subtle
9.   <&g1-h1
or the solid
9.   a2-a4
Each of  these produces complicated, po
sit ions  that contain plenty of possibili-
ties  for  both  players. Generally  White
seeks  to  exploit  the  weakness  of  the
d 5-square, and is careful to limit Black s
coumerplay.  He  then  aims  to  create  a
kingride  initiative  with  the  pawn  ad-
vance f2-f4.
Sometimes, an alternative strategy  is to
occupy  the d 5-square with  the  knight,
to recapture with the e4-pawn and then
to   make   the   most  of   his   queeiiside
pawn majority with  the pawn advances
b7_-b4 and c2-c4-c5.
This  Classical  Variation  is  becoming
more  and  more  popular While simply
wants to develop naturally before start-
ing  to  play actively  The  ensuing  lines
are of  a positional nature, but this does
not necessarily mean that they are easier
to handle: as in its sister variation in the
Schevemngen, tactical play usually starts
after the opening phase.
Yet   again,   Black   has   basically   two
choices:
A)  to   play   e6,   transposing   to   the
Scheveningen   (see   the  Scbeveningen
section for a detailed examination);
B)  to   continue   with   the   thematic
We have already  elaborated  on
the advantages and disadvantages of  this

players are increasingly resorting to
6*   f243l?
Now we have a position that is difficult
to evaluate.
It is easy  to see why  people  have such
differing  views  about  this  line:  Black
has lost a tempo to move the knight to a
fairly  unstable  position  on  g4,  On  the
other   hand.   White   has   moved   his
bishop  four   times   to   pin   it   on   g3d
whereas   his   adversary’s   bishop   has
already   taken   control   of   the   long
dark-squared   diagonal.   Naturally   the
price Black pays for his piece activity is
the strategically doubtful advance of  his
g- and h-pawus, which denies the black
king  a  quiet  refuge  on   the  Ringside.
However,  this  assessment  is  academic
and should not be seen as immutable: it

they enter the 6,Ae3 variation,
Black can  try  to  take  advantage  of’ the
negative aspects of  this idea with

countering an unprepared adversary. In
the  first  years of  the  new  millennium
there has been a return of  interest at the

the  quantity of  theory for  the so-called
minor  variations has now  also reached
disturbing proportions. After

The  last  of  die  alternatives  is  the  old
main  line  6 ,JLgS. Though  it  is  not  so
commonly  played  now,  its  appeal  re-
mains unaltered.
The  move, was  very  popular  from  the
1950s  until  tile  1980s  - or  more pre-
cisely, the line  that  continues with  7.f4
was by far the most common variation,
With    the   adven t   of   a    burgeoning
amount   of   theory,   creative    players
started to look for alternatives in  unex-
plored  areas, as they  had  become  tired
of  the fact tliat memory was becoming
as important a factor  as understanding
For this reason, the move 6.JLg5 was to
become a rarity in  the 1  990s, at least at
the  higher  levels. However, lower-level
players have always continued to show a
marked  preference  for  this  historically
important   and   fascinating   variation.
Their choice is probably inspired by the
hope  of  a  quick  checkmate  or  of  en-
with  the  idea  of  c4-e5.  7.Wf,3 h  which
was popular in die early days of  the vari-
ation, is now very rare. After 7.f4 there is
a  niajor crossroads: Black has a healthy
choice   from   six   major   continuations
which are all perfectly playable, plus two
minor lines (7,..Jtd7 and  7„,h6), All of
these  have a  lot  of  related  theory  and
they  are  strategically very  divergent  as
well;  small   wonder   that   6.Ag5   is  a
daunting prospect for the lazy player’

This   is   the   famous   Poisoned   Pawn
Variation: since its inception, it has al-
ways been the subject of  controversy. Its
colourful  name  would  suggest  a  scant
regard  for  the validity  of  the  variation,
but the experience gained from years of
practical play is that, the b2-pawn often
proves  to  be  a  tasty  morsel  for  Black,
and not a small pellet of  poisonous bait’
The  Poisoned  Pawn  Variation  first  ap-
peared in tournament play in the 19.50s
and  it  was  at  first  underestimated,  in
part  due  io  the  brilliant  victories  with
the white pieces obtained by Keres and
Tai. However,  there  is  nothing  as  per-
suasive  as  victory  and   Fischers  suc-
cesses  in   the   1 96Gs  with   the   black
pieces quickly  changed  the  opinion of
opening scholars and  players alike. This
is made evident by the fact that 7,,,®b6
was  Kasparov s  favourite  move.  How-
ever, it  rarely anyone felt brave enough
to  take him  on  with  this line. In  a cer-
tain  sense,  7...Wb6  is  perhaps  Blacks
most   logical   move:   with   the   dark-
squared  bishop  no  longer  controlling

White has two continuations:
E1)       9.   M4-b3
The  most  solid.  k  seems  unnatural  to
take the ®d4 away from the centre, but
the threat of  a2-a3 and BaZ forces Black
to act.

and White s compensation is difficult to
evaluate.

highly  complex  after  either  the  solid

15. 4:c3-e4
Some  continuations  have  been  deeply
studied  until  the  endgame stage:  with
correct  play  Black  maintains  at  least
equality  However,  it  obvious  that  we
are dealing with very risky lines that do
not  offer  many  opportunities  for  per-
sonal interpretation.

The most natural, and it is considered to
be the strongest, even if statistically the
results are in Black s favour!

9.   Ag5’h4       g7-g5l?
To break  up  the  white  pawn formation
on the kingside. Tills variation made its
simultaneous   (3)  debut   in   the   19SS
interzonal  tournament  in  Gothenburg.
Remarkably; three  Argentinean  players,
Pi Iink.  Panno  and  Najdorf, played  it  at
the   same   time   against   three   Soviet
champions:  Spassky; Geller  and  Keres,
respectively  The  result:  three  victories
for White’
The  implied  verdict  has  not  changed
with time: against correct play Black has
an   uphill   battle  maintaining  equality

The  so-called  Main  Line.  Black delays
counterplay  on  the queenside,  and  de-
velops naturally on the kingside. White
continues with
8.   Wd1-f3
to prepare queenside castling.
An attentive student might ask why  the
queen is moved to f3  and  not  to d2, as
is the case in  the Rich ter-Ran zer, This is
because on  f3  the  queen  is  more  use-
fully  placed  than  on  d2:  it  is  easier  to
transfer  it  to  g3  or  to  h.3 and  the  ad-
vance c4-e5 will gain force when  Black
plays  ...b7-b5.  Above  all,   the   move

White can  continue  with  Velimirovic’s
