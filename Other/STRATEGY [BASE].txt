SIMPLE CHESS
Michael Stean Simple C/less Is an introduction to chess strategy aimed primarily at those players for whom strategy in chess is an almost impenetrable mystery. By isolating the basic elements and illustrating them through a selection of master and grandmaster games. Simple Chess attempts to break down the mystique of chess strategy into plain, clear, easy-to understand ideas. The book assumes only a knowledge of chess terminology from the reader. Simple Clles.� Is not solely a lesson in chess fundamentrus, it also represents a style of chess playing which IS beconting increaSingly prevaient and suo::essful throughout the world. Almost all the games in the book are illustrative of this style which involves a slow-build-up, gradually accumulating small but permanent advantages, with the concept of attack being shelved for the later stages of the game. It is indeed the spread and success of this style of play that prompted the writing of thI

1. Introduction
Don't be deceived by the tille-chess is not a simple game-such a claim would be misleading to say the least-but that does not mean that we must bear the full brunt of its difficulty. When faced with any problem too large to cope with as a single entity. common sense tells us to break it down into smaller fragments of manageable proportions. For example, the arithmetical problem of dividing one number by another is not ooe that can in general be solved in one step, but primary school taught us to find the answer by a series of simple division processes (namely long division), So, how can we break down the 'problem' of playing chess? Give 0"'0 of the uninitiated a chessboard, a set of chessmen, a list of rules and a lot of time, and you may weI! observe the following process: the brighter of the two will quickly understand the idea of checkmate and win some games by 1. e4 2. Bc4 3. QhS 4. Q;\fl mate. When the less observant of our brethren learns how to defend his f7 square in time, the games will grow longer and it wilt gradually occur to the players that the side with more pieces will generally per se be able to force an eventual checkmate. This is the first important 'reduction' in the problem of playing chess-the numerically superior force will win. So now our two novices will no longer look to construct direct mates, these threats are too easy to parry, but will begin to Jearn the tricks of the trade for winning material (forks, skewers, pins, etc.), confident that this smaller objective is sufficient. Time passes and each player becomes sufficiently competent not to shed material without reason. Now they begin to realize the importance of developing quickly and harmoniously and of castling the king into safety. So what next! Where are their new objectives? How can the problem be further reduced? If each player is capable of quick development, castling and of not blundering any pieces away, what Is there to separate the two sides? This is the starting-point of Simple Chess. It tries to reduce the problem still further by recommending various positional goals which you can work towards, other things (i.e. material, development, security of king position) being equal. Just as our two fictitious friends discovered that the one with more pieces can expect to win if he avoids any mating traps, Simple Chess will provide him with some equally elementary objectives which if attained should eventually deCide the game in his favor. subject to the Strengthened provIso that he neither aHows any mating tricks, nor loses any material en route. Essentially, Simple Chc..' ss aims to give you some of the basiC ideas for forming a long-term campaign. It also shows you how to recognize and accumulate small, sometimes almost insignificant-looking advantages which may well have ![ltre or no short-term effect, but are permanent features of the pOSition. As the game progresses, the cumulative effect begins to make itself felt more and more, leading eventually to more tangible gains. This style of play is Simple and economical both In its conception and execution. Combinations and attacks are shelved for their proper time and place as the culmination of an overall strategy. Given the right kind of position it is not so difficult to overwhelm the opposition with an avalanche of sacrifices. The real problem is how to obtain such positions. This is the objective of Simple Chess. Undoubtedly the best way to improve your chess is by studying master and grandmaster games. For this reason I have used a selection of such games as a medium through which to put across the fundamental principles of simple chess. These games are mostly not of the type to capture the limelight of dless literature because they are too simple and unsensational, but for tlIis very reason they are suitable for showing off dearly the basic ideas I want to convey. As a preliminary to splitting the clements of simple chess into an array of recognizable objectives, as will occur in the ensuing chapters. I want to give you 2 something of the tlavor of what is to come in the form of three Introductory games containing most of the concepts and strategies to be elaborated later on. The first is a victory by ex-World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik over the Hungarian International Master Szilagyi in Amsterdam, 1966. One of the truly great masters of strategy. Botvinnik gives a typically powerful and very instructive display. We pick up the play in diagram 1 with BOlvinnik (White) to move: 8 7 6 4 3 2 1. a b c d e g h The position may at first sight seem quite good for Black. His piec£!s occupy good squares in the center, his king is very safe and he has a lead in d£!velopment having already connected his rooks on the back rank while White is a 10ng way fTOm doing so. However, positionally he has problems arising from the exchange of his Queen's Bishop for a Knight. In the long run he wlll find difficulty in defending his White squares. We shall see what this means in more tangible terms as th£! gam£! progresses.
12. b4
A space-gaining move. The center is fixed and White 3 does nOl want to advance 0]1 the Kingside for fear of exposing his own monarch, so the logical zone for expansion is on the Queenside. 12.
13. a 4
Bb6 RfdS Black dare not hit back with13 ..a5 because of 14. Ba3 foHowed by Nc4 or Nb3 with lots of dangerous possibilities on the a3-f8 diagonal.
14. Qc2 RacS
Black already finds himself lacking a good plan. A better idea has 14 ... NfS followed by Ne6 and as trying to get a grip on c5 Dr d4. Black's difficulties stem from the fact that he has no good outpost for his pieces. 15. Be2 In contrast Botvinnik's advance has given him a nice square on c4 which he can occupy with either a Knight or a Bishop. IS. csn Two question marks for a move which does not actually lose any material may seem a bit harsh, but I want to emphasize the point that before 15 ... c5 Black merely had problems, but now he is lost.
16. b5!
4 2. a b c d e 8 h Why Is Black lost? Material is equal and White hasn't gOt a piece beyond the second rate. The answer lies in the Pawns. White has two beautiful !\quares on c4 and d5, plus a mobile Pawn roller on the left flank, whereas Black's Pawns constrict his own pieces terribly, parocularly the Bishop. Botvinnlk now treats us to a vigorous exhibition of technical chess as he converts these advantages into a win. 16. 17. 18. 18. Nc' BgS! Ne8 N d 6 A surprise tactical shot, but its aims are positional. '6 The point of the combination. Black is forced to weaken yet another White square (e6) In the heart of his position. Refusal to fall in with White's plans is even more unpalatable: (i) 18 .. . QxgS 19. Nxd6 Rb8 20. Bc4

White's contra! of the poSition Is so great that he could inSCribe his initials on the board with his King if he wanted. Being rather less self'lndulgent, Botvinnik contents himself with one preparatory King move before embarking on the winning process On general pr!ndpies. his King willfeel safer on a White square. 27. 28. 29.

A perfect illustration of what is known as a White square strategy, something we will explore in more depth later on. For the moment, however, I merely want to draw your attention to the effortless simplicity with which Botvinnik established and drove home his advantage. With the possible exception of 18. BgS!, none of his moves could in any way be described as surprising or difficult to visualize, They were al! reany rather obvious. So why cannot everybody play Uke that? Well, they can providing they recognize and understand the importance of structure. The most important single feature of a chess position Is the activity of the pieces. This is absolutely fundamental in all phases of the game (opening, mtddlegame and especially endgame), a theme which I hope will become increasingly apparent as the book progresses. The primary constraint on piece's activity is 7 f g h the Pawn structure. Just as a building is constructed around a framework of iron girders, a chess game is built around an underlying Structure of pawns. The difference lies in the fact that the iron framework is fixed, whereas the chessplayer has a certain amount of flexibility with his Pawns. The job of the chessplayer must therefore be to use his skill to create a Pawn set-up which will allow his own pieces the optimum freedom and stability, while denying his oppOnent's similar scope. This is the problem of structure, which will be dealt with in some depth. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 3. a b c d e g h To take an example, let us go back to the position of Diagram 2 and examine it from a structural point of view. Removing the pieces from the board, but leaving the pavms, we have Diagram 3. From this we see very slrong squares or outposts for his pieces on c4 and d5. They are strong because neither can be challenged by a Black Pawn. In contrast, Black has no outposts at all. So arithmetically �peaking White had a 2-0 lead in outposts, a very healthy state of affairs. Bearing this in mind, notice the vital role played by the White Pawn on c3 guarding Black's natural outpost on d4. If White were ever to play the pOSitionally 8 backwards. f abysmal c41 he would not only give Black his long awaited outpost, but would also �motber his O\\IJl c4 square, thus equalizing the outpoSt score to 1 �1 at a stroke. Moreover the damage would be Irreversible. Pawns cannot move back... "ards. If you inadvertently put a piece on a bad square, you can always retract it at the cost. of :;ome time (and face), but in the case of a Pawn you arc lumbered with it for the rest of the game. Think twice about Pawn moves, especially in the center. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 4. a b c d e g h Returning to Diagram 3, is there any way for Black to Improve matters, structurally speaking? Certainly. If he could advance c5�c4, the world would suddenly be a much happier place for bim. Loo k at Diagram 4. Black now has three excellent squares c5, d3, and b3, while White has to be content with one (d5). So we see that White's c4 square is strategically the focal point of the position. Just as the outcome of a real battle may depend on controL of a high point or mountain dominating the surrounding terrain, a chess game can hinge around the struggle for control of one key square. In this case it is the square (4. Do you recall Botvinnik's 15th move Be2l It may not have seemed terribly significant at the time, but In fact shO\vs that he f had already fuUy recognized the strategic Importance of the <:4 square. Clever fellows these Russians] We now turn our attention to an even more striking demonstration of the power and importance of structure, this time given by the great master of defence Tigran Petrosian. The ninth game of his Candidates' Match with Lajos Portisch (Black) starled 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. b3 Hg7 4. Bb2 e5 5, g3 d6 6. Bg2 e5 7. O-O Ne6 8, Nc3 O-O 9. d3 NhS 10. Nd2 Bg4 11. a3 Bh6 reaching the position of Diagram 5, 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 s. a b c d e g h At a glance the Black p i eces may seem to be menacingly poised for a Kingside attack. On the other hand a quick look at the Pawn stnlCture reveals that White has an excellent outpost on d5, but how does that help? It certainly has no immediate value, as 12. NdS Nd4! 13. Bxd4 exd4 would allow Black to develop a lot of pressure on the e.-file. However, the ciS square is there to stay and if it cannot be profitably utilized at present, it is nevertheless a good investment for the future. With this in mind Petrosian chose.
12. b4!
The classical way to exploit a structural advantage in the center is with a thrust on the Oank, but here accurate calculation is also required. In the event of 12 ... cxb4 13. axb4 Nxb4 White plays 14. Ba3! (but not 14. Exb7 Nxd3!) with three possibilities: (i) 14 ... Nxd3? 15. h3 now wins a piece. Oil 14 ... Nc6 15. N(d2) e4 winning the d pawn. (iii) 14 ... aS IS. RbI regaining the Pawn with advan- tage as IS ... Nxd3? stlll fails to 16. h3. One might reasonably ask if it was not similar to drive away Black's Bishop with 12. 113 before playing b4 so as to avoid all the above complications based on the pin on White's e Pawn. The answer is that White does not want to make any Pawn move in front of his own King until it is abso/lJrely necessary, as it merely provides Black with a ready-made target to attack. For instance, 12. h3 Bd7 ] 3. b4 fs and .. .f4 could weU be dangerous for White.
12. N d 4
Black has some very dangerous threats. Not only is .. 6xdl and 14 ... Nb3 winning the exchange in the cards, but the Tal-like sacrifice 13 ... Nf4! 14 gxf4 Bxf4 followed by Qh4 is also in the air.
13. h3!
A sense of timing is the key to good defensive play. Here Petrosian accepts the weakening of his Kingside Pawns as he realizes that he can thereby completely repulse the attack. 13.
14. e3
Be6 cxb4 An anti-positional capture, but he has no alternative. After 14 ... Nc6 15. bxc5 dxcS 16. Nb3 Qe7 17. Na4 he simply loses a Pawn for nothing. 1 1

17. Bxh3
18. Bxa8 Bxfl 18 ... Qxa8 19. Qf3 is very much the same as the game.
19. Kxfl QxaS
20. Qf3!
A very strong move, if an equally obvious one. After 20 .. Qxf3 21. Nxf3 not only is Black structurally quite lost, but he has not even enough time to defend his a Pawn in view of the threatened g4 and gS winning a piece.
20. Qb8
This leads to the immediate and rather quaint loss of a piece, but there is nothing better to recommend. If you arc wondering why Black is so abjectly lost. compare the Pawn structures.

The double threat of <":('7 and Qh4! is dedsive. After the further mows 22 ... N{g7)f 5 23. gxfS Nxf5 24. e 4 Ng7 25. Ke1 NbS 26. Qh4 f5 27. Nd5 Black resigned. A resoundingly deciSive game to win again a World Championship contender, but Petrosian didn't have to work all that hard. His Pawns in their own quiet way did all the work for him. In both of the preceding games, Black's structural deficiency has taken the form of weak squares rather than the Pawns themselves being weak. In most cases these two effects (weak squares, weak Pawns) go hand in hand, as we shall see, For the moment, here is a game in which White uses the presence of weak Pawns In the enemy camp to tie dowrl the Black pieces and so launch a mating attack, despite the absence of QJ..ieens.

8 7 6 5 4 3 2 6. a b c d e g h The pOSition is tense. Black's Pawn on eS is weak, but that is his only weakness. The doubled c Pawns are not weak, not yet at a ny rate. On the other hand, White's double Pawns could well become weak as they are on an open file. Moreover, Black has an outpost on f4 and if given time for NhS and Rhf8 could easily seize the advantage, so ... 13.

The point. White recaptures control of the vital c4 square: by force, for if nOw 17... c4 then simply 18, Rddl and the Pawn on c4 cannot be held,

This lets the White Rooks loose, but 17...b4 18. Nc4 Ne8 is also dreadful for Black. It is nO accident that White's conquest of the c4 square is rapidly followed by the collapse of Black's game. IS. Ne4 NeS
19. Rxa4
Black's tortuous maneuvers (the Rook has moved to enable the Knight to defend the Bishop which defends his Pawns!) have maintained material equality, but left his King out in the cold. A typical example of the necessity to defend weaknesses drawing the defending forces out of position. 19. Kb7 What else?

Black is helpless against the threat of Rbb7 followed by Nb6+ mating. His pieces are mere spectators.
24. dS
2S. exd S Resigns. The moral behind this trilogy of games should be clear: Look after your Pawns and your pieces will look after themselves. To 'look after' one's Pawns is not the most difficult thing in the world, and the next few chapters illustrate how this can be done and how the pieces can be made to cooperate with their Pawns.
2. Outposts
We all like to attack. There is a streak of sadism running through every chcssplayer that helps him to sit back contentedly sipping a cup of tea while his opponent, head in hands, tries frantically to averl mate in three. But where do attacks come from? The mere action of pushing one or nvo pieces in the general direction of the enemy King does not constitute an attack. In general a successful attack can only be launched from a position of strength in the center of the board. This 'position of Hrength' can take various forms, the simplest being an outpost. As the name suggestS, an outpost is a square at the forefront of your position which you can readily Support and from where yOll can control or contest squares in the heart of the enemy camp. To be useful an outpost must be firmly under control and so should Ideally be protected by a Pawn. Conversely your opponent should not be given the opportunity to deny you access to your outpost, so in particular it must be immune to attack by enemy pawns. This last condition is far and away the most important and can indeed almost be taken as the defining property of an outpost.
- M
So as not to blur the issue with too many words let us look at some example� of outposts purely in term.<; of Pawn structure. In Diagram 7, there are plenty to be seen. White, from a Structural pOint of view, has outposts on dS, b6, b4, g4. One might also regard c4 and a4 as outposts, for although they are not supported by Pawns, they certainly are immune from attack by them. Black has supported outposts on f4, g3, and unsuppOrted ones on gS and hS. You may have noticed that all of White's outposts are on the Qpeenside, Black's on the Kingside, so with such a Pawn structure one \Nould normally expect to see White attacking on the left flank, and Black on the right. This is all very theoretical and hypothetical, far from the stark realism of practice. For example, one rarely encounters the plethora of outposts seen in Diagram 7. You often have to be satisfied with one, or less! 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 7. b c d e g h Tal-Bronstein, 26th Soviet Championship, Tiflis 1959

8 7 6 ; 4 3 2 8. a b c d e g 11 A quick look at the Pawn structure reveals that White has one outpost (on d5), Black has none. However, life is not quite so simple, as White is not the master of his c4 square, so mack can at any time create an outpost on d3 by playing c4. A typical state of affairs in these Ruy Lopez positions.

17. NgS c41
Black quite rightly refuses to be bullied into retreating his Bishop. He fully realizes the importance of White's outPOSt on dS, and so is willing La allow his Pawns to be shattered by

18. a4 Unable to make any further headway in the center, Tal creates a diversion on the wing.

Nxe7+ Resigns On account of 23 ... Q]{c7 24. QaS+. We have so far seen iIluSlrations of how to set up, secure and exploit outposts, but no due has been given as how to play against an outpost. The most usual way to counter an enemy outpost Is to cover it with as many pic(:es as possible so that when he occupies it with a piece, you can capture enough times [0 force him eventually to recapture with a Pawn. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 20. a b c d c g h For example, in Diagram 20, White has an outpost on f eS, but NeS can always be met by NxeS and after recapturing with the Pawn, his OUtpost is gone. Clearly he needs to bring another minor piece to bear on eS, so White to move would play 1. BgS and fonow it up with Bh4 and Bg3. If on the other hand Black is on the move, he would seek to prevent this. L.h6 is the obvious way, but a more active solution is preferable-namely 1...Qe8 (so as to meet 2. BgS with 2 ...QhS! threatening Rxf3) or 1...Qb6. Either move gives Black a fine position. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 21. a b c d e g h If you are unabJe to cover your opponent's outpost, then extremely active harassing tactics are needed. Diagram 2 1 shows a marked structural resemblance to Diagram 19, but the position features a vital difference--the White Knight has not yet reached dS. Indeed it is at least four moves away. This gives Black some breathing space, which he must make good use of. After the Knight reaches dS he is lost. The diagrammed position occurred in the game Unzicker-Fischer, Varna 1962.

The pieces must be able to coordinate with the Pawn structure. After all, what use is a body without a soul? 3 . Weak Pawns In the previous chapter we looked at Pawn structure from the point ofvlew of outposts and how an outpost acts as a pivot, about which the pieces can swing Into action. Without such an outpost as foundation, pieces tend to Jack the stability necessary for a successful assault and are liable to be driven back in confusion. It Is sheer folly to try to attack directly a well coordinated and deve.loped position. Many players underestimate the defensive resources Inherent in such positions and will in game after game bash Uleir heads against a brick wall instead of using their heads to first weaken the cement. The point they repeatedly fail to appreciate is that a very definite superiority In force is needed to ensure that an attack will be successful. This superiority can take either one of two forms: (i) Better development. This Is simply a c ..se of superiority In numbers. the aggressor being able to feed more pieces into the attack than the defender has avallable to fight them off. (Ii) Better coordination. This is a much more subtle form of advantage which one must "'ark hard to build up. The idea Is to disarm the defense by first tying its pieces down to the defense of certain point�, so that when the storm does break they have vel)' IitUe scope or opportunity to react. Here we concern ourselves primarily with the second condition. Outposts provide the necessary stability for the attacker, but something must also be done to destroy the defender's coordination. This is where the second aspect of Pawn structure, weak Pa\\IJ1s, comes in. If the defending forces can be reduced to the menial task of protecting Pawns, they wilt not he able to offer much opposition to a fuB-scale offensive. So what exactly is a weak Pawn and how is it recognizable? The answer is both Simple and logical. A weak Pawn is one which cannot be protected by another P"cl.wn and so requires support from its own pieces. Note that the criterion is the ability LO be protected by another Pawn, not the existence of such protection. Take the example of two adjacent Pawns on, say, d4 and e4. Neither protects the other but each has the ability to be guarded by the other, by advancing. We must therefore say that the weakness or strength of two adjacent Pawns depends on whether or not they are able to advance if the necessity arises. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 22.
[diagram]
Diagram 22 gives us an example of adjacent Pawns (d6, c6) which are very definitely weak, because neither can move, d5 is never feasible, as il leaves the e Pawn in the soup after the reply exd5 (note for this purpose the power of the White Rook on ell, while c5 leaves Black riddled with holes. The continuation of the game Hecht-Forintos illustrates well the combination of outpost play (fS) and the exploitation of weak Pawns. 1 . Bg5 A simple developing move which exerts great pressure on the Black Pawns. White bas many threats to win a Pawn, including the spectacular 2. NxeSJ 1 . Rfd8 Black has no choice but to defend passively. If he tries to iron out his weaknesses with L.Bxg5 2. Nxg5 dS, he merely tees himself up for the knockout punch, viz. 3.

Rd Turning the focus of attention to the c Pawn (he threatens to win it by capturing twice on (7), while preserving the harmony of the White position. 2 . Rac8 3 . Rc3! A multipurpose move illustrating clearly the maleffects of weak Pawns. White creates options to double on the c file (with Qj::2). double on the d file (Rd3) or possibly transfer the Rook to g3 at some later date. Black has no opportunity to reciprocate, but must on every move be prepared to meet each contingency. We see a definite rift between the mobility of the two armies opening up. When the gap becomes wide enough White will be able to bludgeon his way through the Black position without encountering much resistance. 3 . Bxg5 4 . NxgS Nf4 5 . g 3 B h 5 I f 5 ...Ne6, 6 .

6. Qd2 Ne6
7 , Nxe6 Qxe6 B . QgS Suddenly it's all over. There are three different threats (<n:g7 mate, QxhS Ne7+) and no defense to all of them. The speed of capitulation should make it abundantly clear that pieces tied to the defense of weak Pawns are often unable to defend themselves. The most common form of Pawn weakness encountered in practical play is the isolated Pawn-one which has lost its neighbors and stands alone in face of the enemy. Such a Pawn has two basic deficiencies: firstly it requires defense, and secondly the squares immediately in front of it make ideal outposts for the other player. To see in more tangible terms what this means, let us look at a famous game Fischer won on his road to the World Championship against an ex-World Champion Tigran Petrosian. 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 .

He must use the weakness of the two isolated Pawns to tie down the Black pieces while maximizing the activity of his O\vn.
16. BeS
One of the secrets of endgame play is to realize which pieces to exchange, which to retain. Here White wants to trade off the Black·squared Bishops for two reasons: (i) As the weak Pawns stand on White squares, the Black-squared Bishop is the only piece which cannot be tied down to their defense. (ii) While wants to use the c5 square as an outpost fOf his Knight.

The next logical step in the chain. Having just traded the 'right' pair of Bishops, he does not want the Black Pawns to run away onto Black squares, for in that case he will have traded the wrong Bishops! NovI' White can always meet ...as with bs and the massive passed Pawn must prove decisive. This process of fixing weaknesses on squares where they are most readily assailable si particularly common and should always be horne in mind when playing against weak Pawns. It is also worth noting that b4 establishes the outpost on cs. Whether you approach the position from the point of view of outposts or weaknesses, the move 18. b4! cries out to be played. 1 8 . Kf8 In endgames the King is a very powerful piece and should be used as such.

The other possibility is to transfer the Bishop to a more active defensive post.

According to plan. 2 2 . Nxd7+ A slightly surprising decision in that one would not normally want to trade such a dominating Knight for a struggling Bishop, but here the exchange enables Fischer to penetrate with his Rooks.

Rc7 Nd7 2 5 . Re2 g 6 Black has been totally starved of constructive moves. Let us examine the position in detail to see why: (a) If the Knight moves, there comes Ree7 winning.

Despite having a Pawn more, Black is quite helpless in face of the threat of Rg7 and Rg8 matc. E.g. 34... g5 35. Rg7 Rf6 (35 ... Ng6 36. Bf7+) 36. Rg8+ Rf8 37 Bf7 +. A truly classic game, one worth continual restudy. It shows with perfect simplicity all the steps necessary to transform a superior Pawn structure into a win. The one underlying theme running through the whole game is the way the Black pieces are systematically deprived of all mobility. f 8 7 6 5 4 1. 2 27. a b c d e g h Next we look a t doubled Pawns, a subject littered with common misconceptions. Contrary to popular belief, doubled Pa wns are not invariably weak but in many cases arc definitely advantageous. Naturally doubled isolated Pawns are to be avoided, hut there is no reason to fear having doubled Pawns when no isolation of Pawns occurs. For example, in the following line of the Vienna Opening 1. c4 eS 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. 13c4 Ne6 4. d3 Bb4 S. Nf3 d6 6. O-O Bxc3 7. hxc3 NaS 8. Bb3 Nxb3 9. axb3 O-O 10. c4 (Diagram 27), the only effect of the doubled Pawns is to give White a small but unquestionable advantage. Why? Basically because White has more central Pawns than his opponent (he leads by two c Pawns to one), In the opening and middlegame center Pawns are more valuable than flank Pawns. Moreover the White Pawns provide a very effective barrier a g a inst the enemy Bishop without any way impeding lheir own Bishop. Above all there is no question of White having any weak Pawns-they all protect each other, exc<''Pt for the 'base' at c2 which is completely unassailable. Tllere is of course very little wrong with the Black position either, but the Danish Grandmaster Bent Larsen has been able to turn White'S slender adva ntage into a win. It requires infinite patience and perfect technique, but it is possible. The pros and cons of doubled Pawns may be thought of in tenns of a military line along which forces are evenly distribut.ed. One can reinforce a certain part of the line only at the cost of weakening another. Naturally the value of the policy depend.� on how serious the weakening effect is. To translate this notion into chess terms consider the Pawn complex e3, B, f2, h2. The Pawn triplet on e3. f3, f2, is by itself quite strong as it controls a lot of central squares without exhibiting much to attack. The weakness lies with the isolated h Pawn and the squares in front of it. Returning to the context of our analogy we can say that the center has been strengthened at the cost of weakening the flank. If the latter effect lurns out to be inconsequential then the doubling of the Pawns must be reckoned to be a good thing. Axon Nimzowitsch was maybe one of the first to have a deep understanding of doubled Pawns. A great chess thinker and experimentalist, he pioneered what is nowadays generally considered to be the 'perfect' defense to 1. d4, namely 1. . .Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4-the Nimzo-Indian. Black's basic strategy is to take the Knight at the right moment, doubling White's c Pawns and then try to prove that they are weak. Naturally this idea has received many ramifications over the years, but it can still be made to work even at the highest levels. 1 . 2 . 3 . 4.

8 7 6 5 4 3 2 , b , d e g h Black has given himself a backward b Pawn, an Isolated e Pawn and doubled g Pawns. Why? To keep the position blocked. The White BishOps are badly hemmed in by their own Pawns and without prospect of ever breaking Qut. We have here a new source of 'weakness'. White's Pawns are bad not so much because they require defense, but simply because they get in the way. In SOme sense one can think of them being weak because the pieces cannot avoid defending them. 1 7 . 1 8 . 1 9 . 20. RbI Rb2 Rbf2 Be2 Bd7 Rb8 Qe7 White has already run out of constructive jdea�.

R d 1 Bxf31 A fine move that tells us much about doubled Pawns. Black is not doubling White's f Pawns in order to attack them, but to create an outpost for his Knight on d4. The quartet of Pawns on fl, £3, g3, h2 in itself forms a very strong Pawn complex, but the metamorphosis of White's e Pawn into an f Pawn means that he can no longer control his d4 square. We can see exactly the same idea in a game Karpov-Browne, San Antonio 1972, which opened 1. c4 cS 2. b31? Nf6 3, BbZ g6?!

But this is a serious mistake. Admittedly 14. dS Nd4 is good for Black because of his powerful Knight, but it at least does not offer him any obviolls point of attack. The text move however opens the b file and so leaves White with a backward b Pawn open to allack along the file. The fact that it opens the d file for White is irrelevant here as the Black King comfortably thwarts any aspirations he might have in lhat direction. 1 4 . 1 5 . 1 6 .

In recent tlme.s there has been a trend to go to almost any 1enb>ths in order to weaken enemy Pawns. especially to inflict doubled isolated Pawns. The first victim of this trend was the previously much revered fianchettoed g2 or g7 Bishop. For example: 1. c4 g6 2. Nc3 Bg7 3. Nf3 cS 4. d4 cxd4 S. Nxd4 Nc6 6. Ne2 Bxc3+! (the classical chess theorist might advocate exchanging this piece for nothing less than a Rook!)

(delaying the development of his gl Knight so that he can "i 1" give up his Bishop for the Black Knight when it comes OUl of hiding) 6 ... Bg7 7. Be3 Nc6 S. Bxc6+! bxc6 9. Qcl.

4. Open Files
'Put your Rooks on open files' is a piece of advice every beginner receives, and it very sound piece of advice it i�. But like allpieces of sound advice, it can prove to be inadequate, or worse. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 34. a b c d e g h Look at Diagram 34. An innocent-looking position, but if Black (to move) dutifully seizes the only open file with
1...Rad8 he quickly runs into trouble after 2. Be3:
( i ) 2 . . . a6 3 . Bb6 Rct7 4. Rhdl Ree7 (or 4... Rde7
5. BdS! Re6 6. Rd7 with decisive penetration) S. BeS Rxdl
6. Rxdl and the White Rook reaches the seventh rank
(6 ...Re7?? 7. Rd8+ Kh7 8. Bd6 wins the Rook!). (ii) 2 ... b6 (to prevent the Bishop driving Black off the d file) 3. as! c 5 (forced) 4. axb6 axb6 5 . Ra7 followed by Rhal with a winning position, e.g. 5 ... Ra8 6. Rhal Rxa7
7. Rxa7 ReG 8. Rb7 and Kb3-c4-b5 mopping up the
Queenside Pawns. Why the storm from a clear sky? Because files do not always operate on the first come, first served system. If you look back at variation (I) you will see that Black ran into trouble on the d file, despite having first option on it. So where did he go wrong? Firstly, he failed to appreciate the disparity in strength between the Bishops. The White Bishop was able in variation (i) to drive the Black Rooks off the d file singlehandedly, and in variation (ii) enabled White to open the a file for his own Rooks. In both cases the Black Bishop was a spectator. And secondly, Black had no reason to occupy the d file anyway. Occupation of an open file is of no value unless there is a chance of penetration. Here the White King prevents any possible insurgence on the d file. In particular the entry square on the seventh rank, invariably the most important, is also guarded by lhe White Bishop, making the d tile an entirely prospectless avenue for Black. If the Black King were on, say, e6 rather lhan g8, the d file would be just as worthless for White. Returning to the diagram, the correct treatment by Black is 1 ... Kh71, preparing to trade off White's dangerous Bishop, and after 2 . Rdl (threatening of course Rd7) 2 ... Red8 (not 2...RadS? 3. Be3 gaining a tempo by the attack on the a Pawn) 3 . Be3 Bh6!, because the Pawn-grabbing attempt 4. RxdS RxdS 5. Bxa7 allows Black in on the seventh rank (S ... Rd2+). Better is 4. BcS threatening to seize control of the file with Be7, but Black can defend with 4 ... B g 5 to be followed by bringing his King across to e6. (However, after 5. g3 [threatening 6. h4J 5 .. .h4 [forced] 6. Bd6! will either win the e Pawn or allow White to establish a Rook on the 7th rank after 6 ...Bf6 7. Bc7, when Black is still in serious difficulties. Also, fi 6 ... Re8 7. HO! He?? S. HdB wins.-editor) It must be stressed that open files only have value as a means of feeding Rooks (or possible Queens) into the enemy position, so that a file has no value unless there is somewhere along it an entry point, i.e. an advanced point on whtch a Rook can safely land. The ideal entry point is on the seventh rank or the second rank (i.e. d7 or d2 on the d file, etc.). Every Rook secretly dreams of landing on the seventh or second ranks, making a 90-degrce right (or left) turn and eating its way through the enemy lines. There is something magical about the number seven for a While Rook. Alternat.ively, points of entry on the eighth, Sixth, or even fifth rank can be just as effective. But there must be one, otherwise the file is u.<>eless. In this respect the King can play an important role. In the endgame, there is no piece better equipped to defend entry points than the King. For example, a King on e2 simultaneously covers three entry squares on the d file (dl, d2 and d3), a feat which no other piece (apart from the Queen of course) can perform. This makes the location of the oPPosing King a vital fanor in assessing the value of an open file in the endgame. The basic rule is the further from the King, the better. Returning to our example, we can see that the d me was not a useful commodity for Black because of the proximity of t.he White King, yet the very same file was potentially lethal in White's hands as the Black King was far away. We can see this principle operating in the following vaIiation of the Sicilian Defense, the so-called Maroczy Bind: 1 . e4 cS 2 . Nf3 Ne6 3 . d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 g6 S . c4 Nf6 6. Ne3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 d6 8 .

Let us analyze the poSition a little to see just how serious the threat of Bh3 can he: (I) 16 ... Kf8 (bringing the King across to bolster [he f g h Queenside) 17. Bh3 Rc4 18. b3 Rc7 19. Bxa7.

Winning the file and probably the game as well. Although this does not exhaust Black's defensive possibilities, it does show that he has problems to solve. These problems arise primarily out of his niability to contest White's h3-c8 diagonal and the consequent difficulty in holding on to the c file. The minor pieces play a major role in determining who controls open files. The side with the more active minor pieces can generally count on gaining access to any files that may open up.

In each case the team has been dragged down by the inability of some Bishop or Knight to match its opposite number.

Rooks are notoriously difficult to bring into play quickly, so any loss of time incurred early on is liable to postpone their development still further. Many games have been won or lost because of this, but few display this motif with subtlety of the following encounter. White: U. Andersson, Black: R. Knaak Capablanca Memorial Tournament, 1974

When the checks run out White's mating threats (Rb8 and BishOp moves) are unstoppable. f 5 . Half-open files: the minority attack The open file is a double·edgcd wcapon. Although a way to feed the major pieces into the heart of the opponent's position, there is always the danger of it being seized and used to reciprocal effect by the enemy. In short, it is a two way road for Rooks. The chcssplayer, not being an unselfish advocate of equality of opportunity, naturally prefers a ooe way system. The half-open file is precisely this. We do not have to go very far (three moves to be exact) to find an example of one: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 ('6 3. cxdS cxdS. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 43. a b c d c g h White has the half-open c file, Black the half-open e file. $0 whal does this mean? Cannot Black always erect a granite wall on the c file by c6 and White do Similarly on lhe e file by c3? Yes of course, but the point is that the Black Pawn chain b7, c6, dS can by challenged by White with b4 and bS. When b5 comes, there is no way Black can avoid being left with a weak Pawn. If he captures away from (6, the d Pawn is left isolated, while allowi.ng an exchange on c6 will leave the c Pawn backward. These are the simple mechanics of the minOrity attack. It is no more nor less than a method of weakening an otherwise sound Pawn set-up by advancing Pawns at it. The process is quite long and slow, the payoff at the end rc\ativeJy small (one weak Pawn to aim at, two maybe if you are lucky), but its value is undeniable. Moreover, it cannot easily rebound on you. An open file can change hands, a half-open file cannot. Indeed it cannot even be challenged. Imagine the contortions Black would have to go through to oppose Rooks on the c me in front of his Pa .... n.s in a position akin to that of Diagram 43. Out of the question. The minority attack has a certain inevitability about it. Though cumbersome, once the mighty wheels have been set in motion, the oppOSition has no way to apply the brakes. So much for extolling the virtues of half-open files, but going to Diagram 43 we see that Black has the e file. Surely, he too can launch a minority attack in due course? Not so easy. A minority attack on the e file would involve advancing his f and g Pawns. But where is he to put his King? Certainly not on [he Queenside in the path of White's attack. On the other hand it is not lhe height of expediency to castle Kingside and then send your Kingside Pawns scampering off into the distance to create just one weak Pav·m in the enemy camp. The final reward is simply not worth the risk. In general one cannot afford to mount a minority attack in front of a castled King. These attacks only usually work on the other side of the board. Let us look at a couple of examples of play from Diagram 43 to see how the minority attacks work out in practice. 1 . d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. cxd5 exd5 4, Nc3 Nf6 5. Bg5 Be7

2 , b c d e g h This is a standard position in the so-called (for obvious reasons) Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit. White's method of development is both simple and economical, and with his last move he prepares to set the minority attack in motion, by b4. Black's method of play has been a little more contorted (ReB, NfB), the reason being that not having a worthwhile minority attack of his own, he wants to channel as many pieces as possible over to the Kingside in order to create some diversionary threats there. OUf first example, Van den Berg-Kramer 1950, proceeded: 1 1 . g 6 So as to play Ne6 without losing a Pawn to Bxf6. 1 2 . b 4 a 6 1 3 . a4 Ne6 1 4 . Bh4 No need to rush things with 14.

If Black is unable to throw any tactical spanners in the works, lhe well-oiled, mechanical minority attack will generally swallow up a Pawn sooner or later. Our second example shows how to create counterplay against the minority attack. Resuming from the pOSition of Diagram 44:

White must now proceed with caution. On 17. Nd2!, there comes 17 ... Nxd2 18. Qxd2 Nh4!. The powerful threats 19 ...Bh3! and 19 ...8f3! leave White at a loss for a reasonable reply, e.g. 19. f3 Q,.:e3+! 20. Qxe3 Rxe3 21. fxg4 Rxd3. Even here, however, White can extract something from the position by judicious play, i.e. 17. Bxe4! dxe4 18. Nd2 HfS 19. bxc6 bxc6 20. Ne2 with threats of Q;>;:c6 or Ng3. The two Knights do a good job here, hopping in and out of the weak squares created by White's Q!Jeenside advance. The minority attack is not purely geared to producing v.-eak Pawns, but Creates OUtposts as ",-ell (c5 In thiS case). Given that a minority attack runs more smoothly away from the central files (we saw In our previous examples that White could operate a minority attack with some effect on the c file, whereas Black found It difflcult to get going on the e file). and the startling criterion that a Pawn minority Is needed for a minority attack, it is not djfficult to appreciate that the best place to acquire a Pawn majority Is in the center. A surplus of Pawns in the middle necessarily means a defiCit somewhere else (assuming of course both sides do have equal Pawns). Remember the old rule 'always capture towards the center' applying to a choice of Pawn captures. The advantage of the central Pawn majority is the raison d'etre for this piece of advice. The hidden implication is: accumulate Pav.ns in the center and you can start minority attackS on the flank.o;. Take the following variation of the English Opening:
1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc 3 dS 3. cxdS NxdS 4. g3 g6 S. Bg2 Nxc3
6 . bxc3 Bg7. 46. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 a b c d e g h By recapturing the Knight 'towards the center' (I.e. with the b Pawn ralher than the d Pawn), White has given himself an extra central Pawn. The offshoot of this Is a half-open b file which can later on in the game be used for a minority attack. To this end he does well to adopt a solid but purely passive Pawn set-up in the center (say Pawns on e2, d3, c4) so as to be able to direct a1l his fire-power to the left flank later on. Diagram 47 shows the type of position that might occur later on after some exchanges. White is ready to launch his minority attack. 47. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 a b , d e 1 . a 4 06 Black wants to hold his QueenSide together by Nd7 without allowing a While Knight to jump Into dS. 2 . a 5 Nd7 Taking the a Pawn would split up Black's Pawns too much, e.g. 2... hxaS? 3.

So what part, if any, does the central Pawn majority play in the minority attack? A considerable part. lbe plan of seeping into the Black position via the Queenside is essentially slow and nonforcing. It only succeeds because Black has no point to counterattack, and this in turn is due to the impervious White center. Minority attacks must he built on the foundation of a firm central position. The victory may be won on the flank, but ultimately it is created in the center. Minority attacks derive from the Pawn :;tructure, Pawn structures derive from the opening. Go back to the eras of Capablanca and Alekhine and you will see Queen's Gambits, hoards of them, with hoards of minority attack::; descending from them. Nowadays* the Sicilian Defense is all the rage. Sicilians here, Sicilians there, Sicilians absolutely everywhere. Why this saturation with Sicilians? Does the Mafia's influence really extend this far? The answer lies in the minority attack. The whole idea of the Sicilian is for Black to trade his c Pawn for the d Pawn. White almost invariably obliges: 1. e4 cS 2. Nf3 Nc6 (or d6 or e6 or g6) 3. d4 cxd4, when Black immediately arrives at a minority attack Pawn structure. Half-open c file, extra central Pawn, 2-3 minority on the Queenside; these are all the necessary ingredients. Sounds infallible, so where's the snag? Why doesn't Black win every game? The problem is Df course that White has a lead in development in the early stages, which may prove difficult tD survive. Black's prospects lie later in the game when the winds of White's initiative have blDWn themselves out. White: L. Vogt, Black; U. Andersson Havana 1975

The time is ripe for the King to march in. All the White pieces are amusingly trapped, like a bicycle wheel in a tramline, only able to go backwards and fon'lards. 4 1 . N g l Rather than submit to the humiliation of idling his King to and fro while the Black monarch strides in and mops up. White surrenders a Pawn to free his pieces, but to no avail of course. 4 1 . Rxf4 and Black soon won. The Pawn structure, or rather distribution in this endgame, is well worth remembering. Black had a 4-3 majOrity on the King side (e, f, g, h Pawns, VS. f, g, h Pawns) and White a 3-2 surplus on the Q!leenside (c, b, a Pawns vs. b and a Pawns). This distribution is fundamentally favorable for Black, firstly because of his first extra central Pawn (which in the game provided him with a powerful outpost on dS for his Knight), and secondly because of the Q!leenside minority attack. There is also a third advantage not apparent from our last game: four Pawns protect a King better than three. How many times have you read that Black's classical freeing move in the Sicilian is ...dS without understanding why? If Black can swap his d Pawn for White's e Pawn he reaches the 4-3 vs. 2-3 distribution advertised above. Of course, if White can meet ... dS with e5, it's a ditlerent story . . The Sicilian i s not the only opening geared to reach this Pawn distribution. For example, the following line of the Caro-Kann 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Bc4 Ngf6 6. Ng5 e6 7.

Although Black obtains the Pawn formation he wants much faster, he can experience great difficulties in developing his Ch.ieenside. This is always the price paid for freeing your game too quickly in these openings. If Black can, however, succeed in hringing all his pieces into play unscarred he is assured of an equal game-at least. The struggle to develop can lead to very sharp play. White: M. Stean, Black: AJ.

Complications nOL [or complication's sake, but to preempt the minority attack which would certainly have f later come, had Black been given time to consolidate by castling. The one aspect of the half-open file not properly covered to date is the outpost on the half-open file. This if> best explained by an example. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 5 3 . a b c d e 9 h Diagram S3 shows another typical Sicilian Pawn structure. Black has the half-open c file, White the d file. Each has an associated outpost, White on dS, Black on c4. Outpost is something of a misnomer here, for as you may remember an outpost was originally defined as a square that could not be challenged by an enemy Pawn. Here Black can play e6 and White b3 chal1enging the respective outposts, but only at a cost. b3 weakens the c3 square and so makes the c Pawn more difficult to defend. Correspondingly, e6 weakens the Black d Pawn, so these moves can only be made in exceptional circumstances. The squares dS and c4 are therefore effectively outposts, if not technically so. These considerations explain a couple of points about the Sicilian Defense that may have been puzzling you: (i) Why does Black so often develop his f8 Bishop passively with e6 and Be7 when he can give it a beautiful .... . . diagonal by g6 and Bg71 Because e6 and Be7 deprive White of hsi dS outpOSt without leaving the d Pawn tooweak. After g6 and Bb7 Black can rarely consider e6 as well. (Ii) Why Is the Maroczy Bind (Pawns on e4 and (4) considered so effective for White against the Sicilian? Because with a White Pawn on c4 Black can have no outpost there. and Black can generate very little play on the c file. Strategical problems are born in the opening, which Is why it is so important to undersrand the op@nlngs you play. Hopefully tills chapter has given you some insight Into the workings of the SIcilian Defense and related openings as well as the minority attack. -,'. - 6 . Black squares and White squares Pawns are quite happy to defend pieces (outposts), yet pieces do not enjoy being tied to the defense of Pawns (weak Pawns). Bear these simple principles in mind and you are well on the way to mastering one of the fundamental problems of chess-cooperatiOn between pieces and Pawns. This harmony between workers and management so to speak is not solely the responsibility of the shop noor. There is no such thing as the 'perfect Pawn formation, because different pieces react in dfiferent ways to the same Pawn skeleton. One of the arts of chess strategy is to recognize which of your pieces fit in well with the Pawn structure, and to exchange off the ones that do not. In this context we are referring primarily to minor pieces (i,e. Bishops and Knights). Recognition of pieces which do or do not fit in welt with the Pawn structure centers mainly around the concept of ' good' and 'bad' Bishops. If most of your central Pawns become blocked on Black squares, say, the future for your Black-squared Bishop will be very limited. The White-squared Bishop on the other hand willbe completely unimpaired by its Pawns. Moreover, Pawns on Black :;quares do not protect White squares, so the Bishop is also needed to help cover the 'gaps'. Knights are less likely to be brought up before the Race Relations Board for color consciousness. They are quite happy to hop from Black squares to White and back again. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 54. <1. b e d e 8 h Diagram 54 is a typical case of good Bishop vs. bad Bishop. The Pawn structure is entirely symmetrjcal, but White's Bishop is compatible with his Pavro structure whereas BLack's is a prisoner in his own camp. White wins without effort: 1 .

Many people reason 'If I put my Pawns on the same colored squares as my Bishop, I can defend them there'. If you commit hara-kiri instead, you won't have to defend them at all. The tWO solutions are roughly equivalent, give or take the problem of cleaning the blood off the board. The real fallacy In the argument is that jf you put all your Pawns on squares of the same color, say Black, there is no defense against enemy penetration on the White squares. Look at Diagram 55. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 55. a b c d e g h There is only very scanty material left on the board and Black has only one Pawn to keep protected.

This is what .... -e are talking about when we saw things like ' ...and Black is weak on the White squares.' We mean there is a danger that a King (in the endgame) of a Queen (in the late middlegame) will be able to penetrate Into the position. Using bridge parlance, he has a duplication of honors. His Pawns cover Black squares, his Bishop does the same, so that after suitable exchanges there will be little more than overworked King to guard the other thirty-two. Naturally the less material on the board, the dearer the bad Bishop syndrome. This is why we started the section with two examples of pure Bishop endgames. Wilh Rooks un as well however the overall strategy is much the same. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 56. a b c d c g h Diagram 56 is an endgame (Tarrasch-Teichmann, San Sebastian, 1912) which allexponents of the French Defense should try to avoid. Black has a bad Bishop and weak Black squares. The execution runs as follows: weakness 1 . g 4 The key to the White position is his King's outpost on d4. Because Black has no minor piece able to operate on Black squares, he cannot usurp the White monarch from its throne and moreover must keep a Rook permanently stationed on the c file to prevent his majesty from walking in. You may remember that the ' ... t·ealmess' of weak Pawns was that pieces could be tied down to their defense. Similarly the 'weakness' of weak squares is that defending pieces must keep them permanently covered to prevent infiltration. To exploit this constraint on the mobility of the Black Rooks, White must bring his own into the game. This he docs by a general advance on the Kingside which will eventually lead to the opening of some lines there. He chooses the extreme right flank for this action to stretch the defense as much as possible. In endgames you should try to introduce 'width' into your play, i.e. create trouble on two widely-spaced fronts. 1 . 2 . h 4 Be8 g6 Trying to keep the Kingside closed.

8 7 6 5 4 3 2 57. a b c d e g h A good point for a brief resume on cht! state of play.

The most powerful piece in any endgame i:; the King, and the White square/mack square strategy is aimed to carve out a mute into the enemy camp for it. You can sec the rcason for stationing Pawns on squares of color opposite to that of your Bishop by the following little exercise. Set up a White Bishop on c4 and Pawn on d4 opposed by a Black King on d6. The King wants to cross the fifth rank. To do so, it must traverse as far as the g file in OOC direction (Ke6, [6, gS) or the a file in the other direcion (Kc7, b6 at which point White can transfer the Bishop to d3, but now KaS). Thus we see that a White-squared Bishop in conjunction with a Black-squared Pawn provides a pretty wide barrier against an enemy King. Now transfer the Pawn on d4 to a White square, any White square (e.g. d5, c4, d3), and the King walks straight through. So in assessing how bad a bad Bishop is, or equivalently how weak a weak square complex is with a vk"\\ 1 to the endgame, the main criterion must be: how easily can the opponent's King break in? Lee us look at an exceptional example (Diagram 59). 1 1 3 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 59. a b c d e g h Black has the worst Bishop the world has ever seen and four sick Pawns to defend, yet he cannot lose! Why not? Because the White King can never enter. White can only attack various Pawns with his Bishop, at most two at a time, but the threats are easily parried. Without a King there is no way to win. Now remove the White Pawn from eS. Despite now being a Pawn down, White wins easily because his King can play its part: 1 . KeS Ke7 2 . B d 3 Kf7 3 . Kd6 The Black squarest 3 . B b 7 4 . Kc7 BaS S . Kb 8 wins everything. As a final example to emphasize the power of the King in the ending, we turn to one of Tal's early games, against Lisitsin in the 1956 Soviet Championship. 1 14 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 60. In Diagram 60, Tal (White, to move) has allsorts of problems to solve with his ragged Kingside Pawns, but his opponent has some Black square holes in the center. The only way to play such endgames is to exploit your own advantages as vigorously as possible, even if it means total capitulation elsewhere. Here Tal decides to abandon his Kingside to avoid being drawn into passive defense and concentrate all his efforts on the weak Black squares. 1 . f 5 1 Naturally he chooses the most uncooperative method of surrendering the Kingside. 1 . gxf5 Winning a Pawn, but compromising his Pawn structure to do so.

As SOOn as the central Pawn set-ups crystallize into some sort of permanent structure, the respective good and bad Bishops become self-evident. For example, the French Defense usually creates the Pawn centers d4, eS (White) v. dS, e6 (Black) In which cases each side has a 'bad' QjJcen Bishop. Hence lhe opening variations: 1. e4 e6 2. d4 ds 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. BgS Be7 5. e5 Nfd7

NO Bd7 followed by ... BbS. Black's idea is always a White square strategy, i.e. exchange his Queen Bishop for the opposing King Bishop and later infiltrate on the White square. WhHe's plan is [he exact opposite (exchange Black-squared Bishops and come in on the Black squares). Look back at the Tarrasch-Teichmann ending (Diagram 56). That arose from a French Defense in which White managed to trade Black-squared Hishops early in the game. To look in some detail at the mechanics of a color strategy in the opening/middlegame we shall turn our attention to the King's Indian Defense. Structurally speaking the KJ.D. is merely a French Defense seen through a mirror, but for some reason or other King's Indian strategy always seems more involved than its reflected counterpart. The following White-square strategy worked out by Petrosian is both subtle and llIuminating: 1 . d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7
4. e4 d6 5 . Be2 O-O 6. Nf3 e5 7. d5
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 6 1 . a b c d e g h Classically these dosed King's Indian positions lead to a race. White plays for 1.5, Black counters with ...f5 and may the best man win! Petroslan's idea is to maneuver for control of the White squares so as to take the sting out of Black's ...f5 counter before launching his own Queenside operations. After all the c5 attack is inherent from the Pavm structure and so wlll never disappear. Let us see how his idea operates by following a game Petrosian-Yuchtman: 7 .

There are essentially two types of White-square strategy. The first is as above: given a IJXed Pawn slructure in which the enemy Pawns are already on Black squares, you exchange White-squared Bishops with a view to setting up outposts or penetrating On White squares. The second is the same idea back to front: given a more fluid Pawn set-up and that your opponent already has relinquished his White squared Bishop, you lry to draw his Pawns onto Black squares. The objective is the same-to give the opponent a Black square Pawn formation, with no Bishop to plug the gaps, but the build-up Is different. 63. a b c d e g h The positiOn in Diagram 63 arose from the opening of the game Stean-Plan!nc, Moscow 1975.

In conclusion, a warning to those who would Willingly accept a bad Bishop and a few weak. squares in return for the slightest glimpse of an attack. As stressed earlier in the book, attacks must be built on the basis of a definite superiority in your position, either in development or in structure.

Pieces need to be kept active and used economically. All the objectives of �imple chess can be traced back to this underlying notion. Outposts are springboards from which piece� can generate activity, weak Pawns hamper mobility because they require protection, 'bad' Bishops are bad because their movements are restricted. However, the single most important factOr in determining mobility must be space, but what is space? Terms like 'White has the freer game', 'White hal; greater control', 'Black is cramped', crop up frequently in annotations, but what do they really mean and how is space apportioned? Unlike the ideas expressed so far in this book, space is nOl an easily definable or recognizable concept. The visual impression you obtain by glancing at a posicion and estimating who seems to have the lion's share can be misleading. The following is nearer the truth. Any given Pawn strm.1ure has a certain capacity for accommodating pieces efficiently. Exceed this capacity and the pk-'Ccs get' in each other's way, and so reduce their mutual activity. This problem of overpopulation is easy to sense when playing a position-it 'feels' cramped. To take an example, compare Diagrams 68 and 69. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 68. a b c d e g h 69. a b c d c g h They do, of course, represent the same position, but with two pairS of minor pieces Jess In lhe second case. In Diagram 68 Black is terribly congested. There is no way he is ever going to be allowed to play ... b5, while alternative methods of seeking some breathing space by (after due preparation) ... c6 or ... fS would compromise his Pawn structure considerably. White on the other hand can build up at leisure for an eventual eS, safe in the knowledge that 50 long as he avoid!> any piece exchange, his adversary will never be able to free his game. Diagram 69 is qUite a comrast. The size of Black's forces is here well within his pOSition'S 'capacity', As a result there arc no spatial problems at all and Black can very quickly seize the initiative by ... a6 and ...bS, or even by ... hS as a Pawn sacrifice, e.g. 1. .. h5 2. cxhS a6 3. bxa6 Rxa6 with tremendous pressure. We see from this pair of positions that Black's structure is very good, but his I ' capacity is small. Visually White has a spatial advantage In both cases, but in [he second the eye flatters to deceive. In j' faCt, he is grossly overextended. A vast empire requires an army of equal proportions to defend it. . Space is the most difficult clement of chessstrategy to understand. As we have just seen ni Diagram 68, a position can be structurally very sound but actually very bad because of spatial problems. The real test of our insight into the nlec.hanics of an advantage in space comes when confronted by a completely sound (structurally), solid but cramped po.�ition. How do you exploit such an advantage in space? Fischer provides all the answers. White: R.J. Fischer, Black: F. Ghcorghiu Buenos Aires 1970

Put yourself in While's shoes and you might ask how yOll can possibly make any impression on the Black position, but that is the wrong approach.

situation is by exchanges so Black prepares ... B1's to exchange Bishops, thus liberating the d7 square for his QJJ .een which In turn allows the Rook a clear path to e8. For White's part it is sufficient to prevent this plan. When you have a spatial advantage there need be no hurry to form an active plan, that will come in due course. The impOrtant thing is to keep your oppOnent bottled up and put the onus on him to create active play. To do so he will be forced to weaken his own position somewhere. Only then do you pounce on him. 1 5 . d S White would prefer to hold his Pawns on d4 and c4, but this advance in conjunction with Nd4 is the only way to prevent Black's freeing plan.

3 5 . f3 and Black resigns. So we see how easy it can be (or rather seem to be) to squeeze an opponent to death without any recourse to violence. The strategy behind playing to exploit a space advantage is twofold: 0) Deprive the opponent of any counterplay, avoiding exchanges whenever possible. The psychological pressure of being permanently hemmed in may well induce him to weaken himself in order to gain some freedom. (il) If no weaknesses are forthcoming you must be prepared to attack on either wing. Greater space control gives you better communication between flanks, so you naturally want to exploit this fact to build up against the adversary's weaker front. In our last game, Fischer chose to attack on the Kingside because of the sparsity of Black forces in that region, Had the Black pieces been concentrated on the Kingside he would have resorted to a Queenside advance (b4 and cS). Flexibility of thought is needed to make use of flexibility on the board. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 73. a b c d c g h You have doubtless seen the move sequence: 1. e4 e5 2 . Nf3 Ne6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5.

Never in the history of chess have so many moves been repeated so often so quickly by so many people who didn't really understand them. Have you ever examined these well tried and trusted moves with a critical eye? ·Why, for example, should White spend twelve moves to develop just four pieces? Why waste four of these moves to preserve a Bishop which will In all probability later become 'bad' when White blocks the center with dS? By answering these queStiOns, we can gain a lot of insight into White's overall strategy in the Lopez. The first and most primitive idea behind 3. BbS is to lay seige to Black's e Pawn which will subsequently be liquidated by d4, thereby opening rhe floodgates for the White Pawn center to scatter the enemy forces with the allied pieces following up to rout the broken army-no prisoners taken. Black cannot however be forced to surrender the center. By keeping his own e Pawn finnly defended Black can thwart allWhite's aspiralions of conquest in the center, but this will lead to a rather cramped position. So the offspring of White's plan is an advantage in space due to the necessity for his opponent to maintain a firm central barricade. This spatial plus however is not very big and the only way to maintain it is by avoiding any exchange of pieces. Black's position (Diagram 73) has sufficient 'capacity' for three minor pieces, but not dearly enough for all four of them. This explains why White is willing to invest so much time early in the game (BbS, Ba4, Bb3, Be2, h3) purely to avoid exchanges. If his spatial strategy is to succeed he must leave Black with four minor pieces. These dosed Ruy Lopez positions are some of lhe most subtle and complex in the whole opening repertoire. It is probably no coincidence that nearly allthe great players of recent times have been deadly exponents of the Ruy Lopez. In the hands of Fischer or Karpov 3. BbS sometimes appears to win by force. For example, Karpov Westerinen, Nice 1974. 1 . e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3 . BbS a6 4. Ba4 d6 S. O-O Bd7 6. d4 Nf6 7. c3 f Be7 B. Nbd2 O-O 9. Rei ReB 10. Nfl h6 1 1 .

Nf6 Black's moves from this juncture are, essentially, irrelevant. There is no way he can in the long run hope to hold his Queenside position, which has the look of Custer's last stand about it. Although he has only one vulnerable Pawn (d6), Black's pieces are so starved of space that they are themselves becoming targets of attack.

Undoubtedly the most difficult game in the book to understand. One can only really begin to appreciate the Idea of converting spatial advantages into structural ones when the latter have been fully absorbed and understood. The dosed Ruy Lopez positions represent a very fine balance between space and structure which only becomes apparent after many years of experIence with them. When you understand the Lopez, you have mastered simple chess. Our brief excursion into the Ruy Lopez has scratched the surface of some of the deeper aspects of chess strategy, but we will proceed no further in this direction. The idea of this book is to keep things simple, so let us look at some of the more direct consequences of spatial advantages. Space, or lack of it, is generally used as a way of persuading the opponent to make structural concessions. Let us take for example a (quite common) Pawn structure, Diagram 78. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 78. a b c d e g h Black's set-up is very sound but its 'capacity' is low, so given a position with some major pieces and a few minor pieces each, he would have some Spatial problems. Structurally speaking he has two ways to combat them: (i) Undermine White's center by ... bS. This is the positionally correct method, but is in practice often difficult to organize as White can usually keep quite a strong grip on the bS square (with, say, Knight on d4, c3, Bishop on fl-a6 diagonal). An added problem si that moving the b Pawn gives White an outpost on c6 for his Knight. (jj) Challenge White's Pawn wedge by ... e6. But this creates structural weaknesses. The Black d Pawn is left very weak after White exchanges Pawns on e6 and the Black Kingside is also weakened somewhat. Practice has shown that Pawn structure akin to Diagram 78 are very favorable for White providing that Black's minority anack ... b5 can be prevented. In this case the exploitation of White's spatial advantage is not all difficult to understand. He can utilize his greater control and communication between wings to launch a direct Kingside attack.

Of course, the \. . hole plan can be prevented by Black playing ...e6 at almost any stage, but this would leave him with a very sick d Pawn on an open file.

Once again the trouble with Black's position is with communications. His Queenside position is a favorable one, but Jacks contact with the rest of the war effort.

You see no targets in the enemy position and no way to force any weaknesses, but merely attempt to fortify your own position allowing simplification only when absolutely necessary or clearly favorable in the belief that your opponent will some time feel obliged to make concrete concessions in terms of Pawn weaknesses or outposts in order to avoid suffocation. The difficult part of a spatial strategy lies not In the execution which is relatively simple, but in the recognition of the fact that you actually do have an advantage in space. As already mentioned, the vital criterion is not necessarily whether you 'appear' to control more of the board. This is undoubtedly a yardstick, but not always an accurate one. The real criterion is whether your opponent has more pieces than can comfortably fit in with his Pawn structure, and this you can only really expect to assess correctly on the basis of experience. From your O\'t'llgames and by studying master games you can gradually acquire a feeling for the 'capacity' (as I earlier termed It) of certain Pawn structures. Space is not an easy concept to define with precision or understand with clarity, but time and practice \'lill sharpen your awareness of It as a factor in chess. J have tried throughout the book to lay down principles and put fon-vard ideas that relate to all phases of the game, opening, middlegame, and endgame, and space is no exception. The role played by space in the endgame is in fact much more straightfonvard than In the middlegame. In the endings the King assumes greater power and, consequently, value. The advantage of being first to occupy the center with your King is considerable. He who commands more space has more squares for his Kitlg, it's as simple as that. More space means a potentially stronger King. f -g h White: T. Petrosian, Black: L. Portisch Candidate's Match (5th Game) 1974 1',\ 1 1 . c4 Nf6 2. Nf3 h6 3. g3 e5 4. Bg2 '"Bg'-r 5. O-O e6

If you are prepared to lose nine games in order to score one brilliant victory, then it is probably not for you. However, most players are motivated at least partly by over-the-board success - the thrill of winning is one of the attractions of chess, and most players feel very satisfied when their rating improves. The level at which one plays is governed by a number of vague and poorly un- derstood factors. The first is what one might term 'natural talent'. By this I mean that combination of factors which sets an upper bound to the level one can achieve by training and practice. One cannot list precisely which factors are rele- vant, but one may divide the possible factors into two classes. The first class con- sists of non-chess-specific elements such as general intelligence and memory. The second class involves a mesh of inter-related chess factors such as the age at which one learnt the game, early chess education and so on. By the time anyone gets around to reading this book, the 'natural talent' factor will probably be immutable, which brings us to other factors which are more un- der one's control. These determine how closely one approaches the ceiling im- posed by one's 'natural talent'. It is my belief that most players never get anywhere near their natural ceiling, and that considerable improvement is possi- ble with appropriate education, training and practice. Most chess books aim to help readers improve their chess. An opening book, for example, will give gen- eral plans and concrete analysis, both to help the reader prepare his chosen open- ings and, after a game, to compare the course of the game with established theory. Clearly, concrete knowledge is an important factor in establishing chess strength; someone who has a detailed knowledge of rook and pawn endings will have an advantage over someone who does not. An assiduous program of self- training is bound to have a positive effect. In 1977, Jon Tisdall explained to me his plan for becoming a grandmaster. He had estimated how many hours of study were required to advance by one rating point. Multiplying this by the difference between his current rating and the grandmaster level gave the total number of hours of study required. I laughed, and pointed out that with each advance, the number of hours required to gain the next point would probably increase, and so he might never make it. However, his plan proved justified, because in 1995 he did indeed gain the grandmaster title. There are few players who can conduct a training program stretching over decades, and indeed time limitations apply to virtually all players. In practice this
6 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
restricts the amount of improvement possible on the 'chess knowledge' front. In this book I will give advice on how to use the time available for chess study most efficiently, for example by distinguishing essential knowledge from optional knowledge, and advising on the construction of an opening repertoire. The third factor, which is the main focus of this book, is the efficiency with which one applies the first two factors while actually sitting at the board. A de- tailed knowledge of rook and pawn endings won't help a bit if one has an attack of blind panic; an encyclopaedic memory is valueless if one is regularly seized by an uncontrollable impulse to sacrifice a piece unsoundly. Chaotic and mud- dled calculation; misjudgements; oversights; lack of confidence (or overconfi- dence!); lack of determination - these and many other negative influences all serve to whittle away one's playing strength. Such problems are not at all easy to solve, firstly because players very often do not realize what they are doing wrong and secondly because they imagine that there is nothing they can do to improve matters. This book includes a description of various common failings at the board. I think that many readers will reach a particular section and suddenly think "Yes, that's exactly the mistake I always make." Recognizing the problem is already the first step towards solving it. An awareness of when one is most likely to go wrong enables one to take special care in these 'danger situations'. Eventually, by concentrating on a particular weakness, it is often possible to eradicate it com- pletely. Since many of the matters dealt with in this book are psychological in nature, there will be quite a few examples from my own games - 1 can personally testify that muddled thinking occurs at grandmaster level! Where I have covered a fa- miliar topic, I have made an effort to replace, whenever possible, the standard time-worn examples with excerpts from contemporary play. Of course, this book, while containing much useful advice and information, cannot hope to go into detail about every aspect of the game. My aim has been merely to start the reader along the upward path of self-improvement. I hope that Secrets of Practical Chess will help readers to improve their results and produce more satisfying games. John Nunn Chertsey, 1997
1 At the Board
Decision-making The Tree of Analysis revisited The so-called 'Tree of Analysis' was popularized in Kotov's famous book Think Like a Grandmaster. The analy- sis of any chess position has a tree-like structure. There are various alterna- tives in the current position, which form the main branches. Each alterna- tive permits a range of replies, which form slightly smaller branches, and so on. Since there are, typically, dozens of legal moves in an average chess position, a tree including every legal move rapidly becomes too dense for human beings to handle. Of course, it isn't necessary to consider every legal move, since a considerable percentage of these legal moves are nonsensical, and this tends to thin the tree some- what. Nevertheless, even if there are only five reasonable possibilities at each ply (we will borrow a term from the computer chess world and call half a move a ply), after three whole moves there are 15,625 'leaves'. It follows that analysing solely by means of an analytical tree is only possible when the number of reasonable possibilities for the two players is limited - in prac- tice this means tactical positions and certain types of endgame. However, one constructs some sort of analytical tree in thinking about almost any posi- tion; in less tactical situations, where the opponent's replies are much less predictable, one would not rely solely on the 'tree' but also take other factors into consideration. It follows that the 'Tree of Analy- sis' is a very important method of chess thinking; computers have shown that it is possible to play very strongly using practically nothing else. Kotov's book described in detail the mental processes involved in concrete analy- sis. If we assume that White is to move, then Kotov recommended that White form a list of 'candidate moves' which he is trying to decide between, making sure that the list is complete. For each of these, White creates a list of possible replies by Black and so on, following each branch in turn until a definite evaluation can be given. Ko- tov specifically warned against jump- ing from branch to branch; he thought that you should analyse each candi- date move until it can be definitely evaluated, and only then move on to the next one. The following example, which I have taken from Colin Crouch's inter- esting book Attacking Technique, is given as an exercise. It can be solved by Kotov's method, although this does

not mean to say that you will find it simple. L. Psakhis - D. King (analysis) L. Psakhis - D. King London (Lloyds Bank) 1994 Black actually blundered a piece away with 31...Nxe5?? 32 Qxd5+ Re6 33 Hxe5, but 31...Sxe5 is better. Crouch then remarks "The attempt at a tactical refutation ... with 32 £te7+ does not quite succeed: 32...Hxe7 33 Hxe7 Hxf2 34 Rxd5+ *h7! 35 Re4+ Hf5+! 36 *hl 2tf2+ 37 Hxf2 Qxf2 38 Sf7 *g6 39 Hxf5 Rxf5 40 Rxb4 with a draw." Your task is to choose a move after 34 Qxd5+ (D) in this line. The diagram is given at the top of the next column and the solution may be found on page 14. It is interesting to see how Kotov's method for, as he put it, teaching 'human beings to analyse with the ac- curacy of a machine' compares with the way machines actually calculate. In Figure 1 we see a stage in the computer's analysis of a position, with many branches removed for the sake of clarity. The computer analyses by a process of 'iterative deepening'. Let us suppose it is analysing a position in which it has to choose between 40 legal moves. It will analyse all legal sequences of moves to a particular depth, taking some branches deeper, especially those with forcing se- quences involving checks or captures. This will allow it to attach a numerical evaluation to all the 40 possibilities. Based on its evaluation, it will re- order the 40 moves to put the most promising ones (i.e. those with the highest evaluation) first. Then it will go one ply deeper, again analysing all possible legal sequences, and devoting Ar THE BOARD 9 more time to those moves early in the Your Chess Now, have discussed the pros and cons of Kotov's recommen- dations, but my concern is to give practical advice and not to get in- volved in an academic discussion. There are several problems which can arise as a result of Kotov's method. The most obvious is that it can be ex- tremely inefficient. Let us suppose that you are analysing a possible com- bination 1 Bxh7+ xh7 2 Ng5+. There are two defences, 2...<Ng6 and
2...<Bg8. You start analysing 2...<Bg6;
it is very complicated, but after twenty minutes you decide that White has the advantage. Then you start looking at
2...6g8. After a couple of minutes it
becomes obvious that this refutes the sacrifice. The upshot of Kotov's in- flexible approach is that you have lost twenty minutes' thinking time, solely on account of the bad luck of having chosen the wrong move to analyse first. A more rational approach would be to spend a couple of minutes look- ing at each of the two alternatives. It is possible that this will reveal one of them to refute the sacrifice, at which point Bxh7+ can be abandoned. It is also possible that the preliminary analysis will show one of them to be a clear-cut loss, in which case you can switch attention to the other one in the confidence that it is definitely the critical line. If both are unresolvable within a short time, then this is in it- self useful information. It shows that the task of determining whether the sacrifice is sound or not will require a Figure 2 shows a human being ana- lysing according to Kotov's recipe. He has listed three candidate moves and is in the process of analysing the first of these. He has not started analysing the other two. Figure 3 shows how a human actu- ally thinks. He has started analysing move A and discovered line Al. He wasn't especially impressed by it, so switched to analysing move B. He didn't like that move either, so he re- turned to his analysis of A, adding line A2 to his earlier efforts. He has either not got around to move C, or has sim- ply forgotten about it.

Bb7, but this leads to the same result after 1...&C7. Finally, there is 1 Ba6, which avoids the king fork, but after
1...6C7 White nevertheless must lose
a piece, as the knight is now trapped. This is all in accordance with Kotov's method. While looking at this last line, however, you notice a surprising point: after 1 Aa6 c7 White can try 2 Nc5 !?, with the idea that 2...Nxb8 3 Nd6 <Ba8 4 Nc7 leads to mate by 5 Bb7#. Having spotted this, it is cer- tainly worth noting that it might be possible to utilize it in the previously analysed lines. This jumping back is not in accordance with Kotov's method. Sure enough, after 1 Bb7 Nc7 White can play 2 Jla6, and again Black can- not take the knight. So which line is correct? The an- swer is that 1 Ba6 Nc7 2 Nc5 fails to
2...d6+ 3 <Nd5 xb8, and now 4 <Nxd6
<Na8 5 Nc7 is stalemate. White must prevent Black giving up his d-pawn, and so 1 Bb7! c7 2 Ba6! is the right line (2...d6 allows the knight out). Spotting a new idea may even cause you to change your list of candidate moves. Here is an example (D): White has just played 19 Sgl-g5. Black was threatening 19...£ki3+ fol- lowed by 20...Nc5+, but now this threat is nullified, because on the dis- covered check White can take on f5. Moreover, 20 Sxf5 gxf5 21 Sgl is a serious threat. My initial thought was the safety- first 19...e6, but after 20 hxg6 fxg6 21 Sdgl the position is just unclear, so I substantial time investment. Then the decision is really whether it is worth- while putting in the effort to analyse deeper. We will revisit this question of whether or not to analyse in the next section. A second problem with Kotov's method is that it fails to take into ac- count the synergistic effect of analys- ing several lines. The analysis of move A and that of move B are very often not independent of one another. Sup- pose you have rejected move A, but when analysing move B you suddenly notice a tactical possibility. It makes sense to return to move A to see if the same possibility is applicable there. Here is a simple example: J. Gunst Das Illustrierte Blatt, 1922 Clearly White has to move his bishop, so there are three possibilities. You look at 1 Bxd7, and note that l...Nc7 wins one of the two minor pieces by a fork. The next move is 1

However, having noticed the possi- bility of ...£}xa2+ in the variation with ..Bh6, 1 should have gone back to see if this affected my list of candidate moves. The key point is that the cap- ture on a2 becomes possible once the white queen no longer guards b2, and so the move 19..Bc2!! (D) springs to mind: A. Kuligowski - J. Nunn Wijk aan Zee 1983 started looking for alternatives. My eye was suddenly caught by a tactical idea. After 19..Bh6 the most obvious reply is 20 Sxf5, but then I wondered if some combination of ...Bxe3 and ...Nxa2+ might force mate. After some thought I established that 2O... xa2+!
21 Nxa2 (21 Bxa2 Nxe3) 21..>xb3
22 Jlxh6 Qxa2 wins for Black, and
concluded that after 19...Bh6 White would have to sacrifice the exchange on g5. The resulting positions ap- peared to give Black some advantage. The game continued:

White is now completely helpless, for example: 1) 20 Nxd5 Nxa2+ 21 *xc2 Qxb3+ 22 *bl Sb7 23 hxg6 f5 wins for Black. 2) 20 Sdgl Nxa2+ 21 Nxa2 Qxb3

12 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
17 Nxh7+ <Nxh7 18 "h5+ *g8 19
Nxg7 Nxg7 20 Rg4+ <Nh7 21 Sf3 1-0 You can never find a move like 16 ?)b6! by using the tree of analysis (un- less you are a computer) because it makes absolutely no sense except as part of the whole tactical operation, and therefore will not make it onto your list of 'candidate moves'. Here is a more sophisticated exam- G. Kuzmin - E. Sveshnikov ple. USSR Ch, Moscow 1973 The position seems tailor-made for a double bishop sacrifice on h7 and g7, the only problem being that it doesn't work: 16 Jlxh7+ Nxh7 17 Qh5+ *g8 18 Nxg7 *xg7 19 Qg4+ h7 20 Sf3 (of course White can give perpetual check) 20...Nxf4 21 Sxf4 f5 defends. In order to win, White has to isolate the element that makes the sacrifice fail (i.e. the possibility of ...?)xf4) and ask a 'What if...' ques- tion, in this case 'What if I could de- flect the knight away from d5?'. Then the solution becomes obvious:
16 Nb6! Nxb6
It does not help if Black moves his rook, for example 16...Sb8 17 ?)xd5 cxd5 18 Nxh7+ *xh7 19 Qh5+ *g8
20 Nxg7 Qxc5+ 21 *hl <Nxg7 22
Qg4+ *h8 23 Sf3 Rc2 24 f5! Rxf5
25 Sxf5 exf5 26 Qh3+ (had Black
played 16...Sa7, White would now have 26 Qd4+) followed by Qg3+ and the rook on b8 falls. V. Anand - J. Lautier Biel 1997 There are so many pieces hanging that it takes a few moments to grasp what is going on in this position! White is set to lose the exchange on e3, but the bishop on g2 is trapped, so it looks as if the most likely outcome is a position with, for example, two bish- ops against a rook and two pawns. However, Anand had an imaginative tactical idea, namely to sacrifice his
AT THE BOARD 13
queen with the astonishing move 20 Bg6. Unfortunately, after 20 Bg6 Wxdl 21 Sxe6+ Black can just run with his king by 21...<Bf8 22 Ba3+ (22 2xf7+ g8) 22...Ne7 23 Nxe7+ Ng8 and White is losing. Now White can ask 'What if I had a pawn on h6?'. Then the line with 2xf7+ would lead to mate as 2xg7+ followed by Ba3+ would be possible. 20 h6!!gxh6? Black apparently hadn't seen An- and's idea at all, or he would have tried
20... xe3, although White retains the
advantage after 21 Bxe3 Re5 22 hxg7 2g8 23 Wcl !. Of course, the variation
20...g6 21 Bxg6 represents the fulfil-
ment of White's idea. 21 i.g6!I e7 Now that h6 is available for White's bishop, the line 21...Qxdl 22 2xe6+ *f8 23 Nxh6+ *g8 24 Nxf7# ends in mate.

2xd8+ *xd8 25 Nd3! 1-0 The tree of analysis is certainly a useful technique in tactical positions, but it should be used flexibly and sup- plemented by other types of chess thinking. One has to strike a balance between the rigid application of Ko- tov's principles and jumping from one variation to another too much. In par- ticular, I favour the 'quick scan' ap- proach, looking briefly at all the major lines to see if any can be quickly re- solved. With any luck, this will be enough to settle the analysis; if not, at least you know where the tricky areas lie. The most common errors in 'tree' analysis are: 1) Forgetting to analyse a move completely. This is surprisingly easy to do. After spending twenty minutes analysing defences A and B to your intended sacrifice, you decide that it is sound and play it. The instant your hand has left the piece you remember defence C, which you had noticed but not analysed. 2) Confusing similar lines. If you are jumping about a lot between rather similar variations, then it is easy to get mixed up as to which position came from which line. In other words, al- though you have the positions clear in your mind, the links between them which form the branches of the 'tree' have become muddled. You may need to start rebuilding the 'tree' in your mind from scratch when this hap- pens. While a certain amount of mental discipline can greatly increase the effi- ciency of your tactical analysis, a great deal still depends on 'natural talent'. It would be quite easy to overlook the whole idea of Bg6 in the Anand- Lautier position above, and in this case a wonderfully organized tree of variations will not help you. But then, Lautier missed it too, so at least you would not be alone. Now we return to the exercise on page 8. Here is the diagram again:

Evaluation functions When computers analyse a position, they create a tree of analysis, and then use a rather crude evaluation function to assess the position at the end of every branch. Then, by working back- wards, they can evaluate the current position and establish what they con- sider to be the optimal line of play. If a computer had a perfectly accurate evaluation function, then it would not need to analyse the position more than one ply ahead - it could simply evalu- ate the position after each legal move and choose the one with the highest evaluation. The effect of analysis is to increase the accuracy of the fairly primitive evaluation function. Humans tend to analyse in a differ- ent way, but they still use an evalua- tion function. While they may not think they have an advantage of 0.32 pawns, it is quite normal to think 'Well, at the end of this line I have a slight/fair/clear/crushing advantage.' After looking at various lines the hu- man decides on the best. This process is rather similar to that performed by the computer. However, the human also typically uses an evaluation function in a differ- ent way. If you think that you have an advantage in the current position, then you automatically reject moves which allow your opponent total equality. L. Psakhis - D. King (analysis) Crouch's 34...Nh7 is actually the weakest of the three king moves, and leads to a draw, as in his analysis. Initially I thought that 34...Nh8 was winning, since any check on the eighth rank is met by ...Sf8+, and oth- erwise White has no defence to the threats against his king. However, Fritz found an incredible defence: 35 Se8+ Sf8+ 36 *hl Sxe8? 37 Sf8+! Sxf8 (after 37...*h7 38 Rf5+ Black is worse) 38 Qg8+! forcing stalemate. Therefore, Black would have to play
36...£tf2+ 37 Sxf2 Sxe8, with a large
advantage although no forced win. The final move, 34... f8, is actu- ally the strongest and leads to a forced win for Black, although it appears the least likely move because it self-pins the f2-rook. White can only try 35 Se2 Hf6+ 36 Sff2 (36 Hef2 Sxf2 37 Ra8+ *e7 38 Re4+ *f6 wins) 36...Sxf2 37 Qa8+, but there is no perpetual check:
37...*f7 38 Qe8+ (38 Qd5+ *f6)
38...*f6 39 "e7+ (39 Rf8+ *g6)
AT THE BOARD 15
This type of reasoning is very com- mon and is extremely useful in rapidly cutting down the number of moves that you have to consider, but it also has its dangers. It is almost the reverse of the computer's logic; instead of us- ing the analysis to evaluate the posi- tion, the 'evaluation' is used to prune the analysis tree. However, because the initial 'evaluation' is not based on concrete analysis of the current posi- tion, it is inherently unreliable. Typi- cally, players simply carry over their evaluation from the preceding move and use it as a starting point for the next one. If the evaluation is inaccu- rate, then all kinds of odd things can start to happen. Suppose you have three possible moves, A, B and C, and believe that you have the advantage. You analyse A and decide that it leads to equality; B the same. You then con- clude that C must be the correct move with very little analysis. If the position is in fact equal, then C may actually lead to a disadvantage, although you do not realize this immediately. Then, because you tend to carry over evalua- tions from one move to the next, you repeat this exercise in defective logic the next move. The upshot is a whole string of inaccurate moves; this is, in fact, what is commonly known as 'lo- sing the thread of the game'. If you experience 'losing the thread', try af- terwards to trace the problem back to its root cause; surprisingly often, the source of the error was a faulty evalua- tion. Y. Seirawan - J.

I was very happy with the result of the opening. It seemed to me that 8 d5 was premature, giving Black a target to aim at with ...c6 and ...e6. In the dia- gram position, I felt that the move f3 was not only a loss of time, but even served to weaken White's dark squares, especially e3. It is thanks to this that White cannot castle (allowing the e3- bishop to be exchanged by ...Nc4 and ... e3 would really be bad for White). Therefore I assessed the position as slightly better for Black, but this was just wrong. Perhaps White has not played the opening in optimal style, but a small inaccuracy by White is not enough to hand Black the advantage; he has equalized, but no more.

Nc4 are fine for Black, but the fact that White had to play this artificial-looking king move seemed to justify my earlier assessment. I was now quite excited about various tacti- cal possibilities involving a bishop or knight moving to g4, but at the mo- ment no such idea is effective.

then Black would have been in trou- ble. The d6-pawn is under fire and the h7-knight can only emerge in the dis- tant future. Even the solid 25 Sfl would have given White a clear advan- tage. In this example the chain of events was: a bad assessment of the position, resulting in over-ambitious play by Black; then avoidance of drawing lines, leading to the awful 17... h5?. Black only got back on track after his position had severely deteriorated.
18 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
When to analyse One question which Kotov did not really cover is whether to analyse at all, or how much to analyse. Yet this is of great practical importance. One might end up playing better moves if one could analyse for an unlimited time, but games played before the in- troduction of chess clocks (and some postal games) show that this is not necessarily the case. Too much analy- sis can easily lead to fatigue and con- fusion. These days the tendency is towards faster and faster time-limits, and this means that apportioning one's thinking time becomes ever more cru- cial. When analysing a given position, it is fair to say that one almost always sees more in the first five minutes than in the next five minutes. The five min- utes after that is even less productive, and so on. I have observed that if a player spends more than 20 minutes over a move, the result is almost al- ways a mistake. The normal decision- making process should not take longer than this, even in fairly complex situa- tions. There will, of course, always be exceptions to any such empirical law, but in this case they are fairly rare. If a player takes a long time over a move, the reason is usually either indecision or inability to find a satisfactory con- tinuation. It is very unusual for the po- sition to be so complicated that it really demands more than 20 minutes' thought. If you have thought about a position for some time and are still unsure what to play, then it is essential to be ruth- lessly pragmatic. You have to ask yourself whether further thought is really going to help you make a better decision. Suppose your lengthy cogi- tation is the result of indecision; for example, say there are two moves, both of which have roughly equal merit. If you have not been able to decide be- tween them up to now, it is reasonable to suppose that there is in fact little to choose between them. Considerable further thought might eventually re- veal some tiny difference, but it is rare that this expenditure of time is worth- while. First of all, it is easy to be wrong when dealing with such fine distinc- tions and secondly, gaining an infini- tesimal advantage is of little value if the result is that you run into time- trouble and blunder away a piece. Games are decided by very small ad- vantages far less often than is usually supposed. There are players, such as Capablanca and Karpov, with the abil- ity to convert a small advantage into a win on a regular basis, but this talent is rare even amongst grandmasters. Games in which the players make er- rors and the advantage swings back and forth are far more common; in the end the decision comes about as a re- sult of a serious mistake. My advice is to obey your instinctive feeling as to which of the two moves is better or, if you don't have any preference, just choose at random. I have occasionally
AT THE BOARD 19
been tempted to toss a coin at the board, but despite the undoubted psy- chological impact on the opponent, this does seem rather unsporting. If you are unable to find a satisfac- tory continuation, then once again it usually does not help to think on and on hoping for a miracle. Of course, if it is a question of coming up with some- thing or resigning, then you may as well continue, but this is uncommon. Usually, you are better off playing what appears to be the least unfavour- able continuation and saving the time for accurate defence and possible counterplay later on. It is worth noting that if you are generally unhappy with your position, then this might well be colouring your assessments. Before choosing a move, it is probably worth having a quick review of the alterna- tives and the reasons why you deemed them unsatisfactory, to see if they are really as bad as you imagine. It is not unusual suddenly to find that your in- tended equal continuation is slightly worse for you; you then look at more and more unfavourable possibilities, become deeply depressed about your position, and forget that the first line you looked at wasn't actually all that bad. Another common time-waster is instinctively to want to play a certain move and then to spend a long time trying to back up this intuitive feeling with concrete analysis. Don't do this. If your intuition is telling you strongly to play move X, then you will probably play it in the end anyway and further thought is only going to waste time. The situation which represents the worst of all worlds is when you want to play X, but can't find any objective reason for doing so; then you analyse and analyse until you find some half- baked and dubious reason why X is a good move. Then you end up playing a dubious move and spending a lot of time. However, it is usually worth- while spending a few minutes trying to find something concrete wrong with your intuitive choice, because posi- tional intuition doesn't insure against the possibility that it might be bad for tactical reasons. If, during these few minutes you don't find anything wrong, then you should just play the move. The following game is a successful example of playing (almost!) without calculation. J.

19..."b8
After 19...Sxe5 20 f3 Bb4 21 fxe4 JLxel 22 "xel Qb6 23 *hl White has a large advantage since an assault on g7 is not far away. The text-move was unexpected, but the point is clear: if White takes three times on e4, then Black just plays ...Sxe5. 20 e6 A key moment. I thought for a few minutes about the direct 20 Qg4, when Black has almost no choice but to play 20...Qxe5. Then it looks as though there must be a tactical possi- bility using the long diagonal, but I could only see one idea: 21 df5 Qxb2 22 Nxh6+ Nh7 23 Nxf7 "xc2
24 Sxe4 dxe4 25 Ng5+, followed by
Rh5. However, even a quick glance is enough to show that the analysis of this line will be very complicated: in the middle Black can try 24...Sxe4, or he may decline the second piece and play, for example, 23...W6. Here is a case in which a quick scan of the other possibilities is much bet- ter than the twenty minutes or so which would have been required to as- sess this double piece sacrifice. I first looked at 20 Ngf5 Sxe5 21 Qg4 g6, but there seemed to be nothing clear. Then the text-move occurred to me and I was at once attracted to it. After 2O...fxe6 21 xe4 dxe4 22 Bxe4 Bxe4 23 Sxe4 Black has a miserable position; the e6-pawn is weak, the

It seemed to me that it would be very hard to put the extra pawn to good use in such a position. Looking back on it, I think this line would also have been somewhat better for White, since Black still has trouble using his knight effectively. The more dynamic game continuation is at least as good, and presents Black with diffi- cult decisions. In general, White would be quite happy for Black to exchange knights on g3, as then he would have an auto- matic attack by Rd3 (meeting ...g6 by e6). However, I was not prepared to spend a tempo on forcing it by playing 19 f3. Moreover, this move both weak- ens the a7-gl diagonal and blocks the

DAUT
This acronym means: if in doubt, 'Don't Analyse Unnecessary Tactics'. Tactical analysis is an error-prone activity. Overlooking one important finesse can completely change the re- sult of the analysis. If it is possible to decide on your move on purely posi- tional considerations then you should do so; it is quicker and more reliable. There are, of course, many positions in which concrete analysis is essential, a5-knight remains offside and White can step up his pressure with natural moves such as Rg4 and Hael. Best of all, it is simple and risk-free. Home analysis shows that the dou- ble piece sacrifice leads to a draw: af- ter 25 Ng5+ g8 26 Qh5 in the above line, Black can respond 26...e3! and White has nothing more than perpet- ual check.
20...W4
Another rather unexpected move. 21 xe4 dxe4 22 g3 Again a simple choice. In order to avoid losing the pawn on e4, Black's queen must move onto the long diago- nal, but then White has various tactical ideas based on moving the d4-knight.

It is important to take into account any finesse which might make the win easier. Here White has the choice be- tween 23 Re2 and 23 Rg4 h5 24 Qe2. The latter is clearly superior for two reasons. Firstly the protruding pawn on h5 is a weakness, as it will be unde- fended; secondly, the weakening of the g5-square may allow White to oc- cupy it later with his knight, creating a permanent danger to Black's king. This is an example of the method of comparison (page 44).

Nc5 5 O-O d6 6 c3 O-O 7 Nbd2 a6 8 Nb3 Na7 9 h3 Nd7 10 Nc2 f5 11 exf5 Sxf5 12 d4 Hf8 Black has played the opening in a rather provocative manner, aiming to open the f-file and create counterplay by attacking f2. However, the cost has been retarded development.
13 Ne4
After 13 d5 Ne7 14 Ng5 15 Nde4 White has secure control over e4, which would warm the heart of anyone who plays against the King's Indian. Unfortunately for White, the black bishop is on a7 rather than g7, and the pressure on f2 gives Black rea- sonable counterplay.
13...exd4 (D)
With quite a few of White's pieces pointing at Black's naked kingside, there is clearly potential for a forcing continuation, but which move should he choose? 14 eg5, 14 fg5, 14 Jlb3+ and 14 Jlg5 are all reasonable continuations. I would regard this as a borderline case for deciding whether to spend the time to analyse every- thing thoroughly. The position does indeed look promising on purely stra- tegic grounds, but the wide range of moves at White's disposal indicates that a complete analysis will be very time-consuming. In the end I decided on a straight- forward forcing continuation which gives White a slight positional advan- tage. In fact White could have secured a larger advantage by another line, but that is the risk one takes in making a decision not to look too deeply into a position. However, I would certainly have taken my time had there not been an advantageous alternative. 14 &eg5 Here is an analysis of the other pos- sibilities: 1) 14 i.g5 Qe8 15 Sei de5 16 Nxd4 Bxh3! 17 gxh3 Bxd4 18 cxd4 £rf3+ 19 <Ng2 Nxel+ 20 Wxel Nxd4 and Black is slightly better. 2) 14 Rd3 £ce5 15 xe5 2>xe5 16 2rf6+ Qxf6 17 Qxh7+ *f7 de- fends. 3) 14 Bb3+ *h8 15 £fg5 Re7 (not 15... de5 16Nxh7!) 16 2)e6 (16

the upshot is at best 'unclear'. It is then incredibly hard to write your analysis off as a waste of time and start thinking about alternative ideas. Even- tually you convince yourself to play the tactical line with an argument like 'well, he probably won't find his way through all the complications, and even then he doesn't have any advan- tage'. Thus you end up playing a move which is objectively not the best, and it is amazing how often one's opponent does indeed find his way through the complications once they have been forced on him. prepared to sacrifice the rook on gl to achieve it. The game continued with the complex tactical variation 19 f4! 2tf3 20 Rg2 xgl 21 e5 O-O 22 Nd3 ! Bxe5! 23 fxe5 Qxh4 24 Hxgl Rf4+ 25 &bl ! Qxe5. Even for a grandmas- ter, working one's way through this line is far from easy, but that is not the end of it. In the resulting position Black has a rook and three pawns for a bishop and a knight, on paper a con- siderable material advantage. How- ever, Anand showed that after 26 Qc5 ! White's initiative prevents Black from co-ordinating his pieces. He went on to win very nicely. One can hardly criticize Anand's choice, as it did give him the advan- tage in a very forcing way, but for or- dinary mortals (and normal GMs such as myself) this continuation would be a distinct leap in the dark. If faced with the diagram position, it would be rea- sonable to spot 19 f4 and think "Well, that may be good, but it's very compli- cated. I'll analyse it if I have to, but is there another line which gives me the advantage and involves less risk?" The move 19 Be2 is natural; it threatens f4 and e5 without any sacrifice at all. Black cannot blockade White's pawns with 19...g5 because 20 hxg5 hxg5 21 Qxb4 (or 20 "xb4 gxh4 21 Sxd4) is very good for White. Anand did not play this move because of 19...d3, which is indeed the only reasonable reply. However, White can then con- tinue 20 Re3! and Black is in big trou- ble. The threat of f4 and e5 is renewed, V. Anand - G. Kamsky Linares 1994 In this position a great deal depends on White's mobile e- and f-pawns. If he can set them moving by f4 and e5, gaining tempi with both moves, then Black will be dead lost. At the moment, however, Black threatens a fork on f3. Anand decided that forcing through f4 and e5 was so important that he was

He cannot castle ow- ing to 26 xh6, the g7-pawn is hang- ing, White threatens Rc5 and the bishop is dominated by the powerful centralized knight. This variation is fairly straightforward to calculate, and probably not really necessary as after

stands very well. Thus White could have gained at least as much advan- tage as in the game with the simple move 19 Be2. It is easy to imagine that having calculated the difficult and attractive line with 19 f4, White was not eager to find an equally good sim- ple alternative, even though moves like 19 Be2 and 20 Qe3 are child's play to someone such as Anand. Safety-nets When you are thinking about a com- plex and lengthy tactical line, espe- cially one involving sacrifices, it helps to have a safety-net, i.e. an alternative line which you can adopt if, half-way through your intended continuation, you discover that it doesn't work. The simplest type of safety-net is when you have a perpetual check in hand (D). This looks like a fairly normal Naj- dorf Sicilian, but Shirov found an imaginative tactical idea.

Shirov did not analyse 19...£te4!?, but perhaps this would have been a way for Black to reach a reasonable position. The main line runs 20 Sc5 (20 Bxc4 bxc4 21 £ki4 g5! is much better for Black than the game, as with- out the bishop on d3 White's threats are far less dangerous) 20..Bxf4 21 Oxc7 Nxg3 22 hxg3 Nxb2 and White Ar THE BOARD 27 variations can indeed be carried much further, but in this position there are numerous options for both players, and this increases the complexity by a large factor. Shirov based his sacrifice largely on intuition. In this position, with Black's king seriously exposed, he must have felt that there would very likely be a way to play for a win. Moreover, at the back of his mind there was the com- forting knowledge that if in fact there was no winning attempt, he had the safety-net of perpetual check to fall back on. 23 xc5 Rxc5 24 e5! A risk-free method of playing for a win. This introduces the d3-bishop into the attack, and possibly the c3- knight as well, while all the time re- taining the option of perpetual check.

Shirov now thought carefully about the various options for playing on. This raises the question as to why he embarked on the combination if he had no idea how he was going to con- tinue at this stage. The answer is that even a leading grandmaster such as Shirov is human. We are already six moves away from the start of the com- bination, and it is not possible to cal- culate complex tactics accurately an indefinite distance ahead. Very forcing

A. Yusupov - L. Portisch Tunis Interzonal 1985 In this position Black has already moved his king and so cannot castle kingside. White has just attacked the c-pawn with Nb5 and 18..Bd6 would be a normal reply. Yusupov certainly has some compensation for the pawn as Portisch's king is stuck in the cen- tre, but Black's pieces are fairly well placed and he is, at any rate, not worse.

Portisch was certainly aware that taking the knight with the b-pawn would expose his king too much, and the text-move was the point of his idea. He aims to take the knight with a piece, leaving the b7-pawn to defend his knight and provide his king with adequate defence.
21 Hedl+ <4>c8 (D)
The critical moment. Portisch has staked the game on his ability to take the knight with a piece. If he fails, then he will inevitably lose because the con- cessions he has made in order to trap the knight are so large. He has been prepared to go a pawn down (two pawns have been sacrificed, but he was a pawn up in the diagram posi- tion) and, just as important, he has been prepared to expose his own king seriously. In view of the total lack of any safety-net, Portisch should have made absolutely sure that there was no hole in his calculations. 22 b4! Yusupov pinpoints the flaw in the whole concept.

Ra4+ Nc5 33 Nd2 1-0 Implicit commitments Almost every move in chess involves some sort of commitment. A pawn move cannot be reversed and with each advance the pawn permanently loses the ability to control certain squares. Even a piece move is a commitment; if the piece turns out to be badly placed on its new square, it may have to go into reverse, with consequent loss of time. However, the degree of commit- ment is important. A piece sacrifice involves a greater degree of commit- ment than a natural developing move. We have already discussed the more obvious types of commitment earlier. However, there is a more subtle type of commitment, which we call im- plicit commitment. Very often, a cer- tain type of commitment is bound up in a player's choice of opening. A player as White adopting the Velimi- rovic Attack in the Sicilian (one of the main lines of which runs 1 e4 c5 2 3 Nc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 2tf6 5 c3 d6
6 Bc4 e6 7 Ne3 kel 8 Re2 a6 9 O-O-O
Rc7 10 Bb3 O-O 11 g4) is committing himself to an all-out kingside attack, which may involve sacrifices, and if he is hesitant about giving up material then he has simply chosen the wrong opening. Of course, this is an extreme example - there are few opening varia- tions as one-sided as the Velimirovic Attack, but the same general principle applies in many openings. For exam- ple, it is not unusual for a player to seize a long-term strategic advantage in return for piece activity or a lead in development. In this case the player with the better development has taken on an implicit commitment to under- take rapid action. Advantages such as a lead in development are inherently temporary, because when the oppo- nent has brought out all his pieces the advantage disappears. A common mis- take is to take on such a position, but not to appreciate that the long-term chances lie with the opponent. The re- sult is a fatal lack of urgency. Here is an example. J. Nunn - J. Mellado Leon 1997 French Defence

10...2tec6 11 O-O (D)
trouble feeding across to the other side of the board. In the endgame the pawn is more likely to promote, as there are fewer pieces available to keep it under control. Black would probably have to assign one piece to keep a watchful eye on the pawn, leaving him a man short elsewhere. The only caveat here is that White should not exchange too many pieces in an endgame, since then Black could use his king as the block- ading piece. In return for White's long-term as- set, Black's minor pieces can converge to attack the e5-pawn and for some time White will be tied down to its de- fence. Moreover, Black's development is quite good, especially as White will have to invest some time in regaining the pawn on c4. However, these com- pensating factors are all temporary, and given time White will complete his development and reorganize his forces to defend e5 efficiently. Black has therefore taken on a heavy implicit commitment either to keep White off- balance or to convert his temporary advantages into something more per- manent before White puts his house in order. If Black has not achieved some- thing concrete within the next half- dozen moves, then we can safely pre- dict that he will be in trouble. White, on the other hand, can con- tent himself with more modest play. All he need do is consolidate his po- sition and bring all his pieces into play and Black will 'automatically' be worse. Of course, this might have been This is a typical case of implicit commitment. The extra pawn is not relevant, as White will win back the c4-pawn in a few moves. The key fac- tor is that Black has allowed White to drive a wedge into the middle of his position. The protected passed pawn is not going to promote in the near future - there are simply too many pieces on the board for that - but it is an asset both in the middlegame and in the endgame. In the middlegame it stifles the activity of Black's pieces and cuts communication between the queen- side and kingside. This could help White to mount a kingside attack, for Black's queenside pieces would have
32 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
quite difficult if Black had continued accurately, but nevertheless White's position is easier to play. He has a very clear-cut aim, while Black must try to generate counterplay 'somehow', i.e. he has to formulate a plan from scratch, whereas White's plan is handed to him on a plate. This is a typical situation in such 'long-term advantage vs piece play' situations. The piece-play side has much more work to do, at least to begin with, to find the best plan. If he succeeds, then the other side may also have to think carefully about how to contain his opponent's counterplay, but if he does not succeed the game can be quite easy. To my surprise, Black spent very little time over the next few moves and only started to think when he was al- ready in considerable difficulties. Evi- dently he did not appreciate that this is the critical phase of the game and ordi- nary developing moves will not be enough. From all this we can learn an im- portant lesson. At the end of the open- ing, spend a few minutes deciding whether one player has the better long-term chances. This may be obvi- ous simply from the opening variation chosen (for example, in the Exchange Ruy Lopez it is obviously White who has the better long-term chances), but if it is at all unclear then it is worth spending time on this question. The strategy for the two players may then be quite clear: one side must aim to consolidate and contain his opponent; the other must play to stir up trouble quickly.

After 18 Sadi, for instance, Black can continue 18...c4 and try to plant a knight on d3 (for which White will probably have to give up the ex- change). 16 i.f4 b6 If now 16...b5, then White replies 17 ?)cd2; thanks to Black's inaccurate 15th move, the knight can retreat to the centre rather than to a3. 17 b3 White must not allow the exchange of queens. His own queen is well placed in the centre of the board, while Black's is marooned on the queenside, so such an exchange would clearly fa- vour Black.
17... d5
The transfer of the knight to d5 has blocked the d-file and prevented White backing up his pawn with a rook at dl , but it has also relieved the pressure on the e5-pawn.
18.fi.g3
Now the defects of Black's earlier play start to become apparent. Cer- tainly he has developed his pieces, but he has done nothing to prevent White doing the same. All other things being equal, the position will favour White because of his superior structure. More and more, Black struggles to find con- structive moves. He can only under- mine White's pawns by ...f6, but then White would swap on f6, leaving the e6-pawn hopelessly weak.
18...h6
Black wants to prevent White sup- porting his d-pawn by a later .fi.h4, covering the queening square, but we can already see that Black is running out of ideas.
19 Re4
A typical move from the player who has time on his side. It does not create any immediate threat, but tidies up White's position by unpinning the c4-knight. Black also has the worry that the white queen might now switch to the kingside and form the basis of a direct attack.
19...5ac8 20 h4
Both relieving White's back rank (his king would be very safe on h2) and making another threatening ges- ture against Black's king.
20...b5 21 Ne3 (D)
White aims to open the d-file by re- moving Black's best-placed piece, the blockading knight on d5.
21... cb4?
The correct plan is indeed to use the second knight to restore the d-file blockade, but this move is a tactical er- ror which leads to the loss of material.

Hxa8 40 cb3 1-0 Positional thinking Although precise analysis plays some part in most chess situations, posi- tional thinking is just as important. Even in sharp situations, positional factors can still play a major part; for example, there is little point in playing a combination winning the exchange if the result is a position riddled with weaknesses (see Sax-Stean on page 105). Unfortunately, if you have little natural talent for it, positional think- ing is one of the most difficult aspects of chess to learn. One often hears of how a certain player has a 'natural feel' for the pieces and instinctively puts them on the right squares. This is either an innate ability or something which is learnt by experience. If you have played over and studied thou- sands of games, and seen all the differ- ent patterns and plans which can arise from the main openings, then you al- ready have a good start when it comes to positional play. Most players do not have the time for this sort of study and must focus their efforts where they will do the most good. This really means con- centrating on the types of middlegame position which can arise from your

opening repertoire. Most openings give rise to certain distinctive central pawn structures. Some pawn structures are particular to just one opening. Look, for example, at the following diagram: Accepted, Nimzo-Indian, etc. If such pawn structures arise in your reper- toire, it pays to look not only at games with 'your' opening, but at others which give rise to identical central pawn structures. If you have a data- base program with a 'position search' facility, then you can use this to find which openings result in a particular pawn structure. Once you have identified the main pawn structures relevant to your open- ings, then try to find games resulting in these structures. Once again, a data- base program makes this easy. If there are too many games to play over, then restrict yourself to games by grand- masters - there is no point playing over games in which the players adopt quite inappropriate plans. It is much better if the games are annotated, pref- erably with words rather than sym- bols. Languageless annotations are fine for displaying tactical analysis, but when it comes to explaining the plans for both sides, there is no substi- tute for a clear explanation in words by someone who really understands the opening. Opening books which emphasize general ideas and plans may also be of help. For each pawn structure, try to play over about fifty games. This should be enough to give you an idea both of the typical plans adopted by both players, and of which plans tend to succeed. The idea is not really to learn what to play in specific positions, but to see what the two players are trying to do, You don't need to see the position of the pieces to know that it's almost certainly a Winawer French. On the other hand, look at the following dia- gram: It could be virtually anything: Caro- Kann, 2 c3 Sicilian, Queen's Gambit

point, which comes into play later in the game, is that White's al -rook may emerge via a3. Of course, this slightly unusual idea is hardly enough to win the game by it- self, but it puts Onishchuk off his stride. Instead of the normal patterns in this system, he has to work out a plan for himself. As we shall see, Ad- ams has a much better grasp of the re- quirements of the position.

Once again taking the chance to steer the game along original paths. The mechanical reply would be 9 Qxc4, when the knight could later drop back to e3. However, Adams chooses a dif- ferent move, which greatly strength- ens his grip on d5. He has already formulated his plan for the next phase of the game: to increase his control of the light squares as much as possible, with particular reference to d5 and f5. Rather unusually, this is the only plan he needs to win the game! The first step is to transfer his knight from d2 to e3.
9...5.8 10
Preparing £te3, taking aim at both critical squares.
10...Bf8?
A definite error. One of White's problems is that the immediate £te3 is impossible because the e4-pawn would be hanging. Thus White would have to spend some time preparing £te3. By allowing White to play Jlg5 and Bxf6, Black not only lets White solve the problem of developing his bishop, and how each side tries to frustrate the other's plans. By looking at all these games in quick succession, you will notice connections and similarities be- tween them which would not be ap- parent if you looked at them over a period of months. When these posi- tions arise in your games, you will then have a much better idea of what you should be trying to do. Even grandmasters depend on this type of knowledge, and if they are thrown into unfamiliar territory, then they immediately start to play much less strongly. The following game is an illustration of this, but it also dem- onstrates a second valuable lesson: the importance of sticking consistently to a plan. M. Adams - A. Onishchuk Tilburg 1997 Two Knights Defence
1 e4 e5 2 £tf3 c6 3 Nc4 4 d3
Ne7 5 O-O O-O 6 a4 d6 7 Nbd2 Adams is playing this quiet system in a slightly unusual way. White nor- mally plays c3 at some stage, so as to preserve his c4-bishop from exchange (he can meet ...Na5 by Bb5, and then drop it back to a4 and c2 if Black chases it with his pawns). Adams has countered the threat of ...?)a5 in a dif- ferent way, by playing a4. This not only enables him to maintain the bishop on the a2-g8 diagonal, but may also form the basis of a space-gaining operation on the queenside. A third Ar THE BOARD 37 but also allows £te3 without loss of time. Already one can see the outlines of a good knight vs bad bishop position shaping up. Black should have played 10...h6. He need not worry about 11 Ng3 Bf8 12 £rf5, because the knight can be ex- pelled by 12..Ah7 followed by ...g6.
11 Ng5 h6
Having played ...Bf8, it would have been psychologically very difficult to return to e7, although that might have been the best choice. The move played ultimately turns out to weaken Black's kingside. 12 i.xf6 Rxf6 up with a concrete line in which a5 turned out to be a useful move, but he must look to the long term. Given that he is aiming for light-squared control, the possibility of a6, forcing ...b6, would be helpful. Black can, of course, prevent this by playing ...a6 himself, but this would not be without possible defects. White will at some stage play £ki5, and Black would like to be able to expel the knight with ...c6. If he has already played ...a6, then the knight can settle on b6. Thus Black is presented with a choice of evils, which never makes for an easy decision.
14... e7 15 Sa3
Another useful move. Once again, White is looking forward to the day when Black will have to play ...c6, leaving his d6-pawn weak. Now the rook can come to d3, stepping up the pressure against d6 without loss of time. The firepower could even be in- creased by Sel-e2-d2. Note that when one is lining up the heavy artillery along an open or half-open file, it is usually better to have the rooks in front of the queen. Here White can achieve this ideal formation very effi- ciently. Both these ideas (gaining a queen- side space advantage and developing the rook via a3) were already inherent in White's 6th move, so Adams's play has been very consistent.

Black will be two pawns down for nothing. There comes a point in the vast ma- jority of games when your acquired knowledge will be exhausted and you will have to rely on your own re- sources. This point normally arises in the early middlegame. The next step is to formulate a plan. You may already have some idea of the options avail- able from your opening study; this will help you to narrow your search. In any case, it is time for some serious thought; the plan you choose now will go a long way towards defining the whole shape of the struggle to come. In some positions, for example, those with a blocked centre, it may be ap- propriate to construct a long-term plan which may require ten or twenty moves to execute. More likely, your plan will be much shorter-range, lasting per- haps five moves. This applies particu- larly in relatively open positions. Here are some tips on making a plan: 1) Make sure your plan is benefi- cial. There is no point aiming for a tar- get which does not actually enhance your position. Typical misguided plans are: attacking on the wrong part of the board; aiming for the exchange of the wrong pieces; committing yourself to weakening pawn advances. 2) Make sure your plan is realistic. There is no point in embarking on a five-move plan if your opponent can wait for the first four moves, and then stop your plan by playing one move himself. 3) Make sure your plan is not tacti- cally flawed. Even if what you are aiming for is worthwhile, this will not help if your opponent can mate you while you are executing it. Having decided on a particular plan, you have to strike a balance be- tween consistency and flexibility. On the one hand, pointless changes of plan are very damaging. If you play two moves of one plan, then three moves of another, then four moves of a third, you will probably be back more or less where you started! The ideal situation occurs when you formulate a plan and, while you are executing it, your oppo- nent does little either to prevent it or to develop counterplay. Then you can produce an elegant positional game which is dominated by a single strate- gic thread. However, games like this normally only arise between players of very different strengths (the Adams- Onishchuk game above is an excep- tion in this respect). More often your plan will be blown off course because your opponent will interfere with it in some way. While consistency is a vir- tue, sometimes you have to be as prag- matic as a politician in changing your

plan. If your opponent has blocked Plan A, but at the cost of creating a weakness elsewhere on the board, it would be foolish to stick to your origi- nal intention, ignoring the new situa- tion. Instead you should rethink your strategy. Most games are like this: the players formulate a series of mini- plans and strike a balance between forwarding their own plans and inter- fering with those of the opponent. Eventually the balance is upset, either by one player's plan succeeding deci- sively, or by the game dissolving into tactics. J. Nunn - V. Hort Wijk aan Zee 1982 Giuoco Piano

5 d3 a6 6 O-O d6 7 £fod2 O-O 8
Nb3 Na7 9 Sei Ne6 10 Nc4 h6 11 a4 White has adopted a quiet opening system which avoids an early d4 in the hope of playing it at a more effective moment later. While this system is very solid, it has the defect that if Black plays in equally solid style, the game may simply peter out to a draw. White's last move aims for a5, gain- ing space on the queenside and await- ing a more favourable moment for the thematic move £te3 (aiming at the squares d5 and f5). Readers will al- ready be familiar with this type of strategy from the Adams-Onishchuk game given above. The game has now deviated from known theory, so it is time for White to think about his long-term plan and im- mediate 'mini-plan'. Since the posi- tion is still fairly fluid, it is difficult to create any long-term plans; trying to anticipate what will happen more than a few moves ahead is fruitless, as too many things might happen to throw a plan off course. However, the mini- plan is much easier; as mentioned ear- lier, one of White's ideas in this open- ing is to play d4 in the middlegame, when it may be more awkward for Black. White cannot play d4 immedi- ately, as Black could take on b3 and then on d4, so 13 Bc2 is indicated. Then d4 will be a real inconvenience, as Black must meet the threatened fork by d4-d5.

After this White's advantage is safe. Black would have preferred not to make this exchange, but he was proba- bly worried about the pressure on b5. However, he could have made a bid for counterplay by 15...b4!?. 16 cxd4 c6 The first mini-plan is over and has achieved a definite success, but now it is time for the next. White has a per- manent advantage in his greater cen- tral control, if only he can maintain his 'two abreast' centre intact. Thus his next mini-plan should consist of con- solidation. The immediate problem is the e4-pawn; Black need only move his e6-bishop to attack it awkwardly. White cannot defend it by Rf3, be- cause the queen must defend the d- pawn. One solution is to play f3, but the weakening on the a7-gl diagonal is ugly, especially in view of the lurk- ing bishop on a7 - Black would have good chances for counterplay by means of a timely ...c5. 17 h3! The start of an alternative plan for supporting e4, based on W 1-g3. White first of all rules out the possibility of ..Bg4, which might be annoying once the e3-knight has moved away.
17...Qc7 18 £tfl Nd7 (D)
Now e4 is defended, and at first sight a natural continuation would be 19 ?)g3, further covering the central pawn and making a move towards Black's king. However, one should al- ways take into account the opponent's intentions and see if there is a possi- bility to frustrate them. Black's recent moves, removing the bishop from e6, suggest that he intends to play ...c5. After 19 g3 c5 20 d5 c4, for exam- ple, Black activates his queenside ma- jority while White, thanks to the bishop on a7, has trouble getting his own cen- tral majority moving. 19 b4! A very ambitious move, which is only justified because White's central structure is already secure. Now if

while all the white minor pieces are well placed to create threats on that side of the board. I decided simply to move my pieces towards Black's king by ?)g3 and Rf3. At this point White could think about a breakthrough by d5 or e5, or simply play gaining the two bishops. 22 £Q3 Sae8 23Qf3 h7 Black could have tried the tricky

White would just play 24 W5. The text-move takes the sting out of d5 or e5, so White goes for £tf5. 24 £tf5 Nxf5 25 Rxf5 (D) Black ever plays ...c5, White will re- ply bxc5 and d5, gaining a massive central majority. Moreover, the cl- bishop can now move to b2, setting up further latent threats against Black's kingside. In a sense, this move falls under the heading of 'consolidation', because it is mainly directed against the possibility of Black breaking up White's centre by ...c5.
19...bxa4
Black now threatens to attack the b4-pawn along the half-open file, and White's first priority is to defend it. The pawn on a4 can be recaptured later.
20 Nb2 Rb6 21 Nc3 He7
After 21...c5 White would ignore the hanging piece since 22 dxc5 dxc5
23 Bxf6 Rxf6 24 Qxd7 cxb4 is rather
messy. Instead he would continue with the thematic reply 22 bxc5 dxc5 23 d5, when the possible counterplay against f2 is not a serious worry, e.g. 23...c4 24 Rd2 (24 Se2? Nxe4! draws) 24...Sab8
25 Se2, and White is ready for e5.
After the text-move, White must create his next mini-plan. The centre is secured and Black cannot attack it with ...c5 or ...d5, the latter because the reply e5 would give White an auto- matic kingside attack. Black evidently intends to restrain White's centre by doubling rooks on the e-file, which leaves open the ques- tion as to how White should make progress. My eye was naturally at- tracted to Black's kingside; there is only a single knight defending it, Black's next move anticipates e5 by White.
25...Nf8
White now has the two bishops to show for his efforts, but the knight on f8 is an effective defender of the king- side and direct attacking attempts do not appear promising. White must take care, or else Black's latent pres- sure along the lines a7-gl and e8-el might be unleashed.
AT THE BOARD 43
I therefore decided to switch to the queenside, and build up against the a6-pawn. Note that this plan would not have been effective before as Black could simply have played ..Bc8.
26 Hxa4 e6 27 Sdl Nc7?!
Black decides to pre-empt White's attack on the a-pawn and hopes to oc- cupy a good square at b5, but now the knight is dangerously far away from the kingside. It would have been better to leave the knight on e6, ready to move to c7 or f8 as necessary.
28 Nb2
The immediate 28 e5 g6 is ineffec- tive as 29 Qf4 is met by 29...?)d5. Now, however, 29 e5 is a threat. Note how White has again changed his plan to utilize the circumstance that Black's knight has gone to the queenside.
28..."b5
Black does not want to be mated and, now that a6 is defended by the knight, he switches his queen to the kingside.

The imme- diate threat is 32 JLcl Qh4 33 g3 Rxh3 34 Af5.
31... e6?
Alarmed by the growing danger to his king, Hort, who was in severe time-trouble, decides to jettison his a- pawn in order to bring the knight over to the kingside. In many cases, if your pieces are tied down to defending a weak pawn, then letting the pawn go is a way to activate the pieces and de- velop counterplay (see page 136). In this case, however, it makes little dif- ference; the position remains more or less the same except that Black is a pawn down.

The rea- son is that you are really interested in relative assessments and not absolute ones. If, for example, you know that move A is '0.2 pawns' better than move B, then you would prefer A to B - it doesn't matter whether A is 0.3 pawns better for you or 0.1 pawns worse for you, it is only the relative evaluation which matters. In practice, of course, this type of logic is hard to apply if there are many different continuations. If you have al- ternatives A, B, C, D and E then com- paring A with B, C with E, D with A and so on is going to lead to a logical conundrum rather than a decision. It is much simpler to make an absolute as- sessment that A is a bit better for White, B is equal, and so on, and then pick the move with highest value. It follows that the method of com- parison, as we call it, works best when there are very few options (three at 37 sn Ultra-cautious in time-trouble. 37 f4 38 gxf4 Rxf4+ is of course unsound after 39 hl, but I wanted to make really sure there were no com- plications!

option of playing ...Rh4+ first. The only difference between these two lines is that in one White's g-pawn is on g2 and in the other on g3. There is no question that the additional move g3 helps Black. If White exchanges his b5-bishop on c6, then he will have less control of the light squares in any case; the weaknesses created by play- ing g3 would then be quite serious. It may well happen that White will change his mind and play the bishop back from b5, but in this case Black has gained time.

Whilst occasions in which one can consciously use the method of com- parison are not all that common, in some sense it is being used all the time. When one is thinking 'does that knight belong on c4 or g3?', this is really a comparison. There is no at- tempt to evaluate the consequences of these two alternatives in absolute Bd2 (D) terms; one is simply asking which is better. In this wider sense comparison is an important part of chess thinking. Making your opponent think Sometimes it is better to pass the re- sponsibility for a difficult decision on to your opponent. You may be con- templating, for example, the move ...h6 which allows a piece sacrifice Bxh6!?. You look at the sacrifice a lit- tle; it is a complete mess, extremely hard to evaluate. However, the alterna- tives to ...h6 are about equal. You may decide to play ...h6 without further thought, and put the responsibility of evaluating the sacrifice onto your

opponent - he will have to spend time coming to a definite conclusion in- stead of you. There is nothing more frustrating than thinking for half an hour, deciding that the sacrifice is not sound, playing ....h6 and meeting with the reply Sadi within 30 seconds. In- deed, there are many opponents who would use the logic that if you thought about the sacrifice for so long and still allowed it, then it must be unsound. Playing your move fairly quickly short-circuits this logic. Indeed, your opponent may wonder if you have even seen the sacrifice. Obviously, this type of logic can be overdone; it would be ridiculous to allow a sacrifice lead- ing to a clear-cut win. Moreover, if you were playing a dangerous attacking player, then provoking him to make a sacrifice is probably not a good idea. A 'making your opponent think' move usually works best if you are in a slightly inferior position. Then your opponent will be undecided about whether to continue positionally, in which case his advantage might prove insufficient for a win, or to enter the tactics, when, at the cost of some risk, he might end up with a larger advan- tage. If your opponent has a large ad- vantage to start with, then he will probably avoid tactics since he has good winning chances in any case. Here is an example (D). Black stands badly, mainly because of the miserable position of his bishop on g6. White intends to swap bishops on d6 and then play This will J. Nunn - S.

Conquest played this very quickly, which is a good practical 'make your opponent think' decision.

the consequences are not too serious, then you have an oversight; if the up- shot is catastrophic, then you have a blunder. Why do chess players blunder? Hu- man fallibility is obviously one rea- son, but the majority of blunders are not purely the result of chance. There are several factors that can greatly in- crease the probability of a blunder and if one is aware of these factors, then one can take particular care during these 'high-risk' periods. The most common cause of blun- dering is a previous oversight. Let us suppose that your opponent suddenly sacrifices a piece and that this sacri- fice comes as a complete surprise to you. A typical train of thought starts: "Oh, ****! I completely overlooked that. It looks strong; perhaps I will even have to resign. How could I have overlooked such a simple idea? How stupid. And I had such a winning posi- tion." Not very constructive. Making a serious oversight is a huge blow to one's self-confidence, it sends the mind into a whirl and turns the stom- ach upside down. Nobody's brain can function properly in such a state. The only real solution is to take the time necessary until one's mind and stom- ach have quietened down. The length of time this takes depends on one's personality and will-power, and of course how strong the opponent's move actually is! What is quite useless is to have a major bout of self- recrimination at the board - if your Black's counterplay has dried up, and it is White's turn to go on the of- fensive.

I hadn't realized that this move was possible, although in retrospect it is hard to imagine any other follow-up to Black's previous move. At once I saw that the position had become rather more murky than was really necessary and the knowledge that I had made a bit of a mess of it was the trigger for what followed. 17Qxe5 f6 18Qd4 (D) personality tends towards this, try to save it until the end of the game (by which time, hopefully, it may not be necessary). This is another reason why running short of time is a bad idea. If something unexpected happens, you do not have the possibility of a short 'time-out' to recover your composure. Here is an example of precisely the wrong reaction, taken from one of my own games. J. Nunn - D. Cox Norwich Junior International 1974 Sicilian, Pelikan I e4 c5 2 3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4

Warning signals One of the most common reasons for blundering is failure to take warning signs into account. Tactics very rarely strike out of a blue sky. There is nor- mally some underlying weakness, visi- ble beforehand, which the tactic seeks to exploit. When you see such a poten- tial vulnerability, it pays to look very carefully for a possible tactic by the opponent exploiting this weakness. Once I played 100 games against Mike Cook at 10 minutes (for him) vs 5 minutes (for me). At that time Mike was about 2300 strength. About half- way through the series (which I even- tually won 88-12) he explained his disappointment: "I thought that I would see lots of advanced strategic concepts in these games but actually all I have learnt is
LPDO."
"LPDO?"
"Loose Pieces Drop Off." During the remaining games I saw what he meant. Most of the games were decided by relatively simple tac- tics involving undefended pieces, when the LP would duly DO. Now, whenever I see such a combi- nation (they occur quite often), I think
'LPDO'.
Looking at the diagram overleaf, the LP on h8 should have been a a clear two-pawn advantage, but about
18...Nc5. After 19 Rd2 Re7 Black has
some nasty threats, while White has fallen somewhat behind in develop- ment. In fact White should be able to retain the better position by 20 O-O-O!, but of course White no longer has the same clear-cut advantage as at move 15.
18...Sxc2!?
This is not a particularly good move, but it had a devastating effect on me because I had completely missed it. Having now overlooked two of my op- ponent's moves, I went into a panic. I saw horrible threats such as 19...Qa5 or 19...Nc6 followed by ...Bb4+ and quickly decided that I had to get my kingside pieces out as rapidly as possi- ble. I saw that after 19 Bd3 Nxd3+ 20 Rxd3 Ra5+ (or 20...Nb4+) I would have to play $tfl, but the resulting po- sition did not look too bad. My king could find safety after g3 and g2, freeing the other rook; in addition Black's d-pawn would be very weak. Unfortunately my brain had stopped functioning.
19 Nd3?? Nc5 0-1
I am sure almost all players have had this experience at one time or an- other - disorientation caused by one mistake immediately leading to a sec- ond, much more serious, error. A calm look at the position after 18...Hxc2 would have shown that White is still clearly better after 19 Be2 (threaten- ing 20 Bh5+ followed by O-O), for ex- ample 19...Sg8 20 Bh5+ *f8 21 O-O

and White won easily. White's queen had earlier moved from dl to c2, so this is also an exam- ple of overlooking a switchback (see page 57). We will consider two other warning signals, but virtually any tactical weak- ness can give the opponent a chance for a combination. Note that by 'tact- ical weakness' I do not mean isolated pawns, bad bishops and other such long-term weaknesses; these are 'stra- tegic weaknesses'. A tactical weak- ness is a short-term vulnerability such as an undefended piece, a potential pin or fork, or a trapped piece. Tactical weaknesses may exist only for a single move, so if your opponent creates one, you should look for a way to exploit it straight away. One of the most common errors amongst beginners is to allow an e-file pin of the queen, but even GMs can underestimate the significance of a queen + king line-up. What is surprising about this exam- ple is that the initial move of the com- bination is one of the most familiar tactical blows in the Sicilian. It seems that the idea of it being followed up by anything other than Bxb5+ or ?)xb5 just didn't occur to Black. Even ex-world champions (or cur- rent ones, depending on your perspec- tive) can fall victim to LPDO (D): Black already has an LP on h5. He added a second one by ...

Of course 8 f2 is a very unusual move and one can easily imagine how Seirawan came to overlook it. In Open Games, White does not normally vol- untarily deprive himself of the right to castle, and in most positions it would be a waste of time for Black to start analysing king moves to the second rank. How, then, can one expect to spot moves such as in advance? This really is the point of the warning signs - they tell you when to take time out to look for unusual tactical motifs, which might only be justified because you have a potential vulnerability in your position.

7...Re7?
This is an example of a major com- mitment. Black's aim is to inconven- ience White's knight; indeed, one's instant reaction is that White must play 8 Re2 to avoid losing the knight to ...f5. However, if it turns out that White is not seriously inconvenienced by the pin, then Black has done quite a lot of damage to his own position: the queen obstructs the development of Black's kingside, takes away the last flight square from the knight on g6 and sets Black up for an e-file pin.

consider it a possibility for his oppo- nent. However, an extra piece provides pretty good compensation for the two bishops! Curiously, a similar 'diagonal dis- aster' occurred in another game from the Open Group of the same event. Our final warning sign is the weak diagonal.

We deal with the question of how to continue after you have made an over- sight under 'Defence' (see page 97). 'Hard-to-see' moves Another type of oversight is the sim- ple 'blind spot'. In this case it is not a question of a misjudgement, but of a move, either for oneself or for the op- ponent, simply not entering one's mind at all. This is usually because there is something odd about the move, so that it doesn't fit into any of the standard patterns. Here is a clear example. awkward situation. After the check on b5 Black will have to move his king, as

56 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
forced instant resignation by 29...Sd2!, which either wins a rook or mates. Ad- mittedly, Mestel was somewhat short of time, but even so it is not hard to calculate this simple combination, provided that the idea crosses one's mind in the first place. When two line-moving pieces are facing each other, the options are usu- ally limited to exchanging, allowing the opponent to exchange, or moving the attacked piece away. It is very un- usual for the piece to move part of the way towards the enemy piece. The ex- ception is when there is a very juicy outpost somewhere on an open file, practically begging a piece to land on it. That was not the case here, so the winning move was a little hard to see. Nevertheless, it is surprising that Mes- tel did in fact play a move along the file, so he must have noticed that it was impossible for White to take the rook after such a move. Evidently the fact that the rook was undefended on d2 formed just enough of a mental block to cause the oversight. I call such moves along the line of attack (without capturing the attack- ing piece) collinear moves. They are even more difficult to spot when the attacked piece moves away from the attacking piece. Here is one example from opening theory: 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6

"xb6+ 16 *hl (D) M. Tai - R. Fischer Curasao Candidates 1962 In this position White is aiming for the exchange of light-squared bishops. Then he will have certain potential advantages: pressure against the iso- lated a-pawn on an open file and the possibility of an eventual good knight vs bad bishop position with White's knight occupying d5 (for example, if White plays Sa2, then £ki2-c4-e3- d5). Fischer found a simple and ele- gant solution to Black's problems:
16..Bb5!. This collinear move leaves
White with three options: to leave the bishop on b5, to play Nxb5, or to play Bxb5. If White ignores the bishop, then Black's next move will be ...Bc6, both attacking the weak e4-pawn and supporting the thrust ...d5. To meet these threats White will be forced to play Bf3, but this is hardly the most active square for the bishop; Black would obtain good counterplay by ...a5-a4, when the b2-pawn is vulner- able. The second option, 17 xb5,

and now 24...Bxc3 would have left Black a pawn up with a good position. In the later game Unzicker-Fischer, Varna Olympiad 1962, the German grandmaster chose 21 h3 but lost in only five more moves: 21...Bc8 22 Bfel h6 23 *h2 Ng5 24 g3? Ra7 25 *g2 Ba2 26*flBxc3 0-1. Fischer's handling of this game was very impressive. Switchbacks are another potential blind spot. If you have just moved a piece from A to B, the idea of moving it back from B to A can be hard to spot. The third type of move which is hard to spot is the 'hesitation move'. This arises when a piece can move from A to either B or C. You decide that it is bad to move it to C and play it to B instead. Next move it would be good to play it from B to C, but you don't consider it because this is pre- cisely the move that you rejected a few moments ago. Here is an example (D); Black has a fairly miserable posi- tion. He is a pawn down, his king is somewhat exposed and White has a passed d-pawn which bears constant observation. However, the opposite- coloured bishops make it very hard for White to win, and in addition Black came up with an excellent defensive idea:
1..J14!
Now 2 Nxh4 Rf4+ 3 i.g3 Rh6+ leads to perpetual check, so I tried ... 2d7Nxd7 swaps off the knight which White was hoping to put on d5 later, and moves the weak a-pawn off the open file. The result would be a near-certain draw in view of the opposite-coloured bish- ops, but this might be White's best op- tion.

As an aside, I am one of those play- ers who gets up from the board after almost every move (but even when walking around, I am still thinking hard about the position). However, af- ter playing Bd6 I stayed at the board. When players are completely win- ning, they often remain at the board in order to accept their opponent's resig- nation, and I suspect that Filguth thus interpreted my unusual immobility. In fact, of course, I was frantically trying to find a good reply to ... h5. I seem to be especially prone to overlooking 'hesitation' moves.

simple 19 Qb3+ would have been enormously strong. After 19...Qxb3 (or else White swaps queens and takes on d3) 20 axb3 Sd8 21 He3 White wins the pawn, after which Black doesn't have much to show for his two-pawn deficit. I didn't even consider 19 Qb3+ for the simple reason that I had rejected it the previous move. It didn't occur to me that the 'extra' tempo ...d3 is actu- ally very helpful to White, because it severely weakens Black's d-pawn and, unlike the line after 18 Qb3+, White has not weakened the d4-square by playing c3-c4. It is worth trying to pinpoint repeti- tive errors in one's own play. These days, with the availability of strong computer programs, finding tactical errors is quite easy. I always quickly run my games past Fritz - it is often quite shocking what turns up! Time-trouble The advice here is quite simple: don't get into time-trouble in the first place. This immediately raises the question: what constitutes time-trouble? Some people panic when they have ten min- utes left for ten moves, while others appear quite calm even when down to their last thirty seconds. I will propose a definition: time- trouble arises if you have less than one minute left per move. In my opinion this is the lower limit for guaranteeing J. Nunn - J. de la Villa Szirak Interzonal 1987 In this position White is a pawn up but has yet to develop his queenside pieces. Here I rejected 18 Rb3+ be- cause after 18... h8 19 Qxb6 axb6 it is quite hard for White to continue his development. 20 d3 is impossible be- cause of the pressure on c3, and 20 c4 is met by 20...d3! 21 Nxd3 Nd4 22 Sf 1 Bg4, which leaves White totally paralysed. Black could just continue with ...Sae8 and ...Be2, eventually winning the pawn on f2 and setting up possible mating threats along the h- file. I therefore played 18 Qc2! which, in addition to the attack on h7, threat- ens to bring the queenside pieces out by 19 d3 and 20 Bf4. Black responded with 18...d3!?, based on the tactical point 19 Jlxd3? Qxf2+!! 20 <Nxf2 Bd4-H- 21 e2 Bg4#. I actually played 19 xd3 Bxc3 20 bxc3 Qxf2+ 21 4>h2 Qxel 22 Ba3! and won after im- mense complications. However, the
60 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
an acceptable standard of play. It is of course possible to play well even with less time than this, but you are really putting yourself in the hands of fate. If no unexpected problems arise, no shocks, no really tricky decisions, then you will probably survive more or less unscathed, but how can you be sure this is going to happen? Those who are addicted to time-trouble will show you the remarkable games they won despite extreme time shortage; they probably won't show you the much larger number which they lost because of the same time shortage. If you regularly run into time- trouble, according to this definition, then you are doing something wrong and it is almost certainly costing you points. The reasons for running short of time are many. Here is a selection of the most common: 1) Indecision. Probably the most common reason. If you spend a long time agonizing over decisions, then you will inevitably run short of time. The pragmatic approach I recommend in this book should help. If you find that, after lengthy thought, you usu- ally end up playing the move that you wanted to play straight away, then learn to trust your intuition more. 2) Worrying too much about very minor matters. There is no point think- ing for half an hour about a possible advantage or disadvantage of what a computer would call '0.1 of a pawn'. This almost certainly is not going to cost you a half-point. The piece you hang later during time-trouble proba- bly is. 3) Providing yourself with an ex- cuse. To those who do not suffer from this particular ailment, it probably sounds ridiculous, but it is surpris- ingly common. In these cases there is a (possibly subconscious) reluctance to admit that a loss is due to bad play; problems with the clock provide an al- ternative explanation. If you find your- self saying to people after a game 'I had a perfectly reasonable position until I ran into time-trouble' then you probably have this disease to some ex- tent. It really is an absurd attitude. The clock is just as much a part of the game as the board and pieces, and los- ing because of time-trouble is no dif- ferent to losing because of weak play - it's still a zero on the score-sheet. The only difference is that if you run very short of time you will almost certainly lose; if you play more quickly, you may lose because of weak play, but then again you may not. The best way to improve is to gain over-the-board experience and if your games just be- come a time-trouble mess, then you are probably not learning very much from them. If you have time-trouble problems, then in addition to the points men- tioned above, bear in mind the follow- ing tips: 1) Arrive for the game on time. The most obvious and simplest way of saving time!
AT THE BOARD 61
2) Don't spend a long time consid- ering which opening to play. If you have the luxury of knowing more than one opening, then you should think about this before the game. 3) Don't think about theoretical moves. Some players spend an inordi- nate length of time reaching a position with which they are already familiar. An extreme case was a game I played as White against Stohl in the Poisoned Pawn, an opening with which we were both very familiar. I played a line which was believed to lead to equality. He was so worried about the improve- ment he felt sure was coming that he thought carefully about each move, trying to spot the 'improvement' in ad- vance. By the time the improvement arrived, well into the ending, he had used 90 of his 120 minutes reaching a position he knew perfectly well. The 'improvement', when it finally came, was actually a rather modest affair, but thanks to Stohl's lack of time I won the game. 4) Don't use up time thinking about obviously forced moves. Your oppo- nent takes a piece; you suddenly no- tice that after your recapture he has a possibility that you hadn't noticed be- fore. Don't think - just take back. Thinking not only wastes time, it also alerts your opponent to the fact that there is something you are worried about. It he hasn't noticed it before, he probably will now! Of course, you should be sure that the recapture really is the only possibility, otherwise you might overlook a powerful zwischen- zug. 5) Chess is all about making deci- sions. Postponing a decision doesn't necessarily improve it. Try to get into the habit of asking yourself: is further thought actually going to beneficial? I won't give any advice about what to do if you are in time-trouble, since this situation shouldn't arise. If your opponent is in time-trouble, the main piece of advice is to stay calm. It is quite easy to become so ex- cited that you start bashing out moves as quickly as your opponent and thus make no use of your time advantage. You should also avoid thinking "I must try to win the game during his time-trouble" and then embark on some risky venture which you would never play under normal circum- stances. This is only justified if you have a very bad or losing position, and the time-trouble really is your only hope. Given a choice between a quiet continuation and an equally good sharp continuation, then by all means choose the sharp continuation, but an opponent in time-trouble is no justifi- cation for knowingly playing an infe- rior move. Players in time-trouble tend to spend most of their time analysing forcing, tactical continuations, so be especially careful not to allow a tacti- cal trick. Where strategy is concerned, they will probably decide on a 'default move' to play if your move carries no
62 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
special threat. Very often this 'default move' will be part of a plan for trans- ferring a badly-placed piece to a better square. If they are deprived of any such obvious plan, then the result is usually confusion or a 'nothing' move. With any luck, you can use the moves before the time-control to gain a posi- tional advantage which will set you up nicely for next phase of the game. Laziness Laziness at the chessboard manifests itself in two ways. The first is when you have a complicated possibility, but decide not to analyse it on the grounds that it would be too much work. Note that is not the same as the 'DAUT' principle mentioned on page
21. That represents a conscious weigh-
ing of the balance between the time spent and the possibility of finding a better move. It comes into play most often when there is a perfectly ade- quate alternative which can be played with little calculation. Laziness, on the other hand, is a deliberate turning away from a move which may turn out to be very strong indeed. Losing a game because you have overlooked a move is one thing, but losing because you have spotted the correct move and could not be bothered to analyse it is quite another! A second, more understandable, form of laziness is when your oppo- nent has an irritating possibility. You have to consider this same possibility every move until you become fed up with it and spend a tempo ruling it out completely. The most common mani- festation of this form of laziness is preventing a possible check by the op- ponent. You have to calculate the check in every single line, and in the end you just pre-empt the check by moving your king. There are, of course, many situations in which such a move is per- fectly reasonable, but there are also many in which the loss of time is im- portant. Playing hl after O-O (or bl after O-O-O) may be just such a waste of time. When such a move is justifiable, it is normally because of a concrete reason rather than because it is annoying to have to do a bit more calculation. Here is an unusual example of lazi- ness: J. Nunn - Xie Jun Hastings 1996/7 In this position, it suddenly oc- curred to me that Black might play

21 Sa3.
Determination Of all the personal qualities which are important at the board, determination is probably the most significant. Some players, when confronted with an on- erous defensive task, such as defend- ing an inferior and long-drawn-out ending, suffer a crisis Of will-power. They see the gloom ahead of them, with only the distant prospect of at most half a point, and become despon- dent. The result is either a feeble resis- tance, or a decision to stake everything on a half-hearted swindle. When this is brushed aside, they feel that they can resign with good grace. Not sur- prisingly, this behaviour no recipe for success. Even very strong players can be- come so resigned to the prospect of in- evitable defeat that they do not notice when a saving opportunity is presented to them. Here are a couple of notable recent examples. The position overleaf is a simple technical win for White, and it is hard ...a3 as a pawn sacrifice at some stage. I started to calculate lines such as 21 exf4 22 Bxf4 a3 23 Sxa3 Sxa3 24 bxa3 and wondered if Black has enough compensation for the pawn. I decided that she does not, because White's d4 is annoying for Black, aiming at both c6 and f5. 1 started cal- culating more and more lines and in each I had to take into account the pos- sibility of ...a3. In the end I just be- came fed up with this, and decided to rule it out.
21 Sa3?
My reasoning was that since the rook is blocked in by both bishops and unlikely to move along the first rank, it might as well perform a useful task (preventing ...a3). Deep down I was aware that this move looks highly artificial; my 'logic' was really just a rationalization for an outbreak of lazi- ness. A more sensible piece of reasoning would have been to note that Black's queenside pawn majority will be very good in an ending, and so White must play for a decision in the middlegame. For the moment White need not worry about ...a3, since the bl -bishop will prevent the b-pawn promoting for sev- eral moves. Thus 21 f5 is correct, aiming to play Ng4 or h5 to eliminate the de- fensive knight. Since White's position in the diagram is not especially good, he should probably be happy with a sacrifice on h6 leading to perpetual check.

Short had been losing from an early stage, and Kaspa- rov had been exchanging down to a simplified endgame. Both sides were simply acting out the final stages of a drama which had been decided in the opening, and they knew full well what the result of the game would be. In this frame of mind it is possible to let one's attention wander away from the posi- tion on the board. Nevertheless, it is an astonishing error to occur at such a high level. G. Kasparov - N. Short London PCA World Championship (9) 1993 to imagine Kasparov going so far wrong as to reach a drawn position, yet that is what happened.

Not a particularly accurate move, although it does not throw away the win. White should simply put his rook on the fourth rank and march his king to b4. Thus 45 Sdl+ Ne5 46 Bd4 or

easily.
45...*e5 46 e4??
An amazing blunder. One way to win is by 46 Ne2 e4 47 Ba3 (47 Bf1 and 48 Bf4 is also good) and Black must either allow the king to reach d3, or permit the advance of the pawn. In either case White wins easily.

Black had been under pressure for some time and ended up in this rook ending a clear pawn down. 45 g4?I Both players seemed to believe that this position should be a clear-cut win for White, but in fact it is not so sim- ple. The move played is probably al- ready an inaccuracy. After 45 <Nf3 Se6 46 Hd8+ (Shirov comments that
46 Hc3 should win, but White's rook
is tied to the defence of c6 more or less permanently and the win does not look at all simple to me) 46...Nf7 47 Hd7+ He7 48 Hxe7+ Nxe7 White can force a winning queen and pawn ending by 49 *g4 *d6 50 *g5 *xc6 51 <Nh6 <±>b7 52 *xh7 c5 53 *xg6 c4 54 f5 c3

Qf5 Qxh2 (after 58...Qc6+ 59 *h5 Qe8+ 60 *g4 Qg8+ 61 *f4 White remains two pawns up) 59 g4. The evaluation of endings with Q+A vs Q is a simple matter at home, because one only has to consult a computer- generated database. The oracle in- forms us that this one is indeed win- ning, but of course it is not so easy at the board. The general feeling amongst GMs is that endings with Q+gA vs Q (and the defending king cut off from the pawn) are almost impossible to de- fend in practice, even if some of them are drawn with perfect play (see page 150 for more details). Thus even with- out consulting the database, Shirov would have been aware that this end- ing offers White excellent winning prospects. In the specific position above it is quite easy to see that Black only has a few checks and then White can advance his pawn to the fifth rank (59...Qd6+ 60 *g7 Qd4+ 61 *f7 Qc4+ 62 f8 Qb4+ 63 g8), which would provide further evidence in fa- vour of assessing it as winning for White.

This move throws away the win. White could still have retreated his rook and defended the c-pawn along the c-file.
46...*xe7 49 g5 1-0??
Resigning is an even more aston- ishing blunder than Shirov's mistaken rook exchange. After 49...Nd6 Black draws without undue difficulty: 1) 50 f5 gxf5 51 h4 *e5 52 <4>f3 f4

If the white king is on c5 or d5, then Black can play either ... e8 or ..,<£ 7. The fact that Black has this choice of moves means that these is no chance of White winning by somehow losing a move, because only after Nc6 is Black restricted to a unique square for his king.
66 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
What makes Timman's decision to resign so surprising is that he could have quite easily taken the pawn on c6 and waited to see Shirov's intention. Giving up so early is an indication of defeatism - he felt that the rook end- ing was dead lost and, since the king and pawn ending was a natural conse- quence of the rook ending, then that too must be lost. In these examples, both Short and Timman were paying scant attention to the position on the board and were heavily influenced by the preceding play- The lesson to be learnt from this is that while the game is in progress, you should be concentrating on the current position, regardless of what has hap- pened before. There are very few play- ers who have the technical skill to convert advantageous positions into a win without at some stage allowing the opponent a chance for counterplay. The defender's task is to maintain his concentration, so that when a possible saving opportunity arises, he does not overlook it. There is no point in play- ing on if all you are doing is going through the motions, waiting for the right moment at which to resign.
2 The Opening
Building a repertoire It would be nice to start the construc- tion of an opening repertoire from scratch, so that everything fits together neatly, and all transpositions are taken care of. However, most players don't have an elegant opening repertoire. They play a motley collection of open- ings which they have accumulated, more or less by chance, over the years. However, we will take the idealized situation of someone starting from square one (al, presumably). The first step is to think about your personal style. Do you prefer open, tactical positions or closed, strategic positions? Does an attack on your king make you nervous, or are you happy so long as you have a counter-attack? Do you prefer main lines, or some- thing slightly offbeat? Next, look at the various openings available, and see which ones fit in with your per- sonal style. For example, when choos- ing an opening with Black against 1 e4, you might make some notes along the following lines: l...c5: Open positions, tactical, at- tack and counter-attack. Schevenin- gen and Taimanov systems safer and less tactical than the Dragon, Najdorf and Pelikan.
1...c6: Solid positions, strategic,
safe king.
1...e6: Closed positions, strategic.
1...e5: Fairly solid, but can lead to
almost any type of position, depend- ing on the follow-up. Petroff the most solid option.
1...d6: Sharp positions. Attack and
counter-attack. However, White does have solid options.
1...d5: Slightly off-beat, fairly solid
but a little passive.
1...£rf6: Sharp positions. These
days considered slightly off-beat.
1... c6: Slightly off-beat. Need to
consider what to play after 2 Do the same with openings against 1 d4, flank openings and with White. Then you have to consider how all these fit together. If you choose the Pirc against 1 e4, it makes sense to consider the King's Indian against 1 d4. This is more flexible and will give you additional options later. For ex- ample, you may decide later that you would prefer not to allow the Samisch against the King's Indian. To this end you decide to meet 1 d4 with l...d6, and against 2 c4 you will play 2...e5. Many players who would quite like to play this system with Black are put off by two things: firstly, White can play 2 e4 and secondly White can play 2 Nf3
68 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
(it is true that Black can meet 2 3 by
2..Bg4, but many regard this as some-
what better for White). However, be- cause your openings have been chosen to fit together, neither of these prob- lems will bother you. The Pirc is al- ready in your repertoire, and after 2 you can play 2...£tf6 and enter a King's Indian, but with the Samisch having been ruled out. Likewise, the Caro-Kann and the Slav fit together, and then you can an- swer 1 c4 by l...c6, without having to undertake any additional learning to cope with 2 e4. There is a temptation to choose some really unusual openings, because the amount of study required is much less. However, I would advise against this. Rarely played openings are usually rare precisely because they have some defect. Sooner or later your opponents will start to exploit this defect and then you will have to switch openings. If you choose another very unusual open- ing, the process will repeat itself. Af- ter a few years, you will have spent just as much effort as if you had cho- sen a mainstream opening in the first place, and you will have little to show for your efforts. This problem doesn't arise with a repertoire based on main lines. First of all, such lines, which have been tried and tested in thousands of grandmas- ter games, are unlikely to be 'busted' in the first place. The worst that usu- ally happens is that a small finesse leads to a minor reassessment of one line. Secondly, even if the worst hap- pens and a blockbuster novelty fin- ishes off a line, it is usually relatively easy to switch to another line within the same opening. Mainstream open- ings such as the Ruy Lopez or the Or- thodox Queen's Gambit are not merely single lines; they are massive com- plexes of different systems for both colours. Suppose, for example, you play the following line of the Chigorin Defence in the Closed Ruy Lopez: 1 e4 e5 2 f3 Nc6 3 ±b5 a6 4 ±a4 f6
5 O-O ±e7 6 Sei b5 7 i.b3 d6 8 c3 O-O
9 h3 a5 10 Nc2 c5 11 d4 Qc7 12
2fod2 cxd4 13 cxd4 i.d7 14 fiac8
15 Ne3 2>c6 16 d5 2fo4 17 ±bl a5 18
a3 Na6. Suddenly you see a game in this line which seems to cast doubt on Black's play. You need a replacement line, quickly. There is a wide range of possibilities to choose from; you could try 15...Sfe8 or, slightly earlier,
13... c6. Perhaps delaying the ex-
change on d4 and playing 12...Bd7 or
12... c6 might be an idea. All these
are viable lines, so there is no need to panic. They all lead to the same gen- eral type of position, so that the expe- rience you have gained with your former line will not be wasted The general principles governing play with these Chigorin Defence pawn struc- tures will be still be valid in your new line. Moreover, all the effort you have put into learning how to combat ear- lier deviations by White (Exchange Spanish, Lines with Qe2, etc.) will re- main valid. Instead of facing a major
THE OPENING 69
overhaul, only a minor modification will be necessary. Once you have chosen your open- ings, how best to study them? There is nothing better than a good book, which brings us on to our next topic. Using opening books These days there are books on virtu- ally every opening under the sun. Some are good, some are competent and some are bad. Unfortunately, it is often not easy to decide which is which. In choosing a good book, re- views are an obvious guide, but these are often not very helpful in the chess world. This is not necessarily the fault of the reviewers; I can testify from personal experience that reviewing openings books is a difficult and thankless task. In order to assess an opening book properly, you really have to be an expert in that particular opening. Of course, you can check to see if it is up-to-date and well-written, but a really good openings book will contain all those finesses which only a practitioner of the opening will know. Cunning move-orders designed to avoid particular lines, moves which caused a particular variation to be abandoned, but which were never ac- tually played in a game - only a spe- cialist will know whether such things are in the book or not. If one adds that chess book reviewers are normally un- paid (apart from receiving a free copy of the book), it is scarcely surprising that reviews of opening books tend to- wards a certain blandness. Major pub- lishers are perhaps slightly safer than smaller operations, since they nor- mally have some sort of quality con- trol; having said that, they are also under far more commercial pressure to bring a book out on time, which can lead to a rushed job. The saying 'Don't judge a book by its cover' is especially valid for chess books. The covers are normally made by designers rather than chess-players; of course they should be checked, but even so howl- ers occasionally slip through. In the end, the reputation of the author is probably the best guide to the quality of a book. Having chosen a book, it is best first of all to gain an overview of the opening. Look first at just the main lines to create a mental picture of the general structure of the opening. If the book contains illustrative games, it is worth playing these over first; you will probably already notice certain typical themes repeating themselves. In most major openings you will have a choice against each of the opponent's possi- bilities. As with the choice of the main openings, make a list of the various options and see which ones suit your style. Keep transpositional possibili- ties and move-orders in mind, to make sure that your opponent cannot cir- cumvent your proposed repertoire by a simple variation in move-order. Sup- pose, for example, that you are going to play a line of the Sicilian with 1 e4
70 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
c5 2 Nf3 e6, and are thinking about how to meet the 2 c3 Sicilian. You no- tice that the defence 1 e4 c5 2 c3 d5 3 exd5 Rxd5 4 d4 2rf6 5 2rf3 Ng4 is currently popular, and decide to play that. It would be easy to overlook the fact that White can play 1 e4 c5 2 £}f3 e6 3 c3 instead. Of course you can still play 3...d5, but now the line with ...Bg4 is impossible. There are ways round this particular problem, but it is important to have something ready in advance, and not to be caught out over the board. Notice that so far there has been no detailed study. Everything has been careful planning - good groundwork and thoroughness is the secret of suc- cessful opening preparation. Once you have your repertoire mapped out, then you can study each line in detail. To begin with, only study the main lines - that will cope with 90% of your games, and you can easily fill in the unusual lines later. One important question is whether it is better to study an opening book that offers a pre-selected repertoire (often called 'Winning With ...', or a similar title), or one that offers a com- plete coverage of an opening. Cer- tainly both books have their place and the ideal situation is to have one of each type for a given opening. It is cer- tainly useful to have someone do much of the above-mentioned work for you, but nevertheless some lines in the proposed repertoire may not suit you, or developments since the book was published may throw doubt on some recommendations. In this case it is essential to have a source of alterna- tive possibilities. More serious players who have a chess database (see also page 166) may like to check this for recent devel- opments before playing a particular line. A database is also useful for see- ing which lines are currently popular, and therefore where one should be fo- cusing one's efforts. At first you may find that your re- sults with a new opening are disap- pointing. This is more likely with strategic openings than ones based on precise analysis. When I started play- ing the Sicilian Najdorf, my results were very good. This is an opening in which concrete knowledge of specific lines is very important. I had just stud- ied the opening in great detail, and so my knowledge was often better and more up-to-date than that of my oppo- nents. On the other hand, playing a strategic opening requires a positional understanding which is better learnt by experience than from books. It may be several games before you get up to speed with such an opening, but be persistent - your efforts will be re- warded in the end. Books on offbeat openings A particular genre of books which de- serves special attention is that dealing with dubious and rarely-played open- ings. As in all categories of opening
THE OPENING 71
books, there are good and bad exam- ples. Typically, such a book will claim that opening X is unjustly neglected, that recent games have shown X to be playable after all and that all sorts of hidden resources and novelties are re- vealed for the first time in the book. Unfortunately, 99% of the time the reasons X is rarely played are entirely justified, the 'recent games' turn out to be encounters of little value between unknown players, and the resources and novelties will only stand a few seconds' close examination. The tricks which authors can use to make open- ings such as X appear playable are many and varied, and are, of course, revealed for the first time in this book! It is hard to give details without concrete examples, so that means I will have to choose a couple of victims. In this particular genre there is a depress- ingly high proportion of poor books, and it would be easy to choose one of the really bad ones and have some fun. In fact I have chosen one of the better examples, Tony Kosten's The Latvian Gambit (B.T. Batsford, 1995). This book is unusual in that a strong grand- master has taken a look at a rarely played opening with a poor reputa- tion. Tony was certainly taking on a real challenge with this title! When it arrived, I was quite baffled as to how the author had managed to fill up 144 pages; I had thought a detailed refuta- tion would take 10 pages at most. I decided to use the book as a basis for a couple of hours' analysis on the Latvian (pages 72-76 are based on this analysis). It is, of course, very rarely played and I would not expect a GM to dare it, but this enhances its surprise value. It would certainly be embar- rassing to face it and plunge into deep thought on move three! Moreover, when a new book appears on an open- ing, it always encourages a few people to take it up, so the chances of meeting it were high enough to warrant devot- ing a little time to it. When I was a teenager, there were a couple of junior players who used the Latvian which, if you don't know al- ready, is characterized by the moves 1 e4 e5 2 W3 f5. For many players this opening offers a huge advantage: it provides a more or less complete de- fence to 1 e4. If you play a line of the Spanish, then you have to worry about various white systems in the Spanish, such as the Exchange Variation and early d3 lines, plus the Scotch and 3 Bc4 - quite a body of theory to study. Adopting the Latvian short-circuits all that; apart from the King's Gambit and a few other openings, you don't have to study anything else to meet 1 e4. The question is: can the Latvian be considered playable? The move 2...f5 has a dubious ap- pearance; it doesn't develop a piece and it weakens the diagonals h5-e8 and c4-g8, the latter being important if Black intends to castle kingside later. I always viewed 3 ?)xe5 as the most logical reply - Black should be pun- ished for not defending his e-pawn
72 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
4 Nxc6 is another obvious move,
but after 4...dxc6 I felt that this was rather playing into Black's hands. All Black's minor pieces can immediately come into play, while White still has to move his d-pawn to bring his cl- bishop out. Moreover, White has no minor pieces on the kingside, and if White intends to castle on that side the deficiency might allow Black to work up an attack. Neither of these lines is particularly clear, but the point of this initial evaluation is not to assess each possibility rigorously, but simply to decide which move looks best based on general principles. If I had not found a possibility that really struck me as the most promising, then I would have gone round again for a second look at 4 Rh5+ and 4 Nxc6. However, at this moment I noticed a very tempting move: 4 d4!. This seemed to me to fit in best with the principle of rapid piece development in the opening. White creates a 'two- abreast' pawn centre and allows the cl -bishop to be developed without making any concession. The most ob- vious reply is 4...fxe4, but this just loses after 5 xc6 dxc6 6 Qh5+ and with 2...Nc6. I had scored well with this reply in my youth, so I decided to concentrate on it. My first surprise came when I ex- amined the list of contents. Chapter 6 dealt with (after 3 Nxe5) "3...£te6 and other third move alternatives for Black". I was stunned - 1 hadn't realized that
3...Nc6 was even vaguely possible. In
fact Tony justifiably dismisses the "other third move alternatives" but de- votes over nine pages to 3...Nc6 (D). My first reaction on seeing an unfa- miliar move in a book is not to look at the author's analysis, but to set the po- sition up on a board and decide what would be the most natural response.
6...g6 costs a rook, so Black must move
his king. Nor is 4...£rf6 possible, as 5 Nxc6 followed by 6 e5 gives White an extra pawn and a good position. Black can, of course, play 4...Nxe5 but after 5 dxe5 the pawn on e5 prevents ... f6 and Black's development is corre- spondingly awkward. If he tries to get the pawn back by 5...Re7, then 6 Rd4 I noticed that White could win the exchange by 4 Rh5+ g6 5 ?kg6
6 Rh4 hxg6 (6...Sg8!?) 7 Rxh8 Re7.
In return Black has a substantial lead in development. An assessment of this relatively complicated position would take some time, so bearing in mind DAUT I decided to look for something simpler.
THE OPENING 73
8...O-O loses to 9 Ac4+. At the very
least Black will have to make several more moves with his queen and fall hopelessly behind in development. In addition one must also take into ac- count: a) the dreadful positioning of the pawn on f5, which has no positive fea- tures at all and only weakens Black's position; b) the possibility of d5, forcing the c6-knight to retreat; and c) the plan of attacking c7 by c3- d5 (or b5), possibly coupled with Af4. Summing up, Black's position is probably just lost. There remained only one more point to be checked, viz. that Black could not exploit the temporarily active position of his queen by 6...Nb4. However, it would be a miracle if Black could get away with breaking the one remaining un- broken rule of opening play, that one should not repeatedly move the same pieces while leaving the rest of the army at home. The analysis, however, is fairly simple: 6...Nb4 7 O-O Qxc2 8 Qel Ae7 (8..>e4 9 Nc3 Re7 10 Qdl
11 Sei Ne4 12 a3 Nc6 13 Ad3 wins)
9 c3 W6 10 e5 (threatening 11

15 e6 2tf6 16 Nxf4 O-O 17 Ad3 wins)
12 Ad3 Qb3 13 Nb5 Nxe5 14 dxe5
and Black's position collapses. Even this is presented in rather unneces- sary detail; Black's development is so dreadful that it would not be amiss to looks very unpleasant, threatening €)c3-d5. After five minutes I was still unable to see any playable line for Black against 4 d4, so I decided see what Kosten gave. His main lines are 4 Nxc6 and 4 Qh5+, with 4 d4 being relegated to a small note, which con- tinues "4...Qh4! 5 Ad3 fxe4 6 g3 Qh3
7 Axe4 W6" and ends up as "fine" for
Black. Well, 4...Qh4 was certainly a surprise! However, I remained uncon- vinced. Black has violated virtually every principle of opening play, mak- ing weakening pawn moves, giving up a pawn and now developing his queen before the other pieces - surely there had to be a way to gain a clear advan- tage at the very least? Suddenly, I had an idea. How about 5 W3 Rxe4+ 6 Ae2 (D)? The more I looked at this the more it appealed to me. White threatens sim- ply O-O and Bel. Black has insuffi- cient time to develop his kingside minor pieces and get castled, for ex- ample 6... f6 7 O-O Ae7 8 Sei and

condemn his position without con- crete analysis. Having done away with 3...#te6, 1 turned my attention to the main line,
3...W6, again focusing my efforts on
the line I had played decades earlier, namely 4 c4 fxe4 5 c3. In those far-off days the main continuation was
5...Qg6, after which I racked up quite
a few wins with 6 d3 Jlb4 7 dxe4 Rxe4+ 8 £te3. Kosten considers this very good for White, and his main line is 5...Qf7, a move which was practi- cally unknown in 1970. 1 was aware of this move, and indeed had faced it once quite recently against Fritz in a man vs computer tournament. I won that game, but my handling of the opening was rather cautious due to lack of knowledge. Kosten's main line is 6 Ne3 c6! (D) (his exclamation mark). has an extra central pawn, and the po- sition of his queen will turn out to be quite useful if he castles kingside, as he will have instant pressure along the f-file. Indeed, it quickly becomes ap- parent that Black will have a fine game if he has a few tempi to complete his development. After ..Bd6, ...£te7 and ...O-O his king is safe, and the white knights are poorly placed. Black's central pawns prevent the knights from moving forwards and the knight on e3 blocks in the cl -bishop. A quick look at Kosten's analysis bears this out; in most lines White feels obliged to sac- rifice a piece by Nexd5 or c4 to dis- turb Black before he can castle. All these lines are very complicated so, invoking DAUT again, I decided to re- turn to the diagram position. I imme- diately wondered why White should not take the pawn on e4. After 7 Nxe4 d5 8 g5 Qf6 9 £rf3 I was again feel- ing confident about White's posi- tion. White has admittedly moved his knights several times, but Black can- not really boast about this, as so far the only piece he has moved is his queen. In terms of development, the two sides are roughly equal and White's posi- tion is without weaknesses - in fact, Black's compensation for the pawn is simply invisible. Kosten gives two lines: 9...Be6, aiming to castle queen- side, and 9...Bd6. Taking 9...Be6 first, Kosten's continuation is "10 d4 Nd7 11 Nd3 O-O-O (D) 12 c3 g5 13 O-O h5, not fearing 14 xd5?! Bxd5
15 Jlxg5 Qg7."
His principal variation runs 7 d3 exd3 8 Bxd3 d5. Of course, White has a substantial lead in development, but Black has some strategic assets. He

19 Be3) 15 Be3, to be followed by
some combination of Qa4, Hcl and We 5. Black is a pawn down for noth- ing. If Black plays some other 12th move, for example 12.. Bd6, White again plays 13 c4 and in this case mat- ters are even worse as ?)xc4 comes with gain of tempo. Kosten's other line is 9..Bd6, and here he gives 10 d4 W7 11 c4!, which is indeed White's strongest line. The continuation is 11...O-O 12 Qb3 Nh8!? (D) 13 Bd2!? dxc4 14 Nxc4 W17 15 O-O, which he assesses as favouring White (and therefore recommends
9..Be6 as above).
The point of 13 Bd2 is to prevent a check on b4, and therefore to threaten to win a pawn on d5. It is also possi- ble to play 13 Jle2 followed by O-O, when White would also threaten the This line shows a typical ploy used by those attempting to make a very du- bious line playable: the totally irrele- vant move. Nobody could criticize the natural developing moves 10 d4 and
11 Bd3, but what on earth is 12 c3 for?
The d4-pawn isn't attacked, it isn't likely to be attacked and White isn't freeing his f3-knight to move any- where. If White does nothing, then of course Black will eventually work up a serious attack on the kingside, but in opposite-side castling positions speed is of the essence. The correct plan for White is to play c2-c4 to develop coun- terplay in the centre and on the queen- side. Suppose White starts with the most obvious move, 12 O-O, and Black plays as in Kosten's line with 12...g5. White plays 13 c4 (D) and Black is already in a very bad way: 1) 13...Nd6 14Qa4*b8 15 c5&c7
16 b4 with an extra pawn and a very
strong attack. If Black plays 16...a6, White can either sacrifice on a6 imme- diately or prepare it by 17 Hbl.
76 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
both honest and a strong player will have some doubts about the lines he is giving, and this often manifests itself in phrases which are the chess equiva- lent of a disclaimer in a contract. After "6...c6!" in the above line Kosten writes "Calmly leaving the e4-pawn to its fate; what exactly does Black obtain in return? Objectively, very little: just a slight lead in develop- ment and a lot of fun." Not exactly confidence-inspiring for Black, but of course having taken on the book he can hardly admit that the whole open- ing is just unsound. The publisher would doubtless not be amused by a manuscript consisting of a ten-page refutation! Similar key phrases are 'might appeal to a tactically-minded player', 'offers practical chances' and 'Black's position is no worse than in main-line openings such as the Ruy Lopez'. Depends which variation, I suppose! Less honest authors are entirely shameless about such matters. They recommend the most outrageously unsound lines without blushing even slightly. They would never play such lines themselves, of course. My second example is also a rela- tively high-quality product from a reli- able GM author, Winning With the Giuoco Piano and the Max Lange At- tack by Andrew Soltis (Chess Digest, 1992). Books with 'Winning With' in the title confer an extra responsibility on the author, in that the result of the d5-pawn, and would have achieved this purpose using only natural devel- oping moves. Therefore this line may be slightly more accurate. Once again, Black's compensation cannot be de- tected. The position resembles one from a normal opening such as the Petroff, except that Black's f-pawn has unaccountably dropped off the board. When looking through 'dubious opening' analysis, look out for the fol- lowing: 1) 'Nothing moves' by the oppo- nent (i.e. the one facing the dubious opening), which only waste time. 2) Lines in which the opponent pretends he is in the nineteenth cen- tury, co-operatively grabs all the ma- terial on offer and allows a brilliant finish. 3) Lines which are given without any assessment. 4) Secret code words. The fourth point perhaps requires some explanation. An author who is
THE OPENING 77
After 13...O-O 14 Nxh7 (D) Black can, of course, accept the sacrifice. author's research is pre-determined. If the author reaches page 100 and discovers that the opening he is rec- ommending is unsound, then he is un- likely to abandon the whole project. Of course, this probably won't happen if the opening chosen is a popular, main-line system. 'Winning With the Ruy Lopez' is an uncontroversial title; many top GMs regularly play the Ruy Lopez hoping to win. The problems start to arise when 'Winning With...' is combined with an offbeat and un- popular opening, such as the Giuoco Piano. You can be sure that if the es- tablished theory of the Giuoco Piano favoured White, then lots of GMs would play it, but of course it does not. The author is therefore undertaking to discover something new which over- turns the prevailing opinion. Then the crucial question is how convincing these new ideas are. The line of the Giuoco Piano rec- ommended in the above book runs 1 e4 e5 2 2Bf3 Nc6 3 Nc4 Nc5 4 c3 2rf6
5 d4 exd4 6 cxd4 Jlb4+ 7 Nc3 Nxe4 8
O-O Bxc3 9 d5 (this is called the M01- ler Attack) 9...Nf6 10 Eel e7 11 Bxe4 d6 12 Bg5 Jlxg5 13 xg5 and now there are basically two varia- tions. The old continuation is 13...O-O, when White replies 14 xh7. The more modem option, and the one which has really put people off the M011er At- tack, is 13...h6!, which leapt to promi- nence following Barczay-Portisch, Hungarian Ch 1968/9. Let's take these two lines in turn. Traditional theory has it that this is a forced draw. Soltis offers some new ideas in the extremely complex posi- tions which result but, taking DAUT into account, we will not look at these. In any case, I think many players would prefer to avoid 14...<Bxh7 if at all pos- sible; it has the defect that White can force perpetual check virtually at will, and of course a difficult defence in which a slight slip might be fatal is not to the taste of many players. The reasonable alternative to taking the knight is 14..Bf5, when the following moves are virtually forced: 15 Bh4 (15 Bxe7 Rxe7 16 xf8 Exf8 is en- tirely comfortable for Black) 15...Ee8 16Qh5&g6 17 Ed4 (D). Now Soltis gives 17...Ee5 18 f4 Nxf4! 19 Bxf4 Ng6 20 W3 *xh7 21 Bd3 "which is described as unclear by Harding and Botterill - a judgement that apparently has yet to be tested. However, it is not easy for Black to

situation. The first important point is that Soltis notices, as Botterill does not, that 21..Bxd3 loses Black's queen af- ter 22 Qh3+ *g8 23 Hh4. However, Soltis does not add that the position after 23...Rxh4 24 Rxh4 Hxd5 offers White essentially zero winning pros- pects. Soltis in fact mentions Black's best move, 21...Re7, but then gives 22 Rh3+ and stops (see point 3 above). After 22... gS (D) it is quite im- possible to see how White can even defend against the threat of doubling equalize. on the h-file, e.g. 21...Axd3 22 Rh3+! *g8 23 Hh4 or 21..>e7 22 Qh3+ (not 22 Sxf7? Sel+ 23 *f2 Rh4+). Black's best appears to be 21...<Ng8
22 Bxg6 fxg6 but 23 Hf1 retains an
edge." The Harding and Botterill book quoted is The Italian Game (B.T. Bats- ford, 1977). However, in the later book Open Gambits (B.T. Batsford, 1986), Botterill gives "20 Rf3 *xh7 21 Nd3 Bxd3 22 Qxd3+ Ng8 ... it is question- able whether White has enough for the pawn. However White can hold the balance with 20 Qh3 Qc8 (Vukovi6) 21 £tf6+ gxf6 and now: "a) 22 Rh4 f5 (intending ..>d8) retains tension, though I think Black is better. "b) Simply 22 "xc8+ Sxc8 23 Hxf6 is equal." What is the poor reader to make of all this? Soltis and Botterill give com- pletely different lines and offer differ- ent evaluations. I will try to clarify the

point 23...Sh5! 24 Sxh5 Nxh5 25 Qxh5 Re3+, while after 23 Bxg6 fxg6 Black will force exchanges by ei- ther ...Sel+ or ...Sf8, leaving White a pawn down. This brings us to another warning: 5) 'Winning With' authors display great ingenuity in finding resources for 'their' side, but often overlook even quite simple tactical defences for the 'other' side.
THE OPENING 79
Botterill's other line for White, 20 Qh3, can be met by 20...Qc8, although I would feel a bit queasy about allow- ing my kingside pawns to be broken up by W6+ and then blocking in my bishop by ...f5. 1 would prefer to play
20...Bh5!, which again depends on a
small tactical point: 21 W6+ Qxf6! (avoiding any damage to the kingside pawns) 22 Sxf6 Sxh3 23 Sxg6 Sh4! and Black reaches a four-rook ending with a clear extra pawn. White should prefer 21 Qb3 Nxh7 22 Qxb7, when
22...Qb8 reaches a more or less equal
ending, while 22...Sb8 23 Rxa7 Sxb2 is unclear, Black's more active pieces balancing the long-term danger posed by the passed a-pawn. The above analysis shows that after
17...Be5 18 f4 White has a draw at
most, but I will be fair and point out an improvement for White: by 18 Ng5! Qf6 19 W7+ *f8 20 Qh5 he can more or less force Black to accede to a repetition of moves by 20... g8. How- ever, going back one move, there is an interesting possibility for Black to play for an advantage: 17..Bc2! (D). The point of this is quite simple. Black clears the fifth rank for his rook and threatens (amongst other things)
18...Be5 19 "h3 Qe7, followed by
...Be8, with a winning position since White is completely hamstrung by the trapped knight on h7 and can hardly move a piece. The alternatives are: 1) 18 Sd2 loses to 18...£rf4 19 Rg4 Nxh7 20 Qxf4 Be4. 2) 18 Bg4 e5 19 Bh4 f6 20 Nb5 Bg6 wins material. 3) 18 Scl Se5 19 Rh3 Nf5 20 g4 Rh4! and again White loses material. 4) 18 f4 Re7 with a nasty check on e3 to come. 5) 18 g5 (relatively the best move) 18...W6 19 Rh7+ *f8 20 2tf3 Be4 with advantage to Black. Now we return to 13...h6!, which most players cite as the reason for re- jecting the M011er Attack. Soltis recognizes the importance of the line by devoting 16 pages of analy- sis to the position after 13...h6. The critical position arises after 14 Re2 hxg5 15 Sei Ne6 16 dxe6 f6 17 Be3
(D).
Soltis boldly states "This move, at- tributed to the Finnish correspondence player Juhani Sorri, rehabilitates the new M011er." We will take a look at two possibilities for Black, 17...c6 and

It seems to me that Black is virtually winning. After 17...Nf8, Soltis's main line runs 18 Nd3 <Ng8 19 Rc2 Sh6 20 Sg3, and ends with the rather weak comment that "White will now follow with either See3 and Sh3, or by preparations for f2-f4".

You build your entire reper- toire on the basis of this claim. With the Soltis book, this involves learning something against the Two Knights

In fact your whole rep- ertoire is founded on one move, 20 Rd2, which has never been tested in practice and which is analysed for just over half a page. Then it suddenly turns out that there is something wrong with 20 Qd2. What do you do? It is no good switching to another line in the Giuoco Piano, as these have long been dismissed as offering White nothing. In fact, you may as well dust off your books on the Ruy Lopez.
3 The Middlegame
This is the part of the game in which it is hardest to set down rules and give good advice. For every rule one pro- poses, there will be so many excep- tions that the rule may be more misleading than helpful. Accordingly, we are going to deal more with the psychological side of the middlegame than with technical issues. Good positions Congratulations, you have the advan- tage! But what do you do next? The first step is to judge whether your ad- vantage is of a short-term or long-term nature. If it consists of better develop- ment or attacking chances, then it is probably short-term; if it is based on better pawn structure or superior minor pieces, then it is probably long-term. Many advantages, such as control of an open file, may be either short- or long-term depending on whether the opponent has a means of challenging the asset. This step will provide you with a clue as to whether you should be thinking of quick action to exploit your advantage before it disappears, or whether you can afford to manoeu- vre slowly, tidying up your position ready for further action. It is also important to take into ac- count your opponent's possibilities for counterplay. It is no good starting some leisurely manoeuvres if your op- ponent has a passed pawn thundering down the board. Only if both condi- tions are satisfied - a long-term advan- tage and a lack of counterplay - can you afford to indulge in luxuries such as improving your king position. How- ever, in this case you not only can take your time, you should do so. You may not be able to see a concrete reason why a particular 'tidying-up' move might be useful, but you lose nothing by playing it. T. Petrosian - W. Unzicker USSR - West Germany match, Hamburg 1960 White's absolute domination of the c-file and pressure against the vulner- able a5-pawn give him a long-term

Nevertheless, White still has to come up with a plan for improving his position. He decides that a kingside pawn advance is the best way to pro- ceed, but if played immediately this would expose his king. Petrosian there- fore decides to play his king to the se- cure refuge on a2 before proceeding with his kingside plan. Only a com- plete lack of counterplay could justify such an extravagant manoeuvre, but in this particular position White has ab- solutely no need to hurry. 29 ifl <±>g8 After 29...Sb8, White would make progress by 30 Sb6 Sd8 31 Scc6 Bc7

84 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
ideal game is one in which you win without allowing any unnecessary counter-chances. If you can win with a clear-cut combination, then that is the best way to eliminate counterplay, because the game is over! However, you should be really sure that your combination does work; it is quite easy to miscalculate complex tactics, and if there is an element of doubt then a purely strategic approach is proba- bly better. Even if your combination 'works' (i.e. is not tactically unsound) then you should also be sure that your advantage in the resulting position is greater than it is in the position before- hand. A common error is to play an elaborate tactical line gaining, for ex- ample, the exchange for a pawn, only to discover that there are fewer win- ning chances after the combination than before. In the following example White, with a strategically winning position, spotted a seductively beautiful combi- nation (D): This position is a Benoni gone hor- ribly wrong for Black. White's pieces are all actively placed and he has the two bishops, while Black's a8-rook is useless and his knights poorly placed. 19 e5! This is the thematic Benoni break- through, so it came as no surprise.
19...dxe5 20 d6
But this was unexpected. I had an- ticipated the natural 20 f5 when Black is probably just lost. White threatens to complete his blockade by ?)e4, J. Bellon - J. Nunn Zurich 1984 when a list of the threats shows just how awful Black's position is: d6, fxg6, Bg5, Bc4, g5. Consequently, Black would have to try 20...£rf6 (20...e4 21 fxg6 hxg6 22 d6 and 23 Bc4 wins), but 21 fxg6 hxg6 22 Bg5 e4 23 Heel is crushing. One possible continuation would be 23...c4 24 Bxc4 Nc5 25 Qg3 h5 26 Re3 Nf6 27 Nxf6 Nxf6
28 W4 &cd7 29 Nxe4 Nxe4 30 d6!
and Black's position is tom to shreds. Bellon's move gave me a momen- tary glimmer of hope, but then I real- ized he intended 20...Qxd6 21 Qe4 Re7 22 f5 with the same type of posi- tion as after 20 f5. White, it is true, has given up a second pawn, but his knight has arrived on e4 with gain of tempo. A quick look convinced me that there was no real answer to the threats to f7 arising after fxg6, Bc4 and, if neces- sary, Ng5. However, there was obvi- ously nothing better than to take the pawn.

After 24 Bxa6 bxa6
25 Sxc5 (25 Nxc5 Nd3) 25...Sxc5 26
Bxc5 Nd3, for example, Black re- gains the pawn on b2 (White should avoid 27 b4? Nxc5 28 bxc5 Nd4+). In view of the doubled a-pawns, White would be effectively almost a pawn up, but the win would not be guaran- teed.

When you are desperate, it is some- times necessary to play ugly moves. The threat of 26 d7 can only be met by I hadn't seen this queen sacrifice at all, and when he touched his queen I couldn't imagine where it was going. A second later I found out! It is of course desirable to avoid revealing to your opponent that you have over- looked something, but in this case my body language must have broadcast the message far and wide. The question mark attached to this move is perhaps a little harsh, because White retains a winning position even after it. Yet from the practical point of view it is undoubtedly a mistake. 21 would have led to a position in which White's win would require only straightforward, obvious moves - he just has to take aim at f7 and Black will soon collapse. The move played alters the character of the position completely and presents both players with new problems to solve. White had noticed an attractive combination without tactical flaws and leading to a won position. He then

result of a process of elimination. If your position is objectively lost, the most important rule is 'Keep the game going'. This doesn't mean that you should play on for a long time in a resignable position; it means 'do not allow your opponent a simple forced win'. The longer you can force your opponent to work, the greater the chances he will eventually go wrong. In the diagram position, White would be looking for a knock-out blow and would probably reject lines in which he is 'only' a pawn up. Denying him a quick win will eventually cause frus- tration, a loss of objectivity and a pos- sible error. 26 £tf6+?! Once again this does not throw away the win, but a pragmatic player would have contented himself with the gain of a pawn by 26 b3. After

The simple move 32 Bd2 would also have been very awkward. Black's queenside pawns aren't going any- where because pushing them would open the diagonals leading to Black's king. Thus White has time to play Bf3-d5 or Ba4 and exploit his great piece activity.

The earlier complications, coupled with White's fruitless search for a knock-out, had left him short of time. Just at the moment when he could have really used a few extra minutes, he was forced to move quickly and threw the win away. The complexity of the position is such that in my original notes (published, for exam- ple, in Informator) I gave two possible wins for White, only one of which works. I suppose I should be thankful that I got 50% correct! The first 'win' was 34 Bxc6 Bxc6

38 Be7+?
There are very few players who de- fend well when they have slipped from a winning position into an inferior one. It requires exceptional self-control to forget about what has gone before and just to concentrate on the current situation. White could still have held the game by 38 Bf2! Scl 39 Sef 1 with a dead draw after the exchange of b- and d-pawns. The move played is a re- flex action to preserve the d-pawn, but White should never have abandoned the first rank, except to attack the pawn on b2.

Bad positions The first piece of advice is simple: don't give up hope. The history of chess is littered with won positions thrown away. Even world champions
THE MIDDLEGAME 89
have been known to do this, and it is much more common at lower levels. However, you should not just hope that your opponent is going to make a mistake - you have to help him to do so. Being determined to make the win as difficult as possible is the first step in the right direction. A stiff resistance is almost always unnerving for the side with the advantage - he may well have over-estimated the strength of his own position and be anticipating a quick finish. There are two basic strategies when confronted with a bad position. The first is to find some way to hang on, of- ten by liquidating to an endgame. The attacker may not fancy winning a long endgame a pawn up and so may un- wisely continue to seek a middlegame win. Even if he does go for the end- game, a sudden switch from tactical middlegame play to technical end- game play can often prove disorientat- ing. We call this the 'grim defence' response. The second strategy is to seek to gain the initiative, even at material cost, hoping to stir up complications and cause the opponent to go wrong. We call this the 'create confusion' re- sponse. The choice between these alterna- tives depends mainly on the position on the board, but other factors can en- ter the calculation. For example, if your opponent is short of time he may welcome simplification to an end- game, so in this case the 'create confusion' approach may be better. If you are aware of your opponent's style, then this might also affect your decision. One important point is that you should not change plans in mid- stream. If you have decided on 'grim defence' then you should not lose pa- tience and switch plans later unless your opponent carelessly allows you a chance to break out. 'Grim defences' most often fail because the defender creates unnecessary additional weak- nesses, opening the door to the oppo- nent's pieces. The whole point of 'grim defence' is to set up a solid posi- tion which your opponent has to work hard to break down; such positions do not lend themselves to the creation of active counterplay. If you decide to go for 'create con- fusion' then you should press the panic button sufficiently early to give yourself a reasonable chance of suc- cess. However, you should be sure that your position is really bad enough to warrant such drastic measures. In my experience, it is far more common to panic too early than too late. Here is an example of each type of strategy, in both cases in response to a stunning opening novelty. J. Nunn - W. Browne Gj0vik 1983 Sicilian, Najdorf

Nxf6 xf6 12 g5 d7 13 f5 Nc5 14 h4 b4 15 Nce2 In retrospect, one can say that White should choose something else round about here, for example the sacrifice 15fxe6!?.
15...e5 16 Nb3 (D)
though Browne failed to win the game, his novelty was voted the most impor- tant of the second half of 1983. As the similar vote in the first half of 1983 gave a lower score to the winner, it would be fair to say that the most stun- ning novelty played anywhere in the world during 1983 had just landed on my board. After I had recovered from the shock, I settled down to decide on the best reply. I saw that I could take the knight, which leads ultimately to a better ending for Black, or I could try
17 Bg2, which sacrifices a pawn for
not very impressive compensation. My choice was determined largely by practical factors. I realized that Browne would have analysed both these lines carefully at home, so this was cer- tainly a crucial decision. I had spent a great deal of time sitting at the board calculating these alternatives and so, unusually when facing Browne, I was far behind on the clock. In view of the time situation, I doubted my ability to find my way through continuing com- plications which Browne would have analysed at home. I therefore decided to go for the 'grim defence' option, when the many possibilities for both sides would inevitably mean leaving Browne's analysis within a few moves of entering the ending. Moreover, my lack of time would be a less relevant factor as the complications would be less intense. As an aside, there is very little you can do to prevent the occasional I was feeling quite happy with the opening. In previous games Black had invariably continued 16..Bb7, and I had analysed the resulting posi- tions and concluded that they favoured White.
16... xe4!!
I was dumbfounded when this move appeared on the board and for several minutes I just couldn't see the point of it. After 17 Qxe4 Nb7 18 Hd5, fol- lowed by Bg2 if necessary, everything seemed to be fine for White. Sooner or later Black would have to take on d5 when White would have complete domination of the light squares. Then I suddenly saw the idea (which will be revealed in the game continuation) and realized I was in trouble. Even

shocking opening novelty - if you play sharp openings then it is an occu- pational hazard. 17"xe4 In a later game Wedberg-de Fir- mian, Oslo 1984, White did indeed try

White an extra piece.
22 Nxd5 Sxh4! (D)
This move is the key point which it took me several minutes to see at move
16. The upshot is that Black gains a
rook and two pawns for two knights. In an ending, a rook and two pawns is worth more than two minor pieces at least 90% of the time. Two bishops may sometimes hold the balance, but two knights have almost no chance. 23Sgl! White must try to keep Black's bishop passive. The material situation would be the same after 23 Bxh4 Bxg5+ 24 Nc2 Bxh4 25 cxb4, but Black would have a far easier time. His bishop can emerge via f2, his fa- pawn is already passed and his king can obstruct White's queenside pawns by ...Nd7-c7.

26 Ne4 h5!
After 26...d5 27 Bd3! Black has rather a lot of pawns attacked.

Bhh2 (D) White has made considerable prog- ress since the last diagram in setting up a light-squared blockade; of course, he is quite happy to repeat moves.

34...d5!
A combination liquidating to a rook ending favourable for Black. How- ever, there is saying that 'all rook end- ings are drawn'. While this is clearly not intended literally, it contains a large element of truth. Rook endings are often tricky to judge, because in one position an extra pawn may be in- sufficient to win, while in another, one player may have a decisive advantage despite material equality. The reason for this is that piece activity is very im- portant in rook endings and can often prevent the exploitation of a material advantage. Likewise, if material is equal a difference in piece activity may decide the game.

had continued 13 exd5 exd5 14 jkf4 Rd8 15 a4 and here a draw was agreed. After 15...Nxa4 16 Hxa4 Ee8 Black's pieces are quite active and the rook on a4 is misplaced, factors that balance the slight weakness of the iso- lated d-pawn. 13 e5!I A complete shock for me. Objec- tively speaking, this move simply re- futes Black's opening strategy. I saw at once that after 13...Rxe5 14 Bf4 my queen would be in trouble, so I looked to see where I could move my knight. Unfortunately, Black's natural retreat
13...Rd7 loses a piece after 14 b4, so
Black would have to play 13...Ne8. However, then 14 f4 f5 15 exf6 (best; if White tries to play on the kingside with h3 and g4, then the knight on e8 might actually become useful with ...g6 and ...Ng7) 15... xf6 16 Nf3 gives White a clear positional advan- tage - the e6-pawn is weak and it is hard for Black to bring his c8-bishop into play. However, Black is by no means lost and this would be a reason- able attempt at a 'grim defence' strat- egy. In the late 1970s Plaskett was prone to time-trouble, and he had already thought a long time before playing 13 e5. Given the choice between a messy, complicated position and one in which he could increase the posi- tional pressure by straightforward moves, I would certainly have pre- ferred the former. I therefore decided to look again at the capture on e5 and White decided to go for the inferior ending. After placing as many diffi- culties as possible in Black's way, he was eventually rewarded with a slip allowing the half-point to be saved. The next game provides a real con- trast. J. Plaskett - J.

cxd4 5 Nxd4 a6 6 Ne2 &bd7 7 Ne3 Nc5 After the present game I gave up this line. The idea of playing the knight to c5 is to exert pressure on e4, but once White has played f3 this pressure is irrelevant, and then it is hard to see what the knight is doing on c5.

in the end I found the continuation played in the game.
13...Qxe5 14 Nf4 Rh5 15 g4 Rg6
I didn't spend long on the moves
15...Rh4 and 15...Qh3. It is quite easy
to refute the former: 15...Qh4 16 Bg3 Rh3 17 Hfel 2>e8 (17..."h6 18 g5)
18 Afl Rh6 19 Rxh6 gxh6 20 Nxd5
and Black's position is disgusting. Al- though it is quite hard to find a clear- cut refutation of 15...Qh3, there is lit- tle point in thinking about such moves. White can regain his pawn immedi- ately, and there is almost no chance that Black can survive with his queen stuck on h3 and none of his other pieces co-operating with it. Home analysis shows that 15...Qh3 16 Sf2 2te8 17 b4 2d7 18 Nxd5 Nd8 19 Ne3! is very strong; e.g. 19..Bf6 loses to 20 £fl Rh4 21 Ng3 Rg5 22 f4. 16 b4 This was the point of White's pawn sacrifice. The knight has to move, and then Bd3 traps the queen.
16..Ace4!
Except, of course, if it moves to e4! Black can avoid immediate material loss by 16...e5 17 Bxe5 Ne6, but after
18 Bd3 g5 19 "xg5 xg5 20 h4
£te6 21 W5 he has a very bad ending, for example 21...Bxb4 22 .xf6 gxf6 23 xd5 Bc5+ 24 &hl. This doesn't even qualify as a 'grim defence' ~ it is just very bad without any redeeming features. 17 fxe4 dxe4 (D) This continuation is Black's best practical chance, once he has decided on the 'create confusion' method. He has two pawns for the piece and, ow- ing to the attacks on b4 and g4, he is sure to gain a third pawn. This is not a coincidence, but results from the fact that White's tactical operation de- pended on the weakening pawn stabs b4 and g4. Given that Black obtains a material equivalent for the piece, you may wonder why he is worse. The an- swer is simply development. All the white pieces are in active play, while Black's queenside is still sitting at home. 18 *hl White decides to jettison the b4- pawn, preferring to keep the pawn on g4 which shields his king.

£}g4 0-1 Defending well after having made an oversight requires especially cool nerves. We have previously discussed the possible causes of oversights and the warning signs which can indicate when danger is near. Suppose, despite this advice, you nevertheless overlook a surprising and strong move by your opponent. The first piece of advice is to stay calm. It is all too easy to bash out an instinctive response, either through uncontrollable nervous agita- tion or in an attempt to persuade your opponent that you had foreseen his move and had a reply ready. This is a mistake. The correct approach is to spend a few minutes just calming your nerves. Don't get caught up a mental loop of self-recrimination - you don't have time for this while you are at the board. Try to forget about the history of the position, and just consider the current state of affairs on the board. A calm look will very often show that your opponent's move is not nearly as strong as you feared at first and that there are still fighting chances. Then 27 d5?? A horrible blunder in extreme time- trouble - White plays for a mate which does not exist. Despite the downturn in his fortunes, if White had kept a clear head then he would probably have saved the game. The correct

you can choose one of the defensive techniques outlined above and con- tinue the struggle. Attack 'inviting everyone to the party' Most books dealing with attacks on the king discuss the various typical methods of breakthrough; sacrifice on h7, sacrifice on g7, double bishop sac- rifice, and so on. I will not deal with these, partly because they are dis- cussed at length in many other places, but also because they represent only the final stages of an attack. Most players can manage a double bishop sacrifice, provided that they first arrive at a position in which such a sacrifice is possible. The main factor governing the suc- cess of an attack on the enemy king is whether you can bring more attacking pieces to bear on his king position than he can muster for the defence. If you have a large local superiority of force, then a sacrificial breakthrough will of- ten arise as a matter of course. You still have to calculate that the sacrifice works, but the odds will be heavily in your favour if you have enough wood in the vicinity. This title of this section is Yasser Seirawan's catchy phrase for an im- portant attacking principle. Incorpo- rating every possible piece into an attack greatly increases its chance of success. If you have staked everything on your attack, there is no point hold- ing pieces in reserve, since the game will be decided before reserve pieces will be of any use. The following position is a classic example:
HAH
A. Nimzowitsch - S. Tarrasch St Petersburg 1914 Black already has a local superior- ity on the kingside, because White has no defensive pieces there at all. How- ever, 18...Qh4 is ineffective owing to

When you play Sel-e3-g3 or Qdl-el-h4, you are cre- ating the preconditions for the attack to break through. The opponent must counter these manoeuvres either de- fensively or by generating counterplay in another part of the board. In addition to bringing your own pieces to bear on the enemy king, it is also important to block the passage of enemy pieces to the threatened area. Sometimes a sacrifice is necessary. S.

A chain of pawns extending deep into enemy ter- ritory has the effect of cutting his posi- tion in half, and may in itself prove sufficient to prevent any pieces com- ing to the rescue of the beleaguered king. Then it is a matter of whittling away the defensive pieces on the side of the wedge near the king, by sacrifi- cial means if necessary. It is important to watch out for a counter-sacrifice breaking up the wedge, but otherwise such attacks are usually plain sailing. J. Nunn - A. Vydesiaver Leeuwarden Open 1995 I had earlier sacrificed my h-pawn in order to gain time for my attack. This had the positive effect of opening the h-file and allowing the f-pawn to advance, but on the other hand Black's

Pressing home an assault against the enemy king, sacrificing a couple of pieces and finally delivering mate is a great thrill ... provided it works. One of the great dangers of even a correct sacrificial attack is over-sac- rificing. It very often happens that the first sacrifice is sound, but then the player gets overwhelmed with the de- sire to finish 'brilliantly' and instead of just bringing up all his pieces and mating his opponent, he goes on a quite unnecessary sacrificial spree, endangering the win. As the material deficit increases, the opponent gains more and more chances to return some or all of the material in order to fend off the attack. Sometimes some quite unlikely-looking moves become pos- sible if there is enough spare wood to jettison. M. Botvinnik - V. Chekhover Moscow 1935

31 dxe5 fxe5. The position is still very complicated, but Black, a rook and a piece up, has plenty of possibilities to return some of the material. My own view is that White would be struggling to draw in these lines. White's minor pieces are ideally placed to attack Black's king, except for the knight on h3. The ugly cluster of black pieces on the queenside is not doing much and is certainly of little help in defending the kingside. White therefore decides, quite correctly, to sacrifice his one poorly placed piece in the interests of opening up Black's king position. 22 g5! hxg5 Black must accept, since otherwise he cannot defend f7. 23fxg5 N8d7 (D) After 23...&6d7 24 Nxf7, followed by Rh5, White has a crushing attack, so Black offers to return the piece.

the game, but if there is no mate then queen and rook may have to grovel back to the centre, with great loss of time. The defender can often exploit the negative side of an attack by a suitable sacrifice to take the sting out of the on- slaught. G. Sax - M.

Be3 Rc7 9 f4 O-O 10 g4 Nc6 11 g5 Qd7 12 f5 de5 13 f6 Nd8 (D) Defence The principles for defending against an attack on the king are to some ex- tent the converse of those given above in the section on attack. The defender should try to move his own pieces across to help the endangered king while, if possible, obstructing the free passage of the opposing pieces to the critical sector. One particular motif which often arises in practice is that of the defen- sive sacrifice. The idea of the attacker sacrificing material is a familiar one, but it happens almost as often that the defender gives up material. Here I am not talking about the situation in which the attacker has sacrificed, and the defender is returning material, but about cases in which the defender is prepared to accept a genuine material deficit. The basis for such sacrifices very often lies in the positional concessions made by the attacker. In a Sicilian, it may be very useful for attacking pur- poses if White pushes his kingside pawns to g5 and f6, but if the attack collapses the white king may not ap- preciate having had his defensive pawn wall sent into the other half of the board. Launching an attack usu- ally involves a concession of some sort; it may be the creation of weak- nesses, as in the case of a pawn ad- vance, or it may be sending pieces off- side. If White plays his rook to h3 and queen to h4, then mate on h7 will end A typical Sicilian position. The white kingside pawns have launched them- selves forward, but in return Black has undisputed control of the square e5. 14 fxg7?! This looks like a mistake as there is no need for White to commit himself to this capture so early. Recently this

Stean's move may appear suicidal, but it turns out that White has prob- lems continuing his attack because his development is rather poor (all those pawn moves on the kingside). He really needs his queen on the kingside in order to create genuine threats, but both 15 Bd3 (intending Rh5) and 15 Wei drop a pawn after ...Qxd4 and ..Bxg5. Note that in the latter case Black justifies his play with a tactical point: 15 Wei ?}xd4 16 Bxd4 Bxg5

15 Rd2 b5! 16 g6?!
White decides to grab the exchange, but Black obtains tremendous com- pensation. It would have been better to try 16 a3 followed by, for example, doubling rooks on the f-file. However, I do not believe that Black has any problems as a major threat from White is still several moves away.

Finally, once he has played ... g7, ...Bb6 and ..Bb7, his rook can swing across to h8 and White's king will be the one subject to attack. In return for these many positional ad- vantages all White has to show is the very small material advantage of rook for bishop and pawn.

A fairly typical position for the 6 f4 Najdorf (the game started as a Dragon,
108 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
but later transposed into a Najdorf). White has attacking chances on the kingside, while Black can organize counterplay against the isolated e4- pawn. The long-term chances are with Black, because of his superior pawn structure, so the burden of proof lies with White. The normal plan of attack is based on Bh6 and g5, but this is not very effective here because White would be losing a tempo with his bishop and so Black would be able to meet 17 Bh6 by

Therefore this move is forced. If White's bishop were on h6 instead of e3, then he would have a standard at- tacking plan of g4 (preventing ...Nh5), followed by doubling rooks on the f- file, but as it is White always has to take ...h6 into account.

Again, there has been a remarkable transformation in the position. The only trace remaining of White's attack is the misplaced rook on h3. In return for the pawn, Black completely domi- nates the dark squares, while White's
THE MIDDLEGAME 109
pieces are doing little apart from de- fending the pawn on e4. Moreover, the advance g4 has seriously weakened White's kingside, and if Black man- ages to play ...f5 under favourable cir- cumstances then White will be in real trouble. An additional point is that Ljubo- jevid is an attacking player who does not adapt well to positions requiring careful defence; this game is a case in point.

White should be thinking about how he can draw, and his pieces are so pas- sive that the only realistic chance is to play £ki5 at some stage, returning the pawn to reach the haven of opposite- coloured bishops.

However, White must be careful be- cause Black threatens to defend h7 by ...bxc3 followed by ...Qxe4. The solu- tion appears simple: White must play his gl-rook to h4, so as to both defend h7 and cover e4. That is indeed what happened in one of the first games to reach this po- sition, Chandler-Yudasin, Minsk 1982, but after the further moves 18 Sg4 bxc3 19 Sh4 cxb2+ 20 Nxb2 White was shocked by 2O...Rxe4! 21 Sxe4 Nxe4 (D). Once again, if we compare the dia- grams then we can see the change that has taken place. Black's light-squared bishop is absolutely secure on the c2- g6 diagonal and while it is there White has no attacking chances on the king- side. Indeed, it is now White who has to think about defence, since c2 is very weak and Black can open further lines by advancing his a-pawn. The posi- tion is in fact favourable for Black and White was soon in trouble: 22 Ba3 This is a theoretical position from the Velimirovic Attack in the Sicilian.

4 The Endgame
King and Pawn endings King and pawn endings very often represent the final phase of a game. Of course, both sides may promote, in which case the players can look for- ward to a lot more fun, but the major- ity of &+A endings are decided in the pawn ending itself. Unlike most other types of position, the concept of an 'inaccuracy' is almost unknown in &+A endings. Given sufficient energy and skill, most positions are capable of being analysed to a definite conclu- sion. This means that errors can only occur in half-point jumps. Also, un- like other types of position, in which you may recover from a mistake and gradually fight your way back into the game, a slip in a &+A ending usually means the certain loss of half a point. This means that accuracy is at a special premium in this type of end- ing, so it is essential to be familiar with the main principles. There are three fundamental con- cepts in endings. Surprisingly, however, not even all GMs are famil- iar with their correct application. Opposition This is the most basic principle and has the widest application. The following Many games are decided in the end- game, especially between players of comparable strength. Mastery of the endgame is just as important as profi- ciency in the opening and middle- game. Even though this truth has been repeated over and over again, the end- game still remains a neglected area of chess study, especially amongst club players. In the past they had some excuse, as many club games were decided by ad- judication before the endgame was reached, but quickplay finishes are now the rule rather than the exception. In tournaments, too, the quickplay finish is the most common method of decid- ing long games. The practical effect is that players can no longer rely on an 'if I get an endgame, I'll work it out over the board' attitude. The fast time-limit implies that you have to know the correct method beforehand. Moreover, familiarity is very impor- tant. If you have to ransack your mem- ory for some half-forgotten but vital snippet of information, the chances are that you will have lost on time be- fore your memory cells release the necessary information. This chapter is therefore designed as a quick guide to what it is abso- lutely essential to know about the end- game.
THE ENDGAME 113
d5 Nb7, then White can win in two ways: 1) If White now heads for the g- pawn, he has gained a vital tempo: 4 *e5 *b6 5 *fS *c5 6 *xg5 <Nb4 7 f5 (S)xa4 8 g5 b4 9 g6 a4 10 g7 a3 llg8< It is worthwhile thinking for a moment about why moving one file to the queenside has actually gained a tempo in this line. The point is that af- ter 3 Nd5 the black king is not only unable to approach the a-pawn, but must actually move one square further away. Thus White loses one tempo but Black loses two. 2) 4 c5 (White mops up the a- pawn before heading for the kingside)
4...<Na6 5 *c6 Na7 6 <Nb5 <Nb7 7
xa5 Nc6 8 Nb4 b6 9 c4 with an easy win. If the black king heads the other way with 2...<Nd6, then White heads for the a-pawn, having gained an extra tempo because his king is one square nearer the queenside: 3 b5 e5 4 <4>xa5 <Nf4 5 <Nb4 <±>xg4 6 a5 <Nh3 7 a6 g4 8 a7 g3 9 a8W. This position is a technical win; if you are unfamiliar with the process, here it is: 9...g2 10 Rf3+ <4>h2 11 Rf2 *hl 12 Rh4+ *gl 13 *c3 *fl 14 "f4+ *e2 15 Rg3 <&fl 16 W3+ *gl 17 Rf4 *hl
18 Rh4+ *gl 19 *d2 *fl 20 Qel#.
The situation after l...Ne6 is virtu- ally symmetrical. Once again White must avoid the immediate dash for the pawn with 2 Nc5?. The correct method is 2 <Ne4 <Nf6 (2...4>d6 3 <Nf5 and White promotes first; Black's a-pawn position provides us with a clear-cut example. The two kings face ('oppose') each other with the minimum possible gap of one empty square between them. White has the advantage because his king is one square further advanced. This advantage is sufficient to win if Black is to move, because the black king has to move to one side or the other. This allows White's king to ad- vance to the fifth and run to one or other of the enemy pawns. In this situa- tion we say that 'White has the opposi- tion'. However, even in this relatively simple case there is still one finesse. After 1...&C6 White must not run di- rectly to the g-pawn with 2 <Ne5, be- cause after 2... c5 3 Nf5 b4 4 Nxg5 Nxa4 5 Nf5 Nb4 6 g5 a4 both sides promote at the same time and the position is a draw. Instead, 2 Nc4! is correct, again taking the opposition, but under even more favourable cir- cumstances. If Black plays 2...Nb6 3

does not reach the seventh rank) 3 Nd5 Nf7 4 Nc5 (4 <± 5 also wins)
4...Ne6 5 *b5 *e5 6 *xa5 <±>f4 7
Nb5 (S)xg4 8 a5 Nh3, transposing to line 2 above. While the details of this position in- clude one or two subtle points, the basic principle is clear enough: when White has the opposition, Black must give way with his king and permit White's own king to advance. It is worth noting that if White is to move in the diagram, then Black has the op- position, but because of White's ini- tially more favourable king position, he can hold the draw: 1 Nc4 (1 e4 also draws, but any king retreat to the third rank loses, as Black can trans- pose into the above analysis with re- versed colours) 1...&C6 (after 1...&C5 both sides promote simultaneously) 2 <Nd4 and Black has nothing better than to return to d6. The situation becomes only a little more complicated when the kings are further back: With White to play, one's first im- pulse is to rush forward with the king by 1 c3?, but this is a mistake: Black replies l../4?c7! and after 2 c4 Nc6 or 2 Nd4 Nd6 Black gains the opposi- tion and White cannot make progress. The basic principle governing such cases of what is called the 'distant op- position' is that when the kings face each other with an odd number of squares in between, then the player to move loses the opposition. The situa- tion when there is just one square in between the kings (discussed above) is then just a special case of this rule. In the above position, it follows that
1 Nc2! is the correct move (1 <i?b3? is
also bad, since after l...Nd7! Black can meet 2 Nc4 by 2... c6 and 2 Nc3 by 2... c7). Black replies l...Nd8. Now 2 b3? can be met by 2...(S)d7, and of course 2 Nc7 and 2 d3? Nd7 give Black the opposition. The correct move is 2 Nd2!, again in ac- cordance with our 'odd-square' rule. At first sight White is not getting any- where, since if Black just keeps mov- ing his king up and down the first rank by 2...Ne8, White can apparently only follow suit on his second rank. However, White can make progress by carrying out what is called a 'by- pass'. This involves moving in the op- posite direction to Black's king and at the same time advancing. If it works, then the result will be to regain the op- position, but with the kings two squares closer together. White can re- peat the manoeuvre until there is just
THE ENDGAME 115
one square between the kings and then we have the situation discussed in the previous diagram. Here White exe- cutes a by-pass with 3 Nc3!. Now there is a direct threat to play 4 &C4 and 5 Nb5, so Black has to head for c6 by 3... d7. White continues 4 Nd3 and he has achieved his objective. Now the situation is simpler. 4... c7 and 4... e7 lose because White just heads for the g-pawn or the a-pawn respectively, so Black's king must ad- vance to third rank. White just op- poses the enemy king and gains the 'close' opposition, winning as in the previous diagram. Had Black played
2...Nc8, White would have by-passed
on the other side by 3 e3. When I first saw this idea as a very young player, one point really con- fused me. On most files White was content simply to maintain the opposi- tion but then, suddenly, on one par- ticular file White would abandon the opposition and perform a by-pass. How do you know on which file to execute the by-pass? Eventually I was able to answer my own question and in doing so gained a deeper understand- ing of king and pawn endings. In posi- tions dominated by the opposition, the attacker has two targets. In the above diagrams these are the pawns on a5 and g5. This is perfectly natural: the nature of the opposition is that if Black's king goes to the queenside, then White's king slips through to the kingside and vice versa. If there were no kingside target, then Black would lose nothing by allowing White's king to penetrate in that direction. Simi- larly there must be a queenside target or Black could safely move his king to the other side of the board. The by- pass manoeuvre is almost always per- formed on the file which is equidistant between the two targets. In the above case this is the d-file. In this position, which is superfi- cially similar to the above, White to play cannot win because there is no by-pass. White does win if he takes the opposition with his king on the fourth rank, but he cannot force this from the diagram. The critical position arises after 1 Nd2 Nd7 2 Nd3 and now Black must take care. 2...Nc6? 3 Nc4 and 2...Nd6? 3 <±'d4 allow White to gain the 'close' opposition, and in addition Black's king must also be ready to stop White lunging for the a- pawn. It follows that 2...&C7! is the only drawing move. This would be the ideal time for a by-pass, except that the e4-square, which White needs for
116 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
the operation, is controlled by a black pawn. In the above examples, the 'two-tar- get' situation was quite obvious, be- cause the targets were far apart. Cases in which the targets are closer together are governed by the same principles, even if their nature is less transparent. White to play can draw, but only if he starts with the paradoxical move 1 &hl!. Other moves fail, for example 1 f1? (this loses because White cannot maintain the close opposition) l...<±>d2
2 f2 Nd3 (White would like play 3
Nf3, but his pawn is in the way) 3 Ng3 <Ne3 4 <Ng2 <Ne2 5 <Ng3 <Nf1 and Black reaches a target. Other first moves fail similarly: 1 h2 Nd2! (preparing the by-pass) 2 <Ngl (2 Ng2 Ne2) 2...<±>e3 (by-pass executed) 3 g2 Ne2 and wins, or 1 Ng3 <Nel 2 <Ng2 <Ne2. After 1 &hl ! Black cannot make progress, as White can always main- tain the opposition: 1) l...<Ne2 2 <Ng2 <Nd3 3 <Nh3! Ne3 4 <Ng3, etc. 2) 1...&C1 2 &gl ! (the only move)
2...<Nc2 (2...g4 is met by 3 g2!, but
not 3 fxg4? e4 4 Nf2 <Nd2 and Black wins) 3 <Ng2 <Nc3 4 <Ng3 <Nd3 5 <Nh3 and so on. We end this section on the opposi- tion with the usual warning that while general principles can provide excel- lent guidance, in the end it is the spe- cific position on the board that matters and a forced win overrides any other considerations. The following diagram is very simi- lar to the Neustadtl position given above. On this basis one might assume the position to be a draw, because after
1 f6 b6 or 1 <Ng6 a6 Black gains
the distant opposition. However, there is a slight difference because the kings are further apart than in the Neustadtl H. Neustadtl, 1890 In this position the target squares for Black are (obviously) f3 and (less obviously) fl . The latter is a target be- cause if Black's king reaches fl then White is losing no matter where his king is (within reason) or who is to play. For example, if White's king is on g3, then, with White to play, 1 Nh3 f2 2 Ng4 <Ng2 wins easily. If Black is to play then L. gl forces the same line. It follows that the opposition ma- noeuvres will take place along the ranks (because the ranks are at right angles to the line joining the two tar- gets) and that any by-passing will take place on the second rank.

point, because a new factor entered the equation. The Reti manoeuvre There is no better way to explain this idea than to give Roti's original exam- ple, even though it is one of the most famous endgame positions in chess history. A. Mandler Prager Presse 1929 position and this operates in White's favour. After 1 Nf6? b6 play pro- ceeds exactly as before, but with the kings on the g- and a-files a second factor enters the position: the possibil- ity of a breakthrough by c5. This only works if Black's king is on the back rank, so that White will promote with check. Moreover, Black's king must be on a8, because otherwise c5 can be met by ...&C7 (we saw this in line 2 of the previous diagram). Thus White can win by 1 Ng6! ?a6 (Black must main- tain the opposition; if he deviates, then White gains the opposition himself and wins by reaching d6 or d8 with his king) 2 Bg7! Na7 3 <4>g8! (3 < f8? *b8 4 c5 *c7!) 3...*a8 (Black is dragged to his doom; 3...<£ 8 4 Nf8,
3...*b7 4 Nf7 and 3...*b6 4 *f8 all
win for White, the last line being a by-pass) 4 c5 dxc5 5 e5 and promotes with check. In this case the logic of the opposition broke down past a certain R. Reti Kagan's Neueste Schachnachrichten 1921 White appears to be two tempi short of catching the h-pawn, but he never- theless manages to overhaul it by si- multaneously threatening to promote the c-pawn. The analysis runs 1 Ng7! h4 (l...<Nb6 2 4>f6 h4 3 Ne5 trans- poses to the main line) 2 <Nf6!

118 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
If you have not seen this position before, it is worth playing over the so- lution several times to see exactly why it works. Once again, the 'two-threat' concept is important, but this time it is not a question of tempo play, but the exploitation of the fact that a diagonal king move, if measured with a ruler, is longer than an equivalent horizontal or vertical one. In terms of catching the h-pawn, the routes Nh7-h6-h5 and Ng7-f6-e5 are identical. The advan- tage of the latter is that it activates a second threat, that of promoting the c-pawn. It takes Black two tempi to deal with this threat, by taking the c- pawn with his king, and this is exactly the time White needs to catch up with the h-pawn. Despite this coldly logical explana- tion, it is a remarkable idea and there still seems to be a whiff of magic about the position. The use of a second threat as a kind of warp-drive for White's king occurs in quite a wide range of situations. The above diagram is a second example in which White's king goes on a lengthy detour before catching the enemy pawn. In this case the white king is one tempo short of catching the h-pawn, for example 1 a6? c6 2 Nc8 Nb6 3 Nb8 <Nxa6 4 <Nc7 h5 and White is too late. However, by correctly exploiting the threat of promoting the a-pawn White can make up the time: 1 Nc8 ! <Nc6 2 <Nb8 <Nb5 3 <Nb7 (this is the key move; the white king just makes it into the square of the pawn) 3...<£ >xa5 4 Nc6 and White is in time. Triangulation If it were Black to play in the dia- gram then he would lose immediately, as White's king penetrates to b6 and takes the a-pawn. If it is White to move then his task is considerably harder. The key is a king manoeuvre L. ProkeS Sachove Umeni 1947
THE ENDGAME 119
which, by losing a tempo, transfers the move from White to Black. However, before starting this manoeuvre White has to play what is, in any case, a forced move: 1 Bd5. Now l...Nd8 2 Nd6 is a win even without the a-pawns, so
1...&C8 is forced. White cannot then
win with the direct 2 Nd6 Nd8 3 c7+ &C8 because 4 Nc6 is stalemate - he must be more subtle. While the white king remains adjacent to c5 Black's king cannot occupy c7, and so is re- stricted to shuffling back and forth along the first rank. If the white king moves around the triangle c4-d4-d5 the effect will be to transfer the move to Black: 2 <±>c4 <Nd8 3 <Nd4 <Nc8 4 Nd5 and now we have the position af- ter the first move, but with Black to play. White wins after 4...<Nd8 5 d6 or 4...&C7 5 <2?c5. White's triangulation worked be- cause of Black's lack of space; he could not emulate White's manoeuvre without stepping off the edge of the board. If you have looked at an advanced book on king and pawn endings, you will probably have noticed something called 'the theory of corresponding squares'. This is normally accompa- nied by diagrams with lots of little numbers (or letters, or sometimes both) on the squares. While this is an inter- esting subject from the theoretical point of view, to be quite honest it is of almost no practical value (not to men- tion that your opponent might object when you start adorning the board with mystic numbers). The opposi- tion, triangulation and a little bit of brain-power are all that are needed for the types of position that arise in over-the-board play. Of course there a few esoteric positions which cannot be solved by such straightforward techniques, but in all my career I have never seen such a position arise in practical play. The following position represents about the limit of complex- ity that one can anticipate over the board. N. Grigoriev K novoi armii, 1920 A position such as this would be an easy win for White if his king were on, say, d4, but here the win is difficult be- cause of Black's active king position. The first point to note is that after 1 d4? Ne4 2 Nc3 Black does not play

Expect the unexpected Readers will have noticed several odd king manoeuvres in the preceding po- sitions. This is no coincidence; para- doxical king moves are quite common in king and pawn endings. It is very important to take into account the pos- sibility of 'unnatural' king moves, both for you and for your opponent. It is impossible to give rules for finding such moves, precisely because they are often 'one-off' events which only work in that precise position. How- ever, this won't prevent me from giv- ing a few entertaining examples. Shirov had headed for the position in the following diagram because it seems an obvious draw after, for ex- ample 1 Ng5 <Ng2 2 f4 <±>f3 3 f5 <Ne4. <Nd3 f4 White cannot make prog- ress, e.g. 4 Nd2 Ne4 5 Nc3 Nf5 !, etc. It becomes apparent that White would be much better off in the dia- gram position if it were Black to play. If Black's king goes anywhere except to f4, then White wins by 2 <Ne3 or 2 d4, while after l... <S>f4 White plays 2 <Ne2 and the black king is gradually forced back. In fact the win is still not too easy, but we will return to this point later as the first step is to work out how to lose a tempo. If White plays 1 c2, then Black must reply
1...<Bf4 (since l... <Be3 2 Nc3 loses at
once, and after other moves White wins by either <Nc3-d4 or 2 d4). Read- ers may now recognize a pattern emerg- ing: the situation is basically the same as in the previous diagram rotated through 90 degrees, with c3-e3 taking the place of c5-c7 and c2-f4 the place of d5-c8. Now the solution should be apparent. While the white king remains adjacent to c3, Black's king must re- main adjacent to e3; in other words Black can only oscillate between f3 and f4 (e2 and f2 are out because the d-pawn advances). White only has to triangulate c2-b2-b3-c2, all the time staying adjacent to c3, and he will lose a tempo. The solution runs 1 Nc2 <Nf4 2 <Nb2 <4>f3 (2...<Ne5 3 Nc3 Nd5 4 c2 <Ne5 5 &dl transposes) 3 Nb3 f4 4 c2 (unlike the previous dia- gram, there is still quite a lot of play left in the position) 4...Ne5 (the most resilient defence; 4... e3 5 Nc3 and
4... f3 5 Nd2 lose more quickly) 5

The threat is simply to push the pawn to f6 and then run with the king to take the f7-pawn, si- multaneously defending White's own pawn.

The backward move of White's king is sufficiently counter-intuitive that even such a strong player as Shirov over- looked it. In Hebden-Flear, Black had been a pawn up for most of the game, but here he abandoned his winning attempts and played 1...5d5?!, at which point the players agreed to a draw. Indeed, after 2 Sxd5+ xd5 3 Nxf4 e6 there is clearly no point in continuing. However, as soon as the draw was agreed the players suddenly noticed that White could play 3 f5! (D) in- stead of 3 Nxf4. Suddenly Black is in trouble. After

play his king to g2 at move 8) 5 xg7 e7 6 xh6 <Nf6 is hopeless because White can extract his king by using up his one remaining tempo with the h-pawn: 7 (S)h7 Nf7 8 h6 Nf8 9 Ng6 *g8 10 *f5 *h7 11 *g5 followed by 12 *xf4. Having analysed both 3...<Bd4 and
3... d6 to a loss, one might be tempted
to assess the position as a win for White, but remember: 'Expect the Un- expected'. What does Black need to achieve in order to draw? First of all, he must be able to defend his g7-pawn if White plays Nxf4 followed by Nf5-g6. That means that his king must stay within three squares of f8. If White adopts his alternative plan of heading straight for g7 without both- ering about the f4-pawn, then Black has to be able to answer < ?xh6 with ...<S>xf3; one move slower and White will win as in the bracket given above. Since it takes three moves for White to reach h6, it follows that Black's king must stay within three squares of f3. The first criterion implies that Black must move to c5, c6 or d6 and the sec- ond implies that he must move to c4, d4 or c5. Luckily for Black, there is one square common to both these sets, namely c5. Thus 3,.. c5!! draws, e.g. 4 <Ng6 <Nd4, 4 <Nxf4 <Nd6 or 4 <Ne5 Nc6. It is quite hard to describe exactly what this motif depends on - it cer- tainly has nothing to do with the oppo- sition. Perhaps it is closest to the Reti manoeuvre, in that Black's king is trying to fulfil two tasks at the same time. Chess is more than counting One technique applicable in king and pawn endings, which is often recom- mended in textbooks, is that of 'coun- ting'. This name refers to the method of working out how many moves both sides will take to promote a pawn. Of course, this is only useful in 'race' situations, where each king marches into the opposing pawn-mass with the aim of creating a passed pawn as quickly as possible. I strongly advise against using the technique of 'counting'. There are several flaws with this method, and its unrestricted applica- tion can result in dreadful blunders. The main problem is that this method cannot detect any of the finesses which make king and pawn endings so inter- esting and which arise quite often in practice. The first cause of confusion is that you have to take account of who moves first. If White takes seven moves to promote and Black eight, when White promotes does Black reply by promot- ing or by pushing his pawn to the sev- enth? The answer is that it depends on who moves first. In the heat of battle it is quite easy to get this wrong and be 'out by one' (computer programmers know all about being 'out by one'). The second cause is that the count- ing method gives you no clue as to the

Nc4 it is all over. White captures the black pawns on f4, h4, and g3 while Black takes the a4-pawn and walks back to the kingside." Lasker does not consider what hap- pens if Black plays 2...<i>d4. By count- ing (carefully!) one quickly finds that Black's g-pawn is still on the sixth when White queens and, moreover, it is White's turn to move - enough rea- son to abandon the position as lost, if one does not take the trouble to visual- ize the resulting position. If we actually play over the moves
2...*d4 3 a5 Ne3 4 a6 <±>f2 5 a7 *xg2
6 a8Q h2 (D), then we arrive at the following diagram: relative whereabouts of the pieces at the end of the race. White may pro- mote and give check, or promote on h8 and stop Black's promotion on al. These things are obvious if you run the variation through in your head, but are not obvious if you are just counting. The simple fact is that you actually have to calculate the variation to make sure that one of these special situa- tions doesn't arise at the end of the race and if you are going to do that, then you may as well not waste time on counting. I will quote a position taken from Chess: The Complete Self-Tutor by Edward Lasker (it appears in all edi- tions before 1997), a popular chess primer which advocates the use of the counting method. It only takes a few moments to real- ize that this is a special situation. The congested mass of kingside pawns prevents White from pinning the g- pawn diagonally and from giving check on the h-file. In fact the g-pawn is unstoppable and the best White can do is to grab as many kingside pawns as he can, hoping for a favourable Lasker writes "In the position reached, the sequence 1 b4+ axb4+ 2 b3 forces Black to leave his pawn unprotected, giving White a passed pawn.

move to b6. There is far more to king and pawn endings than counting, and if you use this method you are asking for trouble. Rook endings Rook endings are the most common type of ending to occur in practical play. The reason is that if there are no open files, a relatively frequent occur- rence, then exchanges of rooks are rather unlikely. Minor pieces and queens can be exchanged far more readily. The ability to play rook and pawn endings well is a great distin- guishing feature between a master player and a club player. In simultane- ous displays, it is noticeable how the club players routinely lose completely equal rook endings, and how easily the master manages to escape with a draw from lost rook endings. Part of the reason for this is that rook and pawn endings are genuinely complicated, with a great deal of the- ory. Experience is perhaps even more important; the master will probably have encountered many rook endings in the course of his career, the club player far fewer. However, the situa- tion for club players is certainly far from hopeless; indeed, this is one of those areas in which a few hours' study can provide great dividends. We start with the ending of rook + pawn against rook, which is fundamental to all rook endings. queen ending. However, even this hope is in vain: after 7 Qb8 (7 Rh8 g2 8 "xh4 gl" 9 Rxf4+ "g3 10 Rxf5 "xh3 11 Rg4!? Qg3 and 12...*g2 is also a draw) 7...g2 8 Rxf4+ hl 9 Rxf5 glW the ending is a sure draw. Finally, if you don't calculate the whole variation, how can you be sure that the moves you are intending to play are actually possible? Here is a simple example. W. Schlage - C. Ahues Berlin 1921 It takes White five moves to take on a7 and it takes Black five moves to reach c7, so Black can meet <Nxa7 by ...Nc7 and the position is a draw. This was borne out by the game, which duly finished 1 e6 Nc3 2 Nd6 d4 3 <4>c6 <±>e5 4 <Nb7 <4>d6 5 <±>xa7 <±>c7 V2-V2. Right? Wrong! If White had played 2 d5 ! then he could still take on a7 in five moves, but Black would take longer as the moves he wants to play are illegal, for example after
THE ENDGAME 125
Rook and Pawn vs Rook This ending is sufficiently complex that your author was able write a 320- page book solely about this material balance (and even then several inter- esting positions had to be omitted!). However, many average tournament players have not studied even the fun- damentals of this ending. In fact, a few basic principles can be quite effective in improving one's rook endgame technique. If the defender's king can occupy the pawn's queening square, then the ending is almost always a draw. The only exception is when the pawn is al- ready far advanced and the defender's pieces are badly placed. The general drawing technique is quite simple and is called the 'third-rank defence'. fifth rank. Nevertheless, the position is completely drawn because Black has positioned his rook on his third rank, thereby preventing the immediate ad- vance of the white king. The only way in which White can get his king to the sixth is to play 1 e6, but then Black switches plans and plays l...Sbl, pre- paring to bombard the white king with checks from behind. Now that the pawn is on e6, there is no hiding place for the king, and after 2 f6 Sfl+ 3 e5 Sel+ 4 <Nd6 Sdl+, etc., the posi- tion is clearly drawn. If, in the diagram position, White waits with 1 Ha7 then Black does likewise by either l...Sc6 or l...Sh6. The second important principle is that of 'checking distance'. If the white king has no way to hide from a check- ing black rook, then the factor deter- mining whether the checks are a minor nuisance or a serious problem is the distance between the king and the rook. The further apart they are, the better it is for the side with the rook. Here is a typical position. White ap- pears to have made quite a lot of prog- ress. His rook is cutting the enemy king off on the back rank and his king and pawn have advanced as far as the
126 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
try 4 Hf8 (4 Ne6 Ng7! and 4 Ha5 Ng8 do not help White) intending 5 e7, followed by 6 f6. If Black keeps his rook in its current position then he will eventually lose, but Black can change direction by 4...Eal!. If White now plays a king move to free his pawn, then Black starts checking from the side. There is no shelter, so in view of the large checking distance White cannot effectively meet the barrage of checks. White can, of course, play other moves but they do not help, for example after 5 He8 (to meet 5...Sa6+ by 6 Se6) the simplest draw is to re- turn to fl with the rook. On the other hand, 2...Ne8? loses. After 3 Ha8+ <Nd7 4 Hf8, there is noth- ing Black can do to prevent White playing 5 Ng7 (or f7, if the rook leaves the f-file), followed by f6, and there is no way to stop the pawn. Black's problem is that he lacks the lateral checks which saved him after
2...Ng8. There is no space for his rook
on the kingside, and he cannot give checks from the queenside because his own king gets in the way. This principle is usually formulated as 'move the king to the short side' in order to leave the other side free for long-range rook checks, but in the end it all comes down to ensuring adequate checking distance. Here is another example (D): Black is to play, and he faces the threat of Nc4 followed by b5. If he plays l...Sh5, then White advances his pawn by 2 Na4. The only possibility The above example makes this clear. If it is White to play then he should continue 1 Ng6, which creates the most awkward problems for Black. If White waits, then Black sets up the third-rank defence by ...Eb6. 1 f6 Hb6+ leads to the same thing, while 1 f6 Sgl+ is an immediate draw (note the large checking distance). After 1 Ng6 it is easy for Black to go wrong, for example the passive line l...Sb8 2 f6 *g8 fails to 3 Hg7+ <Nf8 (or 3... h8 4 Hh7+ *g8 5 f7+) 4 Sh7 and White's plan of 'switching to the other side' leaves Black defenceless. Note that this line would be a draw if White's pawn were on g6 and his king on h6, because there would be no room to switch to the other side. This leads us to the important conclusion that in the type of position in which Black has been forced to defend pas- sively with his rook on the first rank, the result is a draw with an a-, b-, g- or h-pawn, but lost with a pawn on one of the other four files. Here we have an f-pawn so this de- fensive plan is not good enough for Black. Instead, he should play l...Efl. This ensures that after 2 Ha8+ Ne7 White cannot play 3 f6+. White can only make progress by playing 2 Nf6, which threatens mate. Black has to choose between 2...<S>e8 and 2...<Bg8. One move loses and the other draws. The correct choice depends on en- suring that Black has sufficient check- ing distance in the subsequent play. After 2...Ng8! 3 Ea8+ h7 White can

We already saw in the analysis on page 126 how the defender must be prepared to use his rook flexibly and operate from different directions ac- cording to changing circumstances. Here is another, very important, exam- ple of this: to defend is to retreat the rook along the b-file, so then when the white king moves to a4 or c4, Black can start checking. In order for this to work, Black needs to have the maximum possible checking distance and in fact l...Sb8! is the only move to draw. Af- ter 2 Sd4 (2 *c4 Hc8+ 3 *b5 Sb8+

It follows that Black's king is trapped in an invisible box on the kingside, consisting of the marked squares in the above diagram (plus g7, the square the king is currently stand- ing on). Black can only use his rook to defend, and he must counter White's threat of playing his king over to de- fend the pawn, releasing his rook and clearing the way for the pawn.

White cannot make progress. If White plays a7 at any stage, Black replies ...Sa6 followed by ...Sal, and if the white king then approaches the pawn, Black draws by checking the king from behind (the nook on a7 is no longer available). This double change of di- rection (al to f6 and then back to al) is quite hard to see, and in fact it was not discovered until 1924 by Vancura. Several years ago I was asked to check some rook ending analysis, but I couldn't understand any of it - White, who had the advantage, seemed to be forcing Black to reach a drawn posi- tion, which Black then avoided! Fi- nally, I looked at the date of the analysis -1912 - and realized that be- cause the Vancura draw wasn't known at that time, all positions of the type shown in the previous diagram were thought to be winning for White. Not surprisingly, this led to some odd moves. I should add that if White's king is nearer to the a-pawn in the above The extra Pawn One of the most common endgame situations in practical play is a rook and pawn ending with an extra pawn on one side of the board, and the posi- tion otherwise symmetrical. Here is a typical situation: An ability to win positions such as this is fundamental to successful chess. White may have won a pawn with a combination, or perhaps Black had an isolated e-pawn which White picked up with subtle strategic play - what- ever your chess style, situations in which you win a pawn for essentially no compensation are very common. The question then arises: how often do you convert the resulting positions into a full point?
THE ENDGAME 129
I showed this position to some of the world's leading grandmasters, in- cluding Karpov, Kramnik and Anders- son, and asked them to estimate their winning chances as White, assuming an opponent of equal strength. The an- swers were all in the range 80-90%. The general feeling was that such a po- sition should objectively be a win, and the 'missing' 10-20% represented the probability of making a mistake one- self rather than the probability of run- ning into exceptionally good defence. A search of 500,000 games re- vealed 94 clear-cut examples of this type of structure (3 vs 3 on one side, 3 vs 2 on the other, no doubled pawns and pawns not blocked). The result was 72 wins, 19 draws and 3 losses(I). The 77% success rate was slightly lower than the GMs thought, but at their level technique is better and so, assuming that the position is objec- tively won, they would be more likely to round up the point. They probably also wouldn't lose a rook ending with a clear extra pawn! Unfortunately, such situations are poorly covered in endgame theory books, which tend to concentrate on more simplified positions. While they devote a lot of attention to the situation with 3 vs 3 on one side and an outside passed pawn on the other wing, the situation in which there is a majority rather than a passed pawn is hardly covered at all. The massive Encyclo- paedia of Chess Endings, with 1727 positions, doesn't contain anything like it, nor do standard works on the endgame such as Levenfish and Smys- lov's famous Rook Endings. Fine's old Basic Chess Endings contains perhaps the most helpful ad- vice. He recommended that if the de- fender's king is on the side where the pawns are balanced then you should adopt the following plan: 1) place the king and rook on the best possible squares; 2) advance the pawns on the other wing as far as convenient, without ac- tually setting up a passed pawn; 3) transpose to a won ending with an outside passed pawn. What he means is that you should not necessarily create the passed pawn as quickly as possible, as some posi- tions with an extra outside passed pawn are drawn. Instead, you should continue to manoeuvre until the passed pawn can be created under favourable circumstances, for example with your rook behind it. If the defender's king is on the side with the potential passed pawn, then the decisive manoeuvre is the penetra- tion of the attacking king on the oppo- site wing. Having played over all the 94 ex- amples mentioned above, I failed to find any clear-cut examples of this winning plan. Either the ending was misplayed by one side or the other, or the defender seemed to assume that he would lose in the long run and em- barked on a desperate bid for counter- play. Thus readers will have to make

do with Nunn vs Fritz5 from the dia- gram on page 128: 1 h4 We are in the second of Fine's cases mentioned above, so White's long- term aim will be to penetrate amongst the queenside pawns with his king. However, at the moment this pawn structure offers no avenues of approach for the king, so White must find a way to induce the pawns to advance. One plan would be to play &el and then at- tack the pawns by Se3-a3, etc., forc- ing them to move forwards. Then White could play Sd3 and Nd2, cross the d-file with his king and then try to get amongst the pawns. Perhaps this plan is the most sys- tematic, but I decided on another idea, that of advancing the kingside pawns. If Black remains passive, White will gain a great deal of space on the king- side and should eventually be able to create a passed pawn there under fa- vourable circumstances. If Black tries to generate counterplay by advancing his queenside pawns, then White will again have the possibility of switching his king to the other side of the board. I...b5 1 doubt that a human would defend in such forthright style! Fritz decides to gain space on the queenside, but it is creating precisely the sort of openings that will help White later on.
2 g4 a5 3 Ng3 a4 4 a3
It is a good idea not to let the queen- side pawns advance too far. Later on the black rook may switch behind the pawns, and this could prove very awk- ward if Black has pawns on a4 and b4. Now that Black has advanced a pawn to a4, White can conveniently halt the pawns by a3 and c3, which also makes his queenside safe against an attack by Black's rook.

In rook endings it is quite often a good idea to have such a chain of pawns. If the white rook defends the base of the chain, then all the pawns are secure against enemy rook attack.

It is possible to set up simplified, idealized positions and play them out against the computer. The best method is to play the same position several times for both col- ours, trying different ideas to see what works and what doesn't. This kind of experience cannot be gained in over- the-board play. We will return to this subject in Chapter 5. Many endings with an extra pawn eventually reduce to the situation in which the pawns are equal on one side and one player has an outside passed pawn on the opposite wing. The re- mainder of the section deals with this common occurrence. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that White possesses an extra pawn on the queen- side. White's rook will need to defend the pawn, and there are three possible positions for the rook: behind the pawn, to the side of the pawn, and in front of the pawn. This list is arranged in descending order of desirability from White's point of view. The situation in which White's rook is behind the pawn is a familiar one. plan, but White loses nothing by try- ing it before considering other ideas.

132 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
The pawn is continually threatening to advance, so Black has to block the pawn with his rook. Not only does the rook become tied down, but Black is left open to the possibility of zugzwang. The classic example of this situation is also one of the best: situation is just as if he had lost the op- position in a king and pawn ending. After ...Nd5, White plays b4 and supports his pawn with the king; after ... b5, White can head for the king- side pawns with his king. Black can only avoid these lines by playing pawn moves on the kingside, but White can always move his rook up and down, so that Black is sure to fall into zugzwang sooner or later.

Now the king heads for the vulner- able enemy pawns. Black's king is too far away to prevent this, so Capa- blanca decides to use his king to blockade the a-pawn and his rook to fight against the penetration of the white king. This is indeed the best de- fence, but however Black plays he cannot overcome the fatal handicap of having one or other of his pieces fully occupied blockading the a-pawn.

As with any pro- posed rule, there are exceptions (for example, a position with rook on al and pawn on a2 against rook on a3 would be far less favourable!), but in normal situations such positions are extremely favourable for White. The further away from the kingside the pawn is, the better for White, but even with a c-pawn his winning prospects would be good. When the rook defends the pawn from the side (we will assume the rook is to the right of the pawn), Black will place his rook behind the pawn. Then much depends on the kingside pawn structure. The white rook is vulner- able to attack by Black's king, and the best situation arises when the rook can occupy an invulnerable square on the kingside where it is defended by a pawn. The alternative is to defend the f7- pawn along the second rank by 66...Se7 67 *g7 Sd7 68 *f6 2c7, but White wins after 69 2e2 <Nxa5 70 Se7 Sc2 71 2xf7 2xf2+ 72 *xg6 Sg2 73 2f3. 67 f4?I By exposing the pawn on g3, Ale- khine makes the win more difficult.

The final case, when the white rook is in front of the pawn, offers the few- est winning chances. Indeed, most po- sitions are drawn. Even in the most favourable case (that of a b-pawn) it is unclear whether White can win unless he has an additional advantage, such as a weak enemy pawn structure on the kingside. B. Spassky - Zhu Chen Veterans vs Women, Copenhagen 1997 Here White has an ideal position on the kingside. His rook can settle at f5, creating a cosy little cluster of pieces defending each other. Black can only break this up by playing ...h5 at a mo- ment when both her rook is attacking the pawn on f3 and the white king is not defending it. However, it turns out that this possibility is of little value to Black. White can win by simply playing his king to cl. If the black rook stays on the second rank, White pushes the b-pawn. Otherwise the king has to be released and it can then advance.

THE ENDGAME 135
The situation with an extra pawn and all the pawns on the same side also occurs quite often in practice. Here is a typical position: Endings with 3 vs 2 (and no passed pawns) on one side are also drawn; again the same principles apply. If you remove the pawns on e3 and f7 from the above diagram, Black's safest first move is again l...h5!. White to play could try 1 g4, but here his winning chances would only be very small. Positional advantage We have already mentioned that piece activity is extremely important in rook and pawn endings (see page 92). A rook on the seventh usually ties the opponent's pieces down to defensive positions, while a king penetrating into the opposing pawn-mass can make mincemeat of them. Another point is that a passive rook is very often per- manently passive. Here is an example, taken from Levenfish and Smyslov's classic book Rook Endings. Black's ideal defensive pawn struc- ture is f7-g6-h5. White's only chance is ultimately to create a passed pawn, and this pawn formation means that White can only make one at the cost of several pawn exchanges. First he must play g4, when Black can swap his fa- pawn. Then White will aim for f5, but another pair of pawns disappears. It follows that once Black has achieved this optimal set-up, White's winning chances are minimal. Thus if Black is to play in the diagram, l...h5! is the right move. If White moves first, then of course he plays 1 g4!. While the resulting po- sition is still theoretically drawn, there is no doubt that in practice Black's task is rather difficult. Black cannot prevent White from gaining a lot of space on the kingside (Ng2-g3, h4-h5, etc.) and his defence is not easy. St Petersburg - London Telegraph match, 1886-7

If White plays a7 at any stage, then there is no shelter for White's king on the queen- side. However, if the pawn stays on a6 then Black can safely take the g4- pawn and return to a4. At this point London conceded the game. Chigorin gave analysis indicat- ing that White could win and the posi- tion has been subject to considerable debate ever since. Levenfish and Smys- lov gave the verdict that Black could draw, but only with very precise play. The white rook can range freely across the fifth rank, while Black's is restricted to just three squares. First of all, defending passively is no good. White can move his king towards the vulnerable a-pawn and the defence eventually breaks down: l...Sa7 2 e4 Sa6 3 4>d4 Ba7 4 f4 Sa6 (or 4...Nd6 5 Sb6+ *e7 6 *c5 Sc7+ 7 <Nb5 Scl 8 g5 f5 9 Bxg6 Sfl 10 *xa5 Bxf4 11 Sf6 Sfl 12 *b6 f4 13 a5 Sgl 14 Bxf4 Bxg5 15 a6 Bg6+ 16 *b7 Sgl 17 Bb4 and wins) 5 Bb7+ Nd6 6 f5 gxf5 7 gxf5 Ba8 8 Bb6+ *e7 9 *c5 Sd8 10 Bb5 and White wins the a-pawn while retaining both his pawns. With his pieces so actively placed, this means a sure win. Very often in such situations, it is better to jettison the weak pawn and try to activate the rook, and here this plan just about draws for Black. Note that Black must not delay; if he allows White's pieces to become any more active before giving up the pawn, then the game will be past saving. The best line is l...Bc6! 2 Sxa5 Sc4+ 3 *e3 &f 7!

of a well-thought-out plan for putting White's central pawn majority to use. The obvious plan is to play e4 at some stage, but for this White needs the sup- port of the king (note that the rook should stay on the c-file to prevent ...c5). White could try e3, Ne2-d3 and then e4, but Black could counter this plan by playing ...f5 at some point. The move played not only makes it much harder for Black to play ...f5, but also opens up a second possibility for activating the white king, based on Sc2 and Ng3-f4.

After 25...f5 26 gxf5 gxf5 27 *g3, followed by f4, White ties Black down to the defence of f5, and then plays e3 and Sg2, when his rook can penetrate along the g-file. 26*g3g5 This is Black's counter-plan.

Now move the pawn to b6 and the knight to b7. Black to plays wins by
1...?)a5, because the white king takes
far too long to make it round to attack the knight (note that even 1 Nd6 is im- possible because of l... c4+). How- ever, White's loss here was due to the poor initial position of his king on c7. If the king starts on c6, then the posi- tion is a draw since l... a5+ 2 Nb5 and 1...£ki8+ 2 Nd7 both lead to repe- titions. With the pawn on b5 and knight on b6, it doesn't matter where the white king is; Black always wins since he can generate an unlimited supply of tempi. If White attacks the knight by 1 Nc6, then l...Na4 wins as before, while 1 c5 is met by l...Nc8, and 2 <Nc6 fails to 2...?)a7+. With a c-pawn, Black wins even with the pawn on the seventh rank. If Black's knight is on c8, he can meet Nd7 by ...?)a7 and Nb7 by ...£te7, Here is a common situation - the knight is single-handedly holding back a passed pawn. There are three possible outcomes to such a struggle: either the knight loses the battle against the white king and pawn, and the pawn pro- motes. Then White wins. Alternatively, the white king cannot achieve more than a perpetual attack on the knight; then the result is a draw. Finally, it may be that the knight can not only restrain the pawn, but can do so while provid- ing a continuous supply of spare tempi. Then Black has time to advance his fa- pawn and win. The diagram position is a draw. The knight can prevent the pawn's promo- tion but without providing any spare tempi: 1 *b7 Nb5 2 *b6 Nd6! 3 *c6 c8 4 <Nc7 Na7 and so on.

Moving on to knight vs knight end- ings, the most important point to note is the devastating effect of an outside passed pawn. The knight is such a short-range piece that if it is prevent- ing the advance of a passed pawn on the queenside, then it cannot exert any influence on the kingside. Thus the side with the outside passed pawn will be effectively a piece up on the other side of the board. Knights are particu- larly ineffective against rook's pawns: S. Dolmatov - A. Beliavsky USSR Championship, Odessa 1989 Here Black is fighting against two rook's pawns. Despite material equal- ity and the small number of pawns, White has a winning position.

Bishop vs Knight endings S. Flohr - J. Capablanca Moscow 1935 The relative value of the bishop and the knight is a familiar topic in every phase of the game, and the basic prin- ciples are the same in an ending. On average, a bishop is worth a lit- tle more than a knight. A bishop is at its best in an open position with a fluid pawn structure. Pawns fixed on the same colour as the squares on which the bishop moves are an obstruction; the more such pawns exist, the more restricted the bishop is and the weaker the squares of the opposite colour. Knights favour blocked pawn struc- tures and like stable, invulnerable squares on which they can settle with- out being disturbed by enemy pawns. A typical such situation arises when a knight occupies the square in front of an isolated pawn, as in the following diagram. We will not discuss this very com- plicated endgame in detail here. Capa- blanca, who was one of the greatest endgame players of all time, just about managed to save the game, but I would doubt my ability to do likewise! He adopted what is undoubtedly the cor- rect plan, namely to avoid allowing any more pawns to be fixed on light squares. He therefore played ...b6, ...a5, ..Bd7 and ...f6, and waited to see if White could make progress. It is worth noting that if Black had a dark-squared bishop, then the position would be a comfortable draw. If, on the other hand, Black had a further pawn weakness, for example the pawn on b7 were on b5 (so that White could fix the queenside pawns by playing b4), then he would be lost. It is worth adding one point which applies particularly to the endgame. Bishops prefer positions with unbal- anced pawn structures. If both sides create a passed pawn, a bishop can sup- port the friendly passed pawn while at the same time holding up the enemy

Knights, being short- range pieces, have to be committed to one or the other task. Players often underestimate the ad- vantage which is conferred by having a bishop against a knight, even in posi- tions with symmetrical pawn struc- tures. Z. Ilincic - G. Cabrilo Cetinje 1992 I suspect that many players would abandon the position as a draw, but in the game White won. Ilindid anno- tated his game in both Informator and the Encyclopaedia of Chess Endings, claiming that the diagram position is actually winning for White. As we shall see, this claim is rather far- fetched, but it is true that White's ad- vantage is sufficient to justify playing on.

Bishop endings Considering the case of same-coloured bishops first, the outside passed pawn is again a very powerful force, even if not quite so effective as in knight end- ings. I would therefore normally ex- pect endings with 3 vs 3 on one side and an extra outside passed pawn on the other side to be winning, although if the passed pawn is not too far away

from the remaining pawns there is a small chance of a blockade. With all the pawns on the same side, a 3 vs 2 or 4 vs 3 ending with fluid pawns should normally be a draw. Since bishops are heavily influenced by fixed pawns, one of the most im- portant questions is how many pawns are fixed on the same-coloured squares as one's bishop. The more there are, the worse it is, all the more so in that the opponent's bishop will automati- cally be a 'good' bishop. Two pawns fixed on the same colour as one's bishop may be a fatal weakness, espe- cially if they can both be attacked si- multaneously by the opposing bishop. This completely immobilizes one's own bishop, and zugzwang may not be far away. passed pawns are better than passed pawns with only one file between them, but two widely-separated passed pawns are best of all. 3) If you are trying to draw an opposite-coloured bishop ending, then it is better to have your pawns on the same-coloured squares as your bishop. This is practically the only type of po- sition in which this reversal of the nor- mal principle applies. The reason is that your drawing chances depend on setting up an unbreakable fortress. Everything has to be defended, and a pawn which is capable of being at- tacked by the enemy bishop will just drop off. Here are a couple of examples illus- trating these principles: Opposite-coloured bishop endings are often quite tricky because many of the principles that apply in a wide range of endings break down in this case. Here are some of the main differ- ences: 1) Material advantage is less im- portant than usual. Endings with one extra pawn are usually drawn. Even two extra pawns may not be sufficient to win. For this reason reduction to an opposite-coloured bishop ending is often a useful drawing resource in a desperate situation. 2) What is important is the ability to create passed pawns. If you can cre- ate two passed pawns, then you have good winning chances. Connected Y. Piskov - J. Nunn Bundesliga 1992 Black is in a difficult position be- cause his king is more exposed. While there are still heavy pieces on the

Threatening to win a pawn by means of ..Bd3 followed by ..Bc4. 43 a3 White has two extra connected passed pawns, and if he could support them with his king then he would be winning. However, his king is too far away and by attacking the pawns with his bishop, Black can force them to ad- vance to dark squares, when it is easy to blockade them. The defender must keep his pawns on the same-coloured squares as his bishop, but the opposite holds true for the attacker. He must try to avoid the blockade of the pawns, and so they should occupy squares of the opposite colour to his bishop. This usually means that they must be de- fended by the king.

Black defended the g-pawn in the only way possible, by heading for h4. L.JLel At first sight this is a dead draw. If White's king attacks the g5-pawn, then Black plays ...Bh4 and waits with his king, while if White's king approaches the c-pawn, then Black's bishop is freed and so he can just keep his king on c7. This is in accordance with the principle that you need two
146 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
passed pawns to have a chance of win- ning an opposite-coloured bishop end- ing. 2 *f6! White's plan is to force the bishop to h4 and then play g3. If Black replies ..Bxg3, White continues xgS and has his second passed pawn. If Black replies ...fxg3, White plays Bg2 and the black bishop is imprisoned. When the white king approaches the c-pawn, Black will be forced to release his bishop by ...g4, again giving White another passed pawn. However, this plan must be imple- mented accurately. After 2 Nf5 Bh4 3 g3 fxg3 4 Bg2 Nd6 White experi- ences certain difficulties. He cannot move his king to f6 or e4 and after 5 4g4 <Nc7 he is not making progress. In fact, this is very much like a king and pawn ending, since both sides can only move their kings (if White moves his bishop, then ...g2 draws at once). White can try to exploit the fact that d7 is not available for Black's king by 5 Ng6 e6 6 h7, but his subtlety is to no avail: after 6...&C7 7 Ng7 e8 White cannot 'by-pass' by 8 f6.

Otherwise the king reaches d6 and that would really be Black's last chance to play ...g4 before White promotes his pawn. 7 hxg4 White wins easily by supporting the passed g-pawn with his king. It is worth noting that Black only loses in the diagram as he cannot de- fend the g5-pawn from d8 or e7. If his king were on the apparently inferior square b8, then l..Ba5 would draw. I must emphasize that the special principles mentioned above apply only to pure opposite-coloured bishop situations. As soon as extra pieces are added to the equation, normal service is resumed. Many players assume that endings with rooks and opposite- coloured bishops are almost as drawn as pure opposite-bishop positions, but this is not so. An extra pawn in an end- ing with rooks and opposite-coloured bishops normally confers good win- ning chances; adding a pair of knights is similar. If even more pieces are added then the attacking potential of opposite-coloured bishops starts to come into play, and then one cannot talk about a drawish influence at all. Queen endings Queen and Pawn vs Queen Of all the fundamental endings with piece 4- pawn vs piece, this is the second most common in practice (the most common being rook and pawn vs rook). It is also by far the most compli- cated, so much so that it has proved too daunting for the majority of authors and very little has been written about it. Before the advent of the computer database, Averbakh provided the best coverage. However, the complexity of the ending was only emphasized by the fact that his seventy pages of analysis dealt almost exclusively with certain simple cases of the pawn on the seventh rank. Now that the oracle of a perfect da- tabase has been constructed, one would have expected someone to provide a far more detailed explanation of the principles behind the ending. How- ever, the database has revealed that Averbakh's efforts only scratched the veneer of this ending and most of the real work remains to be done. I suppose I could stop here with the comment 'nobody understands W+A vs W', but this does seem a little cow- ardly. The first point to make is that if the defending king is in front of the pawn then the position is almost always drawn. There are exceptions in which a winning exchange of queens can be forced, but they are very few indeed. Thus the only interesting case is when the defending king cannot move in front of the pawn. Dealing firstly with the a-pawn, this not surprisingly offers the fewest winning chances of any pawn. The diagram below shows a
148 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
typical situation with the pawn on the sixth. optimally over the board? Our objec- tive is only to establish some general principles helpful in practical play and for this the 50-move rule is not espe- cially relevant. This diagram already reveals many of the important principles governing Q+A vs W. We can ignore the 'special case' squares a7 and a8, which are only marked because White to play can mate in one. There are basically two drawing zones. One lies near to the pawn and these squares are drawn because with the enemy king so close to the pawn, Black can very often ex- change queens and catch the pawn with his king. Virtually all W+A vs W posi- tions (except those with the pawn on the seventh) have such a zone, which we call the proximity zone. When the black king lies in the proximity zone, White is restricted in his attempts to avoid perpetual check, as he can only interpose his queen in favourable cir- cumstances. There is a popular myth that when defending W+ A vs it is always best to have your king as far away from the pawn as possible; as we shall see, this is true only in certain circumstances. The second drawing zone is in the lower right-hand corner, i.e. diago- nally opposite the pawn. White's main weapon in preventing perpetual check is to interpose his queen in such a way as to force the exchange of queens, ei- ther by checking or by pinning the en- emy queen. When the black king is poorly placed, for example on f7, then We will display several diagrams of this type, the aim being to convey a great deal of information in a visual form. The various stars indicate the re- sult when the black king stands on that square. A white star indicates that the position is a win with White to move, but a draw with Black to move. A black star indicates that it is a win whoever moves first. Unmarked squares are drawn whoever moves first. In the case of squares that are under attack by White, then the position is only legal with Black to move and a black star indicates that it is a win; no star indicates that it is drawn. A few positions are illegal because the kings stand next to each other; these are also unmarked. Readers should note that we take no account of the 50-move rule in our dis- cussion. With optimal play, some of the positions are drawn only because of this rule, but who is going to play
THE ENDGAME 149
1...4g3! (although it would be amaz-
ing if anyone realized over the board that 1...4*h3? is losing). If the king starts on e4, there is a choice between
1...4d5 and 1...4f3, but I would al-
ways go for the proximity zone if pos- sible, as the draw is far simpler. Summing up, the proximity zone is the best location for the black king, then the bottom-right corner, then the bottom-left corner. The top right cor- ner is by far the worst. If we move the pawn back to a5, the drawing zones expand enormously: there are many chances to achieve this and Black's options are consequently restricted. White can set up a position with his king on b7 and queen on c6. Then l...Qe7+ is answered by 2 Rc7, l...Rb4+ 2 4*c8 Qf8+ 3 4c7 ends the checks, I..>b3+2*c8 and l..>bl+ 2 4*a8 likewise. The toughest check to meet is 1...18132+, but even in this case White can manoeuvre so as eventually to force Black to give one of the infe- rior checks mentioned above. In the end Black's checks dry up, and White can push his pawn. This problem af- flicts Black whenever his king is in the top right-hand corner. The lower left- hand corner is also not ideal, but this largely depends on Black's queen po- sition. If Black can occupy a good square with his queen, then this is suf- ficient to draw. The bottom right-hand comer is the best of the distant areas; White has very few chances to inter- pose with check and so Black has few problems drawing. While much of the play is governed by general principles, there are a few anomalies. The isolated loss with the black king on h3 (when 1 Qd4 ! is the only winning move) is hard to explain, as is the loss with Black to move when his king is on c2. The point about the two drawing zones is emphasized if we imagine the black king starting somewhere on Black's fifth rank. With the king on d4, the only drawing move is 1...4>d5!, entering the proximity zone. When the king is on h4, the only move is The lower-left squares are marked only because White has the possibility of Qa3+, forcing an immediate ex- change of queens, so we can fairly say that Black is only in danger if his king is in the upper-right comer. We can summarize by saying that with an a-pawn, the pawn needs to be on at least the sixth rank in order to have decent winning chances. Not surprisingly, the b-pawn offers far more winning chances. There are
150 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
two main reasons. First of all, the white king has the squares on the a-file to aid him in his efforts to avoid per- petual check. Secondly, an exchange of queens is much less likely to lead to a draw, even when Black's king is quite close to the pawn, so the proximity zone is much reduced in size. Here is a typical case with the pawn on b6 (D): king on certain d-file squares, but only if it is his turn to move, and even then the draw requires great accuracy. With the king on d8, Black's unique drawing move is l...Qgl!, with the king on d7 again there is only one move, 1...Qhl !, and with the king on d6, 1...Qd5! is the only saving possi- bility. The drawing zone in the bottom- right corner is relatively large, and it is clear that against a b-pawn, if you can- not bring your king in front of the pawn, then this is the area to head for. We do not give the details in the case of the pawn on b4; the situation is somewhat similar to that of the pawn on a5, i.e. White can only win if the black king is near to the top-right cor- ner. To summarize, with a b-pawn the pawn should be on at least the fifth rank to provide good winning chances. The c-pawn provides the greatest winning chances of any pawn. One reason is that the drawing zone in the bottom-right corner disappears when We can see how vastly different this situation is. If White is to move then he wins no matter where Black's king is located. With Black to play there is a small drawing zone in front of the pawn, and a slightly larger one in the bottom right-hand corner. With the pawn on b5 White's win- ning chances are of course less than with the pawn on b6, but still greater than with the pawn on a6 (D): Here we see the familiar pattern emerging, but with some differences. The proximity zone is much smaller than with the a-pawn; it includes all the squares in front of the pawn, but little else. Black can draw with his
THE ENDGAME 151
the pawn is on at least the fourth rank, so in this case Black is left only with the proximity zone. The situation with the pawn on c6 needs no diagram, because Black is losing except if his king is in front of the pawn. When the pawn is on c5, the drawing chances are still very slim, except if the king is in front of the pawn: It follows that if you have various methods of liquidating to W+A vs If, the c-pawn is the one to go for. The de- fender's only chance is to bring his king near to the pawn, but even with the pawn as far back as the fourth rank there are still good winning chances. Central pawns offer significantly fewer chances than with the c-pawn. Once again, there is no distant draw- ing zone and the defender should have his king somewhere near the enemy pawn. Here are two typical diagrams: Even with a pawn on c4, White's winning prospects are surprisingly good:
152 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
Qb3-c3-c5 and drive the enemy queen away. The pawn can then be advanced and, if necessary, the manoeuvre can be repeated all the way down the board. This would be the winning tech- nique in the case that the kings are on the kingside and White's king is safe from perpetual check. Note that we are assuming that Black cannot ex- change queens. This is normally a safe assumption, but there might be cases in which Black could swap on c5, take the c-pawn with his king and return to the kingside in time to save the game. In that case White might do better to play Qb3-a3-a5 in order to advance the pawn. The problem with this is that it badly decentralizes the white queen, and while the queen is away, Black's own queen can take up an ac- tive post, increasing his chances of perpetual check. If the white king is not safe from perpetual check, then the win is much more complicated, if indeed it is pos- sible at all. The plan is again to try to push the pawn using the above ma- noeuvre, and when the black queen starts checking, the white king will run to the queenside, where his pawn and queen stand ready to provide shel- ter. It is important to bear in mind that a barrage of random checks from the enemy queen very rarely amounts to a perpetual, provided that one's own queen occupies a central position and there is at least one pawn for shelter. Therefore White should have no In the second diagram the drawing zone has expanded considerably and encompasses quite a large part of the board. The square a4 is rather anoma- lous (White to play wins only with 1 *c5!). Just as with the c-pawn, the defend- ing king should be as near to the pawn as possible. It is worth noting that it is much better for the defender to have his king on the short side of the pawn than the long side. The extra Pawn Just as in the case of rook endings, queen endings with an extra outside passed pawn are relatively common. It is hard to say whether the winning chances are greater or less than in the case of rooks. Objectively speaking, I suspect that they should be greater, but there are far more chances for things to go wrong with queens on the board! The main danger is that of perpetual check, so king safety is an important factor. Unlike the corresponding situation with a rook, a queen is capable of shepherding a pawn to the promotion square all on its own. Suppose, for ex- ample, White has a passed pawn on b4 supported by a queen on bl, and that Black has blockaded the pawn with his queen on b5. If the queens were re- placed by rooks, then the pawn could not advance without either zugzwang or the approach of White's king. With queens, however, White can continue

An ending with 4 vs 3 offers fair winning chances, and even 3 vs 2 is sometimes won in practice, although I have no doubt that theoreti- cally it should be a draw. Common endings without Pawns Rook vs minor piece The ending rook vs bishop (without pawns) arises occasionally. There are three important things to know about this ending. First of all, in a general initial position this ending is totally drawn. Secondly, if the defender's king is trapped in the corner then he can draw if his bishop moves on squares of opposite colour to the cor- ner square; otherwise it is lost. The reason is quite simple (D). Here White can try 1 Sa8+, but af- ter 1..Bg8 he must lift the stalemate. This involves either letting the black king out of the corner, or unpinning the bishop. The only other reasonable winning attempt is 1 Sh7+ Ng8 2 Sb7, attacking the bishop and threat- ening mate on b8, but Black has the saving move 2..Bc2+. However, it is worth noting that after 1 Ha8+ Bg8 2 Sa7, for example, 2...Be6? would allow 3 Hh7+ Ng8 4 He7 and White wins (checking distance again). If we move the bishop from b3 to b4, then White wins even if Black moves first, for example l."Ng8 2 Sa8+ Bf8 3 Sb8 and mate next move. The third important point is the fol- lowing position. In this case Black's king is near the 'wrong' comer and in fact the position is lost whoever moves first. The im- portant point is that the result is the
156 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
same no matter where Black's bishop is positioned, so long as it is on a dark square. The winning method runs 1 Hfl Bh2 (l...Ah4 2 Hf3 Nd8 3 Sf4 forces the bishop to a bad square, winning af- ter 3...Ae7 4 Sa4 or 3...Nb6 4 Sb4 Bc7 5 Sc4) 2 Hf2 Ng3 (Black tries to keep the bishop sheltered behind the white king for as long as possible;
2...JLgl 3 Hg2 also drives the bishop
out) 3 Hg2 Bd6 (3...M4 and 3...Nf4 are impossible because White wins the bishop with a discovered check) 4 Hd2 Be7 5 Ha2 and again White wins the bishop. Rook vs knight is another ending which occasionally arises in practice. It can even result from some endings of rook vs pawn in which the pawn has to underpromote to avoid mate. While the details of the ending are signifi- cantly more complicated than with rook vs bishop, the one basic principle is clear enough: if the king and knight are not separated, then this ending is almost always a draw. Even if the de- fending king is on the edge of the board (this situation arises automati- cally in the underpromotion cases), then the position is usually drawn. Black's king is in a relatively unfa- vourable position near the corner of the board, but there is just enough space to hold the draw. However, ac- curate defence is required. Play might continue 1 Nf6 £}h7+ 2 Ng6 Qf8+ 3 *h6 *h8 4 Sf7 (4 Hg7 Ne6! 5 Sf7 Ng8! is also a draw) 4...<Ng8! 5 Sg7+ h8 6 Hgl (this is the key moment; Black must play carefully) and now: 1) 6...Nh7?7*g6!*g8(7... f8+

Whilst this marginal position re- quires accurate play, the general situa- tion (king and knight next to each other and away from the edge of the board) is a comfortable draw. Lost positions of the type that arise in over-the-board play generally fall into two categories. The first arises when the king and knight are next to each other, but are poorly placed. One obvious case is when Black's king is trapped in a corner. A less obvious possibility is when Black's king is on

The position with the black king on g8 and knight on g7 is one of the worst defensive formations and is quite often lost if the white king is nearby (for example, with the king on f6 and rook on al Black loses even if he moves first). The second category consists of po- sitions in which the king and knight are separated and cannot join up. Sometimes the win is quite simple, but in others subtle play is required to keep the king and knight apart while at the same time making progress. If the knight cannot be trapped directly, then it is important to keep the defender's king restricted. The attacker some- times has to use his own king for this purpose, even though it is counter- intuitive to move it away from the en- emy knight. A. Karpov - L. Ftacnik Thessaloniki Olympiad 1988

1-0 Rook and minor piece vs Rook This occurs quite often in practice. The general position is a draw, whether the minor piece is a bishop or a knight, but the practical winning chances de- pend very much on which minor piece is involved. The ending of vs S should be a simple draw as there are only a few winning positions. Almost all of these have the defending king badly placed near a corner, and nothing like this can be forced from a normal starting posi- tion. The general feeling amongst GMs has been that there is no point in carrying on this ending because there are no real winning chances. However, the following ending may cause this judgement to be modified
(D):
70 <Nh5 A perfectly reasonable move, but
70 Sf8+ W4 71 Sg8 would have been
slightly more comfortable for Black. After 71...Shl+ 72 <Ng5 Sgl+ 73 <Bh4 the result is either stalemate or the white king escapes from the edge of the board. 7O... g3+ 71 *h6 Thanks to the unfortunate position of White's rook, her king cannot es- cape from the edge: 71 Ng6 £te4+ and c4+ (alternatively, 91...<Nh6 92 Hd3 <Ng7 93 Sd4 *f7 94 *d6 *f6 95 Sf4+ Ng5 96 fib4) 92 £'f4 (keeping the black king confined is more im- portant than running after the knight)

89...Sb8+ 90 Sg8 Ne8 0-1
As 91 Sf8 Ng6 92 Sg8+ Nf7 wins. It is up to the individual whether to continue this ending, but I would only regard it as worthwhile in the case of a quick-play finish. If one is the defender, then the main advice is perfectly obvious: try to keep your king away from the edge of the board or, failing that, try to keep it away from the corner. However, even if you do find yourself in a less favour- able position, don't despair - even with the king in the corner many positions are drawn. The ending of fi+JL vs S is one of the most common pawnless endings to arise in practice. In general it should be a draw, but the defence requires considerable accuracy and grandmas- ters have been known to lose it even in the days of adjournments. There are two basic drawing techniques, and it is worth knowing both of them because the position you find yourself in may be more suited to one rather than the other. The following diagram is the basic position of the 'Cochrane Defence'. The black rook is pinning the enemy bishop and this prevents the white king approaching its counterpart. The only way to unpin is to play Nd5 or Nd3, but then the black king moves I. Rogers - M. Illescas Spanish Team Championship 1996 along the edge of the board away from the white king. Thus Black avoids the most dangerous situation, that in which White creates mating threats by hav- ing his king directly opposite Black's. 78 *d5 Of course 78 Nd3 is answered by
78...*a5.
78...*a3
It is worth pointing out that the Co- chrane Defence is most effective when the black king is near the mid-point of one edge. If, for example, the same formation were set up along the third rank, then the corresponding move would take the black king to a2, dan- gerously near the comer.

In this position White is in no posi- tion to use the Cochrane Defence. Any attempt to switch the rook behind the black king would lose, for example 87 2c8? 2b2+ 88 *fl 2f2+ 89 <&el <Nd3 would lead to a lost 'Philidor po- sition' (see the next diagram). There- fore White has to use the second of the two drawing techniques, the 'second- rank defence'. 87 2d2 The basic idea is to defend pas- sively with both king and rook on the second rank. White will just oscillate with his rook between c2 and d2 until Black undertakes positive action.
162 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
87...Bh5 88 Bc2 Bh2+ 89 <£dl
This is the first of the two main points behind the second-rank defence. Black can drive the enemy king to the edge of the board with a check, but then his own rook is attacked so he has no time to approach with his king.
89...Bhl+ 90 *e2 Bh2+ 91 <£dl
Bh3 92 *e2 Nc3 (D) position'. This winning position arises relatively often as a result of inferior defence, but it is quite tricky to win. If you don't know the correct method, it is easy to go round and round in cir- cles, until you give up in frustration. Philidor, 1749 This is the characteristic Philidor position. The kings face each other with Black's king trapped on the edge of the board, and his rook restricted to one file by mating threats.
1 Bf8+! Be8 2 Bf7!
First White improves the position of his rook with gain of tempo, and confines Black's king to the first rank. The immediate threat is 3 Ba7.
2...Be2
White can force Black's rook to c2 by playing Ba7 and this side-to-side switch, with possible checks on d7 thrown in, gives rise to so many possi- bilities that confusion is easy. What is hard to grasp is that White can only win by means of appropriate bishop This is Black's other winning at- tempt. At first it seems that White is in zugzwang as any rook move loses in- stantly (93 Bel Bh2+ 94 *dl *d3). 93 *dl! Now 93... d3 is answered by the stalemate defence 94 Bd2+ and the king has to retreat.

2... c8 loses to 3 Ha7 Sd8+ 4 Nc6
Nb8 5 Eb7+ *a8 6 Sbl *a7 7 *c7, forcing mate or win of the rook. Thus he must play his rook down the e-file, in order to meet Sa7 by a switch to the c-file. It turns out that e2 is the best square for Black's rook and e3 is the worst; el is somewhere in between. The win after 2...Se3 runs 3 Sd7+ e8 (3... c8 4 Ha7 wins at once, be- cause 4...Sb3 is impossible) 4 Sa7 Nf8

If Black plays 2...Sel, then 3 Af3 is a reflection of the position after White's fifth move in the main line. After 2...He2, White's ultimate aim is to force Black's rook to the third rank. 3Bh7 A waiting move to force Black's rook to the slightly inferior square el. After 3...Se3 White wins as in the pre- vious note.
3...Bel 4 Bb7
White's winning line only works when his rook is on f7 or b7. The side-to-side manoeuvres are typical of this ending; Black is forced to follow suit and oscillate with his own rook between el and cl, but this gives White the chance to transfer his rook from h7 to b7 with gain of tempo.

Quick-play finishes These days the normal method of fin- ishing a long game is the 'quick-play finish' in which, from a certain point on, the players have a fixed amount of time to complete the game, no matter how many moves this might take. In international competitions, the quick- play finish normally comes into effect at move 60, and players are generally given half an hour (sometimes an hour), in addition to any time they still have, to complete the game. Quick-play finishes only affect a relatively small percentage of tourna- ment games, but it is important to be aware of the impact such a finish may have on certain endgames. There are many endings in which the odds would favour a draw at a traditional time- limit, but in a quick-play finish the balance of probabilities is changed. Quick-play finishes also put a pre- mium on memorized knowledge; after the exhaustion of six hours' play, and with limited time on the clock, work- ing out a complex ending is very diffi- cult - you just have to know how to play certain positions. It should be noted that in most cases the speeding up of play will favour the side trying to win, because he can go round and round several times, each time hoping for a mistake, whereas the defender only has to go wrong once. Here is a quick round-up of the most common endings where the result might be affected: 1) Rook and bishop vs rook. The drawing techniques are fairly well- known, but to apply them in practice requires considerable thought. I would not care to defend this in a quick-play finish. 2) Rook and knight vs rook. Should be comfortably drawn at a normal time-limit, but in a quick-play finish it might be worth continuing (as Kaspa- rov showed). 3) Queen and pawn vs queen. Of course, some positions are objectively lost, but even many of the drawn posi- tions require very accurate defence. I imagine that the 'marginal' drawn po- sitions would be almost impossible to defend in a quick-play finish, and even some of the fairly comfortable draws would probably be difficult. 4) Rook and pawn vs rook. Posi- tions which are drawn by the standard 'third-rank' defence would still be drawn in quick-play. In more complex positions, there would of course be more errors, but in these endings the attacker also has to play accurately, so the accelerated tempo probably makes the task equally difficult for both play- ers.
THE ENDGAME 165
If one can liquidate to a variety of different endings, then the fact that there is a quick-play finish might af- fect one's decision as to which to aim for. If one evaluates 2+JL vs 5 as an 80% chance of a win (which seems reasonable) then one might prefer that to a line in which one has a clear positional advantage but not necessar- ily a win. It is perhaps unfortunate that modi- fications to the time-limit can cause what amounts to an alteration in the evaluation of certain endings, but that is the price one has to pay for the elimination of adjournments.
5 Using a Computer
Game databases When non-chess players think of a grandmaster making use of a com- puter, they probably think of playing programs. However, at this level the main use of a computer is to access a large database of games. There are two main uses for a data- base. For the professional, examining the games of prospective opponents is part of the job. If you are participating in a round-robin tournament, some of this may be done before the event, but in a Swiss event it can only be done when the pairings are known, which normally does not allow much time for preparation. The second use is to look at the games played in specific opening lines. If you are intending to play a particular variation in the afternoon, a quick scan of the database to see if there are any recent games is very helpful. You might get a new idea, or you might see something potentially dangerous for your opponent. For home preparation, a database is also extremely useful. Instead of searching through dozens of Informators, New in Chess Yearbooks and other standard references, you can call up all the games in a particular line with a few keystrokes. The games can then be Computers are wonderful tools. In half a century they have moved from a few specialized applications to occupy a central position in our society. Mod- ern civilisation probably could not function without them, so dependent have we become on their services. With the growth of the Internet, a fur- ther communications revolution as great as the introduction of radio and television is upon us. Computers have also had an impact on chess. Early chess computers were laughably weak but, after Deep Blue's defeat of Kasparov in 1997, nobody is laughing now. For a relatively small price, you can buy a chess program in a shop which, running on a standard PC, can defeat virtually anybody ex- cept for IMs and GMs. You can also purchase a database of up to a million games. The question arises as to how these tools can best be used for personal im- provement. The discussion that fol- lows refers to the database program ChessBase and the playing program Fritz. This is not because ChessBase have paid me a wad of money to men- tion their products, but because these are the products I am most familiar with. The discussion is as general as possible and doubtless applies to other, similar, products.
USING A COMPUTER 167
merged into a single game with varia- tions, so that you can easily see the general structure of the variation. If the database program has an interface to a playing module, then at a key- stroke you can set the computer to work analysing any given position. The range of features available is truly astounding, and these days any serious player is virtually obliged to use a database. The main features which I regard as essential for a database program are: 1) It should handle databases of up to a million games without struggling. Of course, you will need a powerful computer to handle such large data- bases, but even so operations on very large databases can be rather slow. 2) It should have facilities for en- tering both variations and text annota- tions, and manipulating these. 3) It should run under the current version of Windows. DOS is dead; forget anything running under DOS. Mac users will have to make do with what is available. 4) It should support openings keys of unlimited depth, and should have facilities for users to modify and ex- pand these. 5) The ability to merge several games into one game with variations is critical. Once you have used this feature, you will not want to do with- out it. 6) There should be an interface to a playing program, so that you just have to hit a key to see the analysis of the current position. A method of pasting this analysis into the game is highly desirable. That deals with the program, but what about the data? Nobody is going to enter a million games by hand, so one is utterly dependent on commer- cial offerings. However, here the situa- tion is much less satisfactory than with the programs. Even the best databases contain a significant number of errors. Poor-quality data is commonplace; indeed, sometimes it is so poor as to make the data practically useless. Some 'commercial' databases are lit- tle more than games collected from every available source, and just lumped together -the 'kitchen sink' approach. Typical problems are: 1) Inconsistent spelling of names. This is perhaps the most irritating. If you are considering buying a data- base, have a look to see if Korchnoi is spelt more than one way in the data- base. If it is, then just forget it. There is nothing more irritating than missing a critical game because you have failed to guess whether the player is 'Korchnoi', 'Korchnoj', 'Kortschnoi' or any of his other close relatives. The same applies to tournaments; you may find games from the same tournament described as 'Wijk aan Zee', 'Wijk', 'Hoogovens', 'WaZ', etc. 2) Duplicate games. This is often a result of problem 1. Sometimes whole tournaments are duplicated because of some minor difference in the spelling of the event name.
168 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
you may say. Well, a Trabant and a Rolls-Royce are both cars with four wheels. Unfortunately, the defects of a database are not visible by looking at the shiny surface of the CD-ROM; you actually have to use it before you spot the problems. At the end of the day much of the blame for this situation must be laid at the door of the chess players them- selves. Copying of data is common- place. Why should a company invest thousands of man-hours producing high-quality data if it is just going to be stolen (because that is what copy- ing is in this case)? Software piracy is illegal - don't do it. Once you have a database you will probably want to keep it up to date. There are various commercial services which offer regular 'top-ups' for your database. These days much of the in- formation can be downloaded from the Internet, although then you have all the problems of inconsistent names, forgetting which tournaments you have already included, etc. For really up-to-the-minute material, the Inter- net is unbeatable, but it requires con- siderable effort to keep on top of the flow of data. Unless you really need new games on a week-by-week basis, the pre-packaged commercial offer- ings are probably better. The Internet is wonderful for e-mail, news and spe- cific enquiries for which you can use a search engine. Otherwise it strikes me as being a great time-waster. 3) Incorrect results. This is one of the most common errors. When enter- ing data, most programs have a default option. If the operator forgets to enter the result, you will just get the default result - with a two-thirds chance of being wrong. You may even find com- binations of these errors, for example Korchnoi beat Bareev, but in an amaz- ingly similar game Kortschnoj lost to Barejew. 4) Incorrect moves. The above er- rors are often fairly noticeable, but in- correct moves are trickier to spot. Of course, if the error is such as to leave one player's queen en prise then you might be a bit suspicious, but if it is the wrong rook to d1, then you might never know unless you compare the game with another source. Once, when deal- ing with a collection of games that contained many errors, I came across a particularly grotesque example. I later mentioned it to the grandmaster con- cerned: "Do you know how your game was mangled in this game collection? Ac- cording to their score, your opponent could have mated in two, but instead left his queen en prise with check", I laughed. "But that really happened", he re- plied. Employing a poor-quality database causes immense frustration and waste of time; the small amount of money saved is not worth it. 'But they are both databases with the same games...',

of the 'game' and see where the stu- dent could have played better. Most players don't have a suitable opponent on hand for such exercises, but the computer can perform a similar job and can also help in the post-mortem analysis. Even though computers play endings less strongly than the middle- game, they can still be useful. As dis- cussed on page 131, if you have trouble winning rook and pawn endings with an extra pawn, play out such a position against the computer. It is a good idea to play out the same position several times, trying different plans. You will soon develop a feeling for which plans work and which are ineffective. If you experience trouble winning at all, you may get some ideas by reversing the colours! The computer does have several limitations; in the areas of positional judgement and plan-forming it is of practically no help, and long-term sac- rifices are almost always rejected by the machine. Analysing the Najdorf Poisoned Pawn with the aid of a com- puter is a futile exercise; White's com- pensation is so long-term that the computer does not see it at all, and resolutely assesses every position as winning for Black. Curiously, I find playing normal games against computers much less helpful. Computers have a particular style of play and one soon learns how to avoid their strengths and exploit their weaknesses. This knowledge is of no value against human players, Playing programs The availability of cheap but very strong playing programs for the home PC provides many new opportunities for training and self-improvement. If you already have a computer, I would strongly recommend buying such a program. The most obvious use, that of checking over one's own games, is also one of the most useful. It is amaz- ing how often a computer check re- veals missed tactical ideas. Even if nothing shattering is found, the com- puter often suggests interesting alter- native ideas which were overlooked during the game. It is important not only to play over the game itself, but the tactical lines on which your deci- sions were based. For this reason, you should only consider buying a pro- gram that supports the entry of varia- tions, and can afterwards store the games and variations in a database. You may well find a pattern in the ideas you have missed, and this will provide you with useful information about which areas of your game need special attention. Another use is to play out training positions against a computer. The fa- mous Russian trainer Mark Dvoretsky recommends the method of 'playing out' interesting positions. The idea is that if, for example, one of his students is weak in tactics, Dvoretsky would set the student to play tactical posi- tions against a strong opponent. After- wards they would go over the course

who (normally!) have a very differ- ent set of strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, it is quite easy to become depressed playing against the com- puter. All one really learns is that it is common to overlook tactical points. Playing programs are just starting to have a major impact on grandmas- ter chess. Here is one example: A. Shirov - L. van Wely Monaco Amber (rapid) 1997 Sicilian, Najdorf

f6 5 Nc3 a6 6 i.e3 e6 7 g4 h6 8 f4 b5 9 Ng2 lb7 10 g5 This move was introduced in the game Ivanchuk-Topalov, Las Palmas 1996 as an improvement over the pre- viously played 10 a3.

gained a large advantage by 19...Sh4 20 2>ce4 Sg4+ 21 2>g3 Bxg5 22 Axg5 Qxg5 23 Rxa8 M3.
15 Nxe6!!
An absolutely stunning innovation, which gives White a clear advantage in every variation. After the game Shi- rov announced that this move had not been discovered by him, but by Fritz. Sure enough, when I set up the posi- tion on my Fritz, the program found 4hxe6 in less than a minute. It is per- haps slightly surprising that Shirov used up his innovation in a rapid event, but he probably felt that since anyone with a Fritz could find this move, it would only be a matter of weeks be- fore someone else played it.

28 Hf4 is also good, but Black could
put up considerable resistance in the line was refuted by a computer, but it may be the first in which the human 'innovator' was honest enough to ad- mit it! The question naturally arises as to how many opening innovations are capable of being found by a computer. Every four months a panel of leading grandmasters votes on the most im- portant opening innovations. The re- sults are published in Informator. At the time of writing, the most recent is- sue for which the results of this vote are available is Informator 68, I set Fritz4 to work on the positions in which the top 15 novelties of Informa- tor 68 were played, to see how many the machine would find. In each case I allowed sufficient time for a complete analysis down to 11 ply (although many lines were taken far deeper, of course). The result: Fritz found 3 of the 15 innovations. Of course, there are many problems with such a test, for example some of the 'innovations' may in fact not be good, and will perhaps be refuted in the near future. Another point is that sharp, clear-cut innovations tend to head the Informator list, because a subtle finesse which can only be ap- preciated by specialists in a particular opening line will not score well in 'democratic' voting. In a couple of cases the innovation was Fritz's sec- ond choice, which would certainly alert a human operator to the fact that there was something of interest pres- ent. However, to summarize I would say that Fritz was only of value for ending.

EVERYMAN CHESS SERIES (formerly Cadogan Chess) Chief Advisor: Garry Kasparov Commissioning editor: Byron Jacobs Printed and bound in the US by Versa Press. 4 Chapter One The Importance of Strategy From the beginnings of human history, people have played games. And of all the games in the world, chess is aptly known as the Royal Game or the King of Games. Heady praise indeed! The unique beauty of chess has attracted some of the greatest minds of human history. Why? What makes chess so fascinating? Critics of the game see only grown men brooding endless hours away, sporadically pushing a few wooden pieces around a checkered board. In this critical light, why would anyone want to play chess? There must be something that makes this game so fascinating. Otherwise, how could it have survived for these many millennia? Obviously, if the critics were right, chess would not exist. Yet chess has not only survived but is doing very well. The FIDE - the Fédération Internationale des Échecs - is the third-largest sporting body in the world, representing over one hundred and sixty nations. (The largest sporting body is the IOC - the International Olympic Committee - and the second-largest is the FIFA - the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, which governs the world's most popular sport, soccer.) Why has chess survived? Things survive the test of time because they are needed. Stop and think for a moment. What is there in your life that has survived for thousands of years? Tools like the spoon have survived. They have evolved to perfectly fit a need. If there were no need for them, such tools would not exist. Games - and there are thousands, perhaps millions, of them - have been used by societies for eons as tools for physical, emotional, and mental growth. Of all these games, chess is the perfect tool for developing the mind. As Goethe said, "The game of chess is the touchstone of the intellect." At the root of chess is a battle of minds. Chess is a reflection of life, requiring a determination to compete and a desire to win. To succeed, you must become clever. Will power alone is not enough. You have to use your brain. You must think. And you must train yourself to think in different ways. When I teach young people the game of chess, I inform them and their parents that chess will teach them the five R's. I then go on to explain these: • R number 1: To play chess competitively according to the international rules of FIDE, a player must (w)rite down his moves. • R number 2: As a player continues to compete, he will experience many losses. Dissatisfied, the player will seek to sharpen his skill and stop repeating the mistakes of the past by reading books on chess. • R number 3: To get better at chess, a player must be able to keep score. He starts the game with eight pawns. As the game progresses, pieces get swapped, and pawns get pushed forward and lost. He now has two Rooks and four pawns left for a point count of 14 (5+5+4), and his opponent has a Rook, a Bishop, a Knight, and five pawns for a point count of 16 (5+3+3+5). 5 The opponent therefore has a material advantage of two. Simple. He has just used (a)rithmetic. • R number 4: The player undertakes these first three R's because it is his responsibility. No one else's. When playing chess, the player has no excuses for his blunders. A teammate didn't drop a perfect pass or miss a shot. He and only he is responsible. • R number 5: The last R is also the most important. Suppose the player's Queen is attacked. If he doesn't move it, the Queen will be captured. If he pulls it back in retreat, it will be safe. If he moves it forward, the Queen can capture a pawn and still be safe. He decides to go for the pawn, and in making his decision, he exercises his powers of reasoning. These five R's combine to produce that which all education is about: critical thinking. When you get right down to it, education has two elements: information and information processing. Information by itself is worthless. It is the critical thinking that allows us to process the information that gives the information its value. Critical thinking occurs in every game of chess, even those played by weak players who have barely learned the moves. Your hand reaches out, your eye gleams, you lift a Knight and pounce on a pawn. You are sneaky, conniving, and ruthless. The pawn is yours! But wait a moment. Your opponent has made a pact with the devil. He takes your valiant Knight. Rats! How did that happen? What should you have done instead? What should you do next? Critical thinking has occurred. Looking at chess with uninitiated eyes, what does the observer see? Two equal, opposing armies facing each other on a 64-square checkered board. What could possibly be so engrossing? And why can one player consistently beat another? One player is obviously better than the other. Given the same army as his opponent, he is outplaying him. Why? Because he is outthinking his opponent. What's his secret weapon? Strategy. What Is Strategy? Many players love quick, slash-and-burn chess games but get restless, impatient, and even frightened when matched with a thoughtful positional player. In their shortsightedness, they either don't understand why their enemy sometimes takes his time in deciding where to move, or they fear that the mental ability of this type of opponent will overwhelm them. The real problem is that they simply know nothing about chess strategy. In the following pages, I will teach you what strategy is and how to create and harness specific strategies for your own use. Once you realize how easy it is to plan and execute a strategy, you'll begin to wonder what all the fuss was about. And your chess-playing friends will come to think of you as an intellectual giant. First we need a definition. What exactly is chess strategy? Is it setting a trap, crossing our fingers, and hoping the opponent falls into it? Sorry, not even close. Is it the same as calculating all the move variations implicit in a position? Wrong again. The fact that strategy has little in common with calculation is surprising, until you consider some of the definitions of strategy that have been offered. My colleague Grandmaster Larry 6 Evans calls strategy "...a long-range master plan", while Hooper and Whyld, in the Oxford Companion to Chess, say that strategy is "...the planning and conduct of the long-term objectives in a game." Calculation, on the other hand, is a computer-like crunching of moves with no clear objective in sight. Phrases such as "long-range" and "long-term" imply in-depth analysis, but in fact, Evans, Hooper, and Whyld are alluding to positional play - the slow, systematic building up of small advantages. Perhaps the late World Champion Max Euwe put it best when he said, "Strategy requires thought; tactics requires observation." He meant that a strategic plan is created by combining positional features involving material, space, piece mobility, and pawn structure over a long span of moves, whereas a tactic is not so much a creation as an observation that can be implemented to take advantage of a short-term opportunity. An example of strategic thinking goes as follows: You realize that you can give your opponent a set of doubled pawns by trading your Bishop for his Knight. You decide that your long-term goal will be to attack and eventually win one of these newly created doubled pawns, thereby gaining a material advantage. This plan governs your following moves, because everything you do is now motivated by your intention of capturing one or both of these doubled pawns. Strategy, then, is the purposeful pursuit of a simple goal: to gain an advantage of some sort over your opponent. With some idea of the intellectual meaning of strategy, we can begin to see its usefulness. No more aimlessly charging from move to meaningless move. And no more blank staring at a board that makes no sense to us at all. Far from complicating our games, strategy actually simplifies them! The promise of simplicity has begun to call us, but how do we actually use this wonderful new tool? In the chapters that follow, I'll define and illustrate the most admired and time-tested strategic concepts - in other words, those that work! You'll see how to recognize when a particular strategy is ideal and how to implement it with a minimum of effort. All you have to do is sit at your chess board, follow along, and immerse yourself in the rewarding world of positional chess - a world where ten-move plans can be created quickly and easily when you recognize and understand the basic strategies of the game. What Is a Chess Advantage? The goal of a strategy is to gain a chess advantage. Being the proud owner of a chess advantage simply means that your position has certain positive features that your opponent's is lacking. There are two types of advantages: static and dynamic. A static advantage is a long-term one - permanent. A dynamic advantage is like a tactic - temporary. You may have a dynamic advantage because your King is safe, whereas your opponent hasn't yet castled. When your opponent castles and brings his King to safety, your dynamic advantage disappears. For this reason, it is important to take every opportunity to create static advantages. Put your faith in only those features that will be part of your position for a long time. The role of strategy is to create one or more of the following static advantages: 7 • More material (force) • Superior piece mobility • Superior pawn structure • More territory (space) • Safe King position (usually when castled) It's up to you to recognize the possibility of an advantage in a position and then come up with a plan that enables you to overcome the opposition by dint of the power the advantage gives you. Will knowledge of how to create static advantages turn you into a good player? It certainly helps, but obviously your opponent will be (or should be!) creating his own advantages. Real skill in chess comes when you can determine whose advantages are more real - which positive features will eventually rise up in triumph. For example, you may have a material advantage (say, an extra pawn), but if your opponent has superior pawn structure, extra space, and more active pieces, you will probably wish you could start the game all over again. Or you may create a material advantage by winning a piece but, in the process, weaken your King's defenses. What good is holding an extra piece if all you can do is stand by and watch yourself getting checkmated? You have misjudged the advantage of winning a piece, and in a nutshell, you've been outplayed. It is this kind of complex, intricate battle between players who are constantly trading their existing advantages for new ones that makes chess such a rewarding sport. After you read through this book, you will be able to take part in those battles armed with new knowledge and insights into chess that can help you build a reputation as a consistent winner. 8 Show in Text Mode

Chapter Two Making the Most of a Material Advantage Of all the advantages you can possess, a material advantage is by far the most powerful and the easiest to understand. A material surplus gives you options that don't normally exist, whereas a material deficit usually provokes something akin to panic. Why panic? Suppose you lose a piece right from the opening and can capture absolutely nothing in return. Can you look forward to a quiet positional middlegame? No. A material deficit in the middlegame is bad news. Even worse is a material deficit in the endgame. Any normal extension of such a game should lead to your defeat, simply because your opponent's army is bigger than yours! Eating your opponent's pieces has the obvious effect of opening up the board, and it also affects the psychological state of both you and your opponent. Small wonder that masters always prefer to play for a material advantage rather than engage in exciting but uncertain skirmishes, such as the kingside attack. In this chapter, we will explore the two most common methods of capitalizing on a material advantage: • Using your superior forces to overwhelm your opponent • Trading pieces with the express purpose of going into a winning endgame In the following discussion, I assume that you are familiar with the numeric values assigned to the pieces - pawn: 1 point; Knight: 3 points; Bishop: 3 points; Rook: 5 points; and Queen: 9 points - and that you can figure out whether you are ahead or behind at any time in the game by adding up the values of your pieces and comparing your total point count with that of your opponent. I also assume that you are familiar with the concept of development - the process of moving your pieces from their starting posts to new and more effective positions. If you need to refresh your memory about ways of winning material or ways of developing your pieces, you might want to read Chapters Two and Three of Play Winning Chess, where I expound on the principles of force (material) and time (development), two of the four principles of the Seirawan method of playing chess. Overwhelming Your Opponent It stands to reason that a group of ten well-trained warriors will defeat an equally skilled group of nine. This fact is so obvious that I have to wonder why more players don't make better use of their material. Instead, less-experienced players often win a piece during the opening and then attack madly with only two or three men, leaving the rest of their army to meditate on its fate back at home. The usual result of such folly? In a high-level tournament, any player who charged ahead in this way would be eaten alive! How can you expect to succeed by crossing the center of the board into enemy territory and attacking a force of seven or eight pieces and countless pawns with only three pieces? If you follow this simple strategy, you will find that most material advantages will resolve themselves in your favor: After winning material, don't immediately attack your opponent. Instead, quietly consolidate your position by developing all your forces and getting your King to safety. Only when everything is protected and your army is fuIly mobilized should you start marching up the board. At that point, you can afford to trade pieces because if you go into an endgame with extra wood, you will usually win. And if your opponent doesn't want to trade, your superior forces will wipe him out in different ways. In summary: Be patient and get your stuff out! Let's take a look at an example of this strategy in action. Diagram 1 shows the board after 13 moves in my 1982 game against World Champion Anatoly Karpov. I am White, and I am behind in development. However, I have a chance to win a piece. After a thorough examination of the possibilities for both sides, I decide that I can take the piece and eventually get the rest of my pieces into play. I am well aware that this is the game's critical moment. If I can grab the piece and catch up in development, I will win this game. Study the following moves to see what I did. Seirawan-Karpov London, 1982 DIAGRAM 1. White to play Seirawan-Karpov, London 1982
14.Re3!
This move takes the pressure off the e-file and attacks the Black Queen. Note that I can counter a retreat like 14...Qd8 with 15.Rxe8+ because the White Queen on a4 is also eyeing the e8- square. Black has only one way to defend against this threat by blocking the e-file.
14...Be6
Now Black's Knight on a6 is left undefended and ready to pluck.
15.Qxa6
So I now have a material advantage. The question is, "Can I get my other pieces out and shuffle my King to safety?"
15...cxd4
Black picks up a pawn, attacks my Rook, and opens up the c-file for his Rooks. The World Champion must play with energy, or else I'll succeed in consolidating my position.
16.Rb3!
I didn't fall for 16.Nxd4?? Qb4+, which loses my d4-Knight.
16...Bf5 17.Bg2
The tempting 17.Nxd4?? is still a loser because after 17...Qc5, there is no defense against the dual threats of ...Qc1 checkmate and ...Qxd4, which wins back the piece.
17...Bc2 18.Nxd4 Bxb3 19.Nxb3
By giving back a bit of material, I reduce Karpov's attacking force and make my defense easier. The material advantage of my two pieces vs. Black's Rook is still sufficient for victory if I can get my King out of the center. One of the strengths of a material advantage is that it gives you great defensive diversity; you can sacrifice some wood defensively and still come out ahead in the end. Remember this: A material advantage is a bit like ballast in a hot air balloon. If you start sinking, you can throw some of it over the side to stop your descent.
19...Rac8 20.Bf3
I defend my e2-pawn and create a hiding place for my King in the event of 20...Qb4+ 21.Kf1 followed by Kg2, which has White burrowing in on the kingside. Notice how I avoid the time- wasting 20.Bxd5? even though it grabs a pawn. I don't intend to capture anything else until I get my King to a safe place! Once that is done, I'll give my greed full rein.
20...Rc2 21.O-O
My King's safety is finally taken care of! With his majesty tucked away, it's time to launch my own threats.
21...Rxb2 22.Rd1
Stage one was winning material, and stage two was consolidation and King security. With this move, I begin stage three: attack and destroy Black's weak spots, the first of which is his d5- pawn.
22...Rd8 23.Nd4!
I centralize my Knight and threaten 24.Nc6 with a juicy fork. Note that 23...Qd7 stops Nd4-c6 but fails to 24.Qa3, when Black's b2-Rook is ensnared!
23...Rd7 24.Nc6 Qe8 25.Nxa7
My material advantage once again becomes pronounced. This meal was quite satisfying at the time, because there is nothing I like more than devouring my opponent's pieces and pawns.
25...Rc7 26.a4
After eating one of my opponents pawns, my Knight found itself out of play on the side of the board. With this move, I am protecting the b5-square and preparing for the Knight's return to the center. In so doing, I am once again sticking to the plan: Take material and then consolidate the position.
26...Qa8
Black pins my Knight, but I have prepared a trick of my own.
27.Rxd5!
Now, 27...Rxa7 28.Qd3 leaves Black without an answer to 29.Rd8+, which captures the Black Queen.
27...Qxa7 28.Rd8+ Kh7 29.Qd3+ f5
A sad necessity. If Black plays 29...g6, then 30.Qd4 carries the double threat of Qd4xb2, which wins the Rook, and Qd4-h8 checkmate. Black would be forced to give up his f-pawn by playing
30...Rb1+, which leads to 31.Kg2 f6 32.Qxf6 and a fate similar to the one that occurred in the
actual game.
30.Qxf5+ g6 31.Qe6 1-0
Black gives up because he sees that 31...h5 32.Qg8+ Kh6 33.Qh8+ creates a double attack on his King and Rook on b2, with the inevitable loss of the Rook. Note that 31...Rg7 32.Qe8 renews my threats against his King. Beating a world Champion is always exhilarating. This win was possible only because I remembered that a material surplus is one of the most important advantages you can possess and because I followed these rules:
1. After you gain material, immediately consolidate your position by developing all your pieces
and ensuring your King's safety.
2. Once you have consolidated your position, seek out new goodies to devour.
3. If you have a large material advantage, don't hesitate to give up some of your gains if doing
so will stop enemy threats while allowing you to remain equal or ahead in material. For our next example, imagine that you have the upper hand in the very one-sided position in Diagram 2. Though victory is much more likely in this game, you could still falter without a strategy to guide you. In this case, the strategy is: DIAGRAM 2. White to play Try to find a target and then build a plan around it. The target will show you where to concentrate your energies, while the plan will tell you what to do. In Diagram 2, White has an enormous material advantage. Black could quietly resign this position but nobody ever won a game by giving up, so he decides to hang on for dear life. How should White finish off his opponent? Actually, anything White does short of handing material back to Black wins. But let's put ourselves in White's shoes and attempt to beat Black in an orderly fashion. We need a target and a plan of attack. The target will show us where to concentrate our energies, and the plan will tell us what to do. In this case, we will choose the Black pawn on e6 as our target. Why this pawn? Because it cannot move. It stands to reason that it is easier to attack something if we can train our sights on it. We don't want a moving target, so the e6-pawn is an ideal candidate. One sensible first move would be 1.Bc4, which opens the b-file for White's b2-Rook and brings the Bishop's powers to bear against the e6-pawn. Black is completely helpless, so nothing he does will have much consequence. He plays 1...Rh8. Now White continues his e6-pawn assault with 2.Rf6, and Black once again moves his Rook with 2...Rd8. Notice how every White move is dictated by our chosen course of action. The goal is to win the e6-pawn, and the plan of action is to bring White's pieces to positions where they can attack this target. From the position in Diagram 2, we have seen the moves 1.Bc4 Rh8 2.Rf6 Rd8. Now how should White continue? So far, he has attacked with two pieces (the Bishop and Rook), but the enemy defenses are easily holding against this small raiding party. The key to winning this position and most others is to involve the entire White army in the assault. Suppose you are the employer of four workers, two of whom never make any effort to do their jobs. Would you tolerate this situation? No! So why would you allow any of your pieces to act in the same manner? Make them earn their keep! Applying this philosophy to our present game, White forces the lazy b2-Rook to join in the attack on the e6-pawn with 3.Rb6. Now the e6-pawn is attacked three times and defended only twice, meaning that White will win it. Note that if Black could somehow defend his pawn a third time, White would make use of his Knight (a fourth attacker!) by playing it to c5 or f4. This example shows how important it is to use your whole army instead. As a game of warfare, chess is a group activity, and each member of the group - pawns and pieces alike - must make a contribution. Throwing Away a Material Advantage Sometimes a material advantage carries with it an aura of invisibility. Lulled by a sense of secure victory, a player with a material surplus will forget the other components of the strategy that turn a material advantage into a win. Here are a couple of examples of this kind of forgetfulness. Did you notice that White's Queen is missing in Diagram 3? What's going on? The game we are about to look at was played "at odds". Today, such games are rare. They are designed to give a weak player a chance to beat someone much stronger. How do you play an odds game? You simply set up the pieces in the normal way and then take off whatever piece or pawn the stronger player (the odds-giver) offers you. In this case, the stronger player offered his Queen, and the game is said to be "at Queen odds". I can already hear you asking, "How can White hope to win without his Queen?" Against an opponent of equal ability, White would really have no hope at all. However, in this case White is William Norwood Potter, an experienced player, and he knows that his opponent, a beginner, will make mistakes. The question is: Will these mistakes be big enough to allow the Queenless Potter a chance at victory? First, I'll give you the game's moves without notes. Play through the game on your own board, and see if you can spot the mistakes for yourself.

DIAGRAM 3.
Potter-Amateur, London, 1870 Queen Odds It doesn't take a master to see that Black dies a horrible death. Why? Did you figure out his fundamental errors? Aside from the fact that he is unable to see basic threats, the main reason for his demise is that he does not develop his pieces. Let's look at the game again, this time with notes that explain the mistakes.
1.e4
White intends to develop his pieces as quickly as possible so that he can whack Black off the board before the lack of a Queen drags him into the abyss of defeat.
1...e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Nc3 Na5?
So far Black has played well. He has gained some central space (with 1...e5) and developed his two Knights. But now he suddenly stops bringing pieces out and instead begins to play with only his cavalry. If he had mobilized his whole army with 4...Bc5 followed by 5...O-O (which also moves the King to safety) and 6...d6, White would not have been able to stave off an eventual loss, and Black would have won.
5.Nxe5 Nxe4?
Black loses a pawn, but, with the advantage afforded by his Queen, this loss really doesn't mean anything at all. If he had now traded off White's attacking forces with 5...Nxc4, the game might still have been his.
6.d3
White has lost all respect for his opponent and dares Black to make a good move. The immediate 6.Bxf7+ would have been better, because now Black can still pull out White's fangs with 6...Nxc4, which ends the attack by trading off the pieces that could have done Black harm. However, Black blunders badly.
6...Nc5??
Black has moved his two Knights over and over again while the rest of his army is still sitting at home. You won't win games if you play like this! Capturing the c4-Bishop was still the correct move.
7.Bxf7+
Black failed to notice that this point was attacked twice. Now Black's King is forced into the center, where it perishes under a brutal assault.
7...Ke7 8.Bg5+
White might have been tempted to continue his attack with 8.Nd5+ using only his three developed pieces. Instead, he wisely brings a new piece into the fray. He Knows Black has made a mistake in not mobilizing his pieces, and he has no intention of repeating his opponent's errors.
8...Kd6 9.Nb5+
White's plan is to force Black to capture the Knight on e5. He reasons that since he is already a Queen down, the loss of an additional piece won't make much difference to the result. The important thing is to draw the enemy King so far forward that it drowns in deep waters.
9...Kxe5 10.f4+ Kf5 11.Nd4+
Of course, White could compensate for giving Queen odds by capturing Black's Queen, but at the moment he is hunting a larger trophy.
11...Kg4 12.h3+ Kg3 13.Ne2+ Kxg2 14.Bd5+ Ne4 15.Bxe4 Checkmate
Black got what he deserved. If you don't develop your pieces, you'll find yourself in hot water again and again. As you have seen, a lead in development can make up for a material deficit. However, if the less-developed army is able to catch up and match the opponent's development, then the material advantage will begin to assert itself. If you are ahead in material, don't simply feed on your enemy's men and forget about your own mobilization. I'll demonstrate this concept further by using another odds game. As Diagram 4 shows, White has less confidence this time (or is more in touch with reality) and gives odds of his Queen- Knight. With the Knight removed from b1, play begins.
DIAGRAM 4.
Ward-Browne, Nottingham, 1874 Queen-Knight Odds
1.e4 e5 2.f4
White immediately shows his willingness to give up more material to open lines for his pieces.
2...exf4 3.Nf3 f5?
A very poor move. Black weakens the pawn protection around his King and fails to develop a piece. Something like 3...d5 (which frees his c8-Bishop) or 3...d6 (which stops White from attacking the Knight with e4-e5) followed by 4...Nf6 would be better.
4.Bc4!
White rushes to get all his pieces out so that he can start an attack against the Black King. Further loss of material doesn't worry him because he is already so far down in force that a quiet game would only lead to his doom.
4...fxe4 5.O-O!
White begs Black to capture the Knight and at the same time develops even more of his forces.
5...exf3?
Look at the Black position. Has he developed any of his pieces? Before playing 5...exf3, he enjoyed a material advantage of a Knight and two pawns. He didn't need to take anything else! Instead of capturing his opponent's pieces, be should be getting his own pieces out and keeping the files and diagonals closed so that his King will be able to get to safety. A much saner move would be 5...d5 (which closes down the a2-g8 diagonal and frees his own light-squared Bishop) or 5...Nf6 followed by 6...d5. In either case, Black's huge material advantage would eventually triumph.
6.Qxf3 Bc5+?
A better move for Black is 6...Nf6, which develops a piece. As things stand, White is able to give up one more pawn in order to get every piece he owns into the fight.
7.d4!
Very nice. White throws this pawn away but frees his c1-Bishop with tempo. Development is now more important than simple material considerations.
7...Bxd4+ 8.Kh1 d6
Black finally gets around to moving his pieces. But because he previously ignored his development, this effort comes too late.
9.Bxf4 Nf6 10.Rae1+
Black thinks that he is two pieces and a pawn ahead. However, look at Diagram 5. DIAGRAM 5. Black to play Notice the guys sitting on a8, b8, c8, d8, and h8. What are they doing? Nothing at all! Now look at the White army. Everybody is hard at work! As a result, White has a much larger force at his disposal than Black. (In a strange way, this position actually puts White ahead in material!) Of course, if Black can get his pieces out, he will win, so White is forced to play for a quick knockout before the reinforcements arrive.
10...Kf8 11.Qd5!
White threatens checkmate on f7 and hopes that Black will fall for 11...Nxd5 12.Bxd6++ Kg8
13.Bxd5+ Be6 14.Bxe6 checkmate. This kind of tactic may seem shocking to the amateur player,
but White knows that shocking moves are the equivalent to swinging fists, and he must land a haymaker.
11...Qd7 12.Qxd4 Nc6
White gets one of his pieces back, but Black manages to develop a piece. Has White's attack fizzled out?
13.Qxf6+!!
Black's King loses its protective cover.
13...gxf6 14.Bh6+ Qg7 15.Rxf6 Checkmate
Apart from the King, every White piece participated in this checkmate. Does the fact that superior development can make up for a material deficit mean that a material advantage is not really so important? Not at all! Black would have won this game if he had been less greedy and more attentive to his development. Here's the strategy once again: When you are already way behind in material, you can happily give away more. You are already down, so you have nothing to lose! When you are ahead, though, you should refuse new gifts until your entire army is developed and your King is safe. Once you have accomplished these goals, you are free to take everything in sight.
TEST 1.
Tarrasch-Schroeder, Nuremberg 1890 Test 1. Black is a Queen up in material, but now his Queen is under attack. It's his move. How should he deal with this problem? Show/Hide Solution Test 1: In the actual game, Black blindly holds on to his Queen with 9...Qg6?? and pays the price after 10.Rd8+ Kf7 11.Bc4+ Be6 12.Nxe5 checkmate. Instead of exhibiting such suicidal greed, Black should catch up in development with 9...Bxc3+ (This move is not really necessary, but it never hurts to weaken the enemy pawn structure.) Then after 10.bxc3 Nf6! 11.Rxd6 cxd6, White has run out of threats, and Black is still ahead by a bundle with an extra Rook. Trading Pieces for a Winning Endgame From the previous examples, you've probably realized that when you have less material than your opponent and no compensation for this deficit, you are often reduced to playing for a lucky shot - a move that depends more on your opponent making a mistake than on any brilliance of your own. In chess parlance, this situation is known as playing for a cheap shot or cheapo for short. On the other hand, if you have a material advantage, you want to eliminate as many of the potential tricks in a position as possible. Trading pieces when you are ahead in material is a wonderful way to avoid being the target of a cheapo. Here's the strategy: When you are materially ahead, trade, trade, trade! The concept of trading pieces is particularly useful if you can wind up in the endgame with an advantage of a pawn or more. Then your poor opponent, down to his last piece or two, will face a miserable defense with no chances to attack whatsoever. A couple of examples will demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy. DIAGRAM 6. White to play White is two pawns ahead in Diagram 6. but Black, with threats of 1...Qxh2+ and 1...Rf2, is trying to make things difficult. Is it time for White to panic, or is there an easy way out? If White employs the trading strategy, then all his problems will disappear after 1.Qd4 (1.Qc3 is also fine). When the Queens leave the board, Black's threats cease to exist, and White can try for victory in a nice, safe, two-pawn-up endgame. We see the same idea in Diagram 7, though in this case, the solution is a more imaginative. DIAGRAM 7. White to play White has a fat four-pawn advantage, but Black threatens 1...Nxh2 and 1...Nf2 checkmate. If White plays 1.Qd6, then Black saves himself with 1...Nf2+ 2.Kh2 Ng4+, and White must accept the draw by perpetual check. If White can only trade Queens, all his problems will be over, but such a trade appears to be impossible. Or is it? It turns out that White can win with the tricky 1.Qb8+! Kxb8 2.Nc6+, forking the King and Queen and leading to a winning endgame. After 2...Kb7 3.Nxd4 Nf2+ 4.Kh2 Ng4+ 5.Kg3, Black can do nothing better than give up. Obviously, trading can be a very important defensive strategy. Sometimes it may not be easy to find away to accomplish the desired exchange, but the end result is usually well worth the effort. DIAGRAM 8. Black to play Gormon-Silman, Ervin Memorial, 1987 Our next example shows White sacrificing a pawn so that he can quickly mobilize his army. In Diagram 8, White has just castled and dares Black, who is already behind in development, to take the b2-pawn bait. Before capturing this pawn, Black must ask himself the two questions on the next page.
1. After capturing the b2-pawn, can I eventually catch up in development?
2. Can White take advantage of the open lines my capture will create and get to me in a hurry?
Foremost in Black's mind is a simple fact: If he can survive White's attack, the extra material will give him an excellent chance to win. He decides to go for it!
1...Qxb2 2.Qd2 h6
A sharp move, even though it doesn't immediately develop a piece. Its deeper purpose is to gain time by attacking the Bishop and prepare the way for placing the f8-Bishop on the h8-a1 diagonal. Black has faith in his position because his pawn structure acts like a thick leather hide, keeping out any annoying flies that might wish to bite him. Note how the pawns on c6 and d6 defend the important b5, c5, d5, and e5 squares, making them uninhabitable for the enemy pieces.
3.Bh4?
Having already sacrificed a pawn, White should have kept his nerve and played 3.Rab1 Qa3
4.Rb3. Then Rf1-b1 would have allowed him to use the b-file to advantage. Instead, White's
move falls in line with Black's plan of development.
3...g5!
Normally these kinds of flank weaknesses aren't recommended. In this setting, however, Black must develop his army as quickly as possible. Coming as it does with tempo, this is Black's best move.
4.Rab1 Qa3 5.Rb3
White's Rook has taken control of the b-file with gain of tempo, but he is still unable to inflict any damage on the Black position.
5...Qa5 6.Bg3 Bg7
Now the Bishop on g7 is very strong, and Black is ready with 7...O-O to get his King to safety. White tries to tear down the Black kingside pawn structure, but in doing so, he allows Black to initiate a series of moves that ultimately lead to a trade of Queens.
7.h4?! gxh4 8.Bxh4 Bxd4!
Black would not normally trade his fine Bishop for the d4-Knight, but in this case, the move represents more than a simple exchange of pieces.
9.Qxd4 Qe5 10.Qxe5 Nxe5 11.Rb7 f6
White's control of the b-file allows him to apply some pressure, but not enough to compensate for an unhealthy pawn deficit. With 11...f6, Black continues to consolidate his position by creating a safe haven on f7 for his King.
12.f3 Bc8
Black forces the Rook to get off the dangerous 7th rank. Note that Black doesn't hurry to swing out and attack. He just slowly improves his position. When you are ahead in material and have a safe position, you can afford to take your time and torture your opponent. This cat-and- mouse theme is a favorite strategy of the masters.
13.Rb4 Rg8 14.Kh1 Kf7 15.Rfb1 Rd8!
Subtle. This Rook will eventually reach the b-file by ...Rd7-b7.
16.Bg3 c5 17.Rb8 Rxb8
Black is quite happy to trade pieces because he can feel victory drawing a little closer with every exchange.
18.Rxb8 Nc6
The Black Knight chases the White Rook to a less-active square.
19.Rb2 Rd7 20.Bf4 h5 21.Nd5 Rb7 22.Bc1 Rxb2 23.Bxb2 Be6
Black has achieved a winning position, and White knows it. As you have seen, the important theme to keep in mind is this: One of the clearest advantages you can have in chess is to win the opponent's pawns or pieces. But there is a risk! As you're grabbing material, you're not developing. Winning material is fine, if you can catch up to your opponent's level of mobilization.
TEST 2.
Silman-Malachi, Lloyds Bank Masters 1978 Test 2. Black has sacrificed two pawns for what appears to be a strong attack. How should White cope with his kingside problems? Show/Hide Solution Test 2: White should trade Queens, of course! The ugly looking 1.Qd2!, heading for g5 or h6, proves to be more than Black can handle. In response to 1...Bf5, White decides that everything is under control and grabs a bit more food with 2.Rxa6 before making the trade. After 2...Rxa6
3.bxa6 Ra8 4.Qg5+ Qxg5 5.Bxg5 Rxa6 6.gxf3 gxf3 7.Nxf3, White wins in a few more moves.

Chapter Three Stopping Enemy Counterplay At some time or other, we all find ourselves with an advantage in position - be it large or small. It's part of the natural ebb and flow of the game. Whether we can parlay that advantage into a win is a completely different matter. Rarely will your opponent be so depressed over his positional shortcomings that he will lay back and allow you to wreak havoc upon him. More than likely, the guy sitting across from you will begin his own aggressive action, fighting for some sort of counterplay. In these cases, you must stay calm, refuse to overreact, and implement this strategy: Try to find the perfect balance between defense and a continuation that furthers your own plans. Let's look at an example. The position in Diagram 9 is very favorable for White. DIAGRAM 9. White to play Botvinnik-Kan, Leningrad, 1939 With his extra pawn and powerful centralized Bishop, he is clearly winning the game. However, Black has a trump of his own: his aggressively placed Rook on the 7th rank. The power of this piece enables him to threaten 1...Qg5. If White allows this move, Black will win the game because checkmate on g2 can be avoided only by 2.Qf2 (which loses the Queen to
2...Rxf2) or 2.g4 (which allows 2...Qd2 with a quick checkmate to follow).
How should White react? Threats to one's King often breed mindless terror. Many players would panic and fly something like 1.Qb4?? Qg5 2.Rb2. The idea is good - trading would indeed take the sting out of Black's attack. However, Black would then play 2...Qc1+, picking up the White Rook and turning a lost position into an easy win. Having seen the Black threat, if all White thinks about is defense, he will lose the game. Instead, after noting the threat, he should look at his own advantages and try to combine an aggressive plan of action that makes use of his pluses with a defensive scheme. This is how it is done. White is a pawn ahead. Because it is a passed pawn, he would love to push it down the board and create a new Queen. What's preventing the promotion? The White Queen is in the way of its own pawn. He must move the Queen if he wants to make immediate use of the extra pawn on c4. Now comes the critical decision: Where can he move the White Queen that also prevents the Black threat of ...Qg5? Because White has a material advantage, he would love to trade Queens, and the answer 1.Qe3! is best. This move both stops the enemy attack in its tracks and furthers White's own goals. In the sections that follow, we will examine two methods of dealing with enemy counterplay. The first is to constantly be on the alert for your opponent's tactical threats. The second is to keep your opponent as helpless as possible. Spotting Tactical Threats Often when you are winning a chess game, there comes a moment when you want to get things over with. As soon as your opponent moves, you rush in with your own response. This lack of care has led many potential victors down the road to oblivion. It takes only one moment of inattention to fall for some hidden tactical trick. As I explain in Winning Chess Tactics, tactics are maneuvers that take advantage of short-term opportunities with the goal of supporting your own strategy or destroying your opponent's strategy. For more information about specific tactics, I will refer you to Winning Chess Tactics. Here, we will look at a couple of examples of what can happen if you underestimate your opponent's tactical possibilities. DIAGRAM 10. Black to play Makogonov-Botvinnik, U.S.S.R., 1943 In Diagram 10, Black is about to lose his Queen and will soon be a piece down. However, his passed pawns on the queenside are so strong that one of them will be promoted very soon, and Black will win the game. Confident that victory will soon be his, Black could easily throw out
1...b3?? as his move. Imagine his horror when be realizes that 2.Rxe7+ Kxe7 3.Bc5+ followed
by Bxa3 tosses the sure win away in one move! Alert to this possibility, Black plays the simple 1...Qxf7+! instead. After 2.Kxf7 b3, White is helpless before the threat of 3...b2 followed by 4...b1=Q and gives up. One of the worst (and most costly) examples of inattention that I've ever seen occurred in a Junior World Championship event. Both players were nine-year old girls who had long ago lost interest in the game. White, behind by three pawns, had already resigned herself to defeat and was playing only through inertia. Black, who had decided that the game was as good as over, was not even looking at the board. Instead, she was literally dancing for joy, because with this victory came the title of World Champion for girls under ten! Black's coaches and parents were frantic. They wanted her to sit down and take the game seriously; there would be plenty of time for celebration after the competition. But because nobody is allowed to offer advice while a contest is in progress, they were forced to watch in horror as the drama unfolded. DIAGRAM 11. White to play From the position in Diagram 11, White decided to throw in a couple of spite checks before giving up, and played 1.Re3+. Now 1...Kd8 2.Re8+ Kc7 would end the game, as would 1...Kf6
2.Rf3+ Kg6. However, Black was in a world of her own. Without so much as a glance at the
board, she grabbed her King and played 1...Kf8??. The reply 2.Re8 checkmate brought poor Black crashing back to reality, but by then it was too late. The World Champion title was gone, and euphoria was replaced by hysteria. The moral of this story? "It's not over till it's over" may be trite, but it's true - for all sports. Avoid overconfidence and never play quick moves. Remember: The game is not over until your opponent either resigns or achieves a checkmate! DIAGRAM 12. Black to play Reshevsky-Fischer, U.S. Championship, 1963-64 At times you may think you have a clear advantage, and then the sudden appearance of a tactic will force you to reassess the situation. When these nasty situations arise, you must keep your head clear and go into damage-control mode, just as Bobby Fischer did when faced with the situation in Diagram 12. Here, Black is a pawn up. He would like to defend his pawn on b6, which is being attacked by the White pieces on b2 and b4. The obvious defense is 1...Rb8, a move that most people would play without too much hesitation. However, this defense would be squashed by 2.Bf1 Bxf1 3.Rxb6!!, and White would win immediately because of the weakness of Black's back rank (3...Rxb6 4.Ra8+ leads to checkmate). In the actual game, Fischer saw his predicament, kept calm in the face of the attack, and accepted that his b6-pawn was a goner. He played to extract White's newly found fangs. After
1...b5 2.Bxb5 Nxb5 3.Rxb5 Rxb5 4.Qxb5 Qe5, White emerged with a small advantage, but the
trades had depleted most of White's aggressive potential, and Black was able to save the game.
TEST 3.
Test 3. It's Black's turn to play. He is obviously winning, and he can choose from among many tempting ideas, such as 1...h3, 1...Qg1+ and 1...Kc3. Is there anything wrong with 1...Kc3? Show/Hide Solution Test 3: Trading with 1...Qg1+ 2.Kc2 Qxb1+ 3.Kxb1, is the simplest. Playing 1...h3 would also force White to resign. All of Black's pieces are protected, the h- pawn is running for a touchdown, and White's vain hope for a stalemate will never materialize because Black has been careful to give White's King the c2-square to run to. Playing 1...Kc3?? is another matter. At first glance it looks very good because checkmate is threatened on d2 and 2.Rc1+ Qxc1+! 3.Kxc1 h3 makes a Queen of the pawn. Unfortunately, Black has not left the White King any squares to move to, and White can take advantage of this oversight by playing 2.Rb3+!, after which 2...Kxb3 leads to a draw by stalemate, whereas
2...Kd4 3.Rxe3 Kxe3 4.Ke1 h3 5.Kf1 is a dead, drawn, King and pawn endgame.
Keeping Your Opponent Helpless Chess can be played on several levels. On the one hand, you can play to create a work of art - a brilliant game that other players will study and admire. On the other hand, you can play chess as a sport, in which case you want to achieve victory in the safest, most economical manner. For most people, creating a work of art is not easy, especially when an opponent is determined to get in the way. However, while you are striving to attain the immortality that accompanies the creation of a masterpiece, you can increase your chances of winning games by honing your ability to limit your opponent's chances, which is something that you have more control over. DIAGRAM 13. Black to play Keene-Hartston, England, 1968 No matter how clearly defined your static advantage might be, you should first curtail all of your opponent's chances and only then proceed with your plans. This means that if you are lucky enough to get your opponent in a passive position, you should make every effort to keep him in that state. For example, the situation in Diagram 13 is a dream for White. His pieces are pouring into the Black position, and Black has no way to create threats of his own. To win, all White has to do is keep Black's pieces bottled up and slowly ooze down the board, claiming one square after another in a safe but dominant fashion.
1...Re6
Black hopes to trade his inactive pieces for White's active ones.
2.Qc4
White doesn't allow Black to carry out his plan. Now Black needs to address the threats along the a2-g8 diagonal and avoid moves like 2...Bxd6?? 3.Rxd6, which lead to heavy material losses.
2...Ng7
Black defends e6. Notice that he can't do anything but hold on.
3.Nb5
The White Knight steps back, opening the d-file for the White Rooks.
3...Na6
Black hopes to trade off the strong White Knight with ...Nc7.
4.Rd7
In taking control of the squares along the 7th rank and preventing ...Nc7, White is not playing with any great imagination. He is simply making sure that Black remains trapped in his current position.
4...Kh8 5.Na7
The double threat of 6.Qxa6 and 6.Nxc6 wins material.
5...Rxa7 6.Rxa7
White, with seemingly no effort at all, won the Exchange and eventually the game. The moral here is: Don't try to make it exciting! Try to make it safe and easy! Here's another example of "better safe than sorry" play. The position in Diagram 14 is completely one-sided. DIAGRAM 14. White to play Moves like 1.Ka5,
1.b6,
or 1.c6 are all easy wins. However, you never know what mistakes you might make later, and the Black Rook is a strong piece. Wouldn't it make sense to trade it if you got the chance? Then Black would have nothing left that was capable of damaging you. Playing 1.Rf4+ forces the exchange of Rooks and leaves Black with no hope at all. The move 1.Rf4+ is hardly necessary, but it does illustrate an important state of mind: When victory is in your grasp, always keep things simple and safe. If possible, take your opponent's weapons away from him, so that he can't shoot you in the back. A master of this kind of "kill the counterplay before starting the execution" style of play was World Champion Tigran Petrosian. In the next example, we see him performing a no- counterplay clinic on another World Champion, Boris Spassky. DIAGRAM 15. Black to play Spassky-Petrosian, World Championship Match, 1966 As you can see in Diagram 15, Black is a pawn ahead, but central to this position is the fact that both players have castled on opposite sides. Black intends to place his Rooks on the g-file and go for mate. He knows that White intends to play a4-a5 and then fly to kill off the Black King, and he quite rightly wonders why he should give his opponent any chance to succeed. Why not close off the queenside and proceed to checkmate White at his leisure? Follow the moves below to see how Petrosian stumped Spassky in this game. The key is to stop Spassky's counterplay.
1...c4!
This fine move gives White control of the d4-square but, more importantly, prepares to close down all play on the queenside. The d4-square is a small price to pay for the Black King's safety.
2.Be2 a6!
Black makes his point. Now 3.b5 a5 or 3.a5 b5 both lead to a complete blockade on the queenside. Stripped of all moves against the Black King, White finds himself completely lacking in opportunities for counterplay.
3.Kh1 Rdg8 4.Rg1 Rg4
With all lines of attack closed down on the queenside, Black can safely devote all his energy to his kingside aspirations.
5.Qd2 Rhg8 6.a5 b5
White, who has no play at all, eventually lost this game. Diagram 16 is another example of the superior side treading carefully to avoid giving the opponent any counterplay. DIAGRAM 16. Black to play Matulović-Fischer, Vinkovci, 1968 White suffers from a terrible Bishop on g2, a Knight that doesn't appear to be going anywhere, and pawns that are in need of constant defense on c2 and e4. Black's backward d-pawn, on the other hand, is well defended by the Black Queen and King. Black's natural plan is to double his Rooks on the c-file and add to the pressure against c2. Unfortunately, 1...Rc4, which attacks e4 and prepares for this doubling, would give White some counterplay chances with 2.g4, because
2...Nxe4 3.Bxe4 Rxe4 4.Ng3 followed by Nf5+ is not what Black wants. The advantages of the
position are not going away, so Black decides to kill his enemy's counterplay chances first. Then he will be free to pursue his queenside dreams. Here's how Fischer neutralized Matulović.
1...h5!
Black stops g3-g4 in its tracks.
2.b3 Bxe2!
Why give up this nice Bishop for the lame Knight? Because only the Knight was keeping Black out of c3.
3.Qxe2 Rc3
Black proceeds with the occupation of the c-file.
4.Rd3 Rbc8 5.Rxc3 Rxc3 6.Kh2 Qc5
White, who is bound hand and foot to the weakling on c2, eventually lost. Black triumphantly demonstrated the wisdom of this principle: If you have a permanent advantage, take the time to stop any potential enemy counterplay. DIAGRAM 17. Black to play Gligorić-Seirawan, Baden, 1982 Here's another example of this principle at work. Diagram 17 shows a position from my game with S. Gligorić. The center is locked so that all the play is occuring on the wings. My superior pawn structure gives me better long-term chances, and I have a clear advantage on the kingside because of my pressure on the f-file. My only worry is potential play by White on the queenside, the only place left for White to seek counterplay. My advantages are not going away, so I decide to pause in my kingside assault and walk my King over to the queenside. (Why not put the old guy to work?) With my King defending that side of the board, the rest of my army would be free to take a whack at the White monarch.
1...Kf8! 2.Rf2 Ke8 3.Rf1 Kd7 4.Rf2 Kc8 5.Rf1 Qh7 6.Bd2
White doesn't fall for my hidden trap 6.Qd2? Nh4+! 7.gxh4 Rxf3 8.Rxf3 Qxe4, followed by ...g5-g4 winning the Exchange.
6...Rf8 7.Qc1 Qf7
If White takes the g-pawn, I will be able to break through on the kingside with ...Rxf3 and a decisive attack.
8.Qd1 Kc7 9.Be3 Qg7 10.Kh2 Qh7 11.Kg2 Rg8 12.Bd2 Nf8!
White is helpless, but he is still holding on. Seeing that I can't crack his kingside, I turn my attention to the other advantage in my position: the weak pawns on c4 and a4.
13.Qb1 Nd7 14.Ree1 Nb6!
White's position is finally starting to fall apart. 15.Qe4 Nxa4 16.Ra1 Nb6 17.Rxa7 Rf7 (His Queen is the only thing defending the weak pawn on c4, so I am happy to trade it off.) 18.Re1 Qxe4 19.Rxe4 Rgf8 (I switch my attention back to f3. Now I can win with 20.Bxg5 Rxf3 21.Be3 Nxc4 22.Rxc4 Rxe3.) 20.f4 gxf4 21.gxf4 Nd7 22.Kg3 Rg8+ 23.Kf2 Rfg7 (Notice how the White Rook on a7 is completely out of play.) 24.Ke2 Rg2+ 25.Kd1 Rh2 26.Re2 Rg1+ 27.Be1 Rhh1 28.Kd2 exf4 29.Bh4. White resigns. The finish would have been something like 29...Ne5
30.Bf6 Rd1+ 31.Kc2 Rc1+ 32.Kb3 Rb1+ 33.Kc2 Rhc1+ 34.Kd2 f3 35.Rf2 Rb2+ 36.Kxc1 Nd3+
37.Kd1 Nxf2+ 38.Kc1 Nd3+ 39.Kd1 f2, and Black wins.
TEST 4.
Gligorić-Fischer, Siegen, 1970 Test 4. It's Black's move. He is a pawn down, but his Bishop is superior to the White Knight; the pawns on a2, c4, e4, and h5 are all weak; his King is well placed; and the Rook on b2 is also strong. Is 1...Rxa2 good? Show/Hide Solution Test 4: No. Playing 1...Rxa2 allows Black to play 2.Nh2 followed by 3.Ng4+, when the White Knight suddenly enters the game with great effect. In the game, Fischer stops this possibility with a nice Exchange sacrifice that led to a winning endgame: 1...Rxh5! 2.Rxh5 Rf2+ 3.Kg3 Rxf1 4.Rh8 Kxe4 (White's pawns start to fall like flies)
5.Ra3 Rg1+ 6.Kh2 Rc1 7.Rxa4 Rc2+ 8.Kh1 c5 9.Ra3 Kxf5. Black manages to win the game on
the strength of his connected passed pawns on the kingside. This Exchange sacrifice is an advanced idea, and I didn't expect most of you to notice it. You can be proud of yourself if you noticed that the usual moves would allow the White Knight to become dangerous. Start to develop an eye for enemy counterplay, and your results will rapidly improve. Show in Text Mode

Chapter Four Understanding Where the Pieces Go Where do the pieces go? Seems like a strange question, doesn't it? After all, everyone reading this book knows how they move, and the majority of readers are also aware that most pieces are stronger if they are placed in the center. However, knowing how to move the pieces has nothing to do with knowing where to put them. Only when you examine the specific needs of each of the pieces and learn the laws that govern them do you start to understand where the pieces go. In fact, this chapter may be the most important one in the book, because the subtle things you'll learn here will have a practical application in almost all your games. As a result, mastering this information will put you far ahead of most of your competition. We'll look at each piece in turn, starting with the Knight. The Knight The Knight, which is represented as a horse in most chess sets, is the only piece that can jump over other pieces and pawns. It has moved in the same way since the game began, and you might think that centuries of familiarity would have deprived it of its mystique. However, the opposite is true! A favorite of some Grandmasters (like Petrosian and myself) and given second billing behind Bishops by others (the great Fischer loves Bishops), this poor jumper is looked down on by many amateurs and secretly feared by others. This love-hate relationship is easy to explain. The fact that a Bishop can actually get an edge over a Knight in the majority of situations breeds disdain for the horse, which appears to be a weakling; but a Knight can wipe a Bishop off the face of the board if the correct environment appears. And so we have the rumblings of a love affair. Amateurs tend to distrust Knights because: • Their pieces and pawns are always being forked by the horrible beasts. • They don't know how to use them properly. This section is devoted to ending this distrust. It's time to learn how to make the humble Knight rule the board! Creating Support Points Unlike the long-range Bishop, the Knight is a short-range piece. This means that it needs to advance up the board to be strong. However, an advanced piece can easily be attacked by enemy pieces and pawns, so the Knight needs a support point, a quiet square where it can safely rest while simultaneously casting a menacing shadow over the board. This desirable square can be considered a support point only if it cannot be attacked by an enemy pawn, or if attacking with the pawn would severely weaken the enemy's position. So we have our first rule concerning knights: Knights need advanced support points to be effective. At times, a support point will just magically appear (which means it was created by an enemy blunder). If you notice one, rush your Knight over and gleefully attach it to its post. Usually, however, your opponents won't be so generous, and you will have to find a way to create a support point. Whole strategies are often built around the creation of support points, and for good reason! An advanced Knight sitting on a juicy support point can be the first major step toward a resounding victory. The next discussion explains why. The 1st and 2nd Ranks Knights on the 1st and 2nd ranks are purely defensive. If they can't make their way up the board, they will never be effective attackers. let's look at a couple of examples:
DIAGRAM 18.
The position in Diagram 18 is equal materially but is nonetheless very bad for Black. Aside from White's superior King position, White's Knight is strongly posted on the 5th rank where it controls no less than eight squares, whereas its Black counterpart is on the horrible h8-square where it controls a pathetic two squares. White wins by either 1.d6 cxd6 2.Kxd6 Kb7 3.Kd7 Kb8
4.Kc6 Ka7 5.Kc7 Ka8 6.Kxb6,
or by 1.Kf6 followed by 2.Kg7 and 3.Kxh8. An extreme example is shown in Diagram 19, demonstrating that a Knight on the 1st or 2nd rank is not particularly useful no matter how you look at it.
DIAGRAM 19.
The Knight on the 1st rank controls four squares while its more advanced brother lays claim to six. The combined power of these two pieces is only ten squares, just two more than that of the lonely White Knight on c3. Kind of pathetic, don't you agree? Also note that these Black Knights would need several moves to get down the board and into a position where they could launch an attack into enemy territory. The rule: Your Knights will not be world-beaters if you allow them to lounge around on the 1st and 2nd ranks! The 3rd Rank DIAGRAM 20. White to play A Knight on the 3rd rank is useful for defense, but it can also take a more aggressive stance by jumping to the 5th rank in just one move. For example, from the position in Diagram 20, White tries 1.Ng5, intending to kill Black with 2.Qxh7+. How should Black deal with this transparent but bothersome threat? The best answer would be 1...Nf6, bringing the Black Knight from the horrible e8-square to the much superior f6 post. From f6, it defends h7 and can aspire to even greener pastures on d5, e4, or g4. Note that g5 is not a support point for the White Knight because Black can gain control of that square easily with ...h7-h6. The 4th Rank A Knight on the 4th rank is generally as good as a Bishop and is well poised for both attack and defense. In Diagram 21, for example, the Knight enjoys a firm support point on d5 because it is well defended by the pawn on e6 and can't be chased away by an enemy pawn.
DIAGRAM 21.
Note the Knight's range: It defends the pawn on b6, attacks the pawn on b4, can pounce on c3, e3, or f4 at any time, and can also jump back to c7, e7, or f6 if needed. Compare this Knight with those lurking on the lower ranks in previous diagrams, and you will see a big difference in their punching power and flexibility. The 5th Rank DIAGRAM 22. Black to play A Knight on a support point on the 5th rank is superior to a Bishop. It eyes many points deep in the enemy camp, threatens the enemy pawns, and helps the rest of its own army in forming an attack. The position in Diagram 22 favors the Black Knight, with both e4 and g4 as fine support points. If it goes to e4, it can join with the Queen and Rook in forming an attack on c3, and if it leaps to g4, it can work with the Queen in creating threats against h2 via ...Qh2+. The White Knight, on the other hand, has no real support point. It can go to c5, but Black's b-pawn would advance to b6 and chase it away The 6th Rank DIAGRAM 23. White to play A Knight on the 6th rank acts just like a bone lodged in someone's throat. It sits deep in enemy territory, attacks pieces and pawns, and controls critical squares right in the enemy camp. In Diagram 23, the Knight on e3 is a virtual parasite. It eyes the pawns on g2 and c4 and prevents the White Rooks from going to f1, d1, or c2. (The c1-Rook would love to move to c2 and defend a2, but the horrible Knight makes that a suicidal choice.) Working in Closed Positions Knights show a good deal of strength in positions with locked pawns, called closed positions. Whereas the other pieces are blocked by the pawns, Knights simply jump over these obstacle - the pawns don't interfere with their activity at all! Let's look at a few examples of why Knights thrive in closed positions while other pieces flounder. DIAGRAM 24. Black to play In Diagram 24, the center and the kingside are locked up with pawns. The White Bishop is clearly suffering because of the clogged diagonals. The Black Knight, however, jumps over anything in its path as it makes its way with 1...Nf8 followed by 2...Ng6 and 3...Nf4 to the support point on f4. On the more esoteric side, Knights prosper when they are placed in front of an enemy passed pawn. This type of guard duty limits most of the other pieces, but Knights are known as the very finest blockers (called blockaders) of passed pawns. Take a look at Diagram 25. DIAGRAM 25. Black to play Some players might think that this position is good for White. He has a Bishop vs. a Black Knight that doesn't seem to be doing much on f6; he has control of more space in the center; and he has a powerful passed pawn on d5. However, the position is actually better for Black. Why? Because White's Bishop is inactive, and the Black Knight is destined for great things after
1...Ne8 followed by 2...Nd6. On d6, this horse takes on several new dimensions: It attacks both
c4 and e4, forcing White to always delegate a piece or two to the defense of these pawns; it keeps White's pieces off b5; it eyes other squares like b7, c8, e8, and f7; and it stops the mighty White passed pawn dead in its tracks. Quite an accomplishment for just one piece! Why does the Knight have more power on d6 (in front of that passed pawn) than a Bishop, Queen, or Rook would have? The answer lies in the Knight's ability to jump over other men. Let's look at Diagram 25 again, this time with a Black Bishop on d6 instead of a Black Knight. This poor, newborn Bishop looks more like a tall pawn than a high-ranking piece because the Black pawns on e5 and c5 are blocking its activity. A Rook on d6 is also terrible, because it needs to roam on open files. As for the Black Queen, such a strong piece is too important to play nursemaid to a mere pawn! A Knight, on the other hand, is happy on d6 in front of the White passed pawn because it can perform an offensive role and a defensive role at the same time - something that other pieces simply can't do. The following game illustrates some of the points made so far in this section. Petrosian-Bondarevsky Moscow, 1950 In this game, we see Black willingly weaken an important square, hoping that White will not be able to make much use of it. Instead, the handler of the White pieces clamps down on this weak point in masterful fashion.
1.Nf3 e6 2.g3 f5
This opening is called the Dutch Defense.
3.Bg2 Nf6 4.O-O Be7 5.d4 O-O 6.c4 c6 7.Qc2 Qe8 8.Nbd2 d5
Black grabs some space and clamps down on the e4-square. A price has been paid though; a hole now exists on e5. Moreover, Black's control of e4 is much more tenuous than White's control of e5. A Black pawn will never be able to chase the White pieces away from e5, but with the simple f2-f3, White can make e4 uninhabitable for Black.
9.Ne5 Nbd7
DIAGRAM 26. White to play Black offers an exchange of Knights and dares White to make real use of e5. From the position shown in Diagram 26, can White make any kind of impression on that square?
10.Nd3!
A fine move that adds to his control of e5 and avoids trades that might help Black get a bit more breathing room. "How does this retreat increase White's control of e5?" you ask. With the Knight sitting on e5, only the White pawn on d4 attacked that square. (A piece does not control the square that it is sitting on.) Now, after 10.Nd3, White is attacking the square twice.
10...Ne4 11.Nf3
Another piece wends its way to the e5 promised land.
11...Nd6 12.b3 b5?
This move is a mistake, which allows White to gain a significant amount of space on the queenside. The best move was 12...b6, which restrains White's next move.
13.c5 Nf7
Black is trying hard to keep White out of e5. Having tied Black down to this defensive chore, White now breaks open a queenside file for his Rooks. Though the goal of the battle for e5 is to create a nice home for his Knights, White doesn't ignore his other men. Never forget that chess is a team game. Your whole army has to participate!
14.a4! bxa4 15.Rxa4
Now the pawn on a7 is a target that White will try to win at his leisure.
15...Bf6
Black brings another piece to bear on e5.
16.Bb2
This move counters Black's pressure on e5 and allows the Rook on f1 access to a1.
16...a6 17.Nfe5 Nfxe5 18.dxe5
DIAGRAM 27. Black to play As you can see in Diagram 27, White occupies the e5-square with a pawn. Why would White allow this? White was willing to part with this support point for two reasons: • The newly created e5-pawn adds to White's advantage in space. • The White pawn has moved from d4, opening up the d4-square for occupation by a piece.
18...Be7 19.f4 Rb8 20.Rfa1 Rb5 21.b4
Black is helpless, so White goes about defending all his pawns. First, he takes time out to play f2-f4 and permanently guard e5. Then he plays b3-b4 and grips c5.
21...h5 22.Bc3
A very flexible move that gives the b4-pawn another defender while simultaneously allowing the Bishop access to the kingside via Bc3-e1.
22...h4 23.e3
Another useful move. White gives the f4-square more support, adds to his control of the d4- square. and clears the f1-a6 diagonal for his light-squared Bishop. Eventually, he will play this Bishop to f1 so that it can join in the attack against a6.
23...Nb8 24.Ne1
White, by playing Nf3, Nd4, and Bf1, manages to overrun the Black position. Before you leave this game, place the Knight on d4 and look at it for awhile. Notice how it virtually sweeps the board. Important squares like b5 and f5 are touched; the pawns on c6 and e6 are pressured; and other points like b3, c2, e2, and f3 are kept within reach. Clearly, central support points like d4 are extremely important for Knights! DIAGRAM 28. White to play Petrosian-Bannik, U.S.S.R., 1958 Let's look are another example. In Diagram 28, White enjoys a host of advantages: better King position, control of the open d-file, and a superior Knight on the superb f5 support point. What makes the position particularly pleasing is the fact that Black's Knight can't find the same kind of homebase because the White pawn on e3 covers both d4 and f4. The following moves revolve around White's efforts to penetrate down the d-file with his Rook.
1.Nh6!
White prepares to move to g8 and attack the f-pawn.
1...Ne6 2.Ng8 Nf8
Black defends f6 with the Rook. Playing 2...Kf7 fails because with 3.Rd7+ Kxg8 4.Kd5, White gets back his piece and achieves deep penetration at the same time.
3.Rd2 Kf7 4.Nh6+ Ke8 5.Nf5 Ne6 6.Rd6 Rxd6 7.Nxd6+ Kd7 8.Nb5
White allowed the trade of Rooks, but the advantages of his position still remain: superior Knight (which has found another fine post on b5) and dominant King (which is ready to jump into d5 or f5).
8...Ng7 9.h6
The poor Black Knight is getting kicked around like a dog.
9...Ne8 10.Kd5
Suddenly, the game is over! Any pawn moves by Black lose material; Knight moves are also disastrous (10...Nc7+ 11.Nxc7 Kxc7 12.Ke6, and the King feasts on all of Black's kingside pawns); and 10...Ke7 allows 11.Kc6, after which the queenside pawns all fall.
10...f5 11.Kxe5 fxg4 12.Nc3
A super Knight. Now it can jump to b5, d5, or e4 - truly an endless array of support points.
12...Ke7 13.Ne4
Black resigns because both of his g-pawns will soon fall by the wayside.
TEST 5.
Test 5. It's Black's turn to play. What squares can he claim as support points, and how can his Knight get to them? Show/Hide Solution Test 5: The two squares that Black might be able to claim are c5 and b4. Once you see the goal, the actual route is rather easy to find: 1...Nb7 followed by 2...Nc5 (attacking the b3-pawn). If the Knight then wants to go to b4 (though c5 is better because the Knight can attack something from that post), it can jump to a6 and then on to b4. The Bishop Introduced in the 15th century, these relatively new pieces are long-range and streamlined. They work best in pairs because each Bishop is doomed to stay on squares of one color for the length of the game. Two Bishops, though, control squares of both colors and compliment each other in fine fashion. DIAGRAM 29. White to play Diagram 29 shows a dreaded wrong-colored Rook-pawn draw. White is a full Bishop and pawn ahead but can't win because his Bishop, stuck forever on the light squares, can't get the Black King out of the corner. (Only a Rook-pawn, an "a" or "h"- pawn produces a draw. Any other pawn would lead to an easy win for White.) Now take a look at Diagram 30. DIAGRAM 30. White to play The addition of an extra Bishop for each side changes the situation entirely. White's material advantage isn't any bigger, but now the win is simplicity itself. Why? Because White's new Bishop gives him control of the dark squares as well as the light squares. After 1.Be5+ Kg8
2.h7+ followed by 3.h8=Q, Black would be well advised to resign and catch a good movie.
If you are still not convinced that the Bishop's restriction to squares of one color is a real problem that deserves close scrutiny, take a look at the outrageous position in Diagram 31; it's sure to make you a believer! DIAGRAM 31. White to play White has a pawn and eight Bishops vs. Black's lone King, but he can't win the game! If you're skeptical, I encourage you to play around with this position for a while and try to prove me wrong. If any one of White's men could change into virtually any other piece, White would score an easy victory because every other piece has the ability to control squares of both colors. Bishops are the only exception, and it is not something that they are proud of. Bishops are interesting creatures. On the one hand, they are wonderful long-range pieces that can sit in a corner and threaten pieces that live at the other end of the board. On the other hand, they are easily blocked by pawns and are forever stuck in a one-colored dimension. Neither of these attributes makes Bishops particularly strong or weak. The fact that it's up to the player to turn his Bishops into something special is what makes chess such a challenging game. There are three types of Bishops: good, bad, and active. It's very important to understand these classifications for the compelling reason that if you don't, you won't have any control over how your Bishops turn out. Good Bishops A Bishop is considered good when its central pawns are not on its color and thus are not obstructing its activity. For example, White's light-squared Bishop in Diagram 32 is eyeing two wonderful diagonals: h1-a8 and a2-g8. DIAGRAM 32. White to play It is a very strong piece because no White pawns are blocking its path. In this case, the Bishop can work with another piece: the Rook. After 1.Re7, the double attack on f7 and b7 will lead to the win of material. The strategy here is: Place a bishop on an unobstructed diagonal; the rewards will pour in immediately. Bad Bishops A Bishop is considered bad when its central pawns are on its color and thus block its activity. For example, White is a whole Bishop up in Diagram 33, but this Bishop is so bad that it is virtually useless. Because the lone Bishop can't do anything (lone means that there are no other pieces for it to work with) and the White King can't break into the Black position, the game will end in a draw. The moral: If your Bishop is on the same color as your pawns, you will severely limit its activity. It's interesting to note that if the position in Diagram 33 had an additional White Bishop on h3, DIAGRAM 33. White to play White would still be unable to win because all of Black's pawns are on dark squares. The Bishops, because of their one-color limitation, would be nothing more than ghosts, floating around the board but unable to touch anything. Active Bishops An active bishop can be either good or bad; it's called active simply because it serves an active function. Take a look at the Bishops in Diagram 34, which are easy to label: DIAGRAM 34. White to play Black's Bishop is good by definition (his center pawns all rest on dark squares), whereas White's is bad (his center pawns rest on light squares). This bit of name calling would lead us to believe that Black's Bishop is superior. However, nothing could be further from the truth! White's Bishop, though technically bad, is active because it is resting outside the pawn chain and is therefore not blocked. Black's Bishop, though technically good, has hardly any squares to go to. White has a couple ways to win material in this position; the simplest being 1.Ra8 Rf8 2.Rb8 followed by 3.Bxb7. The thing to remember about bad bishops is this: A bad bishop can be a strong piece - if you can get it to an active post. So if you have a bad Bishop, don't panic! Just implement one of the following strategies and everything should turn out fine. Freeing the Bishop's Diagonals If you have a bad Bishop, try to move your pawns to another color and free the Bishop's diagonals. Diagram 35 shows a position for which this strategy is appropriate. DIAGRAM 35. White to play A glance should tell you that White's Bishop is bad because two of his center pawns (on d4 and f4) are blocking the Bishop on dark squares. The Bishop's badness is an illusion, though, because White can easily move these pawns and free the Bishop's diagonals. Here's how: 1.f5 (freeing the c1-h6 diagonal) 1...Nf8 2.d5 (freeing the g1-a7 diagonal) 2...Ne5 3.Nxe5 dxe5
4.Bxb6 White will with the game as the capture on b6 also picks up the pawn on a5.
Getting the Bishop Outside the Pawn Chain If you have a bad bishop, activate it by getting it outside the pawn chain. The position in Diagram 36 is not from an actual game, of course, since neither side has a King.
DIAGRAM 36.
However, it provides a good illustration of this principle. White's Bishop is clearly bad; it is also inactive as long as it sits on d2. Does it have to stay there? Of course not! White can turn the Bishop into an active participant in the game by playing Bc1 and then Ba3 (when it comes to life on the a3-f8 diagonal) or by playing Be1 and Bh4 (when its potency increases because of its control of the h4-d8 diagonal). Because Bishops can't jump over other pieces, they need unobstructed diagonals if they are going to be effective. If you have Bishops, you must always be trying to rip open the center. A closed, locked pawn formation is nothing but a hindrance in their battle for activity. Bishops are strongest in wide-open positions. A bad Bishop can only become active if you get it outside the pawn chain. For example, after playing 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4 cxb2 5.Bxb2, we reach a position where Bishops rule the board. Knights simply can't compete with them in this kind of wide-open situation. (Of course, this opening, while offering White wonderful diagonals for his Bishops and a big lead in development, is risky because he has given up two whole pawns.) Compare this position with that reached by 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e5 4.Nc3 d6 5.e4. Now White's Bishops are not so valuable because the center is completely locked up with pawns. y DIAGRAM 37. Black to play With this discussion behind us, you are better able to understand the position in Diagram 37. What should Black do? The first thing to address is the fact that Black has a dark-squared Bishop and White does not. Is this important? Only if you want it to be! If you have such a piece, you must find a way to make it a force in the game. Because White's center pawns are blocking the Bishop, Black should play 1...c5! and blast open the h8-a1 diagonal. After 2.dxc5 Nxc5, Black will have the better position because his powerful Bishop, the same piece that was blocked a moment ago, is now shredding the board. When All Else Fails, Trade If you have a bad bishop that you cannot activate in the two ways just discussed, trade it for a piece of equal or greater value. In Diagram 38, White's game is clearly more comfortable than Black's. DIAGRAM 38. Black to play Cramling-Yrjola, Gausdal 1984 He has two Bishops, his Knight has access to b5 and d5, and Black's lone Bishop is bad because it is blocked by the pawn on e5. Turn the page to see how Black should proceed.
1...h5!
A fine move that prepares to swap the poor piece on g7 for the very active Bishop on e3.
2.Nb5 Rc8 3.c3
Good play by White. The pawn on c3 keeps Black out of both d4 and b4. Notice how masters always try to deprive enemy pieces of good squares.
3...Kh7
Now we see the point of 1...h5. Black is finally ready to initiate the trade of dark-squared Bishops with ...Bh6.
4.Na3 Bh6 5.Bxh6 Qxh6 6.Qxh6+ Kxh6
Black has equalized the position and eventually drew the game. The moral here is: If you don't like the piece you own, improve its position or trade it. Larsen-Fischer Candidates Match, 1971 Now let's look at a game where no less an authority than Bobby Fischer uses the laws that we have been discussing.
1.c4 g6 2.Nf3 Bg7 3.d4 Nf6 4.Nc3 O-O 5.e4 d6 6.Be2 e5 7.O-O Nc6 8.d5 Ne7 9.Nd2 c5 10.Rb1
Ne8 11.b4 b6 12.a4 f5 13.a5 Nf6 14.Qa4 Bd7 15.Qa3 DIAGRAM 39. Black to play In Diagram 39, the center is closed, so both sides have been busy with their respective pawn breaks on the wings. White has made considerable progress on the queenside, and you might expect Black to be in a big hurry with his own attack on the other side of the board. Fischer, though, has a different idea here: He knows that an eventual ...f5-f4 advance is Black's usual way of gaining more kingside space and pursuing his checkmating aspirations. However, that advance will kill the Black Bishop on g7, which is already looking rather useless because of the closed nature of the position. Never a player to forget about the welfare of his pieces, the great Fischer first brings this piece outside the pawn chain.
15...Bh6!
Suddenly, the pathetic piece on g7 has become active.
16.Bd3
Black was threatening to win the e-pawn by 16...Bxd2 followed by 17...fxe4, so White gives this pawn more support.
16...Qc7 17.bxc5 bxc5 18.exf5 gxf5 19.Bc2
White now has the option of getting his own bad Bishop outside the pawn chain with Ba4.
19...a6
Black takes away the b5-square from the White Knight.
20.Nde4?
White would like to play 20.Ba4 but would lose a pawn after 20...Qxa5. The move White actually plays is tricky (it uncovers an attack against h6 via the Bishop on c1), but it only leads to exchanges that speed up Black's kingside attack.
20...Bxc1
Black is delighted to trade his bad Bishop for White's good one.
21.Nxf6+ Rxf6 22.Rfxc1 Raf8 23.Rb6 Bc8
Black defends the a-pawn (why give anything away?) and is finally ready to go after the White King.
24.Ne2 f4!
With his dark-squared Bishop gone, Black is happy to push this pawn. Notice how this advance also frees the c8-h3 diagonal for his light-squared Bishop.
25.Be4 Nf5
Having attended to his Bishop problems, Black now brings his Knight into the attack.
26.Rc6 Qg7 27.Rb1 Nh4 28.Qd3 Bf5
Normally, Black would not trade his good Bishop for White's poor one. However, in this case the White Bishop was defending the critical g2-square, so Black removed it.
29.Kh1 f3! 30.Ng3
Forced. White cannot allow 30.gxf3 Qg2 checkmate.
30...fxg2+ 31.Kg1 Bxe4 32.Qxe4 Nf3+ 33.Kxg2 Nd2
White is doomed. His Queen and Rook are forked, and the pawn on f2 hangs to the battery on the f-file. So Larsen gave up.
TEST 6.
Test 6. Don't look for moves here. Instead, label all the Bishops as either good, bad, active, or inactive. Show/Hide Solution Test 6: The White Bishop on d3 is clearly bad because its center pawns sit on its color and block it. The White Bishop on d2 is good, as is the Black Bishop on d7. The Black Bishop on d4 is bad but active because it has managed to take up a threatening position outside the pawn chain. The Rook Before the Queen's new way of moving was introduced in the 15th century, the Rook was by far the strongest piece in the game. It was so powerful, in fact, that a player attacking it was expected to call "check-Rook". The Rook's powers have remained the same throughout the history of chess, and though its status has been diminished by the Queen, it is still a piece of extraordinary importance Funnily enough, this importance is overlooked by most amateurs, who simply don't know how to make use of a Rook's considerable strength. Most beginners ignore their Rooks at the beginning of a game, and even seasoned tournament players of class A or expert strength fail to make the most of these mighty pieces. DIAGRAM 40. White to play Why do players forget about the Rooks? Most likely, because Rooks are situated at the sides of the board and are often the last pieces to be developed. Many players push out a few pawns (the humble foot soldiers), develop the Bishops and Knights (the warriors on horseback), bring up the Queen (the all-powerful general), and then begin a premature attack, forgetting that backup by the Rooks (cannons that blast their way into the enemy position) would do wonders for their chances of victory. Why refuse to use these cannons when you have them at your disposal? This cannon-like effect is illustrated in Diagram 40. White can blast Black off the board with
1.Qg1, when there is no answer to the devastating 2.Rg8 checkmate. This rout is made possible
because White has followed this strategy: To be effective, Rooks need to be placed on open files. This type of penetration in the enemy position was mentioned by the great Nimzovich, who stated, "The aim of all maneuvers on an open file is the ultimate intrusion along this file onto the 7th or 8th rank, i.e., into the enemy position." The 7th rank is important because most enemy pawns reside there, and control of that critical rank also tends to tie down the enemy King. DIAGRAM 41. White to play Diagram 41 clearly illustrates the importance of the 7th rank. Material is even, but White will win easily after 1.Rc7. His control of the 7th rank leaves Black helpless because the Black King is trapped on the back rank and 2.Rxa7 is threatened. A response of 1...Ra8 is met by 2.Rd7, picking up the d-pawn. DIAGRAM 42. White to play Botvinnik-Alekhine, A.V.R.O., 1938 Let's see how former World Champion Botvinnik made use of this same idea to take down one of the greatest champions in history. White has the better position in Diagram 42 because both his Rooks are already placed on the open c- and e-files.
1.Qc2
White's first move adds to his control of the c-file by doubling, a process where you attempt to lay claim to a particular file with two Rooks or a Rook and Queen. White's move announces, "The c-file is mine!"
1...Re7
Now Black cannot challenge White's claim to the file with ...Rc7, so he turns his attention to the e-file to make sure that White doesn't get that file, too.
2.Rxe7 Qxe7 3.Qc7!
This trade of Queens allows the White Rook to penetrate into the enemy position and take control of the 7th rank.
3...Qxc7 4.Rxc7 f6 5.Kf1
The King prepares to enter the battle. This move also stops future Back Rank Mates and keeps the enemy Rook off the e2-square.
5...Rf7
Black kicks White off the 7th rank.
6.Rc8+ Rf8 7.Rc3!
White's Rook is clearly superior to its Black counterpart, so White wisely avoids further trades. Don't trade any of your good pieces for the enemy's inferior ones!
7...g5 8.Ne1 h5 9.h4!
White is trying to get Black to weaken his pawn structure or give up control of some critical squares. Now 9...g4 gives White control of f4 after Nd3 and Nf4, while 9...gxh4 10.Nf3 regains the pawn and leaves Black with a shattered pawn formation.
9...Nd7 10.Rc7 Rf7 11.Nf3 g4 12.Ne1
White was willing to waste a little time and force Black to create a hole on f4. Now the White Knight hurries to its new home.
12...f5
Not wanting to allow White access to f4, Black tries to plug that square with a pawn.
13.Nd3 f4 14.f3 gxf3 15.gxf3 a5 16.a4!
A good move that fixes the enemy b-pawn on b6.
16...Kf8 17.Rc6
The difference in Rooks is striking. White's Rook is greedily eyeing all the Black pawns, while the ponderous Black Rook is playing a purely defensive role. In the end, White's Rook will eat most of the Black pawns in this series of moves: 17...Ke7 18.Kf2 Rf5 19.b3 Kd8 20.Ke2 Nb8 (Playing for 21.Rxb6 Kc7 followed by 22...Nc6 with defensive chances.) 21.Rg6 Kc7 22.Ne5 Na6 23.Rg7+ Kc8 24.Nc6 Rf6 25.Ne7+ Kb8 26.Nxd5 Rd6 27.Rg5 Nb4 28.Nxb4 axb4
29.Rxh5 Rc6 30.Rb5 Kc7 31.Rxb4 Rh6 32.Rb5 Rxh4 33.Kd3, and White wins.
As strong as doubling on a file can be, tripling is even stronger. In the next example, we see Alekhine's demonstration of how a file should be taken! The only open file on the board in Diagram 43 is the c-file, so Alekhine brings all his big guns to bear on it. DIAGRAM 43. White to play Alekhine-Nimzovich, San Remo, 1930
1.Rc2
White prepares to double.
1...Qe8
Black walks into a series of pins. However, he didn't like the look of 1...Nd8 2.Bd7 Rxc2
3.Qxc2, which gives White control of the c-file.
2.Rac1 Rab8 3.Qe3 Rc7
Black intends to double his own Rooks and challenge White for control of the c-file. White answers by going one better. He will triple!
4.Rc3 Qd7 5.R1c2! Kf8 6.Qc1
This formation - a Queen behind doubled Rooks - is known as Alekhine's Gun in deference to his play in this game.
6...Rbc8
Black has to defend his Knight on c6.
7.Ba4!
White intends to make use of the pin on the c-file by playing b4-b5, which will win a piece.
7...b5
Black puts off this embarrassment by giving up a pawn.
8.Bxb5 Ke8 9.Ba4 Kd8
The Rook on c7 is well defended, and now 10.b5 can be safely met by 10...Na5. Is Black safe?
10.h4!
The answer is a resounding "No!" It turns out that Black is in a rare zugzwang situation - any move he makes will worsen his position. For example, after 10...h5 11.Kh2 g6 12.Kh1, Black is out of moves. The c6-Knight can't budge because of the pin on the a4-e8 diagonal; 12...g5 just hangs some pawns; 12...Qe8 or 12...Ke8 takes away a defender from c7 and loses a piece after
13.b5; and any move by the Knight on e7 or the Rooks drops the c6-Knight. In despair, Black
gives up. We have seen the carnage a Rook can perpetrate on an enemy position. However, the files necessary for this slaughter do not just magically appear. They have to be created in the opening - tailor-made for your Rooks. Most classic openings take the Rook's future into account. For example, after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 (the Sicilian Defense), Black is quite happy to play
3...cxd4 because he knows he has just created a half-open c-file for his Rooks. He will then play
with the goal of getting a Rook on c8 as quickly as possible. White will use the half-open d-file for future operations with his Rooks. The same reasoning applies to another classic opening, the Queen's Gambit Declined. After
1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5, White will eventually place a Rook on c1 and open up the c-
file with cxd5. We even see this strategy at work in the somewhat boring Petroff Defense. Play starts with
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Be7 7.O-O O-O. And with 8.Re1, the
White Rook becomes an instant participant in the battle. The creation and control of open files is so important that sometimes a player will give up quite a bit for the opportunity to use a file to penetrate into the enemy position. In the following game, Fischer accomplishes this goal in a very surprising way. Take a look at Diagram 44, where White's advantage is clear. He has a good Bishop, whereas Black has a bad one (Black's center pawn is on the same color as his Bishop), and the Black pawns on a6 and d5 are both weak. One of White's most important advantages, however, is his wonderful Knight on c5, a piece that eyes the whole board and joins the Bishop in applying pressure to a6. Because of the power of this Knight, White's next move is quite remarkable. DIAGRAM 44. White to play Fischer-Petrosian, Candidates Match, 1971
1.Nxd7+!
He gives up his pride and joy! Why do this when the Knight was perfectly safe and Black had no threats? Because White sees that this exchange will enable him to penetrate into the Black position along the c-file. He trades one advantage (his super Knight) for another (a super Rook).
1...Rxd7
This move is forced, because 1...Nxd7 2.Rxd5 loses the d5-pawn.
2.Rc1
White pounces on the tasty file.
2...Rd6
Black stops 3.Rc6 but gives up control of the 7th rank.
3.Rc7 Nd7 4.Re2 g6 5.Kf2 h5 6.f4 h4 7.Kf3 f5 8.Ke3
Having goaded most of the Black pawns onto light squares (where they are vulnerable to attack by the Bishop), White now aims to bring his King to the dominant d4 post. Notice how great players make use of every man they possess.
8...d4+
This move keeps White's King out of d4 but also opens the a2-g8 diagonal for White's Bishop.
9.Kd2 Nb6 10.R2e7
Doubled Rooks on the 7th (colorfully called Pigs on the 7th) are extremely strong and, in most cases, constitute a winning advantage.
10...Nd5 11.Rf7+ Ke8 12.Rb7 Nxb4 13.Bc4
Black gives up because 13...Nc6 14.Rh7 Rf6 15.Rh8+ Rf8 16.Bf7+ leads to immediate death. So we have seen that it is a huge mistake to neglect your Rooks. As you play, keep in mind this strategy: Whenever possible, get your Rooks to open files that will allow them to move to the 7th or 8th rank. And if you can double your Rooks on the 7th rank, you'll usually have an enormous advantage.
TEST 7.
Test 7. It's White's turn to play. Is 1.d3 a good move, or should White try something else? Show/Hide Solution Test 7: Playing 1.d3 is all right, but it does nothing for the White Rooks. Playing 1.d4! is much more dynamic. After 1...exd4 2.Nxd4, White has made a gain in space. He has also created a half-open d-file that can be used by his Rooks. If Black does not take on d4, then White can take on e5 whenever he wants and create a fully open d-file.
TEST 8.
Test 8. White is two pawns behind, and it's his turn to play. Is he in trouble? Show/Hide Solution Test 8: Actually, White is winning easily despite the negative material count. After 1.Ree7, White creates the dreaded doubled Rooks on the 7th rank. These hungry pigs will eat everything they can get their snouts on while they simultaneously torment the Black King. Here's the play:
1...f6 2.Rxg7 h5 3.Rh7 (threatening 4.Rh8 checkmate) 3...Kg8 (3...Ke8 4.Rc7 Kd8 5.Rcg7 leads
to checkmate) 4.Rdg7+ Kf8 5.g4! hxg4 6.h5. Then nothing can be done to prevent 7.h6 followed by 8.Rhh8 checkmate. The King The King has always been allowed to move one square in any direction. This movement may seem limited, but the eight squares that a centralized King controls make it quite an imposing piece. Actually, the King is a powerful part of your army. If only its capture didn't lead to loss of the game, you could bring it to the center and make use of it immediately. Taking the King for a Walk Though you will usually want to castle quickly to get the King to safety (and also get the Rook into the center), I must admit that once in awhile I enjoy throwing caution to the wind and making use of my King. When people express wonder at my nerve, I ask, "Why should I have to pamper the lazy thing? If it wants to eat, then let it work like all my other men!" Here are a couple of examples of how I've used the King in my games. DIAGRAM 45. White to play Seirawan-Timman, Wijk aan Zee, 1980 As Diagram 45 shows, in this game I have allowed myself to fall behind in development in order to build a strong pawn center and lay claim to a healthy extra pawn. Unfortunately, Black now threatens to wipe me out with 1...Nc2+. Because 1.Qc3 Bxf3 2.gxf3 Qxd4! 3.Qxd4 Nc2+ will result in the destruction of my center and the loss of my pawn, I am forced to pick up my King and make it play an active, defensive role.
1.Kd2!
This move looks crazy, and indeed, it caused quite a commotion at the time in the chess community. But just how silly is my concept? My monarch keeps the enemy Knight out of c2, and if necessary, it can go to c3 where it would guard my important d4-pawn. If I can get my remaining army out before Black somehow punishes me for this violation of an accepted chess dictum, then my King will be safe enough, and my center (not to mention my extra pawn!) will guarantee me a clear advantage. The follow-up proves the soundness of my strategy.
1...a5 2.a3
My first task is to deprive the enemy pieces of advanced squares.
2...Na6 3.Kc2 Qd7
Now I should go on to play 4.b3 b5 5.c5 Be7 6.Bb2. Then everything is in order, I have an obvious edge in space, and I can still boast about my extra pawn. DIAGRAM 46. Black to play Kovacević-Seirawan, Wijk aan Zee 1980 All right, so in that game I had an extra pawn and was willing to suffer a bit to hold onto it. In the next game, I don't have a material advantage, but I nevertheless move my King when it's the logical way to achieve a desired result. In Diagram 46, you can see that my Bishop on g7 is a monster, and it will take me several moves to clear away the back rank so that I can castle on the queenside. But what does White have to crow about? All he has is control of the h-file. Can I take it from him? To do so, I need to connect my Queen and Rook so that I can answer a trade after ...Rh8 with ...Qxh8. Following this line of reasoning, I came up with this surprise move:
1...Kd7!
A great move, if I do say so myself. I instantly get the connection I want. Besides, why would my King be in any danger on d7 as soon as it moves to c7?
2.Nbd2 Rh8
That file is mine!
3.Rg1 Kc7 4.Rb1 Rh3!
With my King nicely tucked away on c7, it's time for me to penetrate White's position.
5.b3 Qh8
This move doubles on both the h-file and on the h8-a1 diagonal.
6.Nf1 N8d7
Now it's time for more of my pieces to enter the fray. Never get carried away and forget about the rest of your army sitting at home. The Black army dominates this position (and it's White's King that is stuck in the middle of the board, not mine!), so I'll tell you how I won the game without further comment:
7.Bf4 Ne5 8.Nxe5 Bxe5 9.Bxe5 Qxe5 10.f3 Bd7 11.Qc2 Qd4! 12.Rg2 Rh1 13.Rf2 Qh8 14.f4
Qh4 15.Rd1 f6 16.gxf6 exf6 17.e5 fxe5 18.fxe5 Rf8 19.exd6+ Kb7 20.Bd3 Re8+ As these two examples illustrate, Early King walks are OK if they benefit your other pieces in some way. Now, I want you to understand two things about these games: • The center was closed or semi-closed in both games. Never walk your King into a wide-open center! • In both games, my King paced across the middle of the board on its way to the other side. In other words, centralizing the King was just a temporary measure. Notice that it was White's King that got killed in the center in my Kovacević game. My King was safely placed on the wing. So how do you know if it's safe to take your King for a walk? A closed center makes such a stroll a lot safer, but it all really comes down to a question of necessity. Is there a clear purpose to the walk? If it helps other aspects of your game, then by all means move that King. But remember: There is a big difference between bringing the King out on purpose and having it drawn out like a hunted animal! The following well-known game is a fine illustration of a King that is forced to move inevitably toward its own death. DIAGRAM 47. White to play Ed. Lasker-Sir George Thomas, London, 1911 From the position in Diagram 47, White makes the following move:
1.Qxh7+!!
By giving up his Queen, White forces the Black King on a journey from which it will never return. Playing 1.Nxf6+ gxf6 would have allowed the Black Queen to defend h7. Now the Black King is forced into the line of fire of the White Bishop on d3.
1.Qxh7+!! Kxh7 2.Nxf6++ Kh6
Black hastily avoids 2...Kh8 3.Ng6 checkmate.
3.Neg4+ Kg5 4.h4+ Kf4 5.g3+ Kf3 6.Be2+ Kg2 7.Rh2+ Kg1 8.Kd2 checkmate
This game hardly teaches any deep chess strategy. It does, however, show what can happen to a King that goes a little too far on the wild side. Remember: Don't allow your King to be led around the board without your approval. Putting the King to Work in the Endgame So far, you have seen that the King can serve a purpose, rather than quivering in fear on the side. You have also seen that it usually can't withstand an attack if several enemy pieces still remain on the board. Once you remove these forces from the board, though, the climate for the King is much more favorable. In general, if both sides have only a couple of pieces left, it's time for you to dust off your King and rush it to the center of the board. There is not enough of the enemy's army left to threaten it (individual checks should not bother you), and you have every right to make use of its considerable strengths. Here's the strategy: The King is a strong piece and must be used in an endgame. When most of the pieces have been traded, rush your King into the center for some action. The next game, which makes a strange comparison with the wipeout witnessed in the previous section, illustrates this point. Both Kings make it to the 6th rank, but one gets butchered by the other. DIAGRAM 48. White to play Cohn-Rubinstein, St. Petersburg, 1909 In Diagram 48, both Kings have come to the center to help their dwindling forces. Black's superior pawn structure gives him the better game, but this doesn't mean that White can do nothing but lose. Unfortunately, though, White decides that a mass exchange will help his cause, when all it really does is allow the opposing King to take up a dominating position.
1.Bxc4 Rxc4 2.Rc1?
White was in check by a strong enemy Knight, so an exchange made sense. However, this trade loses the game. Blocking off the Rook's access to the 4th rank with 2.f4 would have been much better.
2...Rxc1 3.Kxc1 Kf6
Black's King makes a beeline to the isolated pawn on h2.
4.Kd2 Kg5 5.Ke2 Kh4 6.Kf1 Kh3 7.Kg1 e5
Just look at the difference in the Kings' positions. White's King is pushed as far back as it can go, while Black's has trotted up the board with amazing speed. Because White has his hands full defending his h-pawn, Black takes the time to gain extra space with his pawns. Playing 7...e5 prevents White from advancing his f-pawn with 8.f4 because 8...exf4 9.exf4 Kg4 wins a pawn.
8.Kh1 b5
Black immobilizes both of White's queenside pawns with one move.
9.Kg1 f5 10.Kh1 g5 11.Kg1 h5 12.Kh1 g4
Removing some pawns gives the Black King a clear walkway along the 6th rank. Then he will be able to pick up White's immobile e-pawn with ease.
13.e4 fxe4 14.fxe4 h4 15.Kg1 g3 16.hxg3 hxg3
White gives up in the face of possibilities like 17.f4 exf4 18.e5 g2 19.e6 Kg3 20.e7 f3 21.e8=Q f2 checkmate, or 17.fxg3 Kxg3 18.Kf1 Kf3, which enables Black to pick up the e-pawn because of his dominating King position. DIAGRAM 49. Black to play Larsen-Spassky, Lugano, 1968 This game of Rubinstein's was impressive, but it was a case of King vs. King with no other pieces. How effective is the King if other pieces remain on the board? In Diagram 49, the game is pretty even and has all the makings of a boring draw. Spassky starts by offering a trade.
1...Rcd8 2.Rh5?
Larsen, who is always trying for the win, comes up with a highly imaginative concept. However, his strategy contains a fatal flaw: It's usually not a good idea to give up a file like this. Best was 2.Rcd1, which keeps the d-file.
2...h6 3.b4 c4 4.a4?
The great Dane's idea here is to give Black a passed c-pawn but try to undermine it by attacking b5. Also notice that the White Knight has gained control of the d4-square.
4...Kf6 5.axb5 g6!
Very nice. Black will sacrifice a pawn but succeed in drawing the White Rook completely out of play.
6.Rxh6 axb5 7.Nd4 Nd2+ 8.Kg1
White cannot play 8.Ke2 because of 8...Rxd4 wins the Knight.
8...Nb3 9.Nxb3 cxb3
The obstruction on the d-file has been cleared away, and the powerful passed pawn on b3 is going to be the death of White.
10.Rb1 Re4
This move threatens the b-pawn, but it also has a meaner intent: The threat of ...Kg7 will imperil the Rook on h6. The wayward Rook is White's undoing.
11.g3 Rxb4 12.Rh4 Rxh4 13.gxh4 Rd3 14.Kg2 Ke5
Black wins after his King, which constantly hounded the White Rook, marches to the queenside and assists the b-pawn in queening. Black wins because his King plays a part in the battle and White's does not, putting Black effectively ahead in material.
TEST 9.
Test 9. It's Black's move. Which King is better placed? Show/Hide Solution Test 9: Some players might think that Black's King is better off because it still has the right to castle, but castling would just place the King out of the game. On the other hand, White's King is very comfortable on c2. Nothing can attack it; it defends b2 and the three penetration points on the d-file (d3, d2, and d1); and it is ready to rush toward the enemy when a few more pieces are exchanged. If you preferred the White monarch's position, you are beginning to get a good feel for when a King is safe in the center and when it is not.
TEST 10.
Test 10. It's Black's turn to play. What is his best move? Show/Hide Solution Test 10: If you voted for 1...O-O, you made the wrong choice. What would the Black King do on g8? Nothing whatsoever. At the moment, the White Bishop is more active than its Black counterpart. Black should get his King involved in the game and play 1...Ke7! followed by 2...Be6 (after the trade, Black's King would be better placed than White's), which results in a very comfortable position. The Queen The Queen was the weakest piece on the board (except for the pawns) until new Rules were introduced in 1475. Before this change, the Queen was limited to any diagonally adjacent square. Considered to be an advisor to the King, it was given royal status only when it obtained the combined powers of a Rook and Bishop. In Italy, the Queen's new range made such an impression that it was called rabioso, which means furious. Furious indeed! Almost all kingside attacks are led by this amazon, and though professional players enjoy trading it and playing a quiet game, amateurs are usually quite loath to part with this piece. The urge to use her power in an effort to smash the opposition is just too great! Protecting the Queen Funnily enough, the Queen's strength is also a weakness: On the one hand, the Queen loves to be centrally located, which gives it more squares to control; but on the other hand, the Queen can be vulnerable to harassment if it comes out too early. Bearing this in mind, you might want to follow this strategy: DIAGRAM 50. Black to play Don't place your Queen in a vulnerable position. In general, it should be one of the last pieces you bring out. For example, the following situation often arises in games between beginners. They open like this:
1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Bc5 3.Qh5
The position is shown in Diagram 50. Quite logically, White wants to make use of his Queen as soon as possible. He reasons that creating a double threat of 4.Qxe5+ and 4.Qxf7 checkmate can't be bad, forgetting that his Queen will then be vulnerable to attack. After 3...Qe7, which defends against both threats, Black will gain tempo by following up with ...Nf6, developing a Knight to a good square, and simultaneously attacking the Queen. An even more striking example of the Queen's vulnerability can be seen after 1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 (which brings Black's Queen out a little fast; White will be able to gain time by attacking it) 3.Nc3 (tempo number one - the Queen is so much stronger than the Knight that it is forced to run from it in abject terror) 3...Qe5+? (the correct move here is 3...Qa5, which gets the Queen out of harm's way; a commonly seen blunder is 3...Qc6?? 4.Bb5, when the poor lady makes a quick exit from the game) 4.Be2 Bg4 5.d4 (tempo number two - now the beleaguered Queen must hide from the pawn) 5...Bxe2 6.Ngxe2 Qd6? (a terrible move that allows White to gain even more time) 7.Bf4 (tempo number three) 7...Qd8. Disgusted, Black brings his roaming Queen back home. White has developed his whole army while Black played around with just one piece. Of course, if your Queen can remain on a central square, then don't hesitate to place it there! After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 (the Scotch Opening), Black might be tempted to draw the enemy Queen out with 4...Nxd4 5.Qxd4. However, Black would be playing to White's advantage because White's Queen could then eye the whole board from its central square. Why is the Queen safe in this example but poorly placed in the previous example? Because Black can't bring pieces out and attack it with gain of time. Of course, Black could attack it with
5...c5, but after the Queen moves (6.Qa4, for example), what has Black really achieved? Is his
pawn happy on c5? No! It blocks his Bishop and has left a big hole on d5. White will follow up with Nc3 and Bc4, when Black's "gain of time" turns out to be nothing more than a suicidal lunge! The safest way to use a Queen is to first develop your minor pieces, tuck the Queen away on a safe but useful square deep inside your own territory (moving the Queen connects the Rooks), and then bring your Rooks to any open files that may exist. DIAGRAM 51. White to play The position in Diagram 51 is a simple illustration of this strategy. The White Queen cannot safely go to any advanced square at the moment, so White will do best to move it to d2 (to put pressure on d6) or to c2 (to give the e-pawn extra support):
1.Qc2 Qe7
Black was in the same situation. He finally decided to put his Queen on e7, a safe square where it supports the backward d6-pawn.
2.Rad1 Rad8
White brings a Rook to the half-open file, and Black responds by giving his only weakness added support.
3.Rd2
White prepares to double on the d-file, and the game goes on and on. Risking the Queen Sometimes you will desperately want to bring your Queen out to an active but somewhat vulnerable position. In these cases, you must carefully weigh the rewards against the risks, and this type of decision can be difficult even for the greatest players. For example, in Diagram 52, White has just played 1.b4, a move that gains space and threatens the advanced Black Queen. Most people would bring the Black Queen back to a safe square such as d8, but Fischer finds a more active possibility, which though risky, will put the pampered woman to work. DIAGRAM 52. Black to play Larsen-Fischer, Candidates Match, 1971
1...Qe5!
The Queen is very strong here; it can work with the g7-Bishop to control the h8-a1 diagonal and can put immediate pressure on the e4-pawn. However, it is also easy to attack and has nowhere to hide!
2.Rae1
The tactical point of Black's play would become apparent after 2.Bf4 (or 2.Bd4) 2...Nxe4!, which wins a pawn. While 2.Bd3 is answered by 2...Ng4! with a double attack against h2 and c3.
2...Bc6
Black keeps bringing his pieces to bear on e4.
3.Bf4 Nxe4 4.Nxe4 Qxe4
Black has won a pawn and even threatens checkmate on g2.
5.Bd3 Qd4+
Black has won a pawn and his Queen is well placed and he went on to win. In this game, the Queen successfully led the charge, but it's more common to see a Queen dive into enemy territory in an attack against the opponent's King. In fact, in attacks of this kind, it's perfectly normal for the Queen to lead the assault. Here's the strategy: Queens love to lead attacks against the enemy King, but only if the rest of the army can play a part in the assault. DIAGRAM 53. White to play Seirawan-Korchnoi, Wijk aan Zee, 1980 Diagram 53 shows a position from one of my games, which I'll use as an illustration.
1.d5!
Before penetrating Black's kingside with Qh7, I first open up some lines of attack and free my Bishop on b2. My Queen can't beat Black by itself so I insist that other members of my army help it. The pawns that I will give up to accomplish my goal are well worth the price.
1...exd5 2.Qh7
I threaten to capture the pawn on g7.
2...f6 3.Kg1!
I get my King off the dangerous a6-f1 diagonal. Note how I continue the attack only after making sure that my own King is safe!
3...Bxc4 4.Rh4!
I want as many pieces as possible to join in this King hunt.
4...Bxb3 5.axb3 Kf7 6.Rg4
I renew my earlier threat against g7.
6...Rg8 7.Re1
My inactive Rook on d1 finds new life on the open e-file.
7...d4 8.Rxd4 Be5
My Queen is torturing the Black King, while Black's Queen is sitting off on the sidelines doing nothing.
9.Rd7 Qxe1+!
Black wants to get rid of my attacking forces.
10.Nxe1 Bxb2
Black has given up his Queen (worth 9 points) for a Rook, Bishop, and pawn (also worth 9 points), so he is not doing badly as far as material is concerned. Unfortunately for Black, his King is still vulnerable, and my Queen proves to be a very speedy piece. Now I should play
11.Qc2! Be5 12.Qc4+ Kf8 13.Qe6 Re8 14.Nf3 Bb8 15.Nh4 (every piece must take part!), when
the threats of Ng6+ and Nf5 end the game quickly. (In the game, my 11th move was something different, but I won anyway.) My Queen turned out to be an excellent general. It led my whole army on a King hunt and brought back the Black King's head as a trophy. Of course, the difference between a Queen that has decisively penetrated into the enemy position and a Queen that is trapped or out of play can be very small, as the next example shows. DIAGRAM 54. White to play Seirawan-Barbero, Skien, 1979 In Diagram 54, is Black's Queen powerfully posted or out of play? To the untrained eye, Black's Queen may seem to be leading an attack against White's King. But what pieces does it have to help it? None! Such "one-piece attacks" cannot succeed. Now look at White's army. Everything is pointing at Black's kingside. As you'll see if you play through the following game, White has a winning kingside attack. Black's Queen is actually out of play and, as a consequence, will be unable to get back and help defend its King.
1.Rxg7!
This Rook sacrifice draws the Black King into the open and allows the White Queen to join the attack with gain of time.
1...Kxg7 2.Qg5+
White's move is made possible by the pin on the a1-h8 diagonal.
2...Kf7
No better is 2...Kh8, which leads to 3.Qh6+ Kg8 4.Qh7 checkmate.
3.Qxf6+ Ke8 4.Bg6+ Nf7 5.Be5
A nice touch. I gain a critical tempo by attacking the silly Queen on h2, and Black gives up because 5...Qh3 6.Bxc7 leads to unstoppable checkmate on d8. A true team effort!
TEST 11.
Test 11. This position came about after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4!?. It's Black's turn to play. Is bringing out the White Queen so early a good move? Show/Hide Solution Test 11: I am happy if you said that this early Queen move is bad. However, there is actually more to the move than a simple "good" or "bad" label indicates. The Queen is well placed on d4 if nothing can attack it. Is that the case? White is not worried about 4...e5 because that move weakens the d5-square and leaves Black with a backward d-pawn. More bothersome is 4...Nc6, but then White could play 5.Bb5, pinning the annoying Knight. After 5...Bd7 6.Bxc6 Bxc6, the White Queen gets to stay on its perch but at a price: Black now has the two Bishops. This new situation leads to different strategies and fresh problems for both sides. All in all, 4.Qxd4 is playable but certainly nothing for Black to fear. Show in Text Mode

Chapter Five Superior Minor Pieces One of the most intense and interesting strategic battles in chess is that which occurs between a Bishop and a Knight. These two pieces are always trying to humiliate each other, and you need to show a lot of ingenuity to prove that your particular piece is boss. Though many books show some preference for Bishops - a few even say that a Bishop is worth 31⁄2 points compared with 3 for a Knight - in terms of point count, these two pieces are of equal value. Both pieces command a value of 3 points. But of course, you cannot weigh the value of a piece only in terms of point count, and the situation on the board is what delineates the actual worth of a particular piece. This is where real strategy comes in: If you want to engage in a Bishop-Knight battle, you must know how to create the kind of conditions that suit the piece that you possess. If you own a Knight, you must play for a closed position. If you own a Bishop, you must open the position up. (See Chapter Four, "Understanding Where the Pieces Go", for more details about why these conditions suit each piece.) Do whatever it takes to make your piece dominate the enemy's! Bishops over Knights In Chapter Four, you learned that Knights need support points to be effective. It stands to reason, then, that an effective strategy against a Knight is to take away all of its advanced squares so that the poor Knight will never reach its full potential. DIAGRAM 55. Black to play In Diagram 55, Black enjoys a clear advantage because his Bishop is situated on the fine h8-a1 diagonal, while the opposing Knight doesn't have access to any advanced squares. This Bishop is therefore superior to the Knight. Compare this position with the one in Diagram 56. DIAGRAM 56. White to play White's pieces are all on the same squares as they are in Diagram 55, but I have made two changes in the Black camp: The Black Bishop is now on g7, and the pawn has advanced to e5. These seemingly tiny differences completely reverse the statuses of the Bishop and the Knight! Now the Black Bishop is blocked by its own pawns, and the White Knight has access to the d5- outpost. White plays 1.Nb4 followed by 2.Nd5, when his Knight is obviously stronger than the pathetic thing on g7. So here's the first rule to remember when deciding on Bishop-Knight battle strategies: A Knight without advanced posts is inferior to an active Bishop. Don't let the enemy Knight find a good square! And here's the second: When your Bishop is taking on a Knight, open up the position as much as possible. If your pawns block your Bishop, remove these obstacles and treat that Bishop to wide-open diagonals! DIAGRAM 57. White to play Petrosian-Lilienthal, Moscow, 1949 Let's see how the great Petrosian put these strategies to work in one of his games. In Diagram 57, White's dark-squared Bishop already has a good diagonal available on the a1-h8 line. However, his other Bishop is not doing as well. White knows that he shouldn't allow it to play dead. He must find a way to make it a participant in the upcoming battle.
1.g4!
White remembers the excellent rule: Always attack pawn chains at their base. He immediately uses his pawns to blast open the position. By undermining the f5-pawn, White weakens the Black e4-pawn and simultaneously increases the scope of his Bishop on e2.
1...fxg4 2.hxg4 Rc7 3.Kf2
Black threatened ...Rg7, so White gets his King off the dangerous g-file and brings the handsome monarch a step closer to the center in preparation for the endgame.
3...h6 4.Rh1!
Why not place the Rook on an open file where it attacks a weak pawn?
4...e3+
Black knows that one of his pawns is doomed: White would have surrounded the e-pawn by playing Bc3 and Ke3, and he would have gone after the h-pawn with Rh4 and Rah1. So Black sells his e-pawn as dearly as possible: He will force White's Bishop to an inactive square on e3 (away from the a1-h8 diagonal) and give his Knight a home on e4.
5.Bxe3 Ne4+ 6.Kg2 Nf7 7.Bd3!
Suddenly, the forgotten Bishop on e2 makes its presence felt. It turns out that the e4-square is not a permanent support point for the Black Knight because Black does not have a pawn that can defend it.
7...Re7 8.Rae1
White prepares to evict the Black Knight from its new home. With the eviction accomplished, the formerly inactive light-squared Bishop will blast a path of fire down the b1-h7 diagonal.
8...Rfe8
Black's pieces may look comfortable, but in reality they are quite unhappy: His Rooks are playing nursemaid to the Knight on e4; the Knight on f7 is serving the same function for the pawn on h6; and, because the White pawn on f4 takes away the e5 and g5 support points, the f7- Knight has no hope of finding an active, advanced square.
9.Bc1 Nc3 10.Rxe7 Rxe7 11.a5 b6 12.axb6 axb6
Black hopes that these exchanges will make his position easier. Unfortunately, he doesn't realize that his Knight is in danger. He has forgotten the important Knights-need-support-points strategy. An advanced Knight without support points is a shaky animal at best.
13.Bd2 Ne2 14.c3!
The poor thing has nowhere to run and will soon be consumed.
14...b5 15.Kf3
And White will win. Notice how contained the Black Knights were throughout this game. While White's Bishops are doing their jobs on d2 and d3, the poor Knight on f7 has no future, and the beast on e2 - a piece that dared to try for glory - is not long for the board. Remember: A Bishop will usually dominate a Knight in an open position. If the position is not open, make every effort to push those pawns out of the way and activate that Bishop! A Bishop will often beat a Knight in an endgame with passed pawns (or pawn majorities) on both sides of the board because the Bishop's long-range speed allows it to attack enemy pawns from a distance. The position in Diagram 58 shows why a Knight cannot beat a Bishop in situations where the Bishop can use its speed and agility. DIAGRAM 58. Black to play White threatens to promote his h-pawn to a Queen by h7 and h8. However, though the Black Bishop is far away from the kingside, with 1...Bc2!, Black can stop White in his tracks. Now it's up to the White Knight to show how it intends to stop the Black passed pawn on a3. As you will soon see, the poor horse is not up to the challenge. White plays 2.Nd1+, hoping that 2...Bxd1?
3.h7! will allow the White pawn to turn into a Queen after all. But Black responds with 2...Kd2,
and after 3.Nf2 a2, the game is over. The long-range Bishop did its job, while the short-range Knight could not help White reach his goal. In Diagram 59, we see Black winning because four small advantages favor his Bishop. DIAGRAM 59. White to play Kalantar-Petrosian, Erevan, 1948 • White has a majority on the queenside, while Black has a majority on the kingside. Majorities lead to passed pawns, and positions with passed pawns on both sides of the board almost always favor the side with the Bishop. • White's queenside pawns are situated on light-colored squares, making these pawns vulnerable to attack by the enemy lightsquared Bishop. • The position is open, and open positions usually favor Bishops. • Black's kingside pawns will take away any potential support points from the Knight, while the White queenside pawns cannot restrict the activity of the enemy Bishop. Here's how Black takes advantage of this favorable position:
1.Kf2
White correctly brings his King toward the center. Never forget to activate your King in an endgame!
1...f5!
At first glance, Black's move seems illogical because it blocks his Bishop. However, this move fits the needs of the position very well. By pushing his pawn, Black begins to make use of his kingside pawn majority and prepares for the creation of a passed pawn. He will follow up with ...g5, after which the d4, e4, f4, and g4 squares will all be unavailable to the White Knight. If you can, always take away squares from the enemy Knight.
2.Ke3 Kf7 3.Nd3 Bc8
Black intends to attack the c4-pawn and force another White pawn onto a vulnerable light- colored square.
4.b3 g5
Now the White horse can't leap over to f4.
5.Kf3 Kf6 6.Ke3
White cannot do anything active, so he just waits patiently and hopes that Black will not be able to do anything active either.
6...Bd7
The Bishop prepares to swing across the kingside to a point from which it can penetrate into the enemy position.
7.Kf3 Be8 8.Ke3 h6 9.Kf3 Bh5+ 10.Ke3 Bd1 11.Kd2 Bf3 12.Ke3 Be4
It's obvious that the Bishop is superior to the Knight.
13.Kd2 Bxd3!
So why does Black trade a superior piece for an inferior one? Because Black's more mobile majority and his more advanced King mean that the resulting King and pawn endgame is winning for Black.
14.Kxd3 Ke5 15.Ke3 f4+ 16.gxf4+ gxf4+
Black is the first to create a passed pawn.
17.Kf3 Kf5 18.Kf2 Ke4
The Black King's position is now so superior to the White King's that the win becomes easy. Never allow the enemy King to advance this far up the board in an endgame.
19.Ke2 f3+ 20.Kf2 Kf4 21.h4 h5 22.a3 Ke4
White has had enough and resigns because continuations like 23.b4 axb4 24.axb4 cxb4 25.c5 Kxd5 or 23.Kf1 Ke3 (23...Kd3 also wins) 24.Ke1 f2+ 25.Kf1 Kf3 26.b4 axb4 27.axb4 cxb4
28.c5 b3 are quite hopeless.
TEST 12.
Test 12. This position is fairly even except that one side owns a Bishop and the other owns a Knight. It's Black's turn to play, and he wants to move his d-pawn. Should he move it to d6 or d5? Show/Hide Solution Test 12: If you thought that Black should advance his pawn to d5, you have not yet grasped what I have been saying about Bishop vs. Knight strategies. The horrible 1...d5?? doesn't lose material, but I have adorned it with two question marks to denote a blunder of the worst sort. Why would I judge this little pawn advance so harshly? Because it instantly loses the battle of Bishop vs. Knight. With one move, Black closes the center (which favors the Knight), blocks his Bishop by placing a pawn on a White square (which also favors the Knight), and hands the e5- square over to the enemy so that it can become a permanent home for the enemy horse. Playing a move that does all these terrible things is obviously positional suicide. Much more sensible is 1...d6!. This innocent-looking move turns out to be very useful. Now the c5 and e5 squares are inaccessible to the White pieces, the a8-h1 diagonal remains open, and the enemy horse has no advanced squares to jump to. After 1...d6, the Black Bishop, blasting away on its fine diagonal, is clearly superior to the White Knight. The Dominating Knight As I said in Chapter Four, a Knight can easily beat a Bishop if you can close the position or plant your horse on an advanced support point. How strong is a Knight that is firmly planted on the 5th rank? Let's take a look at Diagram 60 and find out. You can see that I am winning this position against the World Champion because my Knight completely blocks his pawns on c3 and c2, covers several squares deep in the White camp (a3, b2, d2, and e3), and only gives the White King one square (e2) to run to. DIAGRAM 60. Black to play Karpov-Seirawan, Mar del Plata, 1982 How does his Bishop compare with my Knight? It serves a defensive function on d4 (guarding the c3-pawn) but blocked by the pawns on c3 and e5. It does have some activity on the g1-a7 diagonal, but nowhere near as much as my accomplished Knight. When you take his endangered King and inferior minor piece into account and then note that his pawns are weak and his Rook is less active than mine, you must agree that I ought to be able to somehow push White over the cliff. Indeed, had I played 1...Qe8!, which threatens the crushing 2...Rh3+ 3.Ke2 Qh5+, I would have surely been victorious. Unfortunately, I failed to take this opportunity and ultimately allowed White to escape with a draw. However, my lack of follow through should not detract from your appreciation of the power of my Knight, which is eating White's position alive. A wonderful horse like this will almost always be stronger than any Bishop, and your strategic sense should be alert to any opportunities to create such a beast. Remember: The prospect of gaining a fine support point for your Knight should excite you. When it can work from a secure base, your horse becomes an extremely powerful piece. So you have seen that a good support point will make your Knight better than most enemy Bishops. How do closed positions help you? If you don't have any support points in a closed position, your Knight may not be a world beater. However, even an average Knight can beat a hemmed-in Bishop. In closed positions, the locked pawns get in the way of the Bishops and often make them absolutely useless. Seirawan-Vukic Nis, 1979 Allow me to demonstrate this closed-position strategy with another of my own games. We'll follow this one through from start to finish.
1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 O-O 5.e4 c5 6.Nge2
I have chosen the setup known as the Botvinnik Formation. I grab firm control of d5, create a space advantage in the center, and dream of pawn advances like b2-b4 (with queenside play) and f2-f4 (with a kingside attack). The price I pay for all these wonderful potential moves is the hole on d4, but I feel that this square can be defended (by the Knight on e2 and the Bishop on e3), and besides, I have always enjoyed playing the White side of this position.
6...Nc6 7.a3 a5
This advance, which weakens the b5-square, is unnecessary because I am not threatening to immediately play b2-b4.
8.O-O d6 9.d3 Ne8
At first glance, this Knight retreat may look strange, but there is actually a lot of logic behind it. Black opens up the a1-h8 diagonal for his Bishop and prepares to swing his Knight over to d4 via c7 and e6. (You didn't think Black was going to leave this Knight on the 1st rank, did you?)
10.Be3 Nd4 11.Bxd4! cxd4
Normally, I would not be in a hurry to give up my fine dark-squared Bishop for a Knight. However, I saw that the resulting position would favor Knights. I can stick one Knight in the hole on b5, while the once-powerful Black Bishop on g7 is now blocked by its own pawn on d4.
12.Nb5 Qb6 13.a4!
DIAGRAM 61. Black to play As Diagram 61 shows, this move kills Black's chances on the queenside, and if the White Knight on b5 is ever taken, I can play axb5 to give myself a superior structure (an open a-file for my Rook and more queenside space). Now only I can initiate play on the queenside (via b2-b4). Because the center is closed (meaning that nobody can play there), the kingside is the only area worth fighting over. I must hasten to gain space there and make that side of the board mine.
13...Nc7 14.f4 Na6
Black brings his Knight within sight of the nice support point on c5.
15.h3 e5
Black's move gives the d4-pawn support.
16.f5
I now enjoy so much extra space on the kingside that I play for a direct attack against the enemy King.
16...Bh6
This Bishop was dead on g7, so it steps outside the pawn chain and gives itself some scope on the h6-c1 diagonal.
17.h4 Bd7 18.Kh2 Nc5 19.Bh3!
My Bishop on g2 was bad, so I move it to h3 and accomplish two goals: I get it outside the pawn chain and give it a new lease on life on the h3-c8 diagonal; and after I play f5-f6 or fxg6, I will trade light-squared Bishops, swapping my bad Bishop for Black's good one. The exchange leaves Black with just one Bishop - a bad one. The strategy here is to deprive Black of control of both colored squares: If you envision battling your enemy with your Knights, don't allow him to own two Bishops because they control both colored squares.
19...g5?
A poor move that weakens the Black King and allows me to play a winning combination. However, Black's choices are limited at this point. The superior 19...f6 would have allowed me to show the superiority of my Knight over his Bishop because after 20.fxg6 hxg6 21.Bxd7 Nxd7
22.h5! gxh5 23.Ng1, Black's kingside is weak and his light squares are riddled with holes. I
could then capture a pawn on h5 (with Qxh5) and then either plug in the hole on f5 with my Rook or bring my Knight there via Nf3, Nh4, and Nf5. My Knights on f5 and b5 would then both be far superior to the enemy Bishop on b6.
20.Nexd4!
This Knight sacrifice allows me to clear the d1-h5 diagonal with no loss of time and bring my Queen to h5 with crushing effect.
20...exd4 21.Qh5 f6
If Black tries to bold on to his Bishop with 21...Bg7, I would destroy him with 22.f6 Bh8
23.Qxg5+, and checkmate follows in one more move.
22.Qxh6 Bxb5 23.axb5 g4
The picture has changed, and I am now the one with the inferior minor piece - Black's nice Knight on c5 is clearly superior to my very bad Bishop on h3. The position is nevertheless good for me because Black's kingside is crumbling. Though the subtle advantages now lie with Black, chess is ultimately about checkmate, and that is what I am playing for! With 23...g4, Black prevents me from exposing his King to more danger with hxg5. He is hoping for 24.Bxg4 Nxd3, after which he will not only have a newly created passed pawn on d4, but his Knight will be able to sink itself into e5 and always be better than my Bishop. I decide to avoid all these positional considerations and go directly for his throat!
24.Rf4!
Does this piece sacrifice demonstrate my bravery? Not at all! I have no choice: If I don't take his King down, my inferior minor piece will cost me the game.
24...gxh3 25.Rg4+ Kf7 26.Rg7+ Ke8 27.Qxh7 Kd8 28.b4!
Very strong. Black can't respond with ...axb4 because of the pin on the a-file, but he can't move his Knight (28...Nxd3, for example) because then 29.Rxb7 threatens both his Queen and Qd7 checkmate.
28...Kc8 29.bxc5 dxc5 30.h5
Black gives up when he sees that 30...a4 31.h6 a3 32.Ra2 leaves him with no useful moves and that the subsequent Rg8 turns my h-pawn into a Queen. Color Control One of my favorite things about a Knight is that it can jump to any color. Though anything placed on the opposite color of a Bishop is safe from its influence, nothing is safe from the Knight because it can control complexes of different colors at will. The next example illustrates this point nicely. In Diagram 62, White's Bishop is on an active post, but because all of Black's pawns rest on or can easily move to dark squares, the Bishop is not a major threat. Can the same be said of the Black Knight? Of course not! It can attack anything on the board, and it can also defend any square. Right now, it is keeping the White King at bay by guarding the c4-square. Black's first order of business is to bring his King over to c5 so that it can keep a cap on c4. The Knight will then be free to move, and the Black King will constantly be threatening to jump into d4. Because the White Bishop cannot touch anything and because the White King cannot penetrate the Black position, White is unable to create any threats of his own. Black can therefore take all the time he wants to implement his plans. DIAGRAM 62. White to play Damjanović-Fischer, Buenos Aires, 1970
1.Bc6 Ke7
Black's King takes the first step in the journey to c5.
2.h4 h6
Another pawn finds rest on a safe dark square.
3.Ke3 Nc8 4.Kd3 Nd6
Black secures a more flexible square for the Knight. It still defends c4, but it also eyes e4 and threatens to eventually move to b5 and c3, where it will attack the White pawn on a2.
5.Ke3 Kd8 6.Kd3
Knowing that his opponent can't do anything but go back and forth is a great luxury for Black.
6...Kc7 7.Ba4 Kb6 8.Ke3 Kc5
Mission accomplished. The Black King seizes c5.
9.Bd7 Kb6
Black is worried that White will somehow be able to penetrate the Black position via g4, so he decides to go back to the kingside, kill all the play there, and then return to c5. Why shouldn't he take his time? What can White do to punish him?
10.Ba4 Kc7 11.Kd3 Kd8 12.Bc6 Ke7 13.Ke3 Ke6 14.Kf3 Kf6 15.g4 g5 16.h5 Ke7
Now White can no longer penetrate on the kingside, so Black heads back to c5.
17.Ke3 Kd8 18.Kd3 Kc7 19.Ba4 Kb6 20.Bd7 Kc5
With the King where he wants it, Black can turn his attention to Knight hopping.
21.Ba4 Nc8 22.Be8 Ne7 23.Ke3 Ng8 24.Bd7 Nf6
The Knight attacks both e4 and g4 from f6. Black has all the time in the world, so why not place all his pieces on their best possible squares?
25.Bf5
Notice that the White Bishop is like a ghost. It can't attack any of the Black pieces because they all reside on dark squares.
25...Kb5 26.Kd3 a4
Black threatens to push this pawn to a3, after which White's a2-pawn will be stuck, and a Knight maneuver to c3 will win that pawn and the game.
27.bxa4+
White stops the threat of ...a4-a3, but allows the Black King to get deep into the White position.
27...Kxa4 28.Kc4 Ka3 29.Kc5 Kxa2 30.Kxb4 Kb2 31.Kc5 Kc3 32.Kd6 Kd4 33.Ke6 Nxe4
The White pawns start to fall, and the end is in sight.
34.Kf7 Nf2 35.Kg6 e4 36.Kxh6 e3 37.Kg7 e2 38.h6 e1=Q 39.h7 Qe7+ 40.Kg8 Ne4
White gives up because 41.h8=Q+ Nf6+ results in the capture of the newly born Queen, while
41.Bxe4 Kxe4 42.h8=Q Qe8+ 43.Kg7 Qxh8+ 44.Kxh8 Kf4 also leads to an easy win for Black.
The guiding principle behind Black's relentless strategy is: When your opponent is helpless, take your time and torture him! You have seen that it is very important always to be on the lookout for ways to make a minor piece superior to its enemy counterpart. In the next example, Black has a chance to saddle White with a very bad Bishop. With the position shown in Diagram 63, Black should initiate a series of trades that leave him with strong Knights vs. bad Bishops. DIAGRAM 63. Black to play Botvinnik-Bronstein, World Championship Match, 1951
1...Bxe2! 2.Rxe2 Bxc3 3.Bxb6
Playing 3.bxc3 Nc4 would leave Black with a powerful horse on c4.
3...axb6 4.bxc3 g5!
With this move, Black fixes the enemy pawns on light squares, where they get in the way of their own Bishop. Black would then follow up with ...Nd7, when his Knight (which can always go to c5 or even make its way to f4) would be much stronger than the sad thing on g2. Unfortunately, Black played this position differently and missed this chance. Seirawan-Short London, 1982 I finish this chapter with a game in which I first give my opponent my two Bishops. Then I trade off his light-squared Bishop, leaving him weak on the light squares because his remaining dark-squared Bishop cannot influence that color. Finally, I turn my Knight into a rampaging monster that is far stronger than any mere Bishop.
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Bg5 h6 4.Bxf6 Qxf6
Black now has two Bishops to my one, so I play to make the position healthy for Knights.
5.Nc3 b6 6.Nf3 Bb7 7.e3 g6 8.Bd3 Bg7 9.Be4!
I want to get rid of his light-squared Bishop, even if it means sacrificing my own, so that he can no longer control both colored squares with Bishops.
9...Bxe4 10.Nxe4 Qe7 11.Qa4 O-O 12.O-O d6 13.Rad1 Nd7 14.Qc6!
The trade of Black's queenside Bishop has left him weak on the light squares.
14...Rfc8 15.Ne1
I know... Knights don't belong on the 1st rank. But this horse is just on its way to greener pastures; it's heading for c6 via d3 (or c2) and b4.
15...Nf6 16.Nxf6+ Bxf6 17.Nc2 Qe8 18.Nb4! Qxc6 19.Nxc6
DIAGRAM 64. Black to play Diagram 64 shows that my mighty Knight is paralyzing the Black position, while the enemy Bishop is doing nothing at all.
19...Kf8 20.b4
The b-pawn rushes to give the Knight some support and also gets off the a1-h8 diagonal in case I choose to advance my d-pawn to d5.
20...Ke8 21.Rd3! Kd7 22.d5 Bg7 23.e4 a6 24.a4
Black's Bishop controls an open diagonal, but there is nothing on that diagonal to attack!
24...Re8 25.Rf3! f5 26.g4
I am trying to blast open the f-file. Black can't capture either my e- or g-pawn because of the piece-winning Rf7+.
26...Rf8
Playing 26...exd5 27.exd5 is even worse because it leads to 27...Re4 28.gxf5 g5 29.Re3!, which wins a pawn.
27.gxf5 gxf5 28.exf5 e5?
Better was the obvious 28...exf5, though 29.Re1 would not have given Black any joy. I would then have a far superior position because I would own the e-file, my minor piece would be wonderful, and the Black pawns on f5 and h6 would be weak.
29.Rg3 Bf6 30.f4! exf4 31.Rxf4 Rae8 32.h4!
I want to keep the Bishop out of g5.
32...Re1+ 33.Kg2 Ra1 34.Rg6 Ra2+ 35.Kh3 h5 36.Re4
I threaten checkmate by 37.Rxf6 and 38.Re7+, utilizing my Knight.
36...Ra3+ 37.Kg2 Ra2+ 38.Kh3 Ra3+ 39.Kg2 Ra2+ 40.Kg3 Ra3+ 41.Kf2 Bd8 42.Rf4
Now I threaten to push my passed f-pawn to f6.
42...Bf6 43.Re4 Bd8 44.Ke2
Black didn't allow me to push my pawn, so I will have to try another idea.
44...Ra2+ 45.Ke3 Rxa4 46.Na7!
By taking the c8-square away from the Black King, I increase the threat of Rg7+ to enormous proportions.
46...Ra3+ 47.Ke2 Ra2+ 48.Kd1 Ra1+ 49.Kc2 Bf6
Black is desperately trying to keep me out of g7.
50.Re6 Bh8 51.Rh6
A decisive switch as I'm now heading for h7. Black can't stop my Rook with 51...Rf7 because that would hang his Bishop.
51...Ra2+ 52.Kb3 Rb2+ 53.Ka3
Finally, I put a stop to the series of annoying checks.
53...Rg2
Black intends to answer 54.Rh7+ with 54...Rg7 blocking the check. I stop this defense and renew my threat.
54.f6 Rfg8 55.Rh7+
And Black resigns because 55...Kd8 56.Ree7 followed by Na7-c6+ ends in checkmate. While it was a struggle we could see how utilizing an advanced Knight it was possible to break down the defense on both colors.
TEST 13.
Sefc-Petrosian, Vienna, 1957 Test 13. It's Black's turn to play. Is 1...Nxc2 a reasonable move? Show/Hide Solution Test 13: No! Playing 1...Nxc2?? would be a positional blunder of incredible proportions because you would be trading off a dominant Knight for a truly pathetic Bishop. After 2.Rxc2, White would suddenly be able to make use of the d-file by playing 3.Rd2 and 4.Rd5+, which is impossible as long as the Knight remains on the wonderful d4-square. In the actual game, Petrosian played 1...Rg5 and tortured his helpless opponent for a long, long time. Black eventually won when he found a way to break into the White position. Show in Text Mode

Chapter Six How to Use Pawns In 1749 André Philidor announced that pawns were the "soul of chess". Nobody really understood what he was talking about at the time, but 160 years later Emanuel Lasker explained Philidor's comment this way: The pawn being much more stationary than the pieces, is an element of the structure, the way the array of pawns is placed determines the character of a position and hence also the plan appropriate to it. Lasker was pointing out something that every master is now well aware of: that the placement of the pawns is one of the most important factors to take into consideration when choosing a strategy. Philidor called pawns the soul of chess because their state determines the plan you will follow. In this chapter, we examine the different types of pawn structures and the strategies that are typically followed because of them. Using Pawns as Blocking and Restricting Agents Pawns cannot swoop down the board in a single bound. In fact, they are actually rather ponderous creatures. What they can do, however, is block other pawns and keep the enemy pieces off certain key squares. Diagram 65 shows an example. White is two pawns ahead and threatens to gain more space by playing f4-f5 (which also opens a diagonal for his bad Bishop) or d4-d5 (which turns the blocked c-pawn into a passer). DIAGRAM 65. Black to play Black can put an end to White's evil intentions, though, with 1...e6!. This move uses the e- pawn as a blocking unit that immobilizes both the White d- and f-pawns. After 1...e6, Black will play 2...Ne7 and place his Knight on either d5 or f5. Black's beautiful Knight (once it reaches either of these posts) and the fixed nature of the White pawns combine to eradicate any chance White has of winning this game. Black made good use of this strategy: Whenever you can, use your pawns to fix your opponent's pawns Now let's look at Diagram 66. DIAGRAM 66. Black to play The position is the same as the previous one, with three significant differences. I have moved the White c-pawn back one square from c5 to c4; I have moved the White pawn on h4 back one square to h3; and I have taken the White pawn on a5 and placed it on g3. Now White will win the game because this pawn position ensures that be will be able to play either d4-d5 or f4-f5 at will.
1...e6 2.g4 hxg4 3.hxg4 Ne7
Black tries to stop White from advancing his pawns.
4.Bf2!
Now with Bh4, White will get his Bishop outside the pawn chain.
4...Ke8
Note how White's pawns on c4 and g4 keep the Knight out of the d5 and f5 squares.
5.Bh4
White threatens to engineer a winning pawn endgame with 6.Bxe7.
5...Ng8
If Black plays 5...Nc8, then White would play 6.a5! to keep the Black Knight out of the b6- square. This is a nice example of using a pawn to restrict the activity of an enemy piece.
6.Bg5!
White dominates the poor Knight. Now it can't go to h6 or f6, and it will be traded if it dares step onto e7.
6...Kd7 7.f5 gxf5+ 8.gxf5 exf5+ 9.Kxf5 Ke8 10.d5
At this point, Black should quietly give up. White has admirably followed this strategy: Use your pawns to take away squares from the enemy pieces. Examples from a couple of my own games will further demonstrate this blocking and restricting strategy. In Diagram 67, my opponent's Bishop and e2-Knight are blocked by the pawns on d4 and f4. Naturally, he would like to correct this problem by advancing his f-pawn from f4 to f5. Why should I let him do this? My first move stops his f-pawn in its tracks. DIAGRAM 67. Black to play Van der Wiel-Seirawan, Baden, 1980
1...g6!
I must admit that this type of move can be dangerous. It does nothing to promote my development, and It weakens the dark squares on the kingside. However, I can disregard both drawbacks because the center is closed, which means that my opponent's pieces can't get to my King, and his Bishop can't jump over his f4-pawn to take advantage of the weaknesses I just created.
2.b3 Na6
I don't want him to free his pieces with d4-d5, so I bring my Knight to c7, where it helps control the important d5-square.
3.Bb2
White threatens to take advantage of my weakness on the a1-h8 diagonal with 4.d5!, uncovering an attack on my f6-Knight and pinning it to the h8-Rook.
3...Be7
I defend my f6-Knight. Now I can chop off the White pawn if it dares to advance to d5.
4.c4 Nc7 5.Qf3 O-O
White's advances on d5 and f5 have been stopped, so I can now take the time to castle, which I would normally do much earlier.
6.Nc1 Nce8!
This Knight is heading for g7, where it defends my King and stops f4-f5 once and for all.
7.Nd3 Ng7 8.Ne5 Qc7 9.h3 Rad8
My well-intentioned move, which puts another defender on d5 and also targets his d-pawn, is slightly inaccurate. The immediate 9...h5! was correct.
10.Rad1?
White mistakenly gives up on the fight for f5. He should have played 10.Ne2 followed by g2- g4, which keeps my Knights out of both f5 and h5.
10...h5! 11.Ne2 h4!
Suddenly, my wishes come true! if my opponent ever plays g2-g4, I will snap off his pawn with ...hxg3, thereby compromising his pawn structure. Now the f5 and h5 squares fall under my complete control because White's g-pawn has been neutralized.
12.Ng4 Nfh5! 13.Qc3 Kh7 14.Rf3 Nf5 15.Ne3 Bf6
The White pawns on d4 and f4 were never allowed to move, and now they turn out to be targets. My pieces on d8, f5, h5, and f6 are all aiming at them!
16.Ng4 Bh8 17.Ne5?
This mistaken move allows a pretty little combination based on the pin along the d1-d8 file.
17...Nxf4! 18.Rxf4 Bxe5 19.Re4 Bf6
White can't play 19.dxe5 because of the unprotected state of the Rook on d1.
20.Rf1 c5! 21.Qd3 cxd4
After I use the pin along the a1-h8 diagonal to pick up his other pawn as well, White resigns. My strategy of restraining his pawns on d4 and f4 proved to be a resounding success! In the next example, shown in Diagram 68, White has a significant lead in development and will try to defeat me on the kingside with f4, g4, and eventually f5. My protected passed pawn is useless at the moment (White will block it by playing Nd3), so I must accept that I have no active counterplay opportunities and do something to stop my opponent's plans. DIAGRAM 68. Black to play Timman-Seirawan, Lone Pine, 1978
1...h5!
By preventing g2-g4, I stop his kingside pawn-storm and create a useful home on f5 for my Knight. It is very important to get used to this type of restrictive pawn device. Even though I am behind in development, I can live with my pawn move because the center is closed and his pieces can't get to my King. However, if the center were open, I would want to get my King castled fast!
2.Nd3 Nf5
By using my h-pawn to restrict his g-pawn, I have provided the perfect niche on f5 for my Knight.
3.f4?
A poor move that restricts his own pieces! Now the Bishop on d2 and the Knight on d3 are both blocked by the f4-pawn. More worrisome was 3.f3 with g2-g4 to follow.
3...Qb7 4.N1f2 Nd7 5.Qe4 Qxe4 6.Nxe4 a5!
I love to use my pawns to shatter my opponent's possibilities. Now b2-b4 is prevented, and if White tries to prepare for b2-b4 with 7.a2-a3, I will play 7...a5-a4! (7.a3 a4!) to restrict him further.
7.g3 Be7 8.Kf2 Nh6
I can see that White intends to control the f5-square with h3 and g4, so I will move my pawn to f5 and stop that plan, too!
9.h3 f5 10.exf6 gxf6 11.Rae1 Kf7 12.Ke2 Rhg8!
Having stopped his g-pawn from advancing, I train my big guns on it and begin to treat it as a weakness
13.Kd1 Nf5 14.Rg1 Nb6!
Now I take aim at his queenside pawns, too. I won the game after the following skirmish:
15.b3 a4 16.Ndxc5 axb3 17.axb3 Nxg3! 18.Rxg3 Rxg3 19.Nxg3 Bxc5 20.f5? exf5 21.Nxf5 d3
22.Bc3 Ra3 23.Kd2 Rxb3 24.Ra1 Bb4 25.Ra7+ Kg6 26.Ne7+ Kg5 27.Bxb4 Nxc4+ 28.Ke1
Rxb4 29.Rd7 Rb1+ 30.Kf2 Rb2+ 31.Kg1 d2, 0-1. Victory was mine because I used my pawns to fix my enemy's pawns on certain squares, turning them into stationary targets. We all know that it is much easier to hit something that cannot run away!
TEST 14.
Test 14. It's Black's move. He enjoys a superior King and a good Bishop versus White's poor piece on f1. What would you do if you were Black? Show/Hide Solution Test 14: Black should play 1...g5! without a second thought White's problem is that all his pawns are fixed on light-colored squares, making them vulnerable to attacks by the enemy Bishop. With 1...g5!, Black also fixes the g4 and h3 pawns on light squares and simultaneously places his own kingside pawns on black squares. Don't forget to use your pawns to restrict the movement of the enemy! After 1...g5! 2.Bd3 h6 3.Be2 (3.Bf5 Bg2 picks up the h3-pawn)
3...Be4! (and not 3...Bg2 4.Kf2 Bxh3?? 5.Kg3, after which the Bishop is trapped) 4.a3 a5!
(fixing the b3-pawn on a vulnerable square and threatening to win it with ...Bc2) 5.Kd2 (letting the Black King in, but 5.Bd1 loses the h-pawn after 5...Bg2 6.Kf2 Bxh3 7.Kg3 Bf1 and the Bishop escapes, whereas 5.Bf1 hangs b3 after 5...Bc2) 5...Kf4 followed by ...Kg3 with material gain. Advancing Pawns Pawns love to advance. Sometimes they will happily jump upon the enemy's swords, sacrificing themselves so that other pieces can live better lives. Advancing pawns can push other pawns aside, opening files and diagonals and making previously inactive pieces something to be feared. At other times, they will become runners and try to turn into Queens. In this section, we'll look at examples of strategies involving advancing pawns. Using Pawns as Sacrificial Lambs DIAGRAM 69. White to play In Diagram 69, White's pawn on d4 appears to be blocking the whole White army. The Bishop on b2 and Queen on a1 are ramming their heads into this pawn; the Rooks are deprived of an open file by its presence; and the Knight on f3 cannot go to d4 because the pawn is already on that square. A good move is 1.Ne3, which prepares to bring the Knight to g4 and also prepares for a d4-d5 advance However, why not sacrifice the d-pawn? Isn't such a sacrifice worth activating all those pieces?
1.d5!
White threatens to capture the Bishop on h8.
1...Bxb2 2.Qxb2
Now the rude d-pawn threatens to advance to d6 and fork the poor Black Knights. Black has no choice; he must take the gift.
2...cxd5
Suddenly, the White pieces are extremely active, and the Black army is held back by its own pawn on d5.
3.Ne5
White brings the Knight into the attack with gain of tempo.
3...Rd6
White threatened to win the Exchange with 4.Nxd7, so Black moves his Rook to safety.
4.Ng4!
Now it's very clear that the weakened dark squares around Black's King will lead to his demise. Threats like 5.Nh6+ Kf8 6.Qh8+ wins, while 5.Nf6+, which forks the King and Queen, are unstoppable.
4...e5
Black tries in vain to block the a1-h8 diagonal.
5.Qxe5
And White wins because Black cannot counter the threats mentioned earlier. DIAGRAM 70. White to play Portisch-Pachman, Moscow, 1967 In Diagram 70, we see the same ideas as those expressed in the previous example, but not quite so pronounced. The White Bishop on b2 is blocked by its own pawn on d4, while the Bishop on f3 is hitting an unyielding target on c6. By sacrificing his d-pawn, White can blast open files and diagonals and give all his pieces a new lease on life.
1.d5! exd5 2.Bxg7
White, who possesses the two Bishops, would not normally want to allow this kind of exchange. In this instance, however, White sees that the trade of this minor piece will weaken the Black King.
2...Kxg7 3.cxd5 cxd5 4.Rdxd5 Qc3 5.Kg2 b6 6.Rhf5
Because of the initial pawn sacrifice, White's pieces are obviously more active than their Black counterparts, and his King is clearly safer than the Black monarch. With 6.Rhf5, White prepares to initiate an attack on the weak f7-pawn.
6...Ng6 7.Rxd7 Rxd7 8.Bd5
The Bishop demonstrates its activity and joins in the fight against f7.
8...Re7 9.Qg4 f6 10.Rh5
Though the Bishop's activity has been enhanced, the f7-pawn is no longer weak. So White turns his attention targeting the h7-pawn.
10...Qc7 11.Be4 Qd7 12.Rxh7+!
This obvious but pleasing sacrifice crashes through Black's defenses.
12...Kxh7 13.Qxg6+ Kh8 14.Qxf6+
Having captured two pawns and a Knight while giving up a Rook, does not give White a material advantage. It's the attack against the denuded Black King that gives White a winning advantage.
14...Kg8
If Black plays 14...Rg7??, then after 15.Qf8+ Rg8 16.Qh6+ he will face checkmate.
15.Qg5+ Kf8 16.Bd5
Black resigns because checkmate is threatened on g8, and 16...Rg7 runs into 17.Qf6+ Ke8
18.Bc6 winning the Queen.
We've seen that pawns can run ahead of the pieces and sacrifice themselves to create roads into the enemy camp. Another reason for the marauding pawn to advance to its own death is to vacate a square that would be more suitable for one of its own pieces. For example, in Diagram 71, the Black Knights appear to be playing a purely defensive role. Refusing to accept this fate, Black sacrifices a pawn to create a fine home on the 4th rank for his horses. They can then play a part in the construction of an attack against the White King. DIAGRAM 71. Black to play te Kolste-Nimzovich, Baden-Baden 1925
1...f4! 2.gxf4 g4!
Black didn't like 2...gxf4+ because after 3.Kh1, the threat is 4.Rg1.
3.Bg2 Nhf5
So Black has lost a pawn, but he has gained a wonderful Knight on f5 and active pawns on the h- and g-files.
4.Qb3
White is in no mood to activate the Black Rooks with 4.Qxb7 Rb8 followed by ...Rxb2.
4...dxc4
Black creates a home on d5 for the other Knight.
5.Qxc4+ Kh8 6.Qc3 h5 7.Rad1 h4
Compare Black's mobile pawns with the blocked, useless thing on f4.
8.Rd3 Nd5 9.Qd2 Rg8 10.Bxd5 cxd5 11.Kh1 g3
Black's strong Knight (courtesy of 1...f4, the vacating pawn advance) and active pawns translate into a powerful Black attack. Note how White's inactive pawns on d4 and f4 are blocking his own pieces on d2, d3, e2, and f1. White would have been well advised to try to implement this strategy': Make your pawns work for you in an active way. Don't allow them to sit around like lumps, blocking your own pieces. Grooming Pawns for Promotion It's clear that pawns can aid the rest of your army. However, their ability to promote to a Queen or a lesser piece if they can reach the last rank makes them a mighty force in their own right. When a pawn's promotion is imminent, the very pieces that once snubbed the lowly pawn will desperately try to block its forward progress with their own bodies. (Knights are particularly good at blocking pawns; see Chapter Four.) If the pawn can manage to get through this blockade, however, it may very well find itself on the way to glory. If you have a passed pawn, your obvious strategy is to actively work for its promotion. Remember: Don't allow a passed pawn to get blocked. If your opponent does manage to block it, do everything in your power to remove that blockader. Once your pawn is free to move forward, it will help you make the enemy army bow before your might. Let's look at some examples. In Diagram 72, Black has managed to block White's passed pawn with his Knight. DIAGRAM 72. White to play Unfortunately for Black, White can break this blockade with 1.Nb5!. Black doesn't want to trade Knights because White's c-pawn would queen, so he has to give up the blockade on c7. Then 1...Na8 2.c7 Nb6 (Trying to establish a new block on c8) 3.Nd6! leads to 4.c8=Q Nxc8
5.Nxc8, and White has won a piece.
In the next example, another passed pawn is driving the opposing forces crazy. In Diagram 73, Black's powerful passed pawn on c2 is dying to turn into a Queen. All Black has to do is break that final block on c1 and push his pawn through the portal of metamorphic change. DIAGRAM 73. Black to play Korchnoi-Karpov, Moscow, 1971
1...b6
This simple move restricts the activity of the White Queen and Bishop and also defends against the threat of Qxa7.
2.f3 Nd6 3.Qd3 Rc6!
Black defends the Knight and frees the Queen for active operations. Note that a response of
4.Rxc2?? Rxc2 5.Qxc2 Qxe3+ costs White his Bishop.
4.a4 Qc4 5.Qd2
White decides against the trade and retains the Queens, hoping he can use his Queen to bother the Black King with some checks at a later time.
5...Nf7!
Black's move is both defensive and attacking. On the defensive side, the Knight retreats to a safe place, defends g5 again (preventing any possible Bxg5 sacrifices), and stops any annoying checks on d8. On the attacking side is the potential threat of 6...Ne5, when the duel jumps of
7...Nxf3+ and 7...Nd3 are overwhelming.
6.f4
Preventing the Knight from hopping to the e5-support point.
6...g4 7.b5 Rc8 8.Qd7 h5 9.Kf2 Qc3 10.Qf5 Re8
White resigns. He has no good way to defend his Bishop: 11.Qg6+ Kf8 ends the checks, while
11.Re1 Qxe1+ 12.Kxe1 c1=Q+ wins the house.
DIAGRAM 74. White to play Silman-Grotts, Santa Barbara, 1989 Diagram 74 shows two opposing pawn majorities. (The concept of majorities is discussed in the next section.) White wants to turn his majority into a powerful passed pawn by playing e5 and d6, so he focuses all his moves on this strategy.
1.Rd1!
White backs up the d-pawn, defends the Queen, and threatens to chop off the Rook on c6.
1...Rc5 2.e5 e6 3.d6
White eventually would have gotten this passed pawn anyway, but Black was hoping to tie White down to the defense of e5.
3...Qd7
This blocking move prevents White's pawn from advancing to d7.
4.Qe3 f6 5.f4 fxe5 6.fxe5 Rf5 7.h3 Qa4 8.Red2! Qd7
Black cannot allow d6-d7. For example, 8...Rfxe5 9.Qxe5! Rxe5 10.d7 wins immediately.
9.Re1
White has now switched his Rooks around so that both are protected by the Queen. With everything safe, White will trade a pair of Rooks (making it easier to defend the e-pawn) and proceed to break down the blockade on d7.
9...Rf8 10.Rf2 Rxf2 11.Qxf2 Rc8 12.Rf1 Qg7 13.Qf6! Qd7
Black avoids 13...Qxf6 14.Rxf6 Re8 15.Rxe6! Rxe6 16.d7, which promotes the pawn.
14.h4
Because Black is helpless, White advances his h-pawn and rips open the protective shield of the Black King. Now Black is faced with a horrible choice: checkmate or a Queen trade and a lost Rook endgame. The dominant theme of this game has been the protected passed d6-pawn.
14...Re8 15.h5 Qg7 16.Qxg7+ Kxg7 17.h6+!
This pawn sacrifice pulls the Black King away from the action and allows the White Rook to penetrate the Black position and ultimately win the e-pawn.
17...Kxh6 18.Rf7 Kg5 19.Re7 Rc8 20.Rxe6 Kf4 21.d7
Black gives up. Salvation could not be found in either 21...Rc1+ 22.Kh2 Rd1 23.Rd6, or
21...Rd8 22.Re7 Kf5 23.e6 followed by 24.Re8, when the final blockade is shattered and White
crowns his new Queen. Drawbacks to Pawn Advances We have seen how an advancing pawn can activate pieces and work for its own promotion. However, a pawn's movement up the board can have some negative consequences. The one qualm I have about a pawn advance is that it can easily lead to the weakening of a specific square or a whole complex of squares. I'll show you what I mean. DIAGRAM 75. White to play The rather boring position in Diagram 75 illustrates how pawn advances can create weak squares. White's pawn on c2 controls the b3 and d3 squares. However, it has the potential to control the b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, d4, d5, d6, d7, and d8 squares. That's a lot of potential! Sadly, every time a pawn moves, it loses a bit of that wonderful potential. For example, 1.c3 loses control of d3 and b3, and 1.c4 gives up d3, b3, d4, and b4. It's clear that we pay a heavy price for every pawn move we make! In the present position, playing 1.c4 is quite good because it blocks Black's c-pawn (which in turn blocks Black's bad Bishop) and gains greater influence over the hole on d5. White does not worry about losing control of d3 or d4 because his other pawn on e2 can control these same squares! White will follow with Nc3 and Nd5, after which his Knight clearly outguns its Black counterpart on f8. Play might continue with 1...Kg7, and now 2.e4? would be a horrible move because it permanently gives up the d4-square (which Black would make use of by playing ...Ne6-d4). The correct move would be 2.Nc3 Ne6 3.e3!, when Black's Knight is deprived of that nice central support point. So while you are seeking out the best strategy to follow from a given position, bear in mind the following: Aside from running down the board, pawns also keep enemy pieces out of critical squares. When you push a pawn, be sure you are not handing a juicy square to your opponent on a plate!
TEST 15.
Test 15. It's White's turn to play. Is 1.f4 a good move? Show/Hide Solution Test 15: Playing 1.f4 is tempting. It forces the Knight back and fixes White's kingside pawns on dark-colored squares. However, this pawn advance is really a poor move. The reasoning behind this assessment takes into account the ability of the Black Rooks to penetrate the White position. At the moment they can't. The e1, e2, e3, and e4 squares are all well defended. After 1.f4?, though, the picture changes. Now e3 is vulnerable and will be used as a home for the Black Rooks. Black might also be able to bring his Knight to that square by ...Nh7, ...Nf6, ...Ng4, and ...Ne3. The moral? Watch out for pawn moves that tempt you with promises of attack but leave gaping holes in their wake!
TEST 16.
Test 16. Black intends to win White's advanced (but blocked) pawn by ...Ke7, ...f6, ...Kd6-c5, and ...Kxb6. It's White's move. Can he do anything to stop Black? Show/Hide Solution Test 16: White can win immediately by breaking the blockade on b7 with 1.Bd5!, which leaves Black with no good defense. Remember, if you have a passed pawn, break the enemy's blockade and ram that pawn down his throat! Working with Pawn Majorities Possessing a pawn majority means that you have more pawns in a given area of the board than your opponent does. Pawn majorities are useful in that they usually allow you to create a passed pawn. Many players consider a queenside majority to be stronger than a kingside majority because your opponent's King more often than not castles on his kingside and may be far away from your queenside.
DIAGRAM 76.
In Diagram 76, we can see two typical pawn majorities. White enjoys a three-to-two majority on the queenside, and Black has a four-to-three majority on the kingside. Whoever has the move obtains the advantage. If White has the first move in this position, he will win with 1.a5 followed by 2.a6 because Black will be unable to stop the pawn from promoting to a Queen. Black has the first move, he will set up a win by playing 1...b6!. Black's two pawns will then be stopping White's three, and the immobile, devalued majority becomes nothing more than a target. Play continues with 2.c5 (or 2.Kg2 Ke6 3.Kf3 Kd6 4.Ke3 Kc5 5.Kd3 Kb4, which allows Black to snack on the a-pawn) 2...Ke6! (and not 2...bxc5?? 3.a5, because then the a-pawn ends up promoting after all) 3.Kg2 Kd5. Black's King can then eat everything on the queenside. DIAGRAM 77. White to play Yates-Alekhine, The Hague, 1921 Of course, you shouldn't place too much emphasis on the value of one majority over another because other factors, such as King position and the quality of the pawns, usually play a part in deciding who will win. For example, here is what Alekhine said about the position in Diagram 77: "The ending in this game is noteworthy in the sense that White's celebrated Q-side pawn majority proves to be completely illusory." Regarding this I must remark that one of the most characteristic prejudices of modern chess theory is the widely held opinion that such a pawn majority is important in itself - without any evaluation of the pawns that constitute this majority, or of the placing of the pieces. In Diagram 77, Black has the following compensation:
1. Great freedom for his King in comparison with the White King.
2. The dominating position of the Rook on the only open file.
Used correctly, these two advantages should provide the basis for a win. Let's see how the game was played:
1.g3 Kf7 2.c5 Kf6
Black has a clear advantage because his King will go to e5, where it will eye both sides of the board, and his kingside pawns will roll forward, annexing space and continuing to restrain the White King. In fact, the combined weight of his active Rook, his Bishop, his beautifully centralized King, and his swarming pawns all adds up to a mighty attack against White's King.
3.Bc4 Bc8!
Because Black is playing for an assault against the White King, he correctly reasons that he should keep as many pieces on the board as possible.
4.a4?
The White King should have dashed to e1, from which it can take part in the game.
4...g5 5.b5
White is trying to make use of his majority, but the Black pieces stop his pawns from going anywhere. Don't forget that White is playing a King down - Black has three pieces to use compared with White's two. How can White hope to force his pawns through when he is at such a point count disadvantage?
5...f4 6.Kf1 Rd2
It's always a good idea to place your Rook on the 7th rank. Here, it traps the White King on the back rank and threatens to go behind White's queenside pawns and attack them.
7.gxf4 gxf4 8.Ke1 Rb2 9.Be2 Ke5! 10.c6 bxc6 11.Rxc6
White is trying to get his Rook active. If he plays 11.bxc6, the Bishop on c8 will stop the passed pawn from going anywhere.
11...Be6 12.Bd1 Rb1
Now Black threatens to win a piece with ...Bg4.
13.Rc5+ Kd4 14.Rc2
If Black plays 14...Bg4, White intends to meet it with 15.Rd2+. Black's next move stops this possibility.
14...e3 15.fxe3+ fxe3 16.Rc6 Bg4
White's King is pinned to the back rank and surrounded by the Black army. The end is near.
17.Rd6+ Ke5 18.h3 Bh5!
White resigns. If 19.Rd8 e2, the Black passed pawn will carry the day. Pawn Majorities in the Endgame The fact that a pawn majority often enables you to create a passed pawn proves to be most useful in an endgame. As a result, if you have a healthy majority, you should try to simplify the position so that your majority will have some weight. It does you no good to rave about the wonders of your pawn majority if your opponent can swoop in with his pieces and behead your King! Remember: The strengths of a pawn majority are best shown in the endgame. In the following example, Capablanca demonstrates the correct way to use a queenside pawn majority. He trades some pieces, steers the game into a simplified position where kingside attacks and hand-to-hand fighting will simply not take place, and then pushes his pawns for all their worth! DIAGRAM 78. Black to play Marshall-Capablanca, U.S.A., 1909 In Diagram 78, Black possesses a queenside majority, but at the moment this advantage is meaningless because Black's Knight is under attack. If he moves the horse to c6 by 1...Nc6, then
2.Nxc6 bxc6 will turn his once-mighty majority into a weak, doubled mess. A retreat to f5 will
also lead to disaster; after 1...Nf5? 2.Qa4+ Bd7 3.Nxd7 Qxd7 4.Qxe4+, the central Black King will feel the heat. Capablanca's answer? His Knight jumps to f3 and forces the exchange of some pieces, which creates a quiet position. Under these less complicated circumstances, Black's queenside majority has a chance to flourish.
1...Nf3+ 2.Nxf3 exf3 3.Qxf3 O-O 4.Rfc1?!
Marshall was a great attacking player, and this series of trades has produced a position that is not to his taste. He understandably did not like 4.Qxb7, which leads to 4...Qxb7 5.Bxb7 Rab8 followed by ...Rxb2, but he should have hastened to get his central majority into play by means of 4.e4. White's failure to make use of his own pawn majority allows Black to take control of the game.
4...Rab8 5.Qe4? Qc7! 6.Rc3 b5 7.a3 c4
It's now clear that Black's queenside pawns are playing an active role in the game while White's central pawns are just sitting passively watching. This difference gives Black a free hand: He doesn't have to deal with the enemy pawns, so he can do whatever he wants.
8.Bf3 Rfd8 9.Rd1 Rxd1+ 10.Bxd1 Rd8 11.Bf3 g6
Black takes a moment out to give his King a little breathing room. With no Back Rank Mates to worry about, he can go focus on his majority without worrying about his own King.
12.Qc6 Qe5 13.Qe4 Qxe4 14.Bxe4 Rd1+! 15.Kg2 a5 16.Rc2 b4
Everything Black does is designed to make use of the power of his pawn majority.
17.axb4 axb4 18.Bf3 Rb1 19.Be2 b3 20.Rd2
White is trying to hold onto b2. He would lose immediately after 20.Rc3 Rxb2 21.Bxc4 Rc2!
22.Rxc2 bxc2, when the pawn promotes to a Queen.
20...Rc1!
Black threatens to win with 21...Rc2.
21.Bd1 c3 22.bxc3 b2 23.Rxb2 Rxd1
Black wins a piece because 23.Bc2 Rxc2 is even worse for White. Black's majority is gone, but he can now lay claim to a material advantage, and he goes on to win in a slow but sure manner. Here are the remaining moves for those who wish to see the great Capablanca's technique:
24.Rc2 Bf5 25.Rb2 Rc1 26.Rb3 Be4+ 27.Kh3 Rc2 28.f4 h5 29.g4 hxg4+ 30.Kxg4 Rxh2
31.Rb4 f5+ 32.Kg3 Re2 33.Rc4 Rxe3+ 34.Kh4 Kg7 35.Rc7+ Kf6 36.Rd7 Bg2 37.Rd6+ Kg7
And Black resigns.
TEST 17.
Test 17. It's White's turn to play. Who has the advantage in this position? Show/Hide Solution Test 17: Black has the advantage. White's pawn majority on the queenside is doubled, and is thus devalued because it cannot produce a passed pawn. Play might proceed like this: 1.a4? (White should play 1.Rc3 and hang on for dear life)
1.a4? Rd3, and now neither 2.a5+ Kb7 or 2.axb5 axb5 brings White any benefit at all.
Working with Pawn Islands An isolated group of pawns (or a lone isolated pawn) is known as a pawn island. In general, the more pawn islands you have, the weaker your pawns as a whole become. Why? To find an answer, we must look at the old but useful rule: Always attack a pawn chain at its base. DIAGRAM 79. Black to play The base of a pawn chain (a line of connected pawns) is the only place that is not protected by a pawn, making it vulnerable to attack by enemy pieces. So the more pawn islands you have, the more points of attack your opponent has. I'll illustrate this point with an example. After the well-known opening moves 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5
3.e5 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3, suppose Black decides to trade by playing 5...cxd4. (It's a bit early to
make this capture because this move frees the c3-square for the White Knight. However, it makes the illustration easier to understand.) White responds with 6.cxd4, and the position is now as shown in Diagram 79. Obviously, the e5-pawn is a hard nut to crack. It is well defended by the Knight on f3 and, more importantly, by the pawn on d4. However, the pawns on d4 and e5 are a pawn chain, and Black knows he should always attack a pawn chain at its base. So the pawn on d4 is the one to go after because it is not supported by another pawn. Black should train all his pieces on the d4- pawn and force White to take a defensive stance.
6...Qb6
Now Black has two pieces aiming at d4.
7.Be2 Nge7 8.Na3 Nf5
The Black army is working together rather nicely toward its single-minded goal of attacking the base pawn on d4. Black may not win this pawn, but he is forcing White's pieces to take up passive positions in order to keep it on the board. How does this example relate to the subject of pawn islands? The more pawn islands you have, the more bases you will have to defend, so the first pawn-island strategy is: Avoid creating pawn islands, because lots of pawn islands translates to lots of vulnerable pawn bases.
DIAGRAM 80.
The position in Diagram 80 is a bare-bones example of the disadvantage of multiple pawn islands. Black has one mass of connected pawns (one pawn island), whereas White has three. The one potential weak point in Black's chain stands on f7. (I talk more about weak squares in Chapter Seven.) White, though, has three vulnerable base points on b2, f4, and h4. If this were a real position with pieces on the board, White could face some hardship simply because he has three points to defend compared with Black's one. The flip side of the first pawn island strategy - avoiding the creation of your own pawn islands - is this second strategy: Whenever you can, create pawn islands in your opponent's camp. Those islands give you extra weaknesses to attack! DIAGRAM 81. White to play Fischer-Trifunović, Bled, 1961 The next example shows the importance of this strategy. In Diagram 81, Fischer needs to recapture his pawn, and at the moment he has two options: He can capture on e6 with 1.Rxe6, but this move leaves the pawn island count even at two each. Or he can capture on d4, which leaves Black with three pawn island - the one on e6 being particularly vulnerable to attack. Fischer chooses the second option.
1.Nxd4 O-O 2.Qg4 Nxd4 3.Rxd4 Qc8 4.Re4
White forces Black to defend his e-pawn.
4...Rf6 5.Be3
Having tied Black down to the defense of the pawn on e6, White takes a moment to bring the rest of his army into play.
5...Qd7 6.Rd1 Qc6 7.Bd4 Rg6 8.Qe2 Rd8 9.g3 Qd5 10.Re1
White has defended himself against Black's cheap tricks and now gangs up on that e-pawn again.
10...c5 11.Bc3 Rd6 12.Be5 Rd8 13.Bf4 c4 14.Rxe6 Rxe6 15.Qxe6+ Qxe6 16.Rxe6
White makes use of his extra pawn and eventually wins the game. DIAGRAM 82. White to play Seirawan-Kveinys, Manila, 1992 Fischer isn't the only Grandmaster who recognizes the weakness of multiple pawn islands. I have followed this strategy myself on many occasions, and the next example is from one of my own games. Analysis has shown that, given the position in Diagram 82, my best plan is 19.Nfd4 followed by b4 (gaining lots of queenside space). I considered this idea, but preferred to generate immediate pressure down the half-open d-file. Though Black could gain a measure of freedom by ...f7-f6, I felt that the pawn islands this move created would ultimately lead to my advantage. Here's how the game went:
1.Rd2 f6 2.exf6 Qxf6 3.Qxf6 gxf6
I don't mind allowing these exchanges because the weakness of Black's three pawn islands will give me all the winning chances.
4.Rfd1 Bxb5 5.cxb5 Nb8 6.Nd4
Black is under pressure. He can't play 6...e5 because he then cedes the f5-square to my Knight. Also horrible is 6...d6 or 6...d5 because that move hangs the pawn on e6. It's clear that his central pawn island - and later his pawns on a7 and h6 - are going to be real sore spots in his position for the rest of the game.
6...Kf7 7.Bh5+ Ke7 8.Bxe8 Rxe8 9.f4 Rc5 10.Kf2 h5 11.Kg3
Black's game is horrible. His pawns on d7 and h5 are weak, and his Knight is all but useless. Though I ultimately botched this game and let my opponent escape with a draw, you should now be able to see why taking on extra pawn islands is a responsibility that players should not accept lightly. In my final pawn-island example, Grandmaster Hübner deliberately plays into a position where he has more pawn islands than his opponent in the hope that he can generate active piece play to compensate for the weaknesses that the pawn islands leave in their wake. Alas, poor Hübner finds that these weaknesses are harder to defend than he anticipated. DIAGRAM 83. White to play Larsen-Hübner, Busum, 1969 In Diagram 83, White has the better game because his pawn structure is superior. Black has three pawn islands to two, and his isolated pawn on a7 is a constant source of worry. Also bothersome are his pawns on c6 and c7. Black wants to maintain his pawn on c6 because it keeps the White army out of d5. However, if he plays ...d7-d6, his c6-pawn will be chopped off by the White Bishop on g2. If Black could magically merge his two queenside pawn islands by placing his a-pawn on b7, then his problems would be solved. The d-pawn could then advance to d6 (because the newly created pawn on b7 would defend c6), and the once weak a-pawn would fit snugly with the rest of the pawns. But this magical cure is just fantasy. Black's a-pawn will never get to b7, and he will be forced to worry about it and the doubled c-pawns for the rest of the game.
1.Rb1
White wants to develop his dark-squared Bishop on d2 and move his Queen to a4. This course of action would take away all of the b-pawn's defenders, though, so White gives it extra support and gets his Rook off the vulnerable a1-h8 diagonal.
1...Rd8 2.Rd1
The Rook goes to the half-open d-file, where it can eye the Black d7-pawn.
2...Nh6 3.h3 Nf5 4.Bd2 Qe7 5.Qa4
Everything is defended, so White is finally ready to go after Black's weak-points.
5...Bb7 6.Qa5
White threatens to eat the c7-pawn. He avoids 6.Qxa7?? because after 6...Ra8! 7.Qxb7 Rdb8
8.Qxc7 Be5, the White Queen is trapped.
6...Qe5 7.Ne4
White welcomes ...Qxa5 because Bxa5 would bring the Bishop to a square where it can carry on the attack against c7. In the meantime, White hops his Knight in the direction of the fine c5- square.
7...d5 8.cxd5 cxd5 9.Nc5
Black has undoubled his pawns, but his a- and c-pawns continue to be targets, the c-file has become available for the White Rooks, and the c5-square has turned into a huge hole that has lured the White Knight.
9...Ba8 10.Bc3
White simultaneously defends his b-pawn and attacks the Black Queen.
10...d4
Tired of being pushed around, Black sacrifices a pawn in a desperate bid to relieve some of the pressure.
11.exd4 Qe7 12.d5 Bxc3 13.Qxc3 Nd6
Black is a pawn down and has no compensation at all. He simply can't overcome the weakness of his two queenside pawn islands.
14.a4
White keeps the Black Knight out of b5 and prepares to advance his queenside pawns and gain extra space there.
14...Qe2 15.b4 a5 16.b5 Qc4 17.Rbc1 Qxc3 18.Rxc3 Ne8 19.Rcd3 Rb6 20.Nb3
The imminent loss of Black's a-pawn signals the end of the game, and he resigns.
TEST 18.
A. Ivanov-Seirawan, U.S. Championship, 1992 Test 18. It's White's turn to play. How many pawn islands does each side have, and which side would you prefer to play? Show/Hide Solution Test 18: Both sides possess three pawn islands in this well-known theoretical position. Black's pawns on a7 and d5 are potentially weak, and White's pawns on f3, f2, and h2 are nothing to boast about. Though many books about openings claim a slight advantage for White, I have always felt confident with the Black side. My centralized King can take part in the battle, and my d-pawn also happens to be a passed, and therefore dynamic, pawn. In my game with Ivanov, White played 1.O-O and after 1...Ke6 2.Re1+ Kf5 3.Be3 Be7 4.Rad1 Rhd8 5.Rd4 g5! (stopping checks on f4) 6.Red1 Ke6 7.Re1 Kf5 8.Red1 Ke6, the chances were completely even.

Chapter Seven The Creation of Targets Most people think that chess is all about checkmating the enemy King. Though this is technically true, in the vast majority of master games, an actual checkmate occurs only after the waging of a bitter positional struggle. Usually, the winning player first builds up a series of small advantages that inevitably reveal weaknesses in the enemy camp. By eventually penetrating onto weak squares and making them his own, or by winning weak pawns, the player emerges victorious by virtue of the superior size of his army. One of the most important chess-playing traits you can develop is a mind-set that I call target consciousness. When you have this mind-set, you are always looking for ways to exploit the weaknesses of your opponent. You should become so enamored with this idea that when you play, you become obsessed with creating targets (weak points) in the enemy position. Once the target materializes, you should systematically search for ways to hit it, and you should not rest until every weakness of your opponent has been turned into an advantage of your own! Here is the strategy: Emulate the great chess masters. They are all mini-Terminators. They scope out targets and hunt them down mercilessly until they can use them to their own advantage! Weak Pawns An isolated pawn, a doubled pawn, or a backward pawn is usually thought to be weak. Indeed, most amateurs will do just about anything to avoid these kinds of pawns because they believe the pervasive misinformation that labels such pawns as doomed to eventual destruction. This kind of labeling is actually a form of chess bigotry. Why should the words isolated, doubled, or backward signify that a pawn is weak? In chess, a pawn or a square is only weak if it can be attacked. If an enemy piece cannot get your pawn, then there is no reason to worry about its safety, regardless of whether it is isolated, doubled, or backward. DIAGRAM 84. White to play Petrosian-Barcza, Budapest, 1955 In Diagram 84, we see a position where the so-called weak pawns actually deserve their name! Black's pawns are all horribly weak. They are so rotten, in fact, that White will just eat one after another. The Black pawn on b6 is isolated and stands on an open file, which makes it easy to attack. The Black d- and h-pawns are also isolated, and the miserable doubled f-pawns speak for themselves. Compare this wreck of a pawn position to White's pawns. All the White pawns, with the exception of the backward pawn on e3, are healthy. They are well protected, can move to safe squares, and should be on the board for a lot longer than the sick Black ones. (Those of you who read Chapter Six will note that Black has four pawn islands to White's one.) Small wonder that Black's pawns will drop like overripe apples.
1.Rxb6
The first victim falls. Now 2.Nxf6+ is threatened.
1...Rc6 2.Rxc6 Rxc6 3.Ra8+ Kd7 4.Ra7+ Rc7 5.Rxc7+
White, who is dining on Black pawns and will soon have a significant material advantage, is happy to trade pieces because this thinning of material keeps Black's counterplay to a minimum.
5...Kxc7 6.Qxh7 Qa2+ 7.Kf3 Qd2
Black threatens 8...Qd1+.
8.Qb1!
White stops the check. When you are ahead in material, your first priority is to stop all enemy counterplay (see Chapter Three). Then if you can restore the positional balance, your material edge will give you a certain victory.
8...f5 9.Ng3
All the White pieces come home to aid their King.
9...Bh4 10.Ne2
White gives Black nothing with this move. Playing either 10.Qxf5 Qd1+ or 10.Nxf5 Qf2+ would make things unnecessarily messy.
10...Be7 11.h3 Bb4 12.Ng3
Now the possibility of a check on f2 is gone, so White can eat again.
12...Kc6 13.Nxf5 Kb5 14.Nd6+ Ka4 15.Nxf7 Ba3 16.Ne5
Having devoured everything, the satiated Knight returns home. Because 16...Bc1 can now be met by either 17.Ng4 or 17.Qd3, Black gives up. He has endured more than enough punishment! Now let's compare the doubled pawns in the game we just looked at with the ones in the next example. The position in Diagram 85 came about after these boring but common opening moves:
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bc4 Bc5 5.O-O O-O 6.d3 d6. In this position (typically seen in
children's matches), DIAGRAM 85. White to play White can play the excellent 7.Be3!, after which 7...Bxe3 8.fxe3 gives White doubled e-pawns. Why does White allow this? The doubled pawns are welcomed by White because he sees that, at the moment, the pawn on f2 is doing nothing at all. On e3, though, it becomes a dynamic contributor because the doubled pawns on e3 and e4 defend the critical d4, d5, f4, and f5 central squares. In addition, the f2-pawn's absence from the f-file gives White a half-open file for his Rooks. Finally, White also sees that his doubled pawns will not be weak. Do they appear weak to you? The e4-pawn is well defended, so the only pawn that could by any stretch of the imagination be a target is the guy on e3. How can Black attack this pawn? It doesn't stand on an open file, so the enemy Rooks can't do anything to it. After something like 8...Ng4, White can simply defend himself with 9.Qe2 (or 9.Qe1) and then chase the bothersome horse away with h3. So these doubled e-pawns are not weak at all. On the contrary, they are active participants in the battle for key central squares. Given all these considerations, Black would be well advised to avoid 7...Bxe3 and instead play either 7...Bb6 (inviting 8.Bxb6? axb6!, which suddenly gives Black an a8-Rook with a half-open file to use and doubled b-pawns that are not weak at all) or 7...Bg4!. After the latter move,
8.Bxc5 dxc5 would make Black happier than White. Why? Because the c-pawns are quite safe
(let White try to attack them after Black plays ...b7-b6!), and the pawn on c5 helps control the important d4-square. To make matters even better for Black, the pawn's removal from d6 gives Black use of the half-open d-file, which benefits both his Queen and Rooks. Clearly, doubled pawns are not necessarily weak! Attackable weak pawns might result from an enemy error, but you cannot count on any opponent to make this kind of error. It is up to you to find ways to create these weaknesses. That is what this particular strategy is all about. Once you create the target, then you can go all out and attack it. One of the most useful methods of creating weak pawn targets is a strategy known as the minority attack, which goes like this: Employ two pawns to attack a pawn majority of three, with the goal of leaving your enemy with weak squares and pawns. DIAGRAM 86. Black to play Reshevsky-Miagmasuren, Sousse, 1967 Diagram 86 illustrates the minority attack strategy quite nicely. White is playing on the queenside because his pawns point in that direction (his pawn chain occupies f2-e3-d4) and give him extra territory there. By advancing his b-pawn, White intends to play b4-b5 followed by bxc6, when Black will be left with a weakness (a pawn that cannot be protected by another pawn) on either d5 or c6. If Black answers this capture with ...bxc6, he will be left with a backward c-pawn on an open file (meaning that it can be easily attacked). Black strives to avoid this fate, but he ends up with a target on d5 instead.
1...b6
Black hopes to answer 2.b5 with 2...c5. A more common and more dangerous plan for Black is to seek counterchances on the kingside, because that is where Black's extra territory exists. For an example of this plan, see the Bobotsov-Petrosian game in Chapter Nine.
2.Nc1!
White is in no hurry to play b4-b5 and instead improves the positioning of his pieces. Bringing this Knight to the center (it's heading for e2) defends c3, d4, and f4 and helps deprive the enemy of counterplay because all of White's key points will soon be well guarded.
2...Bh6 3.N1e2 Nh5 4.b5
Now Black cannot play 4...c5 because of 5.dxc5 and 6.Qxd5, which wins a pawn.
4...Qd7 5.bxc6 Rxc6 6.Qb5
Having deprived the d-pawn of its c6-support, White goes about attacking this newly created target.
6...Rec8
Black avoids the obvious 6...Nf6, which loses to 7.Nxd5! Rxc2 8.Nxf6+.
7.Rbc1 R8c7
Black is hoping that the pin on the c-file will save him. Unfortunately, White's next move leaves Black's position in tatters.
8.g4! a6
Black has no other options because his poor Knight cannot move! Both 8...Nf6 and 8...Ng7 run into 9.Nxd5!, after which a recapture on d5 allows 10.Rxc6, and 9...Rxc2 loses the Queen to
10.Nf6+.
9.Qxa6 Nf6
Black sacrificed a pawn to draw the White Queen away so that it would no longer attack c6. This solution to his problems turns out to be an illusion, though.
10.Nxd5!
Black thought he had prevented this capture! Now what can he do? Playing 10...Rxc2 is still met with 11.Nxf6+.
10...Nxg4
Desperation. Black finally noticed that his intended 10...Nxd5 fails because of 11.Rxc6 Rxc6
12.Qa8+, when White eats a snack on c6 after all.
11.Rxc6 Qxd5 12.Qa8+
Black gives up because he sees that 12...Kg7 13.Rxg6+! leads to the loss of his Queen. Averbakh-Donner Beverwijk, 1962 It is amazing how quickly a position can collapse when you actively seek to create targets and attack them. This complete game example shows a more typical minority attack battle.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 Be7 5.cxd5 exd5 6.Bg5 c6 7.Qc2 g6 8.e3 Bf5 9.Bd3 Bxd3
10.Qxd3 O-O 11.O-O Re8
DIAGRAM 87. White to play The game is quiet, and, as Diagram 87 shows, neither side has any real weaknesses. White decides he has to strike at something, so he starts an immediate minority attack.
12.Bxf6
This move draws the Black Bishop away from its control of b4 and allows White to safely advance his pawn to that square.
12...Bxf6 13.b4 Nd7 14.b5 Nb6 15.bxc6 bxc6
The game now revolves around the newly created weakness on c6.
16.Rac1
White brings his pieces to bear on the c6-target.
16...Be7 17.Rc2 Bd6 18.Nb1 Rc8 19.Rfc1 Qf6
Black indirectly defends the c6-pawn. Now 20.Rxc6?? loses to 20...Rxc6 21.Rxc6 Bxh2+ followed by 22...Qxc6.
20.Nbd2
White brings his Knight back into play. (Never leave a Knight sitting around on the 1st rank.) He also keeps the enemy horse out of c4.
20...Rc7 21.g3
This move restricts the scope of the Black Bishop and gives the King a little room to breathe. Now 22.Rxc6 is a real threat.
21...Rec8 22.Kg2
Black is on the defensive, so White takes a moment off to bring an extra defender to his f3- Knight. The King also keeps enemy pieces out of h3.
22...Qe7 23.e4!
White gains space in the center. He doesn't fear 23...dxe4 because 24.Nxe4 helps to activate his Knight. True, White would then have an isolated d-pawn, but no Black piece would be in a position to attack it.
23...Bb4 24.h4 Qd8 25.e5
White keeps taking more and more space. Realizing that he is being pushed back on all fronts, Black tries to activate his pieces with ...c6-c5.
25...c5 26.dxc5 Rxc5 27.Rxc5 Rxc5 28.Rxc5 Bxc5
Black managed to get the Rooks off the board (a good trade because the White Rooks were more active than their Black counterparts), but he still has an isolated d-pawn. White hastens to block it with his Knights, fixing the pawn on d5 and also demonstrating that his Knights have found a permanent hole on d4. Remember: always strive to dominate the square directly in front of an isolated pawn!
29.Nb3
White attacks the Bishop and brings everything to bear on d4.
29...Be7 30.Nbd4
This Knight is very strong on d4. Now 30...Nc4?? loses to 31.Nc6 Qd7 32.Qxd5! Qxd5
33.Nxe7+, which wins a piece and a pawn.
30...Qc8 31.Qb5 Kf8 32.Nc6 Qb7 33.Nfd4
It's clear that Black's Bishop is inferior to White's Knights.
33...a6 34.Qa5 Ke8 35.Nxe7
White would not normally be in a hurry to trade off his wonderful Knight, but the exposed position of the Black King gives White a chance to start a decisive attack.
35...Kxe7 36.Qc5+ Ke8 37.e6! Nc8 38.exf7+ Kxf7 39.Nc6
White is threatening 40.Qxd5 and 40.Nd8+ with a royal fork.
39...Kg7 40.Qd4+ Kh6 41.Qf6
Black is helpless against the threat of 42.Ne5 followed by a check on f7 or g4. If he plays
41...d4, White's easiest answer is 42.Kh2, breaking the pin. Black resigns. White's strategy has
paid off: Weak enemy pawns don't just magically appear; you must create them.
TEST 19.
Wood-Seirawan, Seattle, 1994 Test 19. It's White's turn to play. My last move was 1...Qd6, attacking White's pawn on f4. After 2.g3, I had achieved an important goal. What was that goal? And how should I continue? Show/Hide Solution Test 19: If you noticed that there is a Bishop vs. Knight battle going on, pat yourself on the back and buy yourself something decadent. I wanted White to play g2-g3, which places another pawn on a black square and hurts his dark-squared Bishop by not allowing it to get outside the pawn chain via a Be3-f2-h4 maneuver. After 2.g3, I immediately gained space on the queenside and prepared a minority attack with 2...b5!. Later I was able to play ...Rb8, ...b5-b4, and ...bxc3, a series of moves that left White with attackable weaknesses on the queenside. I eventually attacked and surrounded these targets, which proved to be enough for the victory. Weak Squares Though most players can easily understand the concept of a weak pawn, they sometimes find it much harder to grasp the idea of a weak square, also known as a hole. I remember one player arguing with me, "You always say that a pawn is weak only if it can be attacked, so you must hope you'll eventually capture it. But you can't ever capture a square. So how can you call a square weak?" My answer was that you can capture a square! Of course, I don't mean you can take it off the board and place it in a box with the other captured pieces. By capturing a square, I mean you can make it serve your army by acting as a home for your pieces. For example, in Chapter Four, you learned that Knights need advanced support points to reach their full potential. A support point is nothing more than a square that has been swayed to your own cause. It supplies a safe haven for your Knight while the horse makes threats in all directions. You can claim that a square is yours - that you have captured it - when it is safe from attack by enemy pawns and is nailed down by your own pieces. Because these captured squares increase the power of your pieces, they are obviously quite valuable. How do you get your hands on these valuable items? Do they just fall into your lap or, as with weak pawns, do you have to fight to create them? In the next example, Anatoly Karpov shows us how it's done in a game against Walter Browne in San Antonio in 1972. After 1.c4 c5 2.b3 Nf6 3.Bb2 g6, a glance shows that no weak squares exist. Karpov changes this assessment with a surprising capture.
4.Bxf6! exf6
White does not give up his strong fianchettoed Bishop to double Black's pawns because the doubled pawns won't be weak in any way. He gives it up because he sees that when the e-pawn is drawn away from e7, it will not be able to exert any control over d5. In other words, White is playing to create a weak square!
5.Nc3
Having created a weakness on d5, White proceeds to "capture the square" by training the sights of all his pieces in that direction.
5...Bg7 6.g3
With 5.Nc3, White obtained a firm grip on d5, but he is not satisfied with just a little control: He wants total domination of that square! By playing 6.g3, he allows his light-squared Bishop to join in the d5 orgy.
6...Nc6 7.Bg2 f5
Black also has a Knight, a Bishop, and a pawn hitting d4. Does that mean that he can lay claim to that square? No.
8.e3
Now none of the Black pieces can land on d4.
8...O-O 9.Nge2
White intends to add to his control of d5 with an eventual Nf4, and in fact White went on to win this game. The rest of the moves are not important here. What is important is how White went out of his way to create the weak square, and how White rushed all his pieces to it. It's also important to pay attention to why White owned d5, while Black didn't own d4. The d4-square was not Black's because the White e3-pawn defended it. DIAGRAM 88. White to play Fischer-Durao, Havana Olympiad, 1966 The creation of weak squares is one of the most important strategies in chess because it affects the strength of your pieces. Every good player is well aware of this fact. Let's see how Bobby Fischer uses weak squares to create homes for his men. The position in Diagram 88 seems solid for both sides. No holes seem to exist, but appearances were never enough for Fischer. Watch how he plays directly for the creation of a weak square.
1.dxc5 dxc5
White makes this seemingly harmless exchange because he wants to get Black's d-pawn away from d6. Its removal from that square allows White to advance his e-pawn and lay claim to both d6 and f6.
2.Qe2 b6 3.e5!
White has begun his battle for two advanced posts in the heart of the Black position. He will play Bf4 (adding to his control of d6) or Bg5 (aiming at f6), Nbd2-e4 (hitting f6 and d6), and Rd1 (training more stuff on d6). Notice how, once be creates the weak square, be immediately brings all of his pieces to bear on it. While the weak-square strategy is important, remember this: Control of a square alone will not necessarily lead to victory. You must also have other advantages that combine to bring the opponent down. In Diagram 89, White has total control of the wonderful d5 post, and his Bishop is extremely strong on that square. Can't Black's Bishop move to d4 and be just as powerful? The answer, unfortunately for Black, is no. Black's Bishop can get to d4, but it can't work with the rest of his army as nicely as White's does. White is in the middle of attacking the kingside with his pawns and Rooks, which will place themselves behind those advancing pawns, and his Bishop, which aims in that direction, will help White with his attack. Black's Bishop will look very picturesque on d4, but it simply can't do anything in relation to the other Black pieces. Remember: Chess is a team effort. One macho piece cannot win a game by itself! White's army is playing a team game and Black's is not. That's why White is going to win. DIAGRAM 89. Black to play Karpov-Mecking, Hastings, 1971-72
1...g5
White threatens to grab all the space on the kingside with g4-g5, so Black attempts to block him.
2.fxg6
White does not even consider 2.h5?? because that move totally locks the position up on the side of the board where White wants to play. He is following this strategy: Open lines when you want to attack, and close lines when you are trying to defend.
2...hxg6 3.Kd3
The immediate 3.h5?? would allow 3...Bg5+, skewering the Exchange.
3...Kg7 4.h5 Bb6 5.Rh3 Bc5 6.Rf1
Now Black doesn't know whether White will double Rooks on the f-file with 7.Rhf3 or on the h-file with Rfh1.
6...f6 7.hxg6
White opens the h-file. He will now use the combined power of his Rooks and Bishop to play for a direct assault on the Black King.
7...Kxg6 8.Rfh1 Rbe8 9.Rh7 Kg5
Black was afraid he might eventually be checkmated after Rh1-h5, so he goes for a walk with his King. As it turns out, this walk takes him to his doom.
10.Ke2
White's King joins in the hunt! Now 11.Kf3, which takes the f4-square away from the Black King, followed by 12.Rg7 checkmate is the threat.
10...Kf4 11.R1h3 Bd4 12.Rg7
Because 13.Rf3 checkmate is inevitable, Black gives up. As this game demonstrates: A strong piece + a captured square for it to rest on + some other complementary advantage(s) = trouble for your opponent! At times, a square can be the focal point of a big fight. One side may want to use it for attacking purposes whereas the other side may want to clog it up for defensive reasons. DIAGRAM 90. Black to play Diagram 90 illustrates this type of situation. This position seems to be fairly clear cut: White's pawns are aimed at the kingside (his pawns on d4 and e5 point in that direction and give him more space on that side of the board), while Black's pawns aim at the queenside. Because you should always attack with pawns in positions with closed centers, Black will play for ...c6-c5, which will give him more queenside territory and also open files for his Rooks. White, on the other hand, will play for f4-f5, which adds to his kingside space, rips open lines so that his minor pieces and Rooks can participate, and frees the c1-h6 diagonal for his Bishop. If Black just wants a race to see who can implement his plan first, then 1...c5 will suffice; but is it worth asking whether Black can instead prevent White's f4-f5 move? Of course it is! You should always know what both you and your opponent can and cannot prevent. In this case, White can't really stop Black from playing ...c6-c5, but Black can prevent White from playing f4-f5. Because the f4-f5 push is so important to White, isn't it worth Black spending a couple moves to stop it? If Black decides to prevent White's plan, he should try to do it in a beneficial way. For example, 1...f5? is a poor move because 2.exf6 leaves Black with a backward e-pawn on an open file. The move that I like is 1...Nh6!, which not only prevents f4-f5 but also announces Black's intention of turning f5 into a fine support point for the Knight! After 2.Nf3 Nf5 3.O-O, Black should play 3...h5!. This strange-looking move is not intended to start a kingside attack. Black is stopping White from playing g2-g4 and reclaiming the f5-square. Now f4-f5 has been prevented, White's Bishop and Rook are doomed to remain trapped behind the f4-pawn, and Black's Knight has a magnificent post. Black has claimed a square that was important to White's plans as a home for his own pieces. Note that Black will not be satisfied with the control of one square but will mix the fine position of his Knight with his original plans on the queenside. He will continue with ...c5 (opening the c-file, gaining space, and attacking the White center), ...Nc6 (joining the f5-Knight and the c5-pawn in their assault on d4), and ...Qb6, after which all his pieces are striking the d4- pawn in unison. Play through these moves on your own board, and you will see a great example of a whole army working together to achieve one goal. The fact that Black first stopped White's plan makes this whole strategy all the sweeter. Let's look at a complete game that illustrates the weak-square strategy. Karpov-Spassky Leningrad, 1974 9th Match Game This game shows a full-bodied fight for several squares in both camps. The position that interests us occurs after the following moves:
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 d6 6.Be2 Be7 7.O-O O-O 8.f4 Nc6 9.Be3 Bd7
10.Nb3
Black's next move is designed to force White to give Black access to the b4-square. The price: a permanent weakening of the b5-square.
10...a5?! 11.a4
White stops the enemy a-pawn in its tracks but creates a weakness on b4. The difference between Black's weakness on b5 and White's on b4 is that the b4-square is not a permanent hole. At some later stage of the game, White can move his Knight and reclaim it by c2-c3.
11...Nb4 12.Bf3 Bc6 13.Nd4
This Knight can now either take the Bishop on c6 or jump into the lovely hole on b5.
13...g6 14.Rf2
White brings another defender to guard c2, allowing the White Queen to roam and also preparing for Rd2 in a few moves.
14...e5
Black creates a hole on d5, but knows that this hole is no big deal because his pieces all attack that square, thereby preventing White's pieces from dominating it.
15.Nxc6 bxc6 16.fxe5 dxe5
Hasn't White given up his control of b5 and d5 by allowing Black to bring a pawn to c6 (where it guards these points)? Yes, he has and they were major strategical decisions. But White has also created new holes on c4 and c5, as well as pawn weaknesses on a5 and c6. And he has also gained the two Bishops, an advantage that he makes use of later.
17.Qf1!
White grabs for control over the c4-square. Note that taking the d-file with Rd2 while a good move is also a committal one, it is not clear yet whether the f-file is more important.
17...Qc8 18.h3
Keeping Black's Knight out of g4. Black will have a difficult time finding useful moves because in this Bishop vs. Knight situation, his Knights don't have any advanced support points. (The Knight on b4 will eventually be chased away.)
18...Nd7
If Black plays 18...Qe6, White will bring his Bishop to c4 by 19.Rc1 (which defends c2 because the immediate 19.Be2 would cut off the f2 defender from the c2-pawn) 19...Rfd8 20.Be2 Rd4 21.b3 followed by Bc4 with a coordinated attack down the f-file.
19.Bg4 h5 20.Bxd7
White is willing to give up his two-Bishop advantage because he feels that the d7-Knight could eventually play to b6 and fight for c4. When playing for possession of a square, don't hesitate to trade pieces that can challenge you for that post.
20...Qxd7 21.Qc4
The White Queen is very strong here. It attacks c6 and also eyes f7.
21...Bh4 22.Rd2 Qe7 23.Raf1! Rfd8 24.Nb1!
DIAGRAM 91. Black to play White prepares to chase the b4-Knight away. With the position as shown in Diagram 91, Black has to come to terms with the fact that the b4-square he put so much effort into controlling was just a temporary possession.
24...Qb7 25.Kh2 Kg7 26.c3 Na6 27.Re2
White decides that he wants to double Rooks on the f-file so that they can work with his Queen in attacking f7. He avoids the trade of this Rook and now threatens 27...-- 28.g3 Bf6 29.Ref2 Rd6 30.Bg5!.
27...Rf8 28.Nd2
All of White's pieces will take part in this battle.
28...Bd8
Black doesn't fall for 28...Qxb2?? 29.Nf3, after which his Queen and his Bishop are both attacked.
29.Nf3 f6 30.Rd2!
Masterful play by White. Now the f-file is blocked off, so White shows renewed interest in the d-file. Note that Black's price for playing ...f7-f6 is to allow the White Queen access to the e6- square.
30...Be7 31.Qe6 Rad8 32.Rxd8 Bxd8
White would have answered 32...Rxd8 with 33.Nxe5! fxe5 34.Rf7+.
33.Rd1 Nb8
The once-proud b4-Knight has been reduced to a pathetic creature on the back rank.
34.Bc5
White has already made use of c4 and e6. Now he jumps into c5 as well.
34...Rh8 35.Rxd8!
Black gives up because 35...Rxd8 36.Be7 will lead to a winning attack on the kingside after
36...Rc8 37.Qxf6+. This game was a model of strategic clarity that made Karpov the most feared
player of his time. It made an enormous impression on me! Lines of Weak Squares So far we have looked only at the control of individual squares. However, sometimes a whole line of squares can become vulnerable to enemy infiltration. For example, in Diagram 92, Black's game is bad no matter whose move it is!
DIAGRAM 92.
Black is doomed because White controls a host of squares, whereas Black controls no advanced posts at all. The White Knight dominates the board on c4 (where it eyes b6 and d6), whereas the Black Knight is kept out of b4 and d4 by the little pawn on c3. White's Rooks are no less impressive. They can penetrate into the Black position on d5, d6, or d7. In Diagram 93, we see a whole line of weakened squares along the a1-h8 diagonal. DIAGRAM 93. White to play White has wisely played f2-f3 and avoided giving up squares to the Black Bishop, but Black has failed to take the same precautions! White will play 1.Qc3, and nothing can be done about a decisive penetration into h8. Steinitz-Blackburne London, 1876 The final game in this chapter shows what happens in actual play when a line of squares becomes vulnerable. It also shows that players were well aware of strong and weak squares way back in the 1800s!
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 d6 6.c3 Be7 7.h3 O-O 8.Qe2 Ne8
This opening is an old-fashioned way of playing the Ruy López. White's next move prevents Black from playing ...f7-f5, but it creates a hole on f4.
9.g4 b5 10.Bc2 Bb7 11.Nbd2 Qd7 12.Nf1
This White Knight is heading for e3, where it can jump into the temporary hole on f5. I call this hole temporary because Black can reclaim control of it with ...g7-g6. However, that advance also has some negative aspects: It weakens the dark squares around Black's King.
12...Nd8
Black knows about weak squares, too! He is heading for e6, where his Knight eyes the hole on f4.
13.Ne3 Ne6 14.Nf5 g6
Black decides that the Knight has to be chased away and is willing to pay the price for doing so. However, now White will try to make use of the holes around the Black King.
15.Nxe7+
This Bishop could have defended the dark squares by playing ...Bf6-g7, so it had to be removed.
15...Qxe7 16.Be3
If Black's Knight ever jumps to f4, White will chop it off with Bxf4. Then the doubled pawn on f4 will be weak, and White will be able to create a full pawn center with d3-d4.
16...N8g7 17.O-O-O c5 18.d4
White has two Bishops, so he wants to open up the position. He would also like to blast open the a1-h8 diagonal so that he can take advantage of the weak dark squares around the Black King.
18...exd4 19.cxd4 c4?
This bad move gives up control of d4 and allows White's dark-squared Bishop to take up residence there. Black's game slides into the gutter after this error, which just goes to show that you should never give up squares with such reckless abandon!
20.d5 Nc7 21.Qd2 a5 22.Bd4
As Diagram 94 shows, the White Bishop is eating up the holes on f6 and g7. Black tries to block him, but White will not be denied this feast. DIAGRAM 94. Black to play
22...f6 23.Qh6
Why not make use of this tasty hole?
23...b4 24.g5
White blasts open the a1-h8 diagonal for the Bishop. The holes that Black created earlier with
14...g6 have finally come back to haunt him.
24...f5 25.Bf6
With 14...g6, Black gave up control of both f6 and h6. Now we see why such a surrender can have serious consequences: White's pieces have turned both these squares into homes!
25...Qf7 26.exf5 gxf5 27.g6!!
A move of frightful power. White gives his Knight access to g5 and also opens the g-file for his Rooks. Time and again, we have seen how top players bring all their pieces into a fight. Now it's time to start doing the same thing in your own games.
27...Qxg6
Black will lose material, but 27...Qxf6 28.Qxh7 checkmate and 27...hxg6 28.Ng5 Qxf6 29.Qh7 checkmate are certainly no better.
28.Bxg7 Qxh6+
Black agrees to lose a piece and thereby agrees to lose the game. He has no choice, though, because 28...Qxg7 loses the Queen to 29.Rhg1, after which the Rooks enter the game and wipe Black out.
29.Bxh6
Black could resign here, but he plays on for a few pointless moves before he comes to terms with his imminent defeat and resigns.

Test 20. It's Black's turn to play. A player with a 1300 rating, Black was doing quite well against his 1900-rated opponent. He played 1...Be7 and eventually went down in defeat after a hard battle. What was wrong with this move? Show/Hide Solution Test 20: Black's Knights are both sitting on excellent posts. His c5-Knight is safe enough because if White plays b4, he will weaken the c4-square (which Black could make use of with ...Nd7-b6-c4), and if he plays Bxc5, Black can respond with ...Bxc5 (when the Bishop is very strong on the a7-g1 diagonal). What Black doesn't appreciate is that his other Knight is not yet permanently situated. He should make sure that f5 would remain in his control by playing
1...h5!.
By playing 1...Be7 instead, he allows 2.g4!, after which 2...Nh6 3.h3 produces a very different picture. His once-proud Knight on f5 is now a useless old nag that cannot get back into the game. The moral: when you control an important square, make sure it remains in your hands! Show in Text Mode

Chapter Eight Territorial Domination One of the most important acquisitions in a game of chess is space. Good players never seem to get enough of it. Like Karpov, I am a space addict, and any other positionally inclined Grandmaster is just as convinced as we are about the virtues of territory.
DIAGRAM 95.
You gain territory through the strategic use of your pawns. In general, all the squares behind your pawns are considered your space unless an enemy pawn can attack them. For example, in Diagram 95, the Xs denote controlled territory. A glance is all you need to know that White has more Xs behind his pawns than Black does, so White has more space in all three sections of the board (queenside, center, and kingside). The X'ed squares in the White camp are all safe landing spots for the White army. The X'ed squares in the Black camp are the only ones Black has for his own pieces. Note that the squares with your pawns on them are not considered your territory, but they become your territory as soon as you push the pawns. For example, f4 is not technically a White square, but after 1.f4-f5, White can lay claim to an extra unit of space because f4 is now behind the pawn chain. Possession of extra space is usually an advantage, but as the ancient Romans discovered, you can't just claim a stretch of territory for yourself; you have to control it to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy. As a result, collecting more space than your opponent is both a boon and a responsibility. The extra territory gives you plenty of room for your pieces and allows you to squeeze the enemy as you systematically increase your spatial advantage. However, advancing borders also need to be defended against foreign infiltration. The following basic rules apply to a space-gaining strategy: • Extra space is a long-range advantage. Don't be in a hurry! Take your time and act like a python, slowly squeezing your victim to death in your deadly coils. • Once you have a significant advantage in space, play to defend your borders, don't let the enemy break free of his bonds, and slowly but surely take more and more of the board for yourself. • To maintain your space advantage, avoid trading pieces. You want the enemy pieces to get in the way of each other and suffocate under their own weight. Your opponent, who has less space, will attempt to trade pieces. A small apartment with eight people may be an intolerable living situation; that same apartment with just two people could be quite acceptable. DIAGRAM 96. White to play Silman-Formanek, World Open, 1989 Space on the Wings Let's make no mistake about it: The center is the most important area of the board, and you should play in that sector whenever you can. However, if the center is blocked by pawns, then neither player has a choice: You must both turn your attention to the wings. For example, in Diagram 96 White has more space in the center, but that section of the board is completely locked up by pawns. Though the center will not see any action, his extra space does give White's pieces more freedom of movement. He uses that extra mobility to immediately strive for spatial gains on the wings. The strategy here: A blocked center means play on the wings.
1.g3
This move prepares for f2-f4. The immediate 1.f4 is bad because 1...exf4 2.Bxf4 Qe7 gives Black a fine square on e5 for his Knights.
1.g3 Ne8 2.f4
White intends to answer 2...exf4 with 3.gxf4, after which White enjoys a considerable territorial advantage on the kingside and use of the half-open g-file. Notice that the White King will be safe when it moves to h1.
2...Qe7 3.f5 f6 4.g4
Nobody can dispute White's edge in kingside territory. His next few moves are designed to increase this advantage and to create an open file so that his Rooks can enter the battle.
4...g5 5.h4 h6 6.Kf2 Nc7 7.Rh1 Rf7
Now White can open the h-file at will with hxg5. Of course, he has no intention of doing so immediately because Black can then challenge that file with ...Rh7. Instead, White will double or even triple on that file and only open it at the moment most favorable to him.
8.Be3
Black is cramped and cannot really do anything but defend, so White takes his time and places his pieces on their best squares.
8...Rh7 9.Rh3 Kg7 10.Rah1 Rah8
Now 11.hxg5 will be met by 11...hxg5, when massive exchanges on the h-file will make Black happy because he is the one with less space. White must remember the following: If you have more space, don't trade pieces!
11.Ne2
The Knight moves toward g3, where it will always threaten to jump into the hole on h5.
11...Kg8 12.Ng3 Ne8 13.b4
Now White grabs some queenside space as well. Why not lay claim to the whole board?
13...Nf8 14.Qd2 Bc8 15.Bc2 Qc7 16.Bb3 Qe7 17.Ba4
White has all the time in the world. Black's lack of space makes him helpless, so White takes care of the needs of each of his pieces. Because this Bishop is bad, White activates it by placing it outside the pawn chain.
17...Bd7 18.Bc6 Qd8 19.Rb1 Qc7 20.b5
White has a lock on both sides of the board and eventually wins. On occasion, you may find that your opponent can eventually shake off a spatial disadvantage. The end of a spatial advantage is not necessarily the end of your control, though. If you have played your cards right, you can usually gain new advantages in exchange for the loss of your land. As an example, look at the position in Diagram 97. White has two center pawns (on d4 and e3), whereas Black has only one (on e6). You should use every advantage you possess, so White will advance his e-pawn, gain central space, and force the Black pieces away from their central posts. DIAGRAM 97. White to play Capablanca-Em. Lasker, Havana, 1921
1.Rfd1
This useful move defends d4 (which might get a little loose after e3-e4) and discourages Black from fighting for space with ...c6-c5 or ...e6-e5, either of which only helps to activate the White Rook.
1...Bd7 2.e4 Nb6?
Black clearly has less space than his opponent, so he should have played 2...Nxc3, trading a pair of Knights.
3.Bf1 Rc8
Black still hopes to create a bit of queenside space with an eventual ...c6-c5.
4.b4
White puts a stop to ...c6-c5 and gains queenside space.
4...Be8 5.Qb3 Rec7 6.a4
While Black is slithering around on his back two ranks, White quietly maps out more space on the queenside.
6...Ng6 7.a5 Nd7 8.e5!
White grabs more central territory, keeps the Black pieces out of f6, and creates a wonderful home for a White Knight on d6. It is true that 8.e5 gives Black access to d5, but White rightly feels that d6 is simply more important!
8...b6
Black has to break out of this bind or he will lose without a fight.
9.Ne4 Rb8 10.Qc3 Nf4 11.Nd6 Nd5 12.Qa3 f6
This move threatens 13.-- 13...fxe5 14.dxe5 Nxe5! 15.Nxe8 Nxf3+, so White is forced to make a trade or two and give Black a bit more room to move about in. Unfortunately for Black, he will have new problems to face in the form of his weakened pawns on c6, e6, and f6.
13.Nxe8 Qxe8 14.exf6 gxf6 15.b5 Rbc8 16.bxc6 Rxc6 17.Rxc6 Rxc6 18.axb6 axb6
White has traded in the bulk of his extra space for permanent targets on b6, e6, f6, and h7. The ability to trade one advantage for another is a hallmark of all great players.
19.Re1
The Rook quickly turns its attention to e6.
19...Qc8 20.Nd2 Nf8 21.Ne4
Because e6 has been well defended, White now focuses on f6.
21...Qd8 22.h4
White wins this game because he has four targets to attack compared with Black's one (the pawn on d4). The fact that the Black King is more vulnerable than its White counterpart also plays a part in the final result. The remaining moves show White slowly making use of all of these factors:
22...Rc7 23.Qb3 Rg7 24.g3 Ra7 25.Bc4 Ra5 26.Nc3 Nxc3 27.Qxc3 Kf7 28.Qe3 Qd6 29.Qe4
Ra4 30.Qb7+ Kg6 31.Qc8 Qb4 32.Rc1 Qe7 33.Bd3+ Kh6 34.Rc7 Ra1+ 35.Kh2 Qd6
36.Qxf8+!
Faced with 36...Qxf8 37.Rxh7 checkmate, Black resigns. By now, it should be clear that giving up too much space can enable your opponent to get a stranglehold on you. At the first hint of territorial deprivation, you must strike out and try to claim some space of your own. DIAGRAM 98. Black to play Lobron-Seirawan, Lucerne Olympiad, 1982 Here's how I fought back in one of my games. As you can see in Diagram 98, White has more space in the center while I have more queenside space. However, why should I let my opponent have all the fun in the middle? I shouldn't!
1...c5!
This move challenges White in the center and also increases my own control of queenside territory.
2.c3 e5!
I stop White cold in the middle. Now 3.d5, which increases White's territory slightly, is probably the best move, but it would close the center and stop all of White's play in that sector.
3.dxe5? dxe5
Now the space in the middle is equal, and I still own my extra territory on the queenside. This extra space gives me the superior position.
4.O-O c4!
Okay, so I'm greedy! I love taking any space my opponent will give me.
5.Bc2 Bb7 6.Qd2 Re8 7.Rad1 Qe7
This very useful move, it gets my Queen off the uncomfortable d-file and gains control of c5. I will now be able to place my Knight and increase my pressure on e4 and d3.
8.Bh6 Nc5 9.Bxg7 Kxg7 10.Qe3 h6
Before continuing play in the middle and on the queenside, I cover all the squares around my King. Now f5, g5, and h5 are off-limits to White's forces.
11.Rd2 Rad8 12.Rfd1 Rxd2 13.Rxd2 Qc7 14.Nh4
White threatens to sacrifice a piece by playing 15.Nhf5+ gxf5 16.Nxf5+ followed by Qxh6, stripping my King bare!
14...Kh7
Now Nhf5 will no longer be a check, and I will have time to capture the first intruder and then defend my h-pawn with ...Ng8.
15.Nf3 Ne6
My Knight is eyeing f4, and this move also gives me the option of trading Queens with ...Qc5. I don't mind a Queen exchange because White's only chance for counterplay lies on the kingside. Without his Queen, his chances of successfully attacking my King would be nonexistent.
16.a4 Kg7 17.Rd1 Qc5 18.Qxc5 Nxc5 19.axb5 axb5 20.Rd6 Ncd7!
I don't fall for 20...Ncxe4? 21.Nxe4 Bxe4 22.Bxe4 Nxe4 23.Rb6! Rd8 24.Rxb5 Rd1+ 25.Kh2, which leads to equality. By playing 20...Ncd7, I give my e-pawn more support and keep White's Rook out of b6.
21.Kf1 Ra8
My Rook prepares to penetrate the White position along the a-file.
22.Rd1 Ra2 23.Rb1 Nc5
I exerted pressure on e4 (which makes my pieces on b7 and f6 attacking while White's men on c2 and g3 are defending) and b2 (courtesy of my spatial advantage on that wing) and eventually won a long game.
TEST 21.
Test 21. It's White's turn to play. He clearly has more queenside space, but Black is about to map out his own territory with ...f7-f5. Should White try to take over the kingside as well by playing 1.f2-f4? Show/Hide Solution Test 21: White should continue to play in his own sector with Nb3, Rc1, and eventually c4-c5, opening lines that will allow White to penetrate into the Black position. A move like 1.f4? is poor because, aside from not following his own queenside plans, White pays too great a price for kingside space. After 1.f4? exf4, White has opened up the a1-h8 diagonal for the Black Bishop (which was a bad Bishop until it was granted this new lease on life), given himself a backward pawn on the half-open e-file, and created a wonderful resting place for a Black Knight on e5. Don't create space if doing so will give your opponent a host of other advantages! Using Pawns to Dominate the Center Possession of a full pawn center can be a potent weapon in the hands of a player who knows how to make use of it. Such a center gains space and takes critical squares away from the enemy pieces. So good players often work to implement this strategy: Make your center indestructible, and it will choke the life out of your opponent. Let's look at some examples. In Diagram 99, White's pawns on d4 and e4 constitute a full pawn center. DIAGRAM 99. Black to play They take away the e5 and d5 squares from the Black pieces, deprive Black's light-squared Bishop of the use of f5, and block Black's other Bishop on b6. White is not in any hurry to advance these pawns, because as soon as he does so, he will give up control of some square. For example, e4-e5 weakens his control of d5 and f5, and d4-d5 both activates the enemy dark- squared Bishop and gives up control of e5. White's correct strategy in this position is to make his center unassailable. Then Black's pieces can do nothing but sit around and brood about their own helplessness. White can prepare an advance at his leisure, only pushing the pawns when it does the most good. Moves like Rad1 and Rfe1 are possible, and the more aggressive plan of Nd2 followed by f2-f4 is also extremely strong. Note that it is Black's move, but the fact that the ball is in his court does not give him any cause to rejoice. What can he do? White's center is as solid as a rock and cannot be injured by Black's impotent army. DIAGRAM 100. White to play Seirawan-Shirazi, U.S. Championship, 1992 In Diagram 100, I have another type of center. My pawns on c4 and e4 do not qualify as a full pawn center, but they still give me a clear advantage in central space. As a result, Black's pieces are having a lot of trouble finding good homes, whereas their counterparts in my army seem to fall on good posts without any effort at all.
1.Nd5 Bh6 2.f4 e5
Black tries desperately to be active, but all he really achieves is the weakening of both the d5- square and the d6-pawn. Best was 2...Ne5, with a difficult game.
3.Bxg4 Bxg4 4.Be3 Bg7 5.f5!
This strong move gains kingside space and also entombs the dark-squared Bishop on g7.
5...g5 6.a4!
I intend to ultimately break through in the center (I was lusting after that weak pawn on d6!), but I first snatch up some territory on the wings. This greedy strategy makes sense. After all, if I have all the space on the kingside, in the center, and on the queenside, what does that leave Black? Absolutely nothing! Placing my opponent in a state of complete helplessness is something that I love to do whenever I can.
6...Bh5 7.a5
Forward! I want all your space.
7...Rf7
Black has nothing to attack and nowhere to go with his pieces, so I can take my time and slowly squeeze him to death.
8.b3 Rd7 9.Qf2
I am threatening to capture on a7. If Black plays 9...a6?, he will give me access to the b6- square and will lose the Exchange after 10.Nb6.
9...Qb8 10.Nc3 Be8 11.Nb5
The Knight was nice on d5, but here it attacks both a7 and d6.
11...b6
The natural-looking 11...a6 weakens b6 and allows me to jump on that point with 12.Nc3,
13.Na4, and 14.Nb6 (or 13.Nd5 and 14.Nb6) when all of Black's pieces look pathetic.
12.axb6 axb6 13.Qd2!
I avoid 13.Bxb6? Rxa1 14.Rxa1 Rb7, with a discovered attack on the b5-Knight by the e8- Bishop. The premature capture would allow trades which only help Black, who has less space.
13...Bf7 14.Qd3 Rxa1 15.Rxa1 Bf8
Black's pieces are cringing on the back rank, but it is not so easy to break through and beat him. I continue to take my time and penetrate his position slowly but very surely, always being careful to avoid giving him any sort of counterplay. My strategy here is: When your opponent is helpless, keep him that way!
16.Qd2 Rb7 17.h4 h6 18.Nc3 Be7 19.Ra6
Notice how I am focusing on those b6 and d6 targets.
19...Kg7 20.Qa2 Qc7 21.Qa4 d5
Pushing the panic button. I threatened to win the b-pawn with Qb5 and Na4, so Black gives up a pawn on his own terms and tries to open up some opportunities for counterplay.
22.Nb5 Qd7 23.cxd5 Be8 24.Na7
The player with more space usually avoids exchanges, but the player with more material usually courts them! In this case, I see a winning endgame, so I welcome all trades.
24...Qxa4 25.bxa4 b5 26.axb5 Bxb5 27.Nxb5 Rxb5 28.d6 Bd8 29.Ra8 Bb6 30.Bxb6 Rxb6
31.d7 and Black decided to get some rest.
At times, both sides will prepare to make a central advance. Timing then becomes critical: Don't let your opponent distract you from your goal. If he succeeds, you will never achieve it! Here's an example. DIAGRAM 101. Black to play Abrahamson-Ashe, Los Angeles, 1994 Faced with the position in Diagram 101, most players will immediately worry about White's threat of Bxd5. However, instead of reacting to a threat, you should first come to terms with the strategic needs of the position. Then and only then can you address its tactical peculiarities. White threatens to capture on d5 with Bxd5. How should Black deal with this threat? Let's first take a quick look at the actual game continuation:
1...c4 2.Qc2 h6 3.Bh4 Nf5 4.Bg3 Nxg3 5.hxg3
Now White threatens 6.Nbxc4.
5...Rb8 6.e4!
And White takes the initiative in the center. What do you think of these moves? Did both sides play well? Did their respective plans succeed? The truth is, Black played quite poorly. His plan should be based on the acquisition of central space by ...e7-e5 (a move that also seeks to soften up the a1-h8 diagonal for his dark-squared Bishop, to say nothing of the fact that it creates a half-open e-file for his Rooks). Did this plan come to fruition? Absolutely not! Instead of worrying about that threat of Bxd5, Black should have tried harder to make his dreamed-of ...e7-e5 push a reality. Here's an analysis of the game:
1...c4?!
This move does stop the threat of Bxd5, but it also takes some of the pressure off of d4. Don't forget: One of the points of ...e7-e5 is to activate the dark-squared Bishop. Placing pawns on c5 and e5 accomplishes that goal because they directly attack d4. A single pawn on e5, while still nice, doesn't have quite the same effect. Instead of 1...c4, I would be more inclined to play 1...h6 2.Bh4 Nf5 3.Bg3 Nxg3 4.hxg3 e6, which gives Black two Bishops and a very flexible pawn structure that favors those Bishops. If White initiates 2.Bf4 e5 3.dxe5 instead, Black plays 3...c4 followed by 4...Nxe5. He does not mind this move now because White has already captured on e5, giving up his strong point on d4 and activating Black's dark-squared Bishop.
1...c4?! 2.Qc2 h6 3.Bh4 Nf5 4.Bg3 Nxg3 5.hxg3 Rb8?
Once again Black reacts to a threat (without asking if it is real or imagined, and without insisting on the success of his own plan). This time, though, his passive response will have serious consequences. Black should have played to set up 5...e5! and grabbed the center for himself. Then 6.Nbxc4 e4 7.Nd6 exf3 8.Nxb7 Qc7 wins a piece for Black and 6.dxe5 Nxe5 gives Black the superior position. Remember: Once you begin to react to enemy threats and, as a consequence, forget about your own dreams, you will find that defeat is waiting just around the corner.
6.e4
With this move (the mirror image of the one Black had so desperately wanted to play), White gains central space and control of the game. After 6...e6 7.e5 (gaining even more central territory), the closed position hurts the Black Bishops. Black's strategy has failed completely! He never got the central space he wanted (via ...e7-e5), and his Bishop pair has gone from a potential advantage to a clear burden. Defending Against a Pawn Center Are central pawns really so strong? They were thought to be in the 1800s and the first part of this century. But then a new modernist view insisted that center pawns can also be treated as weaknesses. This view gave birth to a new strategy: If your opponent insists on building a large pawn center, you must aim your pawns and pieces at it and try to chop it down. For example, after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3, White has a full pawn center. Why did Black allow White to claim the center as his own? Black's moves, known as the Grünfeld Defense, are quite popular, so we know there must be a method to Black's madness. Black has allowed White to build up this impressive center because he intends to attack it and show that it is actually a target! To prove his point, Black must take aim at the center and hit it with everything he's got.
6...Bg7
Black eyes the d4-square and prepares to castle. Never forget to put your King in a safe place.
7.Bc4 O-O 8.Ne2 c5
Now Black has three pieces hitting d4.
9.O-O
White avoids 9.d5, because he would then give up some control of the e5-square and open the a1-h8 diagonal for the Black dark-squared Bishop.
9...Nc6
Black trains more stuff on d4!
10.Be3
White reacts by defending that pawn with everything but the kitchen sink.
10...Qc7
Black threatens some discoveries (via ...cxd4) on the undefended c4-Bishop.
11.Rc1
Now 11...cxd4 12.cxd4 leaves the Bishop well defended.
11...Rd8
The battle for d4 never seems to end, does it?
12.h3
Many players prefer to keep loading up on d4 with 12.Qd2 followed by 13.Rfd1. Note that the immediate 12.f4? is a mistake because 12...Bg4 would get rid of a critical defender of d4.
12...b6 13.f4 Na5 14.Bd3 f5!
Now if White plays poorly with 15.e5, Black will turn the once-mighty White center into something that looks more like a leaky roof with ...c4, ...e6, ...Bb7, and ...Bd5, as you can see in Diagram 102.
DIAGRAM 102.
This position favors Black because he has succeeded in making the White pawns advance, leaving all the light squares vulnerable to occupation by the Black forces. Remember: The idea of a pawn center is to deprive the enemy pieces of nice central squares. Strangely enough, White's pawns are now actually damaging their own army. The e3-Bishop is locked in, the Knight is trapped by the pawns on f4 and d4, and the Rooks are doing absolutely nothing. Now that White is the helpless one (his central space advantage has been rendered useless), Black will take advantage of his queenside space (and queenside majority of pawns) by playing ...Nc6, ...b5, ...a5, and ...b4. DIAGRAM 103. Black to play Yermolinsky-Seirawan, U.S. Championship, 1992 The next example from one of my games shows yet again the importance of attacking a pawn center before it can squeeze you. In Diagram 103, White's pawn on e5 gives him an edge in central space. Instead of bowing to that center, though, I try to prove that it is weak by attacking it at the d4-base.
1...Be4!
I want all my pieces to land on squares that attack d4. My Bishop can chop off White's defending Knight, my e7-Knight is heading for f5, and my Queen can go to b6.
2.Nbd2 Nf5 3.b4
White gains queenside space and prepares to defend the d4-pawn with Bb2.
3...a5
I am already battling my opponent's spatial superiority in the center, so I have no intention of letting him grab queenside space as well! I avoid 3...Ncxd4 because this move opens up the center (not a good idea when your King still resides there!) and would lead to 4.Nxd4 Nxd4
5.Nxe4 dxe4 6.Qa4+ Nc6 (6...Qd7?? 7.Qxd7+ Kxd7 8.Rd1 picks up the Knight) 7.Rd1, after
which I am in danger of being overrun. For example, 7...Qc7?? 8.b5 Nxe5 9.b6+ Qc6 10.Bb5 results in my Queen heading the list of casualties.
4.bxa5
Now 4.b5? Ncxd4 5.Nxd4 Nxd4 6.Nxe4 dxe4 7.Be3 Bc5 is fine for me because White no longer has a check along the a4-e8 diagonal.
4...Qxa5
I have a good position. My pieces are active, White's d4-pawn is a target, and his a3-pawn is also in need of defense. White now errs with his next move as he tries to simplify the position.
5.g4? Nfxd4 6.Nxd4 Nxd4 7.Nxe4 Nxe2+ 8.Qxe2 dxe4 9.Qxe4 Bc5!
White's King is now a bit loose, his g-pawn has gone too far, and his other pawns on a3 and e5 are also potential targets. All I have to do is castle, and I can claim an advantage. Playing 9...Bc5 sacrifices a pawn but gives me time to get my monarch to safety. The initiative is now completely mine.
10.Qxb7 O-O 11.Qe4 Qc3 12.Ra2 Qb3!
My threats of ...Qxa2 and ...Ra4 guarantee me at least the return of my sacrificed pawn. The game will eventually be drawn, but White's once-proud space-gaining center is now remembered only by the weakling on e5.
TEST 22.
Test 22. It's White's turn to play. White enjoys more central space than his opponent. Should he grab even more territory with 1.d5? Show/Hide Solution Test 22: No. 1.d5? is a very poor move. You want to control squares with your center, not give them up! Playing 1.d5 gives up the c5-square for no reason at all and takes away the option of opening the center at some favorable moment with dxe5 (which could be prepared for by playing Ba3, Qc2, Nc4, and so on).

Chapter Nine Attacking the King You might think it strange to find a section on attacking the King in a book about strategy. However, attacking on any side of the board is a strategic undertaking. If the position calls for you to attack your enemy's monarch, then that is the correct strategy for the position. This type of strategic decision is not a matter of personal taste or style. When the board dictates that you should rip the head off the enemy King, then that is what you must do. Now for a word of warning: If all the conditions for a kingside attack exist and you decide to go for the King's throat, don't assume that you are in a "checkmate-or-die" situation. You might be, but a kingside attack per-se doesn't necessarily demand all or nothing. You have to stay flexible. If your attack nets you a pawn, feel free to trade off and go into a winning endgame with a material advantage. If your attack leaves the enemy with various pawn weaknesses, don't hesitate to change your strategy to a positional "hunt and destroy-targets" type of battle. An attack on the King can lead to checkmate, but it can also lead to a host of other advantages that you must be willing to exploit. One other bit of advice: Watch out for central counterplay. One of the finest principles of chess strategy that should be used religiously by the defender and carefully considered by the attacker is: The best reaction to an attack on the wing is a counterattack in the center. Creating the Conditions for a Kingside Attack Whether or not to launch an attack against the enemy King should not be an emotional decision. It's not a macho display, and it's not a course of action you should undertake just because you like to attack. A player charges the enemy King because certain conditions tell him that this is the correct strategy to follow. What are these conditions? The following list shows the four main conditions to look for when deciding on a kingside attack. The list is not complete because lots of small factors can fit together to make the success of an attack more likely, but it does give you a feel for the kind of advantage that can translate to kingside play. • If you have a space advantage in the vicinity of the enemy King, you will usually play in that sector. • If several of your pieces are close to the enemy King while his defenders are few or far away (that is, you have superior force), your chances of a kingside attack succeeding are probably excellent. • If the pawns surrounding the enemy King have been ripped apart or weakened in any way, you can consider an assault if one of the previous conditions also exist. (If the King is open but you have no pieces on that side of the board, then what are you going to checkmate him with?) • If you have a substantial lead in development, you must make use of it before your opponent catches up and your development edge fades away. A lead in development is a signal for attack! One of the most common attacking situations occurs when both Kings have castled on opposite sides. Pushing the pawns in front of your own King can be dangerous because it weakens your King's pawn cover, so it is a normal practice to seek your play on the side of the board where you have not castled. In that sector, you can push your pawns to your heart's content in an effort to gain space and open files for your Rooks, without damaging the integrity of your King's protective-pawn safety net. Not so common is the type of game you get when both sides place their Kings directly in the path of the enemy attack! No subtle plans are called for here! Instead we commonly see a blood- frenzy akin to sharks at feeding time. Each player does everything he can to checkmate the enemy monarch before his own King goes down. Under these circumstances, a fifth condition can be added to the list: • When both sides are playing for checkmate, then time, or tempo, becomes more important than material, or force. Let's look at an example of a dual attack. The position in Diagram 104 is a very popular one on the international circuit and also here in the United States. (It occurs after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be3 Bg7 7.f3 Nc6 8.Qd2 O-O 9.Bc4 Bd7 10.h4 Rac8 11.Bb3 Ne5
12.O-O-O Nc4 13.Bxc4 Rxc4.) The Kings reside on opposite sides of the board: White's King is
sitting on a half-open c-file; Black's King is not faced with an open file yet, but White will do everything he can to create one. DIAGRAM 104. White to play Karpov-Korchnoi, Moscow, 1974
14.h5!
White sacrifices a pawn to speed up his own attack. It is very important to understand that in this position, time is of the essence. If either side plays passively or wastes a move, the enemy will push his attack through and emerge victorious.
14...Nxh5
Black wins a pawn but allows White to open the h-file (bringing the White Rooks into the attack) without any loss of tempo. This transaction accelerates the White attack but leaves Black with a small material advantage. What good is a material advantage in a situation like this? None at all if it comes down to checkmate, but the extra pawn gives Black two possibilities that he did not have before: • He will most likely win any endgame because of that extra unit, so White cannot trade pieces indiscriminately. • He can sacrifice a pawn to stop the White attack and not incur a material disadvantage. In this way, the extra pawn acts like ballast in a hot air balloon: He can throw some over the side if the balloon begins to sink.
15.g4
Again White forces Black to react to his move.
15...Nf6 16.Nde2!
In the midst of his attack, White suddenly pulls his Knight back in retreat! Why would he do such a strange thing? The first part of the answer is concerned with defense. White knows that Black will sacrifice the Exchange by ...Rxc3 if the White Queen ever moves away. If the Queen can't recapture on c3, then bxc3 will be forced, leaving the White King rather exposed. So playing 16.Nde2 gives extra support to the c3-Knight and allows the White Queen to move toward the kingside. The second part of the answer is concerned with attack and with what White really wants to do: He longs to play Bh6 and get rid of Black's g7-Bishop, his most important defender. (This dark-squared Bishop is also a great attacker!) However, the immediate 16.Bh6 takes a White defender away from d4 and walks into 16...Nxe4! 17.Nxe4 Rxd4. So playing
16.Nde2 also prepares for the important Bh6 move.
16...Qa5
This attacking move lost its popularity after this game, and players now favor the defensive
16...Re8, which answers 17.Bh6 with 17...Bh8, retaining the important Bishop.
17.Bh6 Bxh6 18.Qxh6 Rfc8
Black is building up quite a bit of force along the c-file. He might even be contemplating a double Exchange sacrifice via 19...Rxc3 20.Nxc3 Rxc3. White's next move stops this idea in its tracks.
19.Rd3! R4c5 20.g5!
White draws the enemy Rook away from the c-file. This second pawn sacrifice gives White the time he needs to break through with his own attack.
20...Rxg5 21.Rd5!
If White can get rid of that defending Knight on f6, he will checkmate his opponent. The obvious try would be 21.Nd5 (answering 21...Nxd5?? with 22.Qxh7+ Kf8 23.Qh8 checkmate), but then Black would play 21...Rxd5! (keeping the defending Knight) 22.Rxd5 Qxa2, with a strong attack. The idea behind 21.Rd5 is to get rid of the g5-Rook so that it can't sacrifice itself on d5. Then the White Knight can jump into d5 and trade itself for that pesky piece on f6.
21...Rxd5 22.Nxd5 Re8
White threatens to win immediately with 23.Nxe7+ followed by 24.Nxc8.
23.N2f4
White is using a strategy that I have repeated throughout this book: Don't just attack with one or two pieces! Use everything you have. With 23.N2f4, White brings his last available piece into the attack against Black's King. Notice that 23.Nxf6+ exf6 24.Qxh7+ Kf8 25.Qh8+ Ke7 allows the Black King to run away.
23...Bc6
White threatened 24.Nxf6+ exf6 25.Nd5, which keeps Black's King off e7 and leaves him helpless before the threat of Qxh7+ followed by Qh8 checkmate. After 23...Bc6, however,
24.Nxf6+ exf6 25.Nd5 can calmly be met with 25...Bxd5. (If Black had played 23...Be6 - a
move based on the same idea as 23...Bc6 - White was prepared to play 24.Nxe6 fxe6 25.Nxf6+ exf6 26.Qxh7+ Kf8 27.Qxb7 Qg5+ 28.Kb1 Re7 29.Qb8+ Re8 30.Qxa7 Re7 31.Qb8+ Re8
32.Qxd6, which wins all the Black queenside pawns and gives White the endgame odds that
Black so proudly claimed earlier - see the note to 14...Nxh5.)
24.e5!
A real surprise that shows White is going all out for the knockout. Now 24...Nxd5 can still be met with 25.Qxh7+ and 26.Qh8 checkmate. (We'll see how White handles 24...Bxd5 in a minute.) So what does 24.e5 accomplish? And how does White intend to answer 24...dxe5? The point of this third pawn sacrifice is that it closes the 5th rank. After 24...dxe5, the Black Queen no longer eyes g5 and h5, allowing White to play 25.Nxf6+ exf6 26.Nh5! gxh5 27.Rg1+ with checkmate on the next move. If White tries this play without throwing in 24.e5! first, Black can hold on after 24.Nxf6+ exf6 25.Nh5 Qg5+, trading Queens and going into an Exchange-down but tenable endgame with 26.Qxg5 fxg5 27.Nf6+ Kf8 28.Nxe8 Kxe8, hoping for a draw.
24...Bxd5 25.exf6 exf6 26.Qxh7+
The strong-looking 26.Nh5?? actually loses to 26...Re1+ with checkmate to follow!
26...Kf8 27.Qh8+
Black did not wish to see 27...Ke7 28.Nxd5+ Qxd5 29.Re1+, so he gives up. Castling on opposite sides makes your decision to play for an attack fairly clear-cut. In the Karpov-Korchnoi game, we saw both sides trying to rip open the pawn cover around the enemy King. White took precautions and avoided this fate, but Black went under when his kingside pawns got shredded. The three other conditions to watch for, as I said at the beginning of the chapter, are kingside space, pieces aimed at the enemy King (greater force), and a lead in development. Let's look at examples of each of these factors. Superior Space on the Kingside In Diagram 105, Black has more space on the kingside whereas White has territory on the queenside. DIAGRAM 105. Black to play Because the center is completely blocked (which means that nobody can play there), both sides have to find their play in the sector of the board where they own superior space. Here their respective strategies should be obvious: White will play on the queenside and try to open lines of attack with cxd6, Rc1, and Nb5; Black will play on the kingside and try to open a file so that his Rooks can join in the battle. The only way Black can achieve this goal is by ...g6-g5-g4. He will prepare this advance by playing ...g5, ...h5, ...Rf7, ...Bf8 (both defending and attacking moves - the Rook defends White's entry point on c7 and prepares to go to g7, and the Bishop defends d6 and makes room for the Rook), ...Rg7, and finally ...g4. So the battle plans for both sides are clear. Superior Force on the Kingside Positionally, I am doing quite well in Diagram 106. My Queen is attacking the weak a3-pawn, and I can attack the pawn on c3 with ...Rac8. Unfortunately, I didn't take my opponent's kingside build-up seriously enough. His Queen, both Rooks, Knight, and Bishop all aim at my King. This gives him a superior force in that area, so all he has to do is find a way to get those pieces to my King. DIAGRAM 106. White to play Adams-Seirawan, Wijk aan Zee, 1991
1.Nxg6!
A pretty move that creates a road into my position. This attack will cost White a piece or two, but few good things in life are free.
1...hxg6
Even worse is 1...fxg6? 2.Rxe6 Qf7 3.Rxe8+, followed by 4.Bxf7+.
2.Rh3 Nh5
I had only one way to stop immediate checkmate.
3.Rxh5!
White opens another road on the g-file to my King.
3...gxh5 4.Re5 f6
Preventing the Rook from swinging to the g5-square.
5.Re3 h4
Now I keep the Rook off of g3. I'm hanging on as best I can, but in the long run I won't be able to survive.
6.Qxh4 Kf7
Now White can finish me off with 7.d5! Qxa3 (7...e5 8.d6+ picks up my Queen) 8.dxe6+ Ke7
9.Qh7+ Kd6 10.Qd7+ Kc5 11.Qd4+ Kb5 12.c4+, and I lose my Queen for nothing after 12...Ka4
13.Qd7+ Kb4 14.Qd6+.
A Lead in Development I have a considerable lead in development in Diagram 107, but Black is a pawn ahead and hopes to capitalize on it after he castles. The situation is critical for me. If I don't find a way to break through and wipe Black out, that lost pawn will come back to haunt me. In other words, I must attack! DIAGRAM 107. White to play Seirawan-Zarnicki, Buenos Aires, 1993
1.Rxd6!
Because I am already a pawn down, losing a bit more wood doesn't bother me. By taking this Bishop, I get rid of Black's guardian of the dark squares, allowing my Knight to come to e5 and, in turn, bringing my g2-Bishop to life.
1...Qxd6 2.Rd1
I don't want to give Black a chance to castle, so I play with nothing but threats to get his attention.
2...Qc7 3.Bf4
I attack the Queen and gain possession of the e5-square.
3...Qb7 4.Ne5
Now all my army is participating in the attack. Black still can't castle; he has to defend against my threat of 5.Bxc6, which wins me loads of material. (At this point, I don't care whether I checkmate the guy. Winning loads of material is good enough.)
4...Bd7
He is ready to castle again. I must react forcefully or my attack will falter.
5.Rxd7!
Grist for the mill! Now c6 falls, and I get all of my material back - with dividends!
5...Nxd7 6.Bxc6 Qa6 7.Nxd7
I pick up a free Knight, which leaves us with near material equality (though I usually prefer the three pieces over the two Rooks because it gives me three attacking units to two). In addition, I threaten to eat the Rook with Bxa8, thereby stopping Black from castling and also threatening to win the Queen with Nxc5+. The game is as good as over.
7...Qc8 8.Ba4
I could play 8.Bxa8 Qxa8 9.Ne5, but then my opponent could castle. In my mind, I saw my light-squared Bishop as being stronger than either of his pathetic Rooks. Why should I trade it for an undeveloped piece when I could retain it and continue to harrass his King?
8...Ke7
Black has no other way to stop my threat of 9.Nxb6+.
9.Qd3
I refuse to give the poor guy any rest. Now I threaten 10.Qd6+ Ke8 11.Nf6, with checkmate! Notice how I use every piece I own.
9...f6 10.Qd6+ Kf7 11.Ne5+!
Black was threatening to get his h8-Rook into the game via ...Rd8, so I sacrifice a piece to destroy the pawn cover around his King and make room for my light-squared Bishop to jump to d7.
11...fxe5 12.Bd7 Qd8
Black would lose after 12...exf4 13.Qxe6+ Kf8 14.Bxc8.
13.Qxe6+ Kf8 14.Bxe5
The spector of Bd6+ is too much to deal with.
14...g6 15.Bf6
And Black gives up. Why did my attack succeed? Though it appeared that I was at a disadvantage because I was down a pawn, my lead in development gave me more fighting units than my opponent. Dynamically, I was ahead in material for the short term. Of course, if Black had held me off for a while, I would have been in trouble, but energetic play allowed me to make use of my army's superior development. Always bear this in mind: A lead in development gives you a dynamic material advantage for a few moves because your developed pieces are taking part in the game while your Opponent's undeveloped ones are not. If you have a lead in development, you must use it before it goes away!
TEST 23.
Test 23. It's White's turn to play. Where should White seek his play, what is the reasoning behind this decision, and how should he go about achieving his goal? Show/Hide Solution Test 23: The center is locked by pawns, so White must turn his attention to the queenside and the kingside. Because Black possesses the most space on the queenside, only one side of the board is available for White to consider. Does he have any advantages on the kingside? Yes. He has more space (his pawns on e5 and h4 give him much more territory there) and more force (all of his pieces aim in that direction). To cap things off, Black has very few defenders on the kingside, and the closed center stops. Black from seeking a counterattack in the middle. White can go after Black in several ways. One method is 1.Rh3 followed by 2.Rg3. However, the most forceful by far is a sacrifice known as the Classic Bishop Sacrifice, which goes like this:
1.Bxh7+
By giving up a piece, White destroys the pawn cover around the Black King and also brings the poor monarch out for a walk.
1...Kxh7 2.Ng5+
White's Queen and Knight can now join in the attack with gain of time.
2...Kg8
The choices are limited: 2...Kh6? gives up the Queen after 3.Nxe6+, and the only other possibility, 2...Kg6?, loses in the same fashion after 3.h5+ Kh6 4.Nxe6+.
3.Qh5
White threatens checkmate on h7. This Classic Bishop Sacrifice does not usually work if Black can stop this checkmate with ...Nf6 (here, ...Nf6 would be answered with the simple exf6) or ...Bf5. (If the Knight on d7 and the pawn on e6 were gone, Black could play ...Bf5 and be safe. Of course, that's a lot of ifs!)
3...Re8 4.Qxf7+ Kh8 5.Qh5+ Kg8 6.Qh7+ Kf8 7.Qh8+ Ke7 8.Qxg7 checkmate
Attacking Out of Necessity Sometimes you will find the tide of battle has turned against you. You might be a pawn down, or you might be positionally busted on the queenside (you have weak pawns, you control less space, your opponent's Rooks are going to penetrate your position, and so on). What do you do? As in boxing, you might look at his chin (alias his King) and assess whether you have any realistic chance for a knockout. Do you have any justification (aside from desperation) for going after his monarch? Do you have more space? Are your pieces aimed at the King's sector of the board? If you have no advantages whatsoever, any attack is probably doomed to fail before you even begin it. However, if you have some advantages on the kingside and things look bleak elsewhere, why not take a chance and become a slugger? This type of last-chance attack, aside from having some positional justification, earns you psychological points. Your opponent, expecting a safe victory, now faces nasty threats against his King. Will he calmly withstand your onslaught? Or will he panic and, in a state of terror, make a fatal error? When you attack out of necessity, you are not always desperate, though. Quite often your opponent will have certain advantages in one area while you will have advantages in another. In such a situation, you don't have any choice: You must either use your advantages or lose without a fight. You must play wherever your strategic advantages lie! DIAGRAM 108. Black to play Bobotsov-Petrosian, Lugano, 1968 As an example, look at the position in Diagram 108, which results from 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Nc3 c6 6.Bg5 Be7 7.Qc2 g6 8.e3 Bf5 9.Bd3 Bxd3 10.Qxd3 Nbd7 11.Bh6 Ng4!
12.Bf4 O-O 13.O-O Re8 14.h3 Ngf6 15.Ne5 Nb6! 16.Bg5 Ne4 17.Bxe7 Qxe7 18.Qc2 Nd6 19.Na4
Nbc4 20.Nxc4 Nxc4 21.Nc5 Nd6! 22.Rac1 (a Queen's Gambit Declined). White tried a minority attack (see Chapter Seven for more on this topic), but Black completely outplayed him. The trade of light-squared Bishops left the c4-square weak, and b2-b4 (the normal way to play a minority attack) would allow Black to jump to c4 via ...Nc4. In addition, the Black Knight on d6 is perfectly placed. It defends b7 and eyes c4, e4, b5, and f5. The real issue now centers around the players' respective plans. White's play on the queenside has been stopped, and he cannot easily do anything elsewhere. Black's play has not even started, but his pawn chain aims at the kingside, and his pieces can jump to that side with great speed. If Black wants to have any chance of winning this game, he has to play for a kingside attack. He may not conquer the White King, but he will force his opponent to make some sort of positional concessions. (For example, if White eventually has to play f2-f3, his e-pawn will become a target on the open e-file.)
22...Qg5!
The first sign that Black is attacking. His Queen eyes both e3 and g2.
23.Qd1 h5
Black prepares a pawn storm on the kingside. (The idea behind a pawn storm is to open files for the Rooks. Here Black will eventually play ...g6-g5-g4.) He also keeps the White Queen out of g4.
24.Kh1 Re7 25.Nd3 Ne4 26.Nc5 Nd6
Black is in no hurry because White can't really do anything. However, Black does want to avoid exchanges because every trade reduces his army and thus reduces his attacking potential.
27.Nd3 Qf5 28.Ne5 f6 29.Nf3 Rg7
Black is almost ready to play ...g6-g5-g4.
30.Nh2 Re8
Why not get all your pieces in the game before you attack?
31.Kg1 Ne4 32.Qf3 Qe6
Black definitely does not want to trade Queens!
33.Rfd1 g5!
The attack starts. Black sacrifices a pawn to open files to the White King. Notice that Black is not concerned that his own King is a bit exposed because White does not have enough of an army on the kingside to do any harm there.
34.Qxh5
White might as well take the pawn. If he doesn't, Black will play ...g5-g4 and rip open the White King.
34...f5 35.Re1 g4 36.hxg4 fxg4
Black is a pawn down, but all his pieces are superior to their White counterparts. His Rooks enjoy more scope, his Knight is much superior to the old nag on h2, and the White Queen is trapped behind enemy lines and subject to attack by the whole Black army.
37.f3 gxf3 38.Nxf3 Rh7
Black has changed plans. His target was the White King, but now he has decided to hunt down its consort!
39.Qe5 Qc8 40.Qf4 Rf8 41.Qe5 Rf5
White's poor Queen has nowhere to go, and White gives up. DIAGRAM 109. Black to play Seirawan-Lautier, Belgrade, 1991 Now here's another example of attacking out of necessity from one of my games. In Diagram 109, Black has two Bishops, but I am not concerned because I have kept the center as closed as possible. I have gone into this position thinking that with the center closed, I will eventually be able to play b2-b4 and get a nice queenside attack going. Unfortunately, I should have been more concerned about my opponent's play on the other wing.
1...Ne7
This simple little retreat wakes me up! Aside from the fact that Black can someday open the center for his Bishops with ...c7-c5, he is bringing all his pieces to the kingside for an attack.
2.g3
I try to neutralize his dark-squared Bishop and also prepare to bring my own Bishop to the kingside as a defender.
2...g6!
Black intends to play ...h6-h5-h4, ...Kg7, and ...Rh8, which enables his Rooks to join the hunt for my King.
3.Bf3 h5 4.Nf4 Bxf4 5.gxf4
So I have captured his dark-squared Bishop, but my King is now a bit exposed. The interesting thing about this game so far is that Black's play on the kingside has grabbed my attention and stopped me from continuing with my own plans on the opposite wing. He is following this strategy: Use an attack to get your Opponent's attention and make him worry. Often he will stop pursuing his own plans and turn completely to the defense.
5...Nf5 6.Kh1 c5!
By blasting open the center, Black activates the Rook on d8 and the Bishop on e6. I will ultimately be unable to counter his initiative because of the unstable state of my King.
7.dxc5 d4 8.Ne4 Qe7 9.Qe2 Nh4
Black threatens 10...Nxf3 followed by ...Bd5 with a nightmarish pin.
10.Nd6 d3
I can't take this pawn because the Bishop on f3 would be undefended.
11.Qd1 b6 12.b4 bxc5 13.bxc5 Qc7 14.e4 Bh3
If I play 15.Rg1, then 15...Qxc5 threatens my Knight and my pawn on f2.
15.Qxd3 Bxf1 16.Rxf1 Qxc5 17.e5 Nxf3 18.Qxf3 Rb8
Black's extra Exchange gives him a winning position, which he eventually converts into a victory. DIAGRAM 110. Black to play Tatai-Karpov, Las Palmas, 1977 My last example also shows Black on the offensive. In Diagram 110, it isn't hard to see that White is a pawn ahead and has the superior pawn structure. The only advantage Black can boast about is a bit of central space and a significant lead in development. Because development is only a temporary advantage, Black has to attack with all his might and try to convert his developmental lead into something more permanent. Choice is not a factor in this decision; Black must attack or he will lose.
1...Nd4
Pretty self-evident. The Knight takes up a nice central post and gains time by attacking the enemy Queen.
2.Qb1 f5
Now the well-placed White Knight is forced to take a step backward.
3.Nc3 e4
Black's excellent move opens up the h8-a1 diagonal for his dark-squared Bishop, blocks the White Bishop on g2, and gains space in the center.
4.d3
White tries to get rid of that bothersome pawn on e4, but he must be very careful. Any opening of the center will favor the player with better development - Black, in this case.
4...b5 5.Be3
As I said earlier, the player with better development has, in a way, a material advantage because his extra working units give him more useable force. This is why White is so desperately trying to get his pieces out. Other possible moves, such as 5.e3 Nf3+ 6.Bxf3 exf3 7.Nxb5 Qa5+
8.Nc3 b5, leave Black in charge, and playing 5.a3 b4 6.axb4?? Rxa1 7.Qxa1 Nc2+ simply loses
the game.
5...b4 6.Nd1 Re8 7.dxe4 fxe4 8.Bxd4
The Knight on d4 was too strong and had to be eradicated. Unfortunately, the Black dark- squared Bishop now becomes rather dominant.
8...Qxd4 9.a3
White would like to castle, but he realizes that 9.O-O Qd2 10.Bxe4 Bh3 11.Bg2 Bxg2 12.Kxg2 Rxe2 13.Qc1 Qd5+ 14.Kg1 Bd4 will completely tie him up.
9...Bg4 10.Qc2 Qd3!
Very nice. Black never gives White a moment's rest.
11.exd3 exd3+ 12.Kd2 Re2+
The attack continues even after the Queen has left the board.
13.Kxd3 Rd8+
Every piece that Black owns is taking part in the attack.
14.Kc4
If White plays 14.Bd5 Rxd5+ 15.Kc4 Rxc2+ 16.Kxd5 Bf3+, he leaves Black a piece ahead.
14...Rxc2+ 15.Kxb4 Rcd2 16.f3
White has no choice. Any Knight move allows 16...Rxb2+.
16...Bf8+ 17.Ka5 Bd7
Black has woven a checkmating net around the White King. Now 18.Bf1 Bc5! takes away all legal squares from the King and creates the unstoppable threat of 19...Ra8+ with checkmate to follow. White resigns. The obligation to attack can arise anywhere on the board. You might be forced to attack on the queenside or in the center. Just be aware that you have to demand active play, and the way to find out where that play exists is to figure out where your existing advantages lie.
TEST 24.
Sherbakov-M. Gurevich, Helsinki, 1992 Test 24. It's White's turn to play, and he is a pawn down. He could try to defend passively and hope for a draw, but that type of thankless misery is only for the masochistic. Because all of White's pieces are aiming at the Black King, White must try for some kind of knockout in that direction. Normal material and positional considerations do not count (you can give away as much as you want); it's all or nothing in this situation! Fortunately for White, he can land a decisive blow. See if you can find it. Show/Hide Solution Test 24: Because his dark-squared Bishop and his Knight both hit g7, and because his Queen can join in that fight, the punch has to land there. Here's the blow-by-blow:
1.Bxg7!
White sheds the kingside pawn shield.
1...Bxg7 2.Qg5
Now g7 falls, and the game is suddenly over. What good did Black's extra pawn do him? None whatsoever! White's attack on the kingside proved to be the winning one, but if he had not taken advantage of it right away he surely would have lost.
2...Kf8 3.Rxe6!
Black was hoping to run his King to a safer place after 3.Qxg7+ Ke7. After 3.Rxe6! the pawn position around the Black King is completely tossed aside.
3...Qe5
Desperation, but 3...fxe6 4.Qxg7+ Ke8 5.Bxh7 leaves Black unable to cope with the threat of
6.Bg6+.
4.Rxe5 Bxe5 5.Re1 Re8 6.Qh6+ Ke7 7.f4
At the end, White doesn't care about checkmating the Black King anymore. He just wants to win all of Black's pieces. His army in tatters, Black resigns. It doesn't matter whether or not you saw 1.Bxg7. It does matter whether or not you recognized that White had to do something on the kingside. Show in Text Mode

Chapter Ten Faulty Strategies An old chess saying states, "A poor plan is better than no plan at all." When you play with a poor plan, you are at least trying to improve your position. Perhaps the plan will fail against better play, but you should at least get credit for trying! If you play planlessly, however, you will shuffle your pieces back and forth in an aimless fashion, waiting for your opponent to either put you out of your misery or make a game-losing blunder. Which brings to mind another chess saying: "If you don't know what to do, let your opponent come up with an idea. It's bound to be wrong!" Though this bit of chess wisdom is obviously offered tongue in cheek, and though it contrasts sharply with the first bit of wisdom, it nevertheless holds a grain of truth. The fact is that chess is a near-perfect game played by far- from-perfect people. Errors of some kind are seen in virtually every game, and all victories are due to the loser's mistakes and the winner's ability to take advantage of them - how he punishes his opponent for creating those weak pawns, giving him more space, and so on. All this doesn't mean that you should quietly wait for mistakes to occur. If you do nothing, you are making mistakes, and your position will be so bad that you won't be able to take advantage of the opponent's errors. No, you must play with a clear plan in mind at all times. But you must also be alert for your enemy's inevitable moment of suicidal blindness, which will allow you to drive the advantages that you have so carefully cultivated through the heart of his position. The form your enemy's mistake will take cannot be predicted. It might be a blunder that loses copious quantities of material; it might be a subtle strategic error that allows your plan to triumph over his; it might be a poor piece of calculation; or it might be a weak move brought on by psychological collapse. Your opponent will make these mistakes, you will make these mistakes, and I will make these mistakes. Remember yet a third chess saying and you will be able to get through these mistakes with a smile on your face: The winner is the player who makes the next-to-last mistake. Good luck. Misunderstanding the Position Chess advantages are useful only if they help you in the particular situation in which you find yourself on the board. For example, your ability to use a pawn majority to create a passed pawn is most useful in an endgame. As a result, if you possess a healthy majority, you should usually steer the game into a simplified type of position where your majority will carry some weight. It does you no good to rave about the wonders of your pawn majority if your opponent can swoop in with his whole army and behead your King. Always remember: An "advantage" that is inappropriate to the position is no advantage at all. Any gain you make is useful only if you can create a position where its virtues can be demonstrated. In other words, once you gain a Bishop vs. a Knight, a Knight vs. a Bishop, a passed pawn, more space, or anything else, you must make the position on the board conform to the needs of the advantage you have created. If you notice that you can gain a Bishop vs. a Knight but that the resulting position will be closed, you may very well want to think twice before engineering this situation. If you notice that you can create a superior pawn formation but at the cost of giving your opponent more space, you may want to think long and hard about which advantage is more useful at the present time. You must be able to prove to yourself that the advantage you gain gives your plans and possessions superiority over your opponent's plans and possessions. Attacking Prematurely The desire to reward yourself with a premature attack is one way to lose track of what is really happening in a position. For example, the position in Diagram 111 is about equal, but for some reason White decides that he has a right to checkmate Black on the kingside. Why? Evidently, White thinks the position favors him, and he wants to press home his illusory advantage. DIAGRAM 111. White to play Cardoso-Benko, Potoroz, 1958
1.g4?
By starting a pawn storm in this way, White weakens his own King and ignores the central situation. If he had control of the center or if the center were closed, then such a wing attack might be justified, but here Black can strike in the middle with ...e6-e5 and ...d6-d5. To make matters worse, the White Bishop on c4 is undefended. A saner alternative for White would have been either 1.Be2 or 1.Bd3!, which would have been my choice.
1.g4? d5!
Black remembers the rule: The best reaction to a wing attack is a counterattack in the center. If Black can get away with this counterattack, White's whole strategy will be an obvious failure because all the play will be concentrated in the middle. This response will make White's g2-g4 move look rather out of place, to say the least!
2.Bd3
If White plays 2.exd5, Black has 2...Nb4 (with a discovered attack on c4) 3.Be2 Nbxd5, with a clear advantage for Black.
2...dxe4!
Black must open up the center. He can't allow White to close it by playing e4-e5, which would give him a free hand on the kingside.
3.Nxe4 Nd5 4.Bd2 a5
The threat of ...a5-a4 torments White on the queenside, and the wide-open center keeps his attention fixed in that area also. White can't even consider a kingside attack now.
5.c3 Rd8 6.g5 a4 7.Nc1 Qb6+
Black, who is threatening the White King and the pawn on b2, and also threatening moves like ...Ne3, went on to win the game. Notice whose King is more vulnerable in this final position. Getting Hung Up on Development Another way to lose track of what is happening in a position is to get so involved in simple development that you fail to take the dynamics of a particular situation into account. I am as guilty of this type of one-track playing as anyone, as this next game illustrates. Granda Zuñiga-Seirawan Buenos Aires, 1993 In this game, I lose my sense of danger early on and continue to develop my pieces in a routine fashion, unaware of the surprise that awaits me.
1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.Nc3 e6 4.g3 b6 5.Bg2 Bb7 6.O-O Nc6 7.e4 e5 8.d3 g6
I think everything is fine after playing this move. I know I am behind in development but, as Diagram 112 shows, the center is closed, and I don't anticipate any problem. However, my opponent is about to bring me back to the real world. DIAGRAM 112. White to play
9.Nxe5!!
I cannot believe what I am seeing! This shock could have been prevented, of course, by 8...d6, but the possibility of his giving up a piece so early in the game never even entered my mind. Now White can push my pieces back and take advantage of his lead in development, which I had thought was without value just moments ago. To make matters even worse, I have to adjust to a defensive mind-set. Unfortunately, I still refuse to believe that I have made an error of judgment and, instead of implementing some sort of damage control, I play as if my opponent's sacrifice is unsound.
9...Nxe5 10.f4 Nc6 11.e5 Ng8 12.f5
White has a very strong attack, and his lead in development becomes more and more menacing as the position opens up.
12...Nh6?
Overconfident, I lose touch with reality. A much more challenging defense would have been
12...Rb8! (which defends my Bishop and frees my Knight from the pin along the h1-a8 diagonal)
13.e6 dxe6 14.fxe6 f5 15.Rxf5 Qd4+ 16.Rf2, leaving a sharp, unclear position.
13.Ne4!
Oops. Now I can't keep him out of f6 because 13...Be7 just hangs my h6-Knight to 14.Bxh6, whereas 13...Bg7 allows 14.Nd6+.
13...Nxf5 14.Nf6+ Ke7 15.Nd5+ Ke8 16.Nf6+ Ke7 17.g4
White's powerful attack eventually breaks through and leads to my demise. My lesson in this game was to beware of falling behind in development, even in innocent looking positions! Playing Complacently One of the most common mistakes a player can make is to play mindlessly along, repeating known ideas used before in similar situations. The player thinks he is playing by the book but, because one or two details are askew, the position is different and should be evaluated differently. Seirawan-Karpov Haninge, 1990 In this game, we see no less a player than the careful Karpov fall into this type of mental trap.
1.c4 e5 2.g3 g6 3.d4 d6 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.Nc3 c6?
As you can see in Diagram 113, Black's sixth move gives his King the c7-square and takes d5 away from the White Knight. I suspect that Karpov thought he had entered a line that usually begins with 1.d4 d6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 dxe5 4.Qxd8+ Kxd8 5.Nc3 c6, which leads to a satisfactory position for Black. In fact, I have successfully played Black with this line of play several times. However, the fact that I have played g3 and Black has played ...g6 favors me, because the White Bishop can now go to h3, whereas ...g6 does not help Black at all. In fact, it actually weakens f6 and the a1-h8 diagonal. So a Black move that is excellent in the position that results from a line starting with 1.d4 is now a mistake, but my opponent doesn't notice this subtle fact until it is too late. Why does he make this error? Because he isn't thinking yet! He is just playing on his knowledge of a similar position - knowledge that proves erroneous in the present situation! DIAGRAM 113. White to play
7.f4!
I have a slight lead in development, and the Black King is in the center. I go out of my way to blast open lines of attack so that I can take advantage of these factors.
7...Be6
Black places his Bishop on a nice square. Playing 7...Nd7 would make it very hard to develop this piece in the future, and 7...exf4? 8.Bxf4 Be6 9.O-O-O+ Nd7 10.Nf3 would leave the Black King without a safe haven.
8.Nf3
I have no interest in 8.fxe5 because 8...Nd7 would leave me tied to the defense of that miserable e-pawn for the rest of the game. Instead, I choose to develop rapidly and generate chances for an attack.
8...Bxc4
Black hopes that I will accept a simple trade with 9.Nxe5 Be6, after which he has everything under control.
9.Bh3!
Now I threaten 10.Nxe5 because 10...Be6 would lose to 11.Bxe6 followed by 12.Nf7+. Black doesn't want to accelerate my development with 9...exf4 10.Bxf4, so he tries to block off my Bishop on h3.
9...f5 10.b3!!
I don't want to waste my time taking back that pawn on e5. Instead, I prepare to place my Bishop on b2, where it will create real threats along the a1-h8 diagonal.
10...Bb4 11.Bb2 Bd5 12.e4!
Since making his mistake on move 6, Black has not had a moment's rest. With 12.e4, I continue my strategy of ripping open the center to help my better developed forces. Now
12...Bxe4 13.O-O-O+ followed by 14.Nxe4 would be very strong for me when White has
completed his development and will win material.
12...fxe4 13.O-O-O!
I seem to live for development, but this temporary piece sacrifice works because of the poor placement of the Black King and the vulnerability of the Black Rook on h8.
13...Bxc3!
Black stops me from taking on d5.
14.Bxc3 exf3 15.Bxe5 Nd7 16.Bxh8
I win the Exchange and use my material edge to win the game. Overlooking Tactical Factors So far we have witnessed errors that result from overconfidence, the mindless adherence to simple development, and the unthinking usage of basic themes that may not be appropriate to the current position on the board. All errors of these types involve a touch of laziness; the perpetrator of the error does not take the time to really come to grips with the position. Laziness is the cornerstone of most mistakes. If you make an error because the position is too difficult to figure out, then you have nothing to be ashamed of. However, if your mistake is due to a lack of thought, you must swallow your excuses and find a way to increase your level of concentration. Another type of mistake is tactical. You make a move that may be right positionally but that fails to take into consideration the tactical peculiarities of the exact situation. Let's look at an example of this type of error. In Diagram 114, Black understandably wants to close off the queenside because I have more space there, but he doesn't take into account the unprotected state of his Rook on a8. DIAGRAM 114. Black to play Seirawan-Van Wely, Wijk aan Zee, 1992
1...a5? 2.b5 Nd8
That Rook on a8 is being eyed by my Bishop on g2, but so many pieces and pawns are in the way that Black feels safe from any surprise attack. If Black explored the danger on the h1-a8 diagonal more thoroughly, he would see what is coming and avoid 1...a5. However, that tinge of laziness, that blind sense of security, once again brings a player to his knees. Everyone is so humbled by such tactical oversights.
3.exf5!
I get rid of that first obstacle on the long diagonal.
3...Bxf5
Also losing is 3...Nxf5? 4.g4! hxg4 5.fxg4 Nh6 6.Bxh6 Bxh6 7.g5 Bg7 8.Nxb6!, when the Rook on a8 gets eaten just as it does in the game.
4.g4! hxg4 5.fxg4
There goes another obstacle on that diagonal. Suddenly, my g2-Bishop is completely open.
5...Nxg4 6.Nxb6
The last piece moves out of the Bishop's way, again with tempo.
6...cxb6 7.Bxa8 Qc8 8.Bf3
I have again used my material advantage to obtain a victory.
TEST 25.
Arencibia-Seirawan, Manila, 1990 Test 25. It's White turn to play. He has played a very aggressive game (the opening moves were
1.d4 d6 2.Nc3 g6 3.h4 Bg7 4.h5 Nc6 5.Nf3 e5 6.h6 Bf6 7.d5 Nb8 8.e4 Be7 9.Bb5+ Nd7) and
now continues in the same vein with 10.g4. Is this attacking move justified? Show/Hide Solution Test 25: Playing 10.g4 has no real purpose and, aside from weakening the g-pawn, ultimately leads to the loss of the f4-square. White's King is still in the middle, and he has not yet completed his development, so what gives him the right to attack? A sane series of moves is
10.Be3 Ngf6 11.Nd2, which gives extra support to e4 and keeps the enemy Knight out of g4. But
because White has been attacking earlier, he is stuck in that mind-set and throws himself on his sword.
10.g4? Ngf6 11.Nh4?!
What can this Knight do here? Coming forward is not necessarily good!
11...a6 12.Bd3 Nc5
The Knight comes to a good square and uncovers an attack on g4 by the Bishop on c8.
13.g5 Nh5
The Knight heads for f4, and the e7-Bishop attacks g5. Who is really doing the attacking here?
14.Rg1 Nf4 15.Bxf4 exf4 16.Nf3 O-O 17.Be2 f6 18.Nd4
White understandably didn't like the look of 18.gxf6 Bxf6, when Black has the two Bishops and control of the e5-square. His move is an attempt to win material, but it fails to a tactical sequence that I had foreseen several moves earlier.
18...fxg5 19.b4
The point of 18.Nd4. If my Knight retreats to d7, then 20.Ne6 wins material.
19...Bf6!
White's dark-square weaknesses begin to show. Now 20.bxc5 dxc5 does nothing for White because his d4-Knight can't move (because of ...Bxc3).
20.Qd2 Be5!
I'm still playing on those same weaknesses. The tempting 21.bxc5 now fails to 21...Qf6
22.Rd1 dxc5, whereas 22.O-O-O fails to 22...f3, which threatens the Bishop on e2, and ...Bf4,
which wins the Queen.
21.Rd1 Qf6 22.Bg4 Bxg4 23.Rxg4 Nd7 24.Nde2 f3
White did not want to suffer through 25.Nd4 Bf4 26.Qd3 Ne5, which forks the Queen and the Rook on g4, so he resigned. The tactics all worked for Black because White's groundless attacking play caused him to make some positional concessions (like the bothersome dark-squared Bishop) that gave Black more firepower in the fight that ensued. Basing a Decision on Emotion Rather Than Reason Chess is a game of the intellect first and a creative endeavor second. These two attributes combine to help players create beautiful works of art that last for centuries. Anger, fear, and overconfidence are common emotions that may help you in the odd game but that ultimately lead to defeat because they cloud the intellectual and creative processes. These emotions are as dangerous in chess as they are in life. If you dislike your opponent, don't let anger make you play too aggressively. If you are afraid of your opponent, don't be a chicken and play for a draw. If you are confident you can win, don't allow your sense of danger to desert you. We are all emotional beings, but when emotion tells you which move to play, you should do a reality check. Are you in danger of spinning out of control? If you find that your mind is taking a break and you have lost your concentration, get up and walk around (if you have sufficient time on your clock), take a few deep breaths, jump up and down - do anything that will put your mind back at the helm. Having said that, I recognize that there are times when nothing will put your emotions on hold. If your wife has just left you or your lawyer tells you that your financial empire has turned to dust, a pleasant game of chess may ease your pain a bit, but don't expect to play at your full potential. DIAGRAM 115. Black to play Diagram 115 comes from a game where emotions were out in force. Black was the higher rated player and wanted to win very badly. Unfortunately, he had no way to accomplish his goal from this position. His unobtainable desire led to an emotional reaction. Black set a trap. He played
1...Kf6??, hoping to win the pawn endgame after 2.Nf4 (his idea is Nxd5, xb6, xc4, xa5 - quite a
series of captures!) 2...Bxf4 3.Kxf4 h4. However, this "trap" should have been Black's downfall. After 4.e4 dxe4 5.Kxe4, the protected passed d5-pawn should have allowed White to march over, win the h-pawn, and then win the game. It turned out that White was incapacitated by stark terror (most players are afraid of higher rated opponents). Believing that Black's trap was real, he retreated the Knight to f2! Black eventually won this game because of his fearful opponent's major blunder. This game is evidence of the saying: Terror is a self-fulfilling prophecy. In this game, we saw overconfidence sowing the seeds of defeat and fear germinating the seeds and eventually harvesting the loss. Overconfidence (which sometimes manifests itself as wishful thinking) is obviously less incapacitating than terror, but overconfidence is nevertheless an emotional reaction that will lead to a loss against a good opponent. Remember: Overconfidence leads you away from the realities of the position to the world of wishful thinking. DIAGRAM 116. White to play Tartakower-Em. Lasker, New York, 1924 The next game is an example of overconfidence at work. In Diagram 116, White has more space in the center and on the queenside. Other than ...Nf4, Black has no counterplay whatsoever. White should be playing to expand his queenside territorial edge with b4, Be3, and c4-c5. (If White is worried about strange sacrifices on the kingside, such as ...Bxh3 or ...Nf4 followed by ...Nxg2, he could first play Re1 followed by Bf1 and then roll Black up with that c4- c5 idea.) Instead, White gets emotionally bent out of shape, experiences feelings of grandeur, and decides that he has every right to blast his opponent off the board. His reasoning goes something like this: "Since I have the advantage on the queenside and in the center, why not take over on the kingside also?"
1.f4?
Horrible. With one move, White creates a backward pawn on e4 and gives Black use of the e5- square, activity on the e-file for the Black Rook, and two Bishops. (By losing his dark-squared Bishop, White can easily become weak on that color.) Why hand all these nice tidbits to your opponent? Why give him counterplay where none existed? If you want to prove that your game is superior, use the advantages your position gives you. Don't allow some strange macho quirk in your personality (or a simple bad mood) to push aside common sense and create self-inflicted wounds.
1...exf4 2.Bxf4 Nxf4 3.Rxf4
White had more space, but he has allowed several exchanges to occur. By now, you should know that trading benefits the side with less space.
3...Be7!
Black wants to gain two advantages: He wants to get his Knight to e5, and he wants to make use of his dark-squared Bishop (a piece White no longer possesses) by placing it on an active post like g5. Because these two advantages are more or less static (and therefore permanent - see the distinction between static and dynamic advantages discussed in Chapter One), Black first bolsters any potential weak points in his camp and reorganizes his Knight and Bishop so that they can get to their appointed squares.
4.Raf1
Playing 4.Nf3 Nh5 would embarrass the f4-Rook.
4...Rf8
Black defends f7 and gives the e8-square to the light-squared Bishop.
5.Qd3 Be8 6.Qg3
White threatens 7.Rxf6 Bxf6 8.Rxf6, using the pin on the g-file.
6...Qd8
Black not only stops White's threat but also backs up the e7-Bishop so that it can safely go to g5 after the Knight moves out of the way. Black's reshuffling on the back ranks may appear contorted but he is playing to bring his passive pieces to outstanding outposts!
7.Nd1 Nd7
The liberated Bishop is heading for the promised land on g5, while the Knight is heading for e5.
8.Ne3 Bg5
White must have a sinking feeling at this point. He had a great position a few moves earlier, and now as a result of his unreasonable desire to attack the Black King, Black has acquired several advantages.
9.Rg4
No better is 9.Rf5 Bh4, when 10.Qf3 or 10.Qg4 are met with 10...Ne5, and 10.Qf4 g6 leaves the Rook hanging out to dry.
9...f6 10.Qf2 h5 11.Rg3 h4! 12.Rg4 Bh5
Black won the Exchange and eventually won the game. It's not necessary to study countless individual positions to conclude that emotion has a negative impact on any chess game. Learn to monitor your feelings during a game, and if you sense fear, depression, insecurity, or overconfidence setting in, be aware that your susceptibility to a lack of reason is increased. Take precautions: Write down your move before you play it and ask if it conforms to the demands of the position. Is it too timid? Too bold? Is it part of your plan? Does the intended move strengthen your advantages? Remember: You are playing your opponent and the board, not an unreasonable mind that has turned against you.
TEST 26.
Test 26. Black is a class C player facing an Expert. It is his move. He sees that 1...Qxc2 is possible, with a threat of checkmate on f2, but White is a far stronger player and has powerful replies such as 2.Qxa8+, 2.Qxf7+, or 2.Bxf7+ at his disposal. What should Black do? Show/Hide Solution Test 26: When facing someone rated several hundred points higher than yourself, you have a tendency to think that this omnipotent opponent sees everything. Such an attitude, of course, dooms you to certain defeat. Everyone is human, and everyone makes very bad mistakes. You should try to play the same way against everyone, no matter whether they are a beginner or the World Champion. In this position, Black is a pawn down, so if he can't find something soon, he will most likely lose. He could defend by playing 1...Qe8??, but then 2.Bxf7+ Qxf7 3.Qxa8+ would win easily for White. Another defense is 1...Rf8, but White would have a definite advantage after 2.b3. I can see many players losing to their higher rated opponents after these continuations and chalking it up to statistics. However, they could grab a moment of glory with the risky-looking 1...Qxc2!, because
2.Qxa8+ Kh7 leaves White powerless to prevent 3.Kg1 Qxf2+ 4.Kh1 Qxg2 checkmate. The
other replies to 1...Qxc2! are no better for White: 2.Bxf7+ Kh7 is easy for Black, whereas
2.Qxf7+ Kh8 also spells the end.
I suspect that Black might have seen 1...Qxc2 if White had been rated much lower than Black and if Black had been in the position of having to look for a way to win. I also suspect that the rating difference would then have given Black the confidence to find the solution! Time and time again, the silly little numbers that appear after a name incite bravery or fear in players, no matter what their type of mental makeup. Play the board, not the rating, and you will see your results take a big turn for the better! Chapter Eleven The Great Masters of Strategy In chess, as in life, each player has a style that is distinct and personal. Some styles are attacking, some defensive, and some positional or strategic. A modem Grandmaster is expected to play well in all situations, but he usually excels in only one of these styles of play. In boxing, the public always loves a slugger, and the chess public is subject to the same sort of discrimination. They love the wild attacker and the beautiful combinations that he produces. However, it is the Grandmaster with the positional style who demonstrates the deepest understanding of chess. In this chapter, we will spend a little time with the six greatest exponents of strategy. Each of these men has given something to the game that has enriched future generations of players. Wilhelm Steinitz Born in Prague in 1836, Wilhelm Steinitz moved to Vienna as a young man, became enchanted with chess, and by 1862 was playing professional chess in England. Playing with the attacking style of his contemporaries, the young London-based Steinitz was quickly recognized as one of the finest players in the world. In 1873, Steinitz's style suddenly turned positional. He became interested in pawn structure, piece placement, and all the other aspects of positional play that produce static advantages. You might think that such a major change in philosophy would have damaged his game, but the result was just the opposite. Instead of being merely one of the world's best players, he became a force unto himself - a player far ahead of his time. As he honed his new found skills, Steinitz created a new school of chess thought that only the world's elite players could understand. He pioneered the idea that you must first create some sort of positional superiority before you can successfully attack. He also became a master of defense and repelled attacks that would have caused other players to run screaming in fear. One of his greatest gifts to the chess world was his Accumulation Theory, which states that a game can and should be won by the accumulation of small advantages. In 1883, after 20 years in England, Steinitz emigrated to the United States and eventually became an American citizen. Now recognized as unofficial World Champion, Steinitz played the first official world title match in 1886 against Zukertort. He won this battle with ten wins, five losses, and five draws. In January 1892, James G. Cunningham wrote about Steinitz in the British Chess Magazine: He is a man of great physical vigour, and possesses a well-preserved constitution. Everything about him denoted power rather than grace, strength rather than beauty. His stature was short but [his] form massive, his chest broad, his bearing sturdy. His features were rugged in outline, and his face the face of a man of action rather than a man of thought...with bright tawny looks, round face, a crushed-up nose...broad forehead, deepset eyes, and a rough shaggy beard of bright tawny hue, the whole balanced squarely on a thick neck, that again on a short massive body. Cunningham's words paint a portrait of a man in his prime, which makes Steinitz's collapse a few years later all the more remarkable. In 1894, at the age of 58, Steinitz lost the title that was so dear to him to an unheralded 25-year-old German Master named Emanuel Lasker. Shocked by this reversal, Steinitz's physical and mental health took a turn for the worse. When he challenged Lasker to a return match a few years later, he was horribly crushed. Once likeable and proud, Steinitz became cranky and irrational in his final years. He died in poverty in 1900. I feel it fitting to end this biography of the man now known as the father of modern chess with the excellent tribute paid to him by Emanuel Lasker in his Manual of Chess: ...the greatest landmark in the history of chess is reached: William Steinitz announces the principles of strategy, the result of inspired thought and imagination...I who vanquished him must see to it that his great achievement, his theories, should find justice, and I must avenge the wrongs he suffered. Lasker-Steinitz World Championship Match, 1894 17th Match Game
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.d3 Nf6 5.Nc3
Lasker was never a master of opening theory, which explains the tame line he chooses here.
5...d6 6.Be3 Bb6
Black does not want to play 6...Bxe3, a move that strengthens White's center and gives him a half-open f-file for his Rooks.
7.Qd2 Na5 8.Bb5+ c6 9.Ba4 Bxe3
Black is forced to play this move anyway because b2-b4 might well have embarrassed his Knight. Instead of lamenting his loss of choice in the matter, Steinitz plays to double other pawns as well. By so doing, he hopes to achieve a superior pawn structure and, as a result, a superior endgame.
10.fxe3 b5 11.Bb3 Qb6
Black eyes the potential pawn weakness on e3.
12.O-O
White is probably quite satisfied with his position. His control of d4 and f4, plus the possibility of attack down the half-open f-file, are trumps that he must enjoy holding.
12...Ng4
Black attacks the e3-pawn, but the goal of this obvious assault is not to win that pawn. The real point of Black's play is to continue with ...f7-f6 and kill off any potential White may have had on the f-file. So the attacking 12...Ng4 is actually a defensive move!
13.Rae1 f6 14.h3 Nh6 15.Ne2 Nxb3 16.axb3 O-O
Steinitz has created a very firm position, whereas White's position is inflexible because of his double pawns. Black now plans to hold everything together on the kingside and in the center while striking out on the queenside with ...a7-a5 and then a4.
17.Ng3 a5 18.d4
DIAGRAM 117. Black to play Lasker must be a bit frustrated here because this advance hardly threatens the rock-hard pawn on e5. In fact, as you can see in Diagram 117, playing 18.d4 does more harm than good because it takes away all pawn protection from the e4-pawn. Why does Lasker make such a concession? Because he sees that the center is dead and the queenside is in Black's hands. This leaves him only the kingside, but Steinitz's defensive preparations have made it all but impossible to break through over there.
18...Nf7 19.Qf2 Ra7 20.Rd1 a4
White's doubled pawns on the queenside are not really weak, so Black offers to get rid of them if White is willing to open lines over there. Naturally, White refuses this offer because it makes no sense to open files that only the enemy can use.
21.b4 Qc7 22.Ne1 c5 23.Qd2 Be6
Now White can open the d-file if he wishes to, but he cannot use it to penetrate the Black position because d4, d5, d6, d7, and d8 are all covered by Black pieces.
24.d5 Bd7
More long-range advantages for Steinitz: The center is dead, the kingside is safe, the queenside is Black's, and White's center pawns all rest on light-colored squares, making them potential targets for the Bishop later in the game.
25.Ra1 cxb4
Now that everything is safe, Black switches to the queenside attack that he has been preparing for so diligently.
26.Qxb4 Rc8 27.Qd2 Qc4 28.Rf2 Ng5
White is now dreaming only of survival. At the moment, his pawns on c2 and e4 are being pressured.
29.Qd3 Rac7 30.h4 Nf7 31.Qxc4 Rxc4 32.Rd2 g6
Now the White Knight cannot jump to f5.
33.Kf2 Nd8
The Black Knight heads for the queenside battleground.
34.b3 R4c7 35.Rdd1 Nb7 36.Rdb1 Kf7
Black is in no hurry, so he takes a moment off to protect his pawn on f6 and bring his King a bit closer to the center.
37.Ke2 Ra8 38.Kd2 Na5 39.Kd3 h5 40.Ra2 Raa7
Black threatens to win a pawn with 41.-- 41...axb3 42.cxb3 Nxb3! 43.Rxa7 Nc5+ and
44...Rxa7.
41.b4 Nc4
New advantages for Black to crow about: The c4-square has fallen into his hands, and his a- pawn is now a near lethal passer.
42.Nf3 Ra8 43.Nd2 Nb6
The White Knight on d2 has no future because of its lack of support points, so Black refuses to exchange it.
44.Rf1 Rac8 45.Nb1 Ke7 46.c3 Nc4 47.Raf2 Na3!
Black is trying to undermine the defense of c3. Now 48.Nxa3? loses to 48...Rxc3+ followed by
49...Rxa3.
48.Ne2 Nxb1 49.Rxb1 Bg4
Once again Black threatens to get rid of the defender of c3, this time with 50...Bxe2+.
50.Rc1 Rc4 51.Rc2 f5
White resigns. He is surrounded and does not wish to experience any more punishment. The e4-pawn is hanging, 52.exf5 loses to 52...Bxf5+, and 52.Ng3 also fails to 52...fxe4+ 53.Kd2 (even worse is 53.Nxe4 Bf5) 53...Bd7 54.Rc1 Be8 55.Ne2 Bf7, after which Black also picks up the d5-pawn. A masterful game of strategic demolition. Akiba Rubinstein The youngest of 12 children, Akiba Rubinstein was born in 1882 in the Polish border town of Stawiski. His parents wanted him to be a rabbi, but after he learned the game of chess at the relatively late age of 16, his thoughts were on nothing else. After several years of skill development, Rubinstein exploded onto the international scene and was one of the world's dominant players from 1905 to 1911. In 1912, he won tournament after tournament (five in all), and the year was dubbed the Rubinstein Year. Everyone demanded a match between Rubinstein and Lasker, clearly the only player who was close to Rubinstein in strength. Sadly, this match never took place. The beginning of deep psychological problems that eventually turned into full- fledged mental illness, the appearance of the Cuban chess genius Capablanca, and the advent of World War I all combined to dash his championship hopes. Though he remained one of the world's strongest players until about 1921, his pathological shyness and the erosion of his confidence led to a gradual disintegration of his powers. He finally retired from chess in 1932 and spent his final years until his death in 1961 with his family in Belgium. Rubinstein's style formed a bridge between the styles of Steinitz and the players of today. A mastery of openings, a deep understanding of the consequences of different types of pawn structures, and a skill in the endgame that has never been surpassed were all part of his repertoire. Most notable, however, was his ability to connect the openings he played with the kinds of endgames that could be reached from them. This incredibly deep planning is commonly seen in modern champions, but it was virtually unheard of in Rubinstein's day. Today, Rubinstein's games are carefully studied by all the finest players. His moves and concepts still seem fresh, his handling of the endgame is still remarkable, and his opening ideas are still all the rage. Rubinstein-Tarrasch Teplitz-Schoenau, 1922
1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c5 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.g3
Black's defense was eventually named after Tarrasch, who insisted that the isolated d5-pawn that results from this opening will be a source of strength rather than weakness. The 6.g3 move is an invention of Rubinstein's and is now considered to be the main line. Here, we are seeing a game between the two originators of this line: Tarrasch playing his beloved defense, and Rubinstein trying to demonstrate its shortcomings with his own 6.g3.
6...Nf6 7.Bg2 Be7 8.O-O O-O 9.a3
Not a bad move. Nowadays 9.Bg5 is the most common way for White to handle this position.
9...Be6 10.dxc5 Bxc5 11.b4 Be7 12.Bb2
White is training his sights on the d4-square, following the rule that you should always try to control the square directly in front of the isolated pawn.
12...Ne4?
A natural move, but one that is shown to be bad in a surprising way.
13.b5!
The position is now as shown in Diagram 118. DIAGRAM 118. Black to play Rubinstein's truly remarkable 13th move shows that he was never afraid to step out of the boundaries of convention. In Diagram 118, he seems to be forcing the Black Knight to a5, where it can pounce on the hole on c4. Rubinstein has seen that this Knight will actually be vulnerable on a5 and that the c4-square will never be of any real consequence. On top of all that, the Knight's absence from c6 allows White's own Knight to take up residence on d4.
13...Na5 14.Nxe4
The first point: The isolated d-pawn is brought back in connection with its kingside brothers, but it turns out to be far more vulnerable on e4 than it ever was on d5!
14...dxe4 15.Nd4 Qd5
White threatened both 16.Bxe4 and 16.Nxe6. Black didn't like 15...Bd5 16.Nf5 because the dual threats of 17.Qxd5! Qxd5 18.Nxe7+ and 17.Bxg7 were impossible to meet. Also bad was
15...Nc4 16.Nxe6 Qxd1 17.Raxd1 Nxb2 18.Rd7, with superior play for White.
16.Qc2
Now White threatens to chop off the e4-pawn.
16...f5 17.Qc3!
The real point of White's 13th move is finally revealed. White threatens both 18.Qxa5 and a Knight move (18.Nxe6 or 18.Nxf5) with a resultant discovered attack on g7.
17...Nc4
The only way to resist because 17...Bf6 loses quickly to 18.Qxa5 Bxd4 19.Rad1 Bb6 (19...Bxb2 20.Rxd5 Bxd5 21.Qd2 snares a Bishop.) 20.Qc3, threatening both checkmate on g7 as well as Black's Queen.
18.Nxf5! Bf6
Again Black has no choice because 18...Bxf5 allows White to end the game abruptly with
19.Qxg7 checkmate.
19.Qxf6?
A rare example of Rubinstein imprecision. Seeing a winning endgame, he doesn't bother to look for something even better: 19.Ne7+! Kh8 20.Nxd5 Bxc3 21.Nxc3 Nxb2 22.Bxe4, would give White two extra pawns.
19...gxf6 20.Ne7+ Kf7 21.Nxd5 Bxd5
White would meet 21...Nxb2 with 22.Nc7 followed by Nxe6 and Bxe4, with a won game.
22.Rfd1 Ke6 23.Bc3 Rfd8 24.Rd4 f5 25.g4!
Rubinstein's great endgame technique will make things look easy, though in fact the opposite- colored Bishops create great difficulties for him. Playing 25.g4 undermines the e4-pawn and increases the scope of the g2-Bishop.
25...Nd6
Black defends e4 and threatens the pawn on b5. Has Rubinstein missed something?
26.Rad1
No, he has calculated everything out to a win. This threat to the d5-Bishop forces Black's hand.
26...Nxb5
If Black played 26...Bb3, Rubinstein had a pretty checkmating attack prepared: 27.gxf5+ Kxf5
28.Rxd6 Bxd1 29.Bh3+ Kf4 30.e3+ Kf3 31.Rf6+ Ke2 32.Bf1 checkmate (analysis by Hans
Kmoch).
27.gxf5+ Kf7
Playing 27...Kxf5 allows White to capture the Bishop with check.
28.Rxd5 Rxd5 29.Rxd5 Nxc3 30.Rc5 Nxe2+ 31.Kf1 Nf4 32.Bxe4
White is still only one pawn ahead, but now his Bishop has reached a very active square, and his Rook will find happiness on the 7th rank.
32...Rd8 33.Rc7+ Kf6
Black threatens 34...Rd1 checkmate.
34.Ke1 Re8 35.f3 Nd5 36.Rxb7
The two extra pawns guarantee White a relatively easy victory.
36...Nc3 37.Rb4 Nd5 38.Ra4! Re7 39.Kf2 Nb6 40.Ra5
Black's momentary activity is at an end, and now White's Bishop and Rook are superior to their Black counterparts.
40...Rc7 41.Kg3 Nd7 42.Ra6+ Kg7 43.Kf4
During the last few moves, White has taken his time and improved the placement of his Rook and King while forcing the enemy pieces into passive positions.
43...Nb6 44.h4 Rf7 45.Kg5 h6+ 46.Kf4 Kf8 47.a4
The poor Black Knight will not even be allowed the b6-square.
47...Rc7 48.a5 Nc4 49.f6 Rd7 50.Rc6
White gives up the a-pawn but places the Knight on the rim and out of play. He now has a pawn, Rook, Bishop, and King vs. Black's King and Rook. It's clear that the Black army will be outnumbered.
50...Nxa5 51.Rc8+ Kf7 52.Ke5 Nb7 53.Bf5
Black resigns. If he moves his Rook to safety (for instance, 53...Rd1), then 54.Rc7+ picks up the Knight. José RaúI Capablanca Born in Cuba in 1888, José Raúl Capablanca learned how to play the game at the age of four and beat Juan Corzo, the Champion of Cuba, in 1901. He attended Columbia University in 1906 but spent little time studying; instead, he played hundreds of chess games against New York's finest players at the Manhattan Chess Club. It was there that he met Lasker and Alekhine. The great Alekhine commented that he had never seen another player who possessed such a "flabbergasting quickness of chess comprehension." Quitting school so that he could play chess full-time, Capablanca played a match with the very experienced U.S. Champion Frank Marshall and crushed him by eight wins to one. Because of this victory, the unknown Capablanca was allowed to play in the mighty San Sebastian tournament of 1911. Many people were upset that the untested youngster was seeded into this elite group, but he shut everyone up when he won the event outright. Accepted as one of the best two or three players in the world, Capablanca challenged Lasker to a title match but the World Champion's conditions were so numerous that the two sides were unable to agree on mutually acceptable terms. In 1913, Capablanca managed to get a post in the Cuban Foreign Office; he had no specific duties but was expected to act as a kind of goodwill ambassador. Always in the public spotlight, the good-looking, well-dressed young man always made a favorable impression. With all his financial needs taken care of by the Cuban government, the always courteous and charming Capablanca continued playing chess and appeared to have the world on a string. After coming in second to Lasker in St Petersburg 1914, he raised the level of his game so high that he lost only once in the next ten years! His successes included numerous tournament victories and a World Championship match victory over an aging Lasker in 1921. Considered an invincible chess machine, he stunned the chess world when he lost the title to Alekhine in 1927. No longer in his prime, Capablanca was beaten by age, laziness (he didn't take his opponent very seriously), and the ascent of a new kind of player. Alexander Alekhine's incredible preparation and relentless energy made hard work and dedication an integral part of the game. These were traits that Capablanca had failed to nurture, so he fell by the wayside and was never granted a rematch. He died in 1942. Capablanca was the first great technical player, and he developed liquidation to a fine art. Possessing flawless positional judgment and legendary endgame skill, the great Cuban would avoid messy complications, retain subtle strategic elements that could later be used to ensure him some kind of advantage, and steer the game into positions of crystal clarity. Loved, feared, and even worshipped by his fellow Grandmasters, Capablanca was considered the most naturally talented player anyone had ever seen. Alekhine, who was surprised by his own victory over the Cuban, said that "the world would never see the like of such a genius again." And World Champion Max Euwe put things into perspective when he wrote (in 1975), "I honestly feel very humble when I study Capablanca's games." Capablanca-Alekhine St. Petersburg, 1914
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.e3 Nf6 4.Nf3 e6 5.Nbd2 Nbd7
The best answer to White's rather humble developing scheme is 5...c5, taking advantage of the fact that White's Knight (which can no longer go to c3) can't put pressure on d5.
6.Bd3 Be7 7.O-O O-O 8.Qc2 dxc4?
Again, 8...c5 was indicated. The move 8...dxc4 just brings the White Knight to a strong central post.
9.Nxc4 c5 10.Nce5 cxd4 11.exd4 Nb6
Black is hoping to make use of White's isolated d-pawn, but in this situation, the pawn's space-gaining qualities are a considerable advantage whereas its potential weakness is hardly noticeable.
12.Ng5
White threatens 12...-- 13.Bxh7+ Kh8 14.Ngxf7+ Rxf7 15.Nxf7 checkmate. Of course, Black will see this threat, but the only way to stop it is to play ...g6, a move that weakens the dark squares around the Black King.
12...g6 13.Ngf3 Kg7 14.Bg5 Nbd5 15.Rac1 Bd7 16.Qd2 Ng8
Black's move keeps White's dark-squared Bishop out of h6.
17.Bxe7 Qxe7 18.Be4!
White is trying to clarify the position by taking on d5 and leaving Black with a bad Bishop vs. a good Knight.
18...Bb5?
The young Alekhine falls in with his opponent's plans. He would have done better to play
18...Ngf6 19.Bxd5 Nxd5 20.Ng4 f6 21.Qh6+ Kh8, which produces a defensible position.
19.Rfe1 Qd6 20.Bxd5 exd5
Playing 20...Qxd5 is not possible because of 21.Rc5.
21.Qa5!
The position is now as shown in Diagram 119. Capablanca is aware that his Knights are superior to the enemy Bishop (which is striking at nothing), so he prepares a transition into an endgame by 22.Qc7!, a move that allows the Rook to enter the 7th rank. DIAGRAM 119. Black to play
21...a6 22.Qc7! Qxc7 23.Rxc7 h6
Black must accept the loss of a pawn because 23...Rab8 loses to 24.Ng5 with the double threat of 25.Ngxf7 and 25.Ne6+, winning the f8-Rook.
24.Rxb7
Nothing exciting has happened, but Black is utterly lost. This quiet way of pushing the enemy into the abyss is typical of Capablanca's style.
24...Rac8 25.b3 Rc2 26.a4 Be2 27.Nh4!
A crushing blow! Now 28.Nhxg6 is threatened, and 27...g5 28.Nf5+ followed by 29.Ng3, wins the trapped Bishop.
27...h5 28.Nhxg6 Re8 29.Rxf7+
It is surprising that Alekhine does not resign here as he is three pawns behind and his King is under siege.
29...Kh6 30.f4 a5 31.Nh4
White threatens 32.Nf5 checkmate.
31...Rxe5 32.fxe5 Kg5 33.g3 Kg4 34.Rg7+ Kh3 35.Ng2
Nothing can be done to stop 36.Nf4 checkmate, so Alekhine gives up. Simple looking, wasn't it? That's why Capablanca was known as an unbeatable chess machine. He made other players look like children! Aaron Nimzovich Born in Russia in 1886, Aaron Nimzovich was the rebel of the chess world. While most players were learning the doctrines of Steinitz and Tarrasch, the acknowledged high priests of chess, Nimzovich was preaching a whole new set of ideas. Prophylaxis, Over-protection and Blockade were three of his most important concepts, and soon his chess philosophy was labeled as Hypermodernism. Though many players laughed at Nimzovich's outlandish theories, no one could ignore him. How can you ignore one of the world's top five players? He was never given a chance to play for the World Championship, and his tournament achievements (he had many fine results) have been largely forgotten. He died in 1935, but his ideas live on in his classic books My System and Chess Praxis, which have served to instruct later generations in Nimzovich's own brand of chess strategy. Today, all top players make use of the ideas of Steinitz and Nimzovich. These two men can be classed as the greatest chess thinkers in the game's history. Yates-Nimzovich London, 1927
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6
This unusual version of the Sicilian Defense has been named the Nimzovich Variation (just one of many openings named after this great man). Like the Alekhine Defense (1.e4 1...Nf6 2.e5 Nd5), the Nimzovich Variation of the Sicilian Defense dares White to advance his pawns. Black's idea is that these advanced pawns will turn out to be targets.
3.e5
White, of course, wants to prove that his advanced e-pawn is a tower of strength.
3...Nd5 4.Bc4?!
Surprisingly, this natural move, developing with a gain of tempo is mistaken. Only 4.Nc3! can cause Black any worries because 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3 gives White more space and the chance to develop his pieces rapidly, whereas 4...e6 5.Nxd5 exd5 6.d4 tries to take advantage of the doubled Black d-pawns.
4...Nb6! 5.Be2 Nc6 6.c3 d5 7.d4 cxd4 8.cxd4 Bf5
Black wants to play ...e7-e6, so he must first get his Bishop outside the pawn chain to an active post.
9.O-O e6 10.Nc3 Be7 11.Ne1
To quote Nimzovich himself, "If the attack planned by this move, namely f4 with g4 and f5, should really prove possible to carry out, this would be a proof of the incorrectness of 8...Bf5, and that would be an absurdity." Nimzovich, who always felt that you should strengthen your center if possible, recommended 11.Be3 O-O 12.Rc1 followed by a3, b4, and Nd2-b3-c5 with the establishment of an outpost on c5. Yates was a fine attacking player but here his desire to start aggressive action gets the best of him, and he makes the obvious strategic error of placing his Knight on the back rank before his development is complete. The Knight's absence from f3 weakens his control of d4, and Nimzovich takes immediate advantage of this fact.
11...Nd7!
Now 12.f4 cannot be played because 12...Nxd4! 13.Qxd4?? Bc5 pins the Queen to its King. Also good for Black is 12.Be3 Ndxe5! 13.dxe5 d4 14.Bd2 dxc3 15.Bxc3 Qc7, putting pressure on the e5-pawn.
12.Bg4 Bg6 13.f4
Yates initiates a tactical operation but fails to take into account the positional consequences.
13...Nxd4!
The Knight is still taboo because of 14...Bc5, winning material.
14.Nxd5!
The point of Yates's line of play. He sees that 14...exd5 15.Qxd4 Bc5 now fails to 16.Bxd7+. Nimzovich, however, has seen much deeper into the position. Instead of being satisfied with little tactical tricks, he has come to understand that the critical d5 and f5 squares will fall into his hands. He is also well aware that control of these squares will give him control of the game.
14...Nc6 15.Nxe7 Qb6+
A nice zwischenzug that prevents the enemy dark-squared Bishop from developing on e3.
16.Kh1 Nxe7 17.Qa4?
White should have fought for central control by playing 17.Qe2.
17...h5 18.Bh3 Bf5 19.Qa3 Qb5
Black attacks the Rook on f1 and makes way for his other Knight to jump into b6.
20.Kg1 Nb6 21.Qf3 Nbd5
DIAGRAM 120. White to play The difference in positions is beginning to become clear, as you can see in Diagram 120. Black's pieces on d5 and f5 enjoy the support of a pawn, whereas the mirror-image squares on f4 and d4 are not suitable for the same kind of occupation by White's forces.
22.b3 Qb6+ 23.Rf2 Rc8
A natural and tempting move that Nimzovich criticized harshly. Since he has no intention of castling kingside, he felt that this move broke his army into two separate groups (one on the kingside and another on the queenside). With hindsight, he liked 23...O-O-O! much better because after ...Kb8 followed by ...g6, ...Rd7, and ...Rc8, he would have achieved full centralization with his whole army working in unison. Nimzovich also pointed out that the tactical 23...Bg4! might have been the best move of all because after 24.Bxg4 hxg4 25.Qxg4 Rxh2 26.Qxg7 O-O-O
27.Kxh2 Qxf2 28.Nd3 Qe2, would give Black a winning attack. Good or not, 23...O-O-O! is the
move you should pay attention to here, because the thinking of cohesive forces associated with it fits better with Nimzovich's ideals and, as a result, is much more instructive.
24.Bd2 Rh6 25.Rd1 Bxh3 26.Qxh3 Nf5
Black's Knights make a magnificent impression.
27.Qd3 Rg6 28.Nf3 Rg4
Black's pieces are split between the two sides, but they are so well placed that it doesn't really make a difference. It is almost as if they are converging on the sides in a sort of pincher effect.
29.h3 Rg3 30.a4 Nh4
The pins are starting to drive White crazy. Now 31...Nxf3+ is a winning threat
31.Kf1 Rc6 32.a5 Qd8 33.Kg1 Nf5 34.Kh2
So White has managed to push back the first wave of Black's attack. However, Black's pieces are so much better than their White counterparts that he nonetheless maintains a static advantage.
34...a6 35.Qb1 Qe7 36.Nd4?
Seeing that 36...Nxd4 loses the Exchange after 37.Kxg3, the aggressive Yates lashes out. Unfortunately, this erroneous move hastens his defeat because tactics usually work for the side with all the positional trumps. In this case, of course, the side with all the trumps is Black.
36...Qh4!
Black threatens 37...Rxh3+ 38.gxh3 Qxf2+. Yates panics and goes down quickly.
37.Be1 Nxf4 38.Rxf4
Playing 38.Nxf5 fails because 38...Rxg2+ 39.Rxg2 Qxh3+ followed by ...Qxg2 checkmate.
38...Rxh3+ 39.gxh3 Qxf4+ 40.Kg2 Ne3+
After White resigned, Nimzovich was awarded a special prize of £10 for the best played game in the tournament. No wonder chess players often starved to death! Tigran Petrosian Born in 1929 in Tbilisi, Tigran Petrosian learned the complexities of positional play from Nimzovich's books. As a result, he became the greatest master of prophylaxis the world has ever seen. In his prime, his ability to anticipate any plan his opponent came up with, plus his wonderful endgame technique, tactical alertness, and inexhaustible patience made him nearly unbeatable. Never a player to win a lot of games, Petrosian didn't come in first in many tournaments. In match play, however, his skills made him stand out. After a two-month struggle in 1963, he snatched the World Championship from Botvinnik by winning five games, losing two, and drawing fifteen. He then defended his title successfully against Spassky, this time winning four games, losing three, and drawing seventeen. He lost his second match to Spassky in 1969 and succumbed to cancer in 1984. Petrosian enjoyed slowly improving the position of his pieces. He also loved closed positions where he could quietly fight for the control of key squares. This cautious style made him one of the least popular of all World Champions, and his genius was rarely appreciated by players below master strength. A great pity, because his games are models of depth and subtlety and will reward anyone who takes the time to study them. Petrosian-Taimanov U.S.S.R. Championship, 1955
1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 c6 5.e3 Nbd7 6.Bd3 Bb4
This Semi-Slav Defense has become very popular in recent times, though 6...dxc4 7.Bxc4 b5 (a line created by Rubinstein) is the way most people handle the position nowadays.
7.O-O O-O 8.Qc2 Bd6
Black's ...Bb4-d6 turns out to be a waste of time. Petrosian doesn't immediately try to refute his opponent, though; he just sort of flows over Taimanov like an ancient but irresistible glacier.
9.b3 dxc4 10.bxc4 e5 11.Bb2 Re8 12.Ne4 Nxe4 13.Bxe4 h6?
White's greater space gives him a clear advantage, but this move quickly loses control of the light squares and leads to a complete disaster. A better line of play is 13...g6 14.Bd3 Qe7 15.c5 Bc7 16.Bc4!, which leaves White in a better position. But Black can still put up a fight.
14.Rad1 exd4 15.Bh7+!
DIAGRAM 121. Black to play This surprise forces the Black King onto the uncomfortable a1-h8 diagonal. As you can see in Diagram 121, the immediate 15.Rxd4 would have been met by 15...Nf6.
15...Kh8 16.Rxd4
Now 16...Nf6 would be answered by 17.Rfd1 Nxh7 18.Rxd6 Qe7 19.Rxh6, winning a pawn and seizing the initiative.
16...Bc5
White also comes out on top after 16...Qe7 17.Re4 Qf8 18.Rh4 Ne5 19.Ng5! f5 20.Bg6 Nxg6
21.Rxh6+ Kg8 22.Rxg6 (analysis by O'Kelly).
17.Rf4 Qe7 18.Re4! Qf8 19.Rh4
White threatens to take advantage of the pin on the a1-h8 diagonal by playing Rxh6.
19...f6
This move takes care of all the problems along the a1-h8 diagonal, but now Black has a terminal case of light-squared leukemia.
20.Bg6 Re7 21.Rh5
White makes room for the Knight to come to h4, where it can take part in the light-square orgy.
21...Bd6 22.Rd1 Be5 23.Ba3 c5
Now d5 (another light square!) becomes available to the White pieces. Petrosian's game is so crushing, though, that he doesn't need it.
24.Nh4
A humiliated Taimanov saw that he had no defense against the threat of 25.Bh7 and 26.Ng6+ and so gave up. I can personally attest to the way other Grandmasters deferred to Petrosian. During tournament analysis sessions players all speak at once, but whenever Petrosian said anything, everyone would shut up and listen. It's also interesting to note that when a young Karpov lost to Petrosian, he looked up at his great opponent and asked, "Please, can you tell me where I went wrong?" Anatoly Karpov Anatoly Karpov was born in 1951 in Zlatoust, a small town in the Ural Mountains, where he was taught chess, like Capablanca, when he was just four years of age. A slight man with large eyes, Karpov gives the impression that he has a frail mental and physical constitution. This is an illusion, however. Within that fragile frame is a mind of incredible determination and resolve. In 1975, Karpov won the World Championship from Bobby Fischer by a forfeit. Embarrassed that he had acquired the title in this fashion, he played in almost every major tournament of the time, trying desperately to prove that he deserved the champion's mantle. By winning just about every event he played in (and he participated in more tournaments than any champion before or after him), he accumulated the finest tournament record in history. He once said: "To be champion requires more than simply being a strong player; one has to be a strong human being as well." This comment speaks volumes about this great player. Karpov eventually lost the World Championship in 1985 to Garry Kasparov after holding it for 10 years. He regained it in 1993 when Kasparov was stripped of the title by the FIDE. Once again he was World Champion, and once again he had acquired it by forfeit! Though no longer in his prime, he showed that he still deserves the title by winning the super tournament at Linares in 1994. By scoring 21⁄2 points more than second-place Kasparov, Karpov once again demonstrated his incredible knowledge of the game and his amazing mental toughness. Possessing a unique positional style, Karpov always seems to have his pieces well defended and makes use of a space advantage better than anyone else in history. This great champion's philosophy is best described by Karpov himself: Let us say that a game may be continued in two ways: one of them is a beautiful tactical blow that gives rise to variations that don't yield to precise calculation; the other is clear positional pressure that leads to an endgame with microscopic chances of victory...I would choose the latter without thinking twice. If the opponent insists on sharp play I don't object; but in such cases I get less satisfaction, even if I win, than from a game conducted according to all the rules of strategy with its ruthless logic. Karpov-Spassky Leningrad, 1974 11th Match Game
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.Nc3 Be7 5.Bg5 h6 6.Bh4 O-O 7.e3 b6 8.Be2 Bb7 9.Bxf6 Bxf6
10.cxd5 exd5 11.O-O Qd6
A well-known line of the Tartakower Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined has been reached. Black will try to play ...c7-c5 and activate his dark-squared Bishop and queenside pawns. This move may lead to some pawn weaknesses, but Black is willing to take on these potential liabilities in exchange for active piece play.
12.Rac1 a6 13.a3
Karpov has prevented Black's plan because 13...c5? would turn out very badly after 14.dxc5 bxc5 15.Ne4! followed by 16.Nxc5. This and his following move demonstrate his mastery of prophylaxis.
13...Nd7 14.b4 b5
Because ...c5 has been prevented, Black changes plans and creates a strong support point on c4 for his Knight. It's true that ...b5 creates a backward pawn on c7, but once the Knight gets to c4, it will block the c-file and make any attack on c7 quite unlikely.
15.Ne1
A logical move that heads for c5. However, this move turns out to be the only mistake Karpov commits in this game. By playing 15.Nd2! followed by Nb3 and possibly Na5, he would have prevented the freeing advance ...a6-a5.
15...c6 16.Nd3 Nb6?
The move 16...a5! was correct, with equal chances. Spassky never recovers from this one slip.
17.a4 Bd8 18.Nc5 Bc8 19.a5
This is an important advance. Now White's a-pawn will not be vulnerable to the Black Knight on c4, whereas Black's a-pawn will be in need of constant defense because it is under the hungry eye of the c5-horse.
19...Bc7
Creating a tiny threat of ...Qxh2 checkmate, Spassky hopes to create light-squared weaknesses around White's King that he may one day exploit.
20.g3 Nc4 21.e4!
A fine strategical decision, the queenside is closed, so Karpov hastens to create active play in the center.
21...Bh3 22.Re1 dxe4 23.N3xe4 Qg6 24.Bh5!
White kicks Black around and refuses to be sucked into 24.Bxc4? bxc4 25.Rxc4 f5! followed by 26...f4, with a strong attack for Black.
24...Qh7 25.Qf3
The c6-pawn has suddenly turned into a target White also threatens to trap the enemy light- squared Bishop with g3-g4.
25...f5?
Black stops the threat but creates too many weaknesses in the center. Weakening, aggressive moves like this one cannot succeed when played from a state of positional inferiority.
26.Nc3
Suddenly Black is positionally bankrupt. White threatens Qxc6, and Ne6 or Re6 can also be played at any moment. Black has no choice but to win the White Bishop and hope he can survive the menacing storm.
26...g6 27.Qxc6 gxh5 28.Nd5
DIAGRAM 122. Black to play As Diagram 122 shows, Black is up a piece, but his King is open and the White army dominates the center. Black can't handle White's threats of Qxc7, Nxc7, Re7, and Re6.
28...f4
A desperate bid for counterplay.
29.Re7 Qf5 30.Rxc7
Black would like to play ...fxg3, but Ne7+ would pick up his Queen.
30...Rae8 31.Qxh6
Now Black must do something about Qg7 checkmate.
31...Rf7 32.Rxf7 Kxf7 33.Qxf4 Re2 34.Qc7+ Kf8 35.Nf4
Black gives up. Karpov makes his victories look remarkably easy. Other Great Strategists A final word of explanation, and perhaps apology, is needed. Though it is obvious that great players like Lasker, Alekhine, Tal, and Kasparov were excluded from this list because we are looking at positional, not tactical geniuses, the absence of Botvinnik and Fischer may upset a few fans. In fact, both these World Champions were nearly accorded a place in this chapter and were excluded only at the last moment. Mikhail Botvinnik was a brilliant strategic player, but I feel that science played an even greater role in his games. The depth of his preparation (encompassing mental, physical, and theoretical aspects of chess) was unparalleled, and he seems to belong in a slightly different category: He was the first great scientific player. Bobby Fischer could also have made this list of strategic geniuses, but once again, I saw him heading a category of his own: Perfect opening play brought about by intense preparation (Alekhine was the first great opening theorist and Fischer followed in his footsteps), an intense will to win (reminiscent of Emanuel Lasker), incredibly simple and lucid middlegame skills (watching him, you had to wonder whether Capablanca had been reborn), and superior endgame powers (a combination of Rubinstein and Capablanca) made Bobby a perfect player. Highlighting him as a strategic genius wouldn't give him the credit his legacy deserves. Glossary Active: A preference for aggressive or tactical types of play, in relation to an opponent's style. Otherwise, an aggressive move or position. Advantage: A net superiority of position, usually based on force, time, space, or pawn structure. Algebraic notation: Sometimes referred to as chess notation or simply notation. A way of denoting chess moves. There are probably as many ways of writing chess moves as there are languages. However, algebraic notation has become the international standard. Essentially, each square on the chessboard is given a letter and a number. The files are assigned the letters a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h, from left to right from White's perspective. The ranks are assigned the numbers l, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, from bottom to top from White's perspective. Thus, the bottom left corner is square a1 and the top right corner is square h8. When a piece travels from one square to another, algebraic notation enables you to identify the piece and the square to which it is moving. For example, if the Rook moves from square a1 to square a8, you write Ra8. For pawn moves, you write only the square to which the pawn moves; for example, e4. Castling kingside is written O-O, and castling queenside written O-O-O. Analysis: The calculation of a series of moves based on a particular position. In tournament play, you are not allowed to move the pieces during analysis but must make all calculations in your head. When the game is over, opponents commonly analyze the game they have just played, moving the pieces about in an effort to discover what the best moves would have been. Annotation: Written comments about a position or a game. The comments can take the form of narrative, chess notation, or a combination of both. Attack: To start an aggressive action in a particular area of the board, or to threaten to capture a piece or pawn. Battery: Doubling Rooks on a file or a Queen and a Bishop on a diagonal. Berserker: A playing style characterized by frenzied attacks with one or two pieces. Named after ancient Scandinavian warriors who worked themselves up into battle frenzies and then charged their opponents with little regard for strategy or personal danger. Bishop pair: Two Bishops vs. a Bishop and a Knight or two Knights. Two Bishops work well together because they can control diagonals of both colors. See also Opposite-colored Bishops. Blockade: To stop an enemy pawn by placing a piece (ideally a Knight) directly in front of it. Popularized by Aaron Nimzovich. Blunder: A terrible move that loses material or involves decisive positional or tactical concessions. Breakthrough: A penetration of the enemy position usually made by an advancing pawn. Calculation of variations: The working out of chains of moves without physically moving the pieces. Castle: Moving a King and Rook simultaneously. Castling is the only move in which a player can deploy two pieces in one move. Castling allows a player to move his King out of the center (the main theater of action in the opening) to the flank, where it can be protected by pawns. Additionally, castling develops a Rook. When White castles kingside, he moves his King from e1 to g1 and his h1-Rook to f1. When Black castles kingside, he moves his King from e8 to g8 and his h8-Rook to f8. When White castles queenside, he moves his King from e1 to c1 and his a1-Rook to d1. And when Black castles queenside, he moves his King from e8 to c8 and his a8-Rook to d8. Center: The area of the board encompassed by the rectangle c3-c6-f6-f3. Squares e4, d4, e5, and d5 are the most important part of the center. The e- and d-files are the center files. Checkmate: An attack against the enemy King from which the King cannot escape when a player checkmates his opponent's King, he wins the game. Classical: A style of play that focuses on the creation of a full pawn center. Classical principles tend to be rather dogmatic and inflexible. The philosophy of the classical players was eventually challenged by the so-called "hypermoderns". See also Hypermodern. Clearance sacrifice: A move that sacrifices an obstructing piece to make way for a strong move. Closed game: A position that is obstructed by blocking chains of pawns. Such a position tends to favor Knights over Bishops, because the pawns block the diagonals. Combination: A sacrifice combined with a forced series of moves, which exploits the peculiarities of the position in the hope of attaining a certain goal. Connected passed pawns: Two or more passed pawns of the same color on adjacent files. See also Passed pawn. Control: To completely dominate an area of the board. Dominating a file or a square, or simply having the initiative, can constitute control. Counterplay: When the player who has been on the defensive starts his own aggressive action. Cramp: The lack of mobility that is usually the result of a disadvantage in space. Critical position: An important point in the game, where victory or defeat hangs in the balance. Decoy: A tactic that lures an opponent's piece to a particular square. Defense: A move or series of moves designed to thwart an enemy attack. Also used in the names of many openings initiated by Black. Examples are the French Defense and the Caro-Kann Defense. Deflection: A tactic that involves chasing the opponent's main defending piece away from the critical area so that the defense falls apart. Development: The process of moving pieces from their starting positions to new posts, from which they control a greater number of squares and have greater mobility. Discovered attack: An ambush. A Queen, Rook, or Bishop lies in wait so that it can attack when another piece or pawn moves out of its way. Discovered check: A discovered attack that involves checking your opponents King. Double attack: An attack against two pieces or pawns at the same time. Double check: The most powerful type of discovered attack, which checks the King with two pieces. The King is forced to move, and the enemy army is thus frozen for at least one move. Doubled pawns: Two pawns of the same color lined up on a file. This doubling can come about only as the result of a capture. Draw: A tied game. A draw can result from a stalemate, from a three-time repetition of position, or by agreement between the players. See also Stale mate; Three-time repetition of position. Elo rating: The system by which players are rated and ranked. Devised by Professor Arpad Elo (1903-1993) of Milwaukee and adopted by FIDE in 1970. A beginner might have a 900 rating, the average club player 1600, a state champion 2300, and the World Champion 2800. En passant: A French term that means in passing. When a pawn advances two squares (which it can do only if it has not moved before) and passes an enemy pawn on an adjacent file that has advanced to its 5th rank, it can be captured by the enemy pawn as if it had moved only one square. The capture is optional and must be made at the first opportunity; otherwise, the right to capture that particular pawn under those particular circumstances is lost. Endgame: The third and final phase of a chess game. An endgame arises when few pieces remain on the board. The clearest signal that the endgame is about to begin is when Queens are exchanged. Equality: A situation in which neither side has an advantage or the players' advantages balance out. Exchange: The trading of pieces, usually pieces of equal value. Exchange, The: Winning the Exchange means you have won a Rook (5 points) for a Bishop or a Knight (3 points). Fianchetto: An Italian term that means on the flank and applies only to Bishops. A fianchetto (pronounced fyan-KET-to) involves placing a White Bishop on g2 or b2 or a Black Bishop on g7 or b7. FIDE: The French acronym for Fédération Internationale des Échecs, the international chess federation. File: A vertical column of eight squares. Designated in algebraic notation as the a-file, b-file, and so on. See also Half-open file; Open file. Flank: The a-, b-, and c-files on the queenside, and the f-, g-, and h-files on the kingside. Force: Material. An advantage in force arises when one player has more material than his opponent or when he outmans his opponent in a certain area of the board. Forced: A move or series of moves that must be played to avoid disaster. Fork: A tactical maneuver in which a piece or pawn attacks two enemy pieces or pawns at the same time. Gambit: The voluntary sacrifice of at least a pawn in the opening, with the idea of gaining a compensating advantage (usually time, which permits development). General principles: The fundamental rules of chess, devised to enable less advanced players to react logically to different positions. Also used more often than you would think by Grandmasters! Grande combination: A combination that involves many moves and features many types of tactics. Grandmaster: A title awarded by FIDE to players who meet an established set of performance standards, including a high Elo rating. It is the highest title (other than World Champion) attainable in chess. Lesser titles include International Master and FIDE Master, which is the lowest title awarded for international play. Once earned, FIDE titles are for life. See also Elo rating; Master. Half-open file: A file that contains none of one player's pawns but one or more of his opponent's. Hang: To be unprotected and exposed to capture. Hole: A square that cannot be defended by a pawn. Such a square makes an excellent home for a piece because the piece cannot be chased away by hostile pawns. Also known as an outpost. Hypermodern: A school of thought that arose in reaction to the classical theories of chess. The hypermoderns insisted that putting a pawn in the center in the opening made it a target. The heroes of this movement were Richard Réti and Aaron Nimzovich, both of whom expounded the idea of controlling the center from the flanks. Like the ideas of the classicists, those of the hypermoderns can be carried to extremes. Nowadays, both views are seen as correct. A distillation of the two philosophies is needed to cope successfully with any particular situation. See also Classical. Initiative: When you are able to make threats to which your opponent must react, you are said to possess the initiative. Interpose: To place a piece or a pawn between an enemy attacking piece and the attacked piece. Intuition: Finding the right move or strategy by "feel" rather than by calculation. Kingside: The half of the board made up of the e, f, g, and h files. Kingside pieces are the King, the Bishop next to it, the Knight next to the Bishop, and the Rook next to the Knight. See also Queenside. Luft: A German term that means air. In chess, it means to give the King breathing room. It describes a pawn move made in front of the King of the same color to avoid Back Rank Mate possibilities. Major pieces: Queens and Rooks. Also called heavy pieces. Master: In the U.S., a player with a rating of 2200 or more. If a player's rating drops below 2200, the title is rescinded. See also Grandmaster. Mate: Short for checkmate. Material: All the pieces and pawns. A material advantage is when a player has more pieces on the board than his opponent or has pieces of greater value. See also Point count. Middlegame: The phase between the opening and the endgame. Minor pieces: The Bishops and Knights. Mobility: Freedom of movement for the pieces. Occupation: A Rook or Queen that controls a file or rank is said to occupy that file or rank. A piece is said to occupy the square it is sitting on. Open: Short for open game or open file. Also refers to a type of tournament in which any strength of player can participate. Though a player often ends up with opponents who are stronger or weaker than himself, the prizes are usually structured around different rating groups, with prizes for the top scorers in each group. Such open tournaments are extremely popular in the United States. See also Open file; Open game. Open file: A vertical column of eight squares that is free of pawns. Rooks reach their maximum potential when placed on open files or open ranks. Open game: A position characterized by many open ranks, files, or diagonals, and few center pawns. A lead in development becomes very important in positions of this type. Opening: The start of a game, incorporating the first dozen or so moves. The basic goals of an opening are to develop pieces as quickly as possible; control as much of the center as possible; and castle early and get the King to safety, while at the same time bringing the Rooks toward the center and placing them on potentially open files. Openings: Established sequences of moves that lead to the goals outlined under Opening. These sequences of moves are often named after the player who invented them or after the place where they were first played. Some openings, such as the King's Gambit, Ruy Lopez and the English, have been analyzed to great lengths in chess literature. Opposite-colored Bishops: Also Bishops of opposite color. When players have one Bishop each and the Bishops are on different-colored squares. Opposite-colored Bishops can never come into direct contact. Overextension. When space is gained too fast. By rushing his pawns forward and trying to control a lot of territory, a player can leave weaknesses in his camp or can weaken the advanced pawns themselves. He is then said to have overextended his position. Overworked piece: A piece that is required to singlehandedly defend too many other pieces. Passed pawn: A pawn whose advance to the 8th rank cannot be prevented by any enemy pawn and whose promotion to a piece is therefore a serious threat. See also Promotion; Underpromotion. Pawn structure: Also referred to as the pawn skeleton. All aspects of the pawn setup. Perpetual check: When one player places his opponent in check, forcing a reply, followed by another check and another forced reply, followed by another check that repeats the first position. Because such a game could be played forever, after the position repeats itself, the game is declared a draw. See also Three-time repetition of position. Perpetual pursuit: Similar to a perpetual check, except that the pursued piece is a Bishop, Knight Rook, or Queen, instead of the King. Petite combination: A combination that involves only a few moves. Pig: Slang for Rook. Rooks doubled on the 7th rank are commonly referred to as pigs on the 7th. Pin: When one player attacks a piece that his opponent cannot move without losing a different piece of greater value. When the piece of greater value is the King, this tactic is called an absolute pin; when the piece is not the King, the tactic is called a relative pin. Plan: A short- or long-range goal on which a player bases his moves and overall strategy. Point count: A system that gives the pieces the following numeric values: King - priceless; Queen - 9 points; Rook - 5 points; Bishop - 3 points; Knight - 3 points; and pawn - 1 point. Some manuals give a King's point count as 31/2. Positional: A move or style of play based on long-range considerations. The slow buildup of small advantages is said to be positional. Prepared variation: In professional chess, it is common practice to analyze book openings in the hope of finding a new move or plan. When a player makes such a discovery, he will often save this prepared variation for use against a special opponent. When a professional introduces a new move it is often referred to as a theoretical novelty. Promotion: Also called queening. When a pawn reaches the 8th rank, it can be promoted to a Bishop, Knight, Rook, or (most commonly) Queen of the same color. See also Underpromotion. Protected passed pawn: A passed pawn that is under the protection of another pawn. See also Passed pawn. Queenside: The half of the board that includes the d-, c-, b-, and a-files. The queenside pieces are the Queen, the Bishop next to it, the Knight next to the Bishop, and the Rook next to the Knight. See also Kingside. Quiet move: An unassuming move that is not a capture, a check, or a direct threat. A quiet move often occurs at the end of a maneuver or combination that drives the point home. Rank: A horizontal row of eight squares. Designated in algebraic notation as the 1 (1st) rank, the 2 (2nd) rank, and so on. Rating: A number that measures a player's relative strength. The higher the number, the stronger the player. See also Elo rating. Resign: When a player realizes that he is going to lose and graciously gives up the game without waiting for a checkmate. When resigning, a player can simply say, "I resign", or he can tip over his King in a gesture of helplessness. When you first start playing chess, I recommend that you never resign. Always play until the end. Romantic: The Romantic (or Macho) era of chess from the early- to mid-1800s, when sacrifice and attack were considered the only manly ways to play. If a sacrifice was offered, it was considered a disgraceful show of cowardice to refuse the capture. Today, a player who has a proclivity for bold attacks and sacrifices, often throwing caution to the wind, is called a romantic. Royal fork: A fork that attacks the King and Queen. Sacrifice: The voluntary offer of material for compensation in space, time, pawn structure, or even force. (A sacrifice can lead to a force advantage in a particular part of the board.) Unlike a combination, a sacrifice is not always a calculable commodity and often entails an element of uncertainty. Simplify: To trade pieces to quiet down the position, to eliminate the opponent's attacking potential, or to clarify the situation. Skewer: A threat against a valuable piece that forces that piece to move, allowing the capture of a less valuable piece behind it. Smothered checkmate: When a King is completely surrounded by its own pieces (or is at the edge of the board) and receives an unanswerable check from the enemy, he is said to be a victim of smothered checkmate. A smothered checkmate is most often carried out by a Knight. Space: The territory controlled by each player. Space count: A numerical system used to determine who controls more space, in which 1 point is allocated to each square on one player's side of the board that is controlled by a piece or pawn belonging to the other player. Speculative move: Made without calculating the consequences to the extent normally required. Sometimes full calculation is not possible, so a player must rely on intuition, from which a speculative plan might arise. Often used in reference to a sacrifice. For example, White plays a speculative sacrifice. Stalemate: In the English language, a stalemate refers to a standoff between opposing forces. In chess terminology, a stalemate occurs when one player is so bottled up that any legal move he makes will expose his King to immediate capture. A stalemate results in a draw (a tied game). Strategy: The reasoning behind a move, plan, or idea. Study: Theoretical positions, or compositions, that highlight unusual tactical themes. Style: A player's way of playing chess, which reflects his personality and preferences. The types of move a player chooses are usually indicative of the player as a person. Typically, in a game between players of opposing styles (for example, an attacker vs. a quiet positional player), the winner will be the one who successfully imposes his style on the other. Tactics: Maneuvers that take advantage of short-term opportunities. A position with many traps and combinations is considered to be tactical in nature. Tempo: One move, as a unit of time; the plural is tempi. If a piece can reach a useful square in one move but takes two moves to get there, it has lost a tempo. For example, after 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.Qxd4 Nc6, Black gains a tempo and White loses one because the White Queen is attacked and White must move his Queen a second time to get it to safety. Theory: Well-known opening, middlegame, and endgame positions that are documented in books. Three-time repetition of position: Occurs when the players have been moving back and forth, repeating the same position. Often happens when a player, behind in material and facing eventual loss, sacrifices for a perpetual check (see Perpetual check). A three-time repetition of position results in a draw (a tied game). Time: In this book, in addition to the common use of the word ("Black does not have time to stop all of White's threats"), time is a measure of development. Also refers to thinking time, as measured on a chess clock. See also Time control; Tempo. Time control: The amount of time in which each player must play a specified number of moves. In international competitions, the typical time control is 40 moves in 2 hours for each player. After each player has made 40 moves, each is given an additional amount of time (usually 1 hour for 20 moves). If a player uses up his time, but has not yet made the mandatory number of moves, he loses the game by forfeit no matter what the position on the board. Time pressure: One of the most exciting moments in a tournament chess game. When one or both players have used up most of the time on their clocks but still have several moves to make before they reach the mandatory total of 40 or 60, they start to make moves with increasing rapidity, sometimes slamming down the pieces in frenzied panic. Terrible blunders are typical in this phase. Some players get into time pressure in almost every game and are known as time- pressure addicts. Transposition: Reaching an identical opening position by a different order of moves. For example, the French Defense is usually reached by 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5, but 1.d4 e6 2.e4 d5 transposes into the same position. Trap: A way of surreptitiously luring the opponent into making a mistake. Underpromotion: Promotion of a pawn to any piece other than a Queen. Variation: One line of analysis in any phase of the game. It could be a line of play other than the ones used in the game. The term variation is frequently applied to one line of an opening; for example, the Wilkes-Barre Variation (named after the city in Pennsylvania) of the Two Knights' Defense. Variations can become as well analyzed as their parent openings. Entire books have been written on some well-known variations. Weakness: Any pawn or square that is readily attackable and therefore hard to defend. Zugzwang: A German term that means compulsion to move. It refers to a situation in which a player would prefer to do nothing because any move leads to a deterioration of his position, but he moves something because it is illegal to pass. Zwischenzug: A German term that means in-between move. A surprising move that, when inserted in an apparently logical sequence (for example, a check that interrupts a series of exchanges), changes the result of that sequence.

The New Art of Defense in Chess Andrew Soltis 2 Contents Introduction Chapter One What is Defense? Chapter Two The Spirit of Defense Chapter Three New Defense Chapter Four Weapons of Defense Chapter Five Counterplay Chapter Six Risk Management Chapter Seven Sacrifice Chapter Eight Prophylaxis Chapter Nine You Against Tal Chapter Ten Last Chance to Defend Solutions 3 Introduction This book came about because of something I didn't expect to find in my bookcase. It was one of my earliest efforts, The Art of Defense in Chess. I had fond memories of it so I opened it up and leafed through the pages. It was not what I remembered. The book was drastically out of date. This has to be completely rewritten, I thought. Out of date? A book about defense? Yes, because much of what I wrote - about the virtues of solid but passive restraint, for instance - makes little sense nowadays. It would fail against today's attacking players. They think differently from those of 30-plus years ago. In 1974, the year I wrote The Art of Defense in Chess, this would have been considered a favorable position for White, a plus-over-equals advantage, at least: White has a substantial advantage in space. Black has failed to execute any of the freeing moves, such as ... b5 or ... d5, that he needs to survive in this Maroczy Bind pawn structure. White will eventually find a winning plan, such as with ♖e3, ♘g5, ♖h3 and a breakthrough around h7. And White's attack would likely have succeeded if Black played in the manner that served so well for much of the 20th century, with cautious moves such as ... ♘f8 to protect h7 and to avert 2 e5? because of 2 ... ♗xf3 3 gxf3 dxe5 and ... ♕xd3. But today most masters would prefer to play Black, particularly after 1 ... ♕a8!. 4 Why? Because we realize now that White's space advantage, in this and similar positions, is vastly overrated. And we see Black has a powerful plan of 2 ... ♖fc8 and 3 ... ♖xc4! 4 ♗xc4 ♖xc4. That trumps anything White is doing on the kingside. But you can't sacrifice in even positions, can you? That's what 1974 would say if it could speak. Yes, you can, we say today. Black would have one pawn for the Exchange and powerful pressure on the e4-pawn as compensation after 4 ... ♖xc4. In fact, White retreated 2 ♕h3 (!) to anticipate threats along the a8-g2 diagonal. He was no longer acting as an attacker. He was beginning to think like a defender. Black continued to think like a counter-aggressor, with 2 ... ♖ec8. In the next diagram, 3 ♘g5 would try to take Black's attention away from ... ♖xc4. It would offer good practical chances after 3 ... h6 4 ♘xf7! ♔xf7 5 e5, for example. What should Black do after 3 ♘g5? Here's where the solid 3 ... ♘f8! makes sense and would put the pressure back on White. In the game, White chose 3 e5 instead of 3 ♘g5. But 3 ... dxe5 4 fxe5 ♘h5 would 5 threaten ... ♗xf3/... ♘xe5. If White defends with 5 ♗e2 it would be time for 5 ... ♖xc4! 6 ♗xc4 ♖xc4. Black would have the upper hand in view of 7 ... ♗xf3 and 7 ... ♘f4. Instead, play went 3 e5 dxe5 4 ♘xe5 and then 4 ... ♘xe5 5 fxe5 ♘d7. There was only one way to protect the e5-pawn, 6 ♗f4. Black finally pulled the trigger, 6 ... ♖xc4! 7 ♗xc4 ♖xc4. If he wins the e5-pawn he will have more than enough 'comp' for the Exchange and excellent winning chances. White's 8 ♕g3 was natural (but 8 ♘e2 was better). And 8 ... h5! was a surprise. Instead of trying to cash in, 8 ... ♗xg2+ 9 ♕xg2 ♕xg2+ 10 ♔xg2 ♖xf4, Black was content to build pressure with the threat of 9 ... h4! and, if allowed, 10 ... h3!. Unfortunately for White, this illustrates a fact of defensive life: It is easier to safeguard a compact position than one with pieces and pawns spread over a large area, as White's forces are. His 9 ♘e2? was a final error, punished by 9 ... ♘xe5! (based on 10 ♗xe5 ♖g4). The rest of the game was interesting chiefly because of the finish: 10 ♖xc4 ♘xc4 11 h4 ♕d8 12 ♗g5 ♕d7 13 ♘f4 e5! 14 ♘d3 ♕d5 15 ♘f2 ♘d6 16 ♖d1. 6 And 16 ... ♘e4! prompted resignation. This is the way chess is played today. Anyone who plays over attacking games of the 21st century will be struck by how they differ from 20th century games. You can argue that the biggest change since the 1970s is that our play has been refined by computer analysis. But it was transformed earlier by the revolution in middlegame thinking led by Mikhail Tal. Strangely enough, it was the greatest attacker of modern times who inspired new methods of defense. Why? Because Tal changed the way sacrifices and the initiative were evaluated: He won many games because his opponents had never before been confronted by a highly speculative sacrifice. Or by an attack launched by Black right out of the opening. Or by complications that defy exact analysis. Tal presented a way to attack that confounded traditional defensive thinking. But according to the iron law of strategy, the defense always catches up with the offense. This book is about how a different approach evolved to meet the demands of changing times. This is New Defense. 7 Chapter One: What is Defense? When the first edition of this book appeared, readers told me how struck they were by the very first example. It wasn't a famous game. Far from it. But there was something about the way it unfolded: Klyavin - Zhdanov, Latvian Championship 1961
1 e4 c6 2 ♘c3 d5 3 ♘f3 g6 4 d4 ♗g7 5 h3 a6 6 ♗f4 ♘f6? 7 e5 ♘g8 8 ♕d2 b5 9 ♗e2
h6 10 O-O-O e6 It didn't take readers long to conclude that White has a very strong position. He has brought out nearly all of his pieces while Black's only developed piece, his KB, 'bites on granite' at e5. Black's queenside is riddled with holes on dark squares and he has just locked in his other bishop. You might expect a quick mating attack. You would be right:
11 g4 ♘d7 12 ♗g3 ♗f8! 13 ♖df1 ♘b6 14 ♘d1 a5 15 ♘e1 b4 16 ♘d3 ♘c4 17 ♕e1
♕b6 18 b3 ♕xd4! 19 bxc4 ♕a1+ 20 ♔d2 dxc4 21 ♘f4 ♕xa2 22 ♔e3!? ♗b7 23 ♕d2 g5 24 ♘h5 c3 25 ♕d3 ♖d8 26 ♕e4 ♗c5+ 27 ♔f3 ♖d4 28 ♕e3 ♕d5+ and mates Yes, Black delivered the mate. Actually, with a good understanding of defensive play the game's result should not be at all surprising to you. But that understanding is the most difficult chess knowledge to acquire. And it is worth acquiring. It should be no surprise that great players are great defenders. When Garry Kasparov was asked during his great rivalry with Anatoly Karpov why they dominated chess he replied, "We attack better than anyone else - and we defend better than anyone else." 8 Before we get into specific techniques and approaches to defense, let's dispose of some myths. What is defense, really? Defense is dull. How defense got a reputation as plodding and boring is a mystery. Good defense is intensely tactical. It is perhaps 90 percent tactics - and in some positions, more. The defender must rely more on tactics than his opponent does. Schneider - Benjamin, U.S. Chess League 2013
1 e4 e5 2 ♘f3 d6 3 d4 exd4 4 ♕xd4 a6 5 ♗g5 ♘c6 6 ♕d2 ♗e7 7 h4 ♘f6 8 ♘c3 h6 9
♗f4 b5 10 O-O-O!? b4! 11 ♘d5 ♘xe4 12 ♕e3 ♘c5 Aron Nimzovich, a great defender, warned against pawn grabbing in the opening. But he made an exception for swiping a center pawn. Here Black spent two tempi to win the e4-pawn. He is ready to beat back a White initiative with simple moves such as ... ♗e6, ... ♘e6 or ... ♗g4. White felt he had to strike now with 13 ♘xc7+ ♕xc7. However, the natural 14 ♗xd6 fails to 14 ... ♕a7!, when everything is protected and he will be able to consolidate with 15 ... ♘e6. Instead, White chose 14 ♖xd6!, which threatened 15 ♕xc5 and 15 ♖xh6! (15 ... ♖xh6 16 ♗xc7). Traditional defensive thinking stressed the importance of parrying immediate threats. Well, of course, that is important. But if parrying threats were all that mattered, Black would look no further than 14 ... ♕b6. And he would have had his work cut out for him after 15 ♗c4 followed by ♘d4 and ♖e1. Instead, Black began a counter-attack, seeking mate no less, with 14 ... b3!!. He can answer 15 ♖xh6 with 15 ... ♖xh6 16 ♗xc7 bxa2! and replace the lost queen with a new one (17 ♕a3 ♘d3+!). Traditional defensive thinking would say White's chief responsibility is to find a way to stop ... bxa2. But on 15 axb3 Black would continue to counterattack with 15 ... ♘b4! and 16 ... ♕a5. In fact, 15 a3 would also be met by 15 ... ♘b4! because 16 axb4 ♘e6! would threaten mate on c2 as well as 17 ... ♗xd6 and 17 ... ♘xf4. Instead, White found a move that both attacks and defends, 15 ♗c4, and there followed 15 ... bxa2 16 ♗xa2 ♘b4. Black threatens 17 ... ♘xa2+, of course. But the more dangerous idea is 17 ... ♘cd3+! and mate around c2. The surprises kept coming. White found 17 ♗xf7+!, based on 17 ... ♔xf7 18 ♖f6+ and ♗xc7. Black replied 17 ... ♔f8 and on 18 ♗g6 he was finally able to take the rook, 18 ... ♘cd3+! 19 ♗xd3 ♗xd6 20 ♗xd6+ ♕xd6. With only two pawns for a rook, the game must be over, right? Well, that was a common attitude many years ago. Now we know it's usually a dangerous way for a defender to think. White found new ways to exploit Black's king position, 21 ♗e4 ♖b8 22 ♘d4 ♔f7 23 ♖e1 and then 23 ... ♖d8 24 ♕b3+ ♔f8 25 ♖e3, preparing ♖f3+. Black blocked, 25 ... ♘d5! 26 ♖f3+ ♘f6, and walked through the final flurry of checks, 27 ♖xf6+ gxf6 28 ♕e3 ♕xd4! 29 ♕xh6+ ♔e7 30 ♕g7+ ♔d6 31 ♕g3+ ♕e5 32 ♕d3+ ♔e7 33 ♕a3+ ♕d6 White resigns. So, defense is not at all dull. But there are other myths to debunk: Defense is one-dimensional. The charge that defensive play is mechanical, unimaginative and with little room for variety is also unfounded. This is a position from a popular Sicilian Defense variation, the Keres Attack, that begins 1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 e6 6 g4. White's intent is no secret: he seeks a pawn storm with g4-g5, followed perhaps by h2-h4-h5 and g5-g6 to open lines around Black's king. Black's biggest problem is that he has too many ways to try to defend: He can try to strike in the center with 6 ... d5 or 6 ... e5. This is a traditional policy. But there are tactical problems after 6 ... d5 7 exd5, e.g. 7 ... exd5 8 g5 ♘e4 9 ♕e2 or 7 ... ♘xd5 8 ♗b5+! ♗d7 9 ♘xd5 exd5 10 ♕e2+! ♕e7 11 ♗e3 and Black's disorganized pieces face a dangerous initiative. Another natural policy is to trade pieces. But again that's faulty here, e.g. 6 ... ♘c6 7 g5 ♘xd4? 8 ♕xd4 ♘d7 9 ♗e3 leaves White with dominating control of the center. More promising are the strategies that take the sting out of g4-g5 with 6 ... h6 or counterattack with 6 ... a6 and ... b5-b4. But 6 ... h6 ensures that kingside lines will be opened after g4-g5/... hxg5 and a recapture on g5. And 6 ... a6 is slow. Black can even anticipate White's advance with 6 ... ♘fd7 and ... ♘b6 - but that's even slower. Let's see how this kind of choice works in a middlegame position. Once again White is shooting for a quick g4-g5. Classical thinking said an attack like this should be answered by a strike in the center, 1 ... d5. But here there is little compensation after 2 exd5 e4 and simply 3 ♗g2. A second approach is to anticipate White, with what we call prophylaxis. Black can retreat immediately with 1 ... ♘e8. His aim is to play 2 ... ♗g5!, seize control of key kingside squares and offer a piece trade. But White can play 2 ♕d2!. That stops ... ♗g5 and prepares a protected push of his g-pawn. A more successful version of that idea is 1 ... h6 followed by ... ♘h7 and perhaps ... ♘g5. That is stodgy but solid. Black chose the most ambitious alternative, 1 ... h5!. This is characteristic of New Defense thinking: Confront, confound, confuse. If White tries to maintain his pawn at g4, with 2 h3 hxg4 3 hxg4, Black could employ a better version of the 3 ... ♘h7! idea. And on 2 gxh5 Black has a superior version of the center strike idea, 2 ... d5!. Then on 3 exd5 ♗xf5 the attack is blunted and Black will regain his pawn by taking on c2 (or on d5 after 4 ... e4). But the real key to Black's play was revealed when he met White's reply, 2 g5, with 2 ... ♘g4! 3 ♗xg4 ♗xg5!. This works because the tactics, 4 ♗xg5 ♕xg5 and ... ♕xg4+, would favor him. White found the superior 4 ♖e1 hxg4 5 ♔h1. He prepares to use the halfopen g- file. But more important, he safeguards his king from tactics on the g1-a7 diagonal. (Compare this with 5 ♕xg4 ♗xe3+ 6 ♖xe3 ♕b6! 7 ♖ae1 ♖xc3! 8 bxc3 ♘xc2.) With 1 ... h5 Black overturned traditional defensive thinking, which said that you should not voluntarily advance the pawns in front of your castled king. He further violated it with 5 ... g6!. This makes sense because 6 fxg6 fxg6 would give him greater kingside control than White. White accepted the challenge with 6 ♕xg4! and then 6 ... ♗xe3 7 ♖xe3 ♘xc2 8 ♖g3!. When an attacker's pieces outnumber the defender's in a target area - like the kingside here - favorable tactics are likely, if not inevitable. For example 8 ... ♘xa1? 9 ♕h5 threatens a quick mate after fxg6 or ♕h6. Key lines are 9 ... ♗e8 10 ♕h6! followed by ♖h3 and 9 ... ♕f6 10 ♘d5 ♕h8 11 ♘e7+ ♔g7 12 ♖xg6+!. But the philosophy of New Defense says White is not the only player entitled to sacrifice. Black battled back with 8 ... ♖xc3! and then 9 bxc3 ♘xa1. The attack would be over and Black would have all the winning chances after 10 ♘xa1 ♕f6. White had one last bullet to fire, 10 ♕h5!. But Black replied 10 ... ♗e8! so he could meet 11 ♕h6 and 12 ♖h3 with 11 ... ♕f6 and ... ♕g7. The sparkling game ended in perpetual check after 11 fxg6 fxg6 12 ♖xg6+! ♗xg6 13 ♕xg6+. Good defense can mean finding a single, good tactical shot. But more often it requires ten or more moves of hard work. When your opponent has several positional advantages he may be able to press you and press you. Finding one great defensive move won't be enough to save you. White has a dominating bishop and what appears to be decisive pressure against the queenside pawns (1 ... ♖b6 2 a5 or 1 ... ♘d8? 2 e6+! ♕g7 3 ♗e5). But Black had sought this position because of 1 ... a5!. Then 2 ♕xc6 ♕xc6 3 ♖xc6 axb4 and 4 ♗xb4 ♖xb4 5 ♖xe6 ♖axa4 would liquidate into a very drawish endgame. But 1 ... a5 just met the first crisis. White created a new one with 2 bxa5! and then 2 ... c5! 3 ♕f3!- not 3 ♗xc5? ♖c7 4 ♕b4 ♖ab7 or 4 ♕e3 d4. After 3 ... d4 he could not hold his extra pawn. But he got good heavy piece play by means of 4 ♖b3! ♖xb3 5 ♕xb3 ♖xa5 6 ♖b1. This is what a good aggressive player does when his initiative is waning: He converts his positional or material advantage into something equally good. Now instead of pressure against mere pawns White is aiming higher, with ♕d5 or ♕b8+ (6 ... ♖xa4? 7 ♕b8+ ♔g7 8 ♖b7 or 7 ... ♘d8 8 e6). Black needed to pass more tests and did it with 6 ... ♔g7 7 ♕d5 ♔h6!. With his king secure he can fight back against 8 ♖b7 with 8 ... ♕xa4 and ... ♕d1+. White secured his own king's safety with 8 ♔g2 and then 8 ... ♕f7 9 ♔f2 (to stop ... ♘xf4+). Black appeared to be close to running out of moves after 9 ... ♕d7 10 ♖b2! in view of 10 ... ♖a7 11 a5 and 12 a6. But Black wasn't done. He found 10 ... ♖xa4! 11 ♖b7 ♖a2+!. This works because 12 ♕xa2 ♕xb7 13 ♕xe6 ♕b2+ leads to the same kind of perpetual check we saw earlier (14 ♔g1 ♕c1+ 15 ♔g2 ♕d2+ 16 ♔h3 ♕e2!). And 12 ♔e1, for example, risks losing after 12 ... ♕a4!. The hard work demanded of defenders leads to another myth: Defense is unrewarding. Amateurs often complain that even if they manage to meet all of their opponent's threats the best that they can hope for is a draw. Of course, that's better than losing. But it seems to many players that the defender puts in a lot of work at the board for a minimum return. Actually, defense often pays off handsomely because it is harder to defend. The attacker may have an easy time picking from among the forcing moves at his disposal. The more alert defender can upset the lazy attacker by finding the flaw in his attack. In addition, when a player organizes his pieces for attack they are usually ill- prepared for defense: Attacks often fail. Counterattacks rarely do. Black's king has to deal with dangers such as ♕h5/♖h3 followed by ♕h6+! and mate. White played the natural - but lazy - 1 ♕h5?. (Better was 1 ♖g3 first, with unclear chances.) Black replied 1 ... ♗xg2!. This is justified by 2 ♔xg2? ♘f4+ and ... ♘xh5. It is based on something that defense-hating amateurs need to constantly remember: The defender has just as much right to use tactics as the attacker. Shaken by 1 ... ♗xg2!, White replied with 2 f3, to trap the bishop and create a king escape square at f2. Black could have tried to extricate the bishop, say with 2 ... ♕f4. But he took command of the kingside instead with 2 ... ♘f4! and then 3 ♕xh7+ ♔f8. Tactics have turned him into the attacker. He threatens to win with discovered checks on the g-file. He could punish 4 ♕h6+ ♔e7 5 ��f2 with 5 ... ♖h8! and the queen is trapped. The game ended quickly: 4 ♔f2 ♘h3+ 5 ♔e1 ♕f4 6 ♖ad3 ♗f1! 7 ♖e4 ♗xd3! White resigned (or 7 ♔xf1 ♖g1+ 8 ♔e2 ♕xh2 mate). And let's dispose of one final myth: You only learn defense through experience. You hear this all the time: "You can't teach yourself how to defend. It comes from playing hundreds of games." Or, rather, "It comes from losing hundreds of games." Now, it's true that some of the attributes of good defenders, such as patience and coolness under fire, are hallmarks of veteran players. They have learned to take their time and how to deal with crises. But some of history's greatest defenders - Anatoly Karpov and Sammy Reshevsky, for example - developed those skills when they were very young. And there was also a certain 11-year-old who showed us how to defend: With considerable ingenuity White had created a powerful passed pawn at c6. In an endgame that would likely be a decisive factor. But the d5-pawn that protects the c6-pawn is threatened by ... ♕xd5. And 1 ♘a3 would be met by 1 ... ♘f6 2 ♗c4 ♗e4. Magnus Carlsen played 1 ♕f3. He knew that 1 ... g5 looked dangerous because 2 ... g4 would knock his queen away and either win the d-pawn or continue his kingside initiative. His reply, 2 g4!, was strong because White would get control of the light squares following 2 ... ♗g6 3 ♗d3! or 2 ... fxg3 3 hxg3 and ♘e3. For better or worse, 2 ... e4 was the natural reply ... ... and so was 3 ♖xe4! and 3 ... ♗xe4 4 ♕xe4+. At fairly cheap expense (a pawn for the Exchange) White secured his kingside and his pawn chain. Play continued 4 ... ♔g8 5 ♗d3. Black was not done. He was able to stabilize the queenside, 5 ... b5 6 ♘a3 a6 7 ♕f3 ♘c7, and then put his rooks to work on the open file, 8 ♗e4 ♖e8 9 ♕d3 ♖e5 10 ♗c3 ♖e7. White is one piece - a well-placed knight - away from proving he has a big edge. He would like to play 11 ♘c2 and then ♘d4-f5. But 11 ... ♗xc3 12 ♕xc3 ♖xe4 costs a piece. So he settled for 11 ♘b1, with ideas such as ♘d2-b3-d4 and f2-f3. Black appreciated how desperate his situation was and went for the highrisk 11 ... f3. The pawn will be lost there but he wanted to stop the stabilizing f2-f3 and create the option of ... ♕f4 and an undermining ... h5. He gets some e-file play after, say, 12 ♕xf3 ♖ae8. White responded 12 ♖e1! ♗xc3 13 ♘xc3 ♕f4 14 h3. This was the time for 14 ... h5 (15 gxh5 g4 and 16 ♔h1 or 16 ♕e3 is still difficult). But Black's 14 ... ♖f8? was too slow and White took command with 15 ♖e3! h5 16 ♖xf3 ♕c1+ 17 ♔g2. He would have been winning in the long run after 17 ... hxg4 18 hxg4. But Carlsen used tactics to win faster with 17 ... hxg4 18 ♗h7+! ♖xh7 19 ♖xf8+ ♔xf8 20 ♕xh7 ♕xc3 21 ♕f5+. He had foreseen that he can win the knight and the d-pawn with checks: 21 ... ♔e7 22 ♕d7+ ♔f8 23 ♕xd6+ ♔e8 24 ♕d7+ ♔f8 25 ♕f5+!. Now 25 ... ♔e8 26 ♕c8+! and 27 ♕xc7+/hxg4 is an easy win. Black chose 25 ... ♔e7. Here 26 ♕xg5+ is tempting but there's a lot of game left after 26 ... ♔f7. White found the more accurate 26 d6+! and Black resigned (26 ... ♔xd6 27 ♕d7+ forces 27 ... ♔e5, when 28 ♕g7+! skewers the king and queen). Yes, that's an awful lot of calculating. But, as noted earlier, White could also have won with simple moves such as 18 hxg4. You don't have to be a great calculator to be a good defender. You need the right tools, beginning with the proper spirit and attitudes. Let's see what those are. Chapter Two: The Spirit of Defense Good defense is most of all the product of proper spirit. Some players are discouraged if not defeated the minute their opponent seizes the initiative. Others excel at defense because they accept the role as a challenge - and because they know how often good defense wins. Before we look at specific defensive devices, it's important to take stock of the priorities, principles and mental attitudes of good defenders. Let's begin with something all good defenders understand: A weakness is not a weakness if it can't be exploited. That is something the strange Latvian game in the first chapter can teach us. Who really stands better? We say White must have the superior chances because of his edge in development. But the value of development depends on how open the position is. That's another way of saying how easy it is to reach a target. In Paul Morphy's day, having two more pieces developed than your opponent could be a decisive advantage. That was because games typically began with 1 e4 e5 and often led to pawn trades that opened attacking files and diagonals and made quick mates possible. (And in Morphy's day, defense was dreadful.) Here Black's position is riddled with apparent weaknesses, like the holes at d6, f6 and a5. But White has no easy way to get a minor piece, ideally a knight, to them. White lacks an accessible target. On the other hand, Black does have a target: the White king. Even though White made no weakening pawn moves, by castling queenside his king became vulnerable to ... ♘d7-b6-c4. Understanding what is a vulnerable weakness and what is just an apparent one is extraordinarily difficult: Topalov - Ivanchuk, Linares 2008
1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 a6 6 ♗e3 e5 7 ♘b3 ♗e6 8 f3 ♘bd7
9 g4 b5 10 g5 b4 11 ♘d5 ♘xd5 12 exd5 ♗f5 13 ♗d3 ♗xd3 14 ♕xd3 ♗e7 15 h4
This seems like a simple case of opposite wing attacks: White will castle queenside and try to open the kingside with h4-h5 and g5-g6. Black will castle kingside and work the queenside with ... a5-a4. What could be clearer? With that in mind, Black sought a head start with 15 ... a5. White shot back 16 a3! and the question of weaknesses has been turned around. White saw queenside targets that he can exploit after 16 ... bxa3 17 ♖xa3. The Black a-pawn would likely be doomed after ♕b5 and O-O/♖ha1. No better is 16 ... O-O in view of 17 axb4 axb4 18 ♖xa8 ♕xa8 19 ♔e2! followed by ♖a1 and ♘a5-c6. White's king only looks vulnerable on e2. Black continued his plan of queenside pressure, 16 ... a4 17 ♘d2 ♖b8 and play went 18 axb4 ♖xb4. White would have had a clear edge after 19 ♕c3! ♕a5 20 b3 and then 20 ... O-O 21 ♘c4 ♕b5 22 ♗d2!. The same goes for 19 ... ♕b8 20 ♕c6 ♖xb2 21 ♔e2!, when White threatens ♖xa4 and ♖a8. What went wrong for Black? He gave his opponent a target prematurely. The right way was 15 ... O-O! in the first diagram. Then on 16 O-O-O he can play 16 ... a5! and his attack would have a target to hit, the White king, which would be more vulnerable on c1 than e2. If White continues 16 a3 bxa3 17 ♖xa3, as in the game, Black hasn't weakened b5 yet. He could drum up counterplay with 17 ... ♕c7 18 O-O ♖fc8 19 c3 ♘b6 or 18 ♖xa6 ♖xa6 19 ♕xa6 ♕xc2. "A weakness is not a weakness . . ." is an invaluable insight for the defender. There are others, beginning with: Primum Non Nocere Defense comes down to making it hard for an opponent to win. Making the situation worse - by handing him a winning plan - is the ultimate disaster. The words of the Hippocratic oath - Primum Non Nocere (First, Do no harm) - apply to chess players as well as to doctors. Of course, you're going to say, that's obvious. But it's shocking how even GMs flunk this test. Despite White's passed e-pawn, a win is far from likely. It would take several moves before his king can affect events. That's too long. With ... ♖ba8! here or on the next two moves Black could have eliminated the dangerous a-pawn. For example, 1 ... ♖ba8! 2 ♖xb7? ♖xb7 3 axb7 ♖xa1+ and ... ♖b1, or 2 axb7 ♖xa1. Instead he played 1 ... ♗d6 2 h4 ♔g7 3 ♗c4 b6??. This last move was much worse than the missed opportunities for ... ♖ba8. It made ♗b5-c6-b7! a way for White to trap a Black rook. If the Black rooks flee the queenside, White will queen the a-pawn on the square his bishop will control. Black had zero counterplay after 3 ... b6?? and White took his time: 4 ♗b5 h6 5 ♔f1 ♖f8 6 ♔e2 ♖f6 7 ♖b3 ♔f8 8 ♖h3 ♔e7 9 ♔d3 ♔f8 10 ♔c4 ♔g7 11 ♗c6 ♔f8 12 ♔b5! ♔g7 13 ♗b7! ♔f8 14 ♖g1 ♔e7 15 g3!. Black was playing, in effect, a rook down. That means the opening of the kingside, say by 15 ... fxg3 16 ♖hxg3, must lose eventually. He tried 15... f3 16 ♖c1 ♔d8 17 ♖c3 h5 but after 18 ♖h1 ♔e7 19 ♖d1 he resigned. There is no defense to ♖dd3 and ♖xf3, followed by the decisive penetration of a White rook. After "Do no harm" comes a second priority, stopping immediate threats. Your impulse should be to consider the most direct way of preventing an opponent from carrying out a game-winning threat. Again, this sounds obvious but ... White has just traded off his best minor piece, a light-squared bishop, to obtain kingside threats. That's a risky decision because his remaining pieces may be grossly inferior to Black's - provided that Black can deal with the threats. Black can see one danger: ♖f3 and ♖h3 followed by a queen mate on h8 or h7. But he has a more immediate concern. White threatens g5-g6 followed by ♕h7 mate or gxf7+. Can Black create an escape route for his king? Yes, 1 ... ♖c8 and 2 g6 ♖f5 allows ... ♔f8-e7. But 3 ♕h7+ and 4 ♕h8+ is punishing. What about a desperate sacrifice such as 1 ... ♘e7 2 g6 ♕xg6 ? That also stops mate. But a piece down, Black has little chance of salvation. What Black should look for is the one move that stops g5-g6, not just prepares to answer it. Black found 1 ... g6!. It's an easy move to overlook because there is nothing to support that pawn. But after 2 ♕xg6+ ♖g7 White's immediate threats are stopped and his queen is driven back. True, after White played 3 ♕d3 Black could not regain his pawn with 3 ... ♕xb2?? 4 ♖fb1. He settled for a retreat, 3 ... ♘e7!. Black is a pawn down but the nature of the struggle has changed drastically. That's a known defensive technique, as we'll see in a few pages. Now he is the one making threats (... ♗b5!). If White has to play the super- cautious 5 ♖fb1 ♘g6 6 ♕d2 to defend his pawns, Black would have compensation after 6... ♖h7 or 6 ... ♖gf7. White chose 4 ♕b3 instead. Black jumped at the chance for 4 ... ♕xb3! 5 axb3 because his remaining pieces are far superior to White's. This became clearer after 5 ... b6 6 ♗d2 ♘f5 7 ♖f3 ♖h7 8 ♖af1 ♗b5. He eventually won after 9 ♖e1 ♔f7 10 ♔f2 ♖h2 11 ♗c3? ♘h4 12 ♖g3 ♗xf4. Sure, it's obvious that a defender should stop threats from being carried out. But it isn't obvious how to stop them. There are usually several ways to parry a threat. One guideline: It is generally better to parry with a move that both defends as well as threatens. White threatens ♕xf6 but also ♖f4-g4 mate. There are Black moves that stop one threat but allow the other, such as 1 ... ♕b6? 2 ♖f4. The correct method is 1 ... ♕b2!. It protects f6 and allows Black to meet 2 ♖f4 with 2 ... ♖e4!. But in addition, it also threatens 2 ... ♖e2! and ... ♖xg2+ with a quick mate. White tried 2 ♔h1 ♖e2 and saw that 3 ♖f4 fails to 3 ... ♖e1+! 4 ♔h2 ♖e4, the same position as before. So he tried 3 ♗xd5. But this was a blunder that allowed the counterattack, 3 ... ♗xf5! 4 ♕f4 (4 ♖xf5?? ♖e1+) ♗e6 5 ♗f3 ♖h2+ 6 ♔g1 ♖xh3! 7 ♗g2 ♖h5 8 ♕xf6 ♕xf6 9 ♖xf6 ♖a5 and Black won the endgame. So, a good defender tries to meet a threat with an active move, preferably one that makes its own threat. But there is something else to guide the defender. The Principle of Economy Wilhelm Steinitz is credited with this advice: Try to find a way to meet a threat in the least 'expensive' way. That means without giving up material or making major positional concessions. For example, if Black needs to defend his castled position and particularly h7, the economic way is to bring a knight to f6 or f8. In contrast, pushing a pawn to g6 and h6 creates a new weakness. Here's another way to meet a threat to a castled king. Anand - Kramnik, Las Palmas 1996
1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 ♘c6 6 ♗g5 e6 7 ♕d2 ♗e7 8 O-O-O
♘xd4 9 ♕xd4 O-O 10 f4 ♕a5 11 ♗c4 ♗d7 12 ♖d3 ♖ad8 A good plan for White is ♖g3 with the idea of ♗h6 or ♗xf6. But Black can defend with a minor precaution, 13 ♖g3 ♔h8!. Then on 14 e5 dxe5 15 fxe5 ♗c6 White's queen is attacked by the rook on d8. After 16 ♕e3 ♘g8 the g7 square that was White's main target is safeguarded (17 ♗xe7 ♘xe7 18 ♕g5 ♘g6). His attack would halt as he pauses to meet the threat of 19 ... ♕xe5. If White aims at a new target, h7, with 17 ♗d3, Black would rely on 17 ... ♕b6! and 18 ♕xb6 axb6. But hold on. Aren't doubled pawns an 'expensive' concession? No, they would be no weaker than the White e-pawn. A previous game went 19 ♖e1 ♗xg5+ 20 ♖xg5 ♖d4 21 ♗e4 ♘e7 22 ♖g3 ♖fd8 23 b3 ♘g6 and Black won. In this game White passed up 13 ♖g3. Instead, he played the immediate 13 e5 and after 13 ... dxe5 14 ♕xe5 ... he evaluated - correctly - that this time an endgame would be very good for him, 14 ... ♕xe5 15 fxe5 ♘d5 16 ♗xe7 and 17 ♖hd1. Black defended instead with 14 ... ♕b4, threatening the bishop on c4. He met 15 ♖g3 with 15 ... ♔h8!. Again this quiet move eliminates the gravest dangers to g7. And it's much better than 15 ... ♕xc4 16 ♗xf6 ♗xf6 17 ♕xf6 g6 18 ♖d1 when Black is tied up (18 ... ♗c6? 19 ♖xd8) and facing 19 ♖gd3. Note how well Black's rook at d8 is placed for counterattack after 15 ... ♔h8!. White can set a trap with 16 ♘e4 - so that 16 ... ♘xe4 loses to 17 ♗h6! (17 ... ♗f6 18 ♗xg7+). But Black would foil this with 16 ... ♗c6 (17 ♘xf6?? ♕d2+ 18 ♔b1 ♕d1+ and mates). White found the superior 16 ♗d3 and then 16 ... ♗c6 17 ♖h3. This is what good attack and good defense looks like. One side keeps making threats and the other finds ways to thwart or anticipate them. But how does Black met the new threat of 18 ♗xf6 and 19 ♖xh7+ ? After all, 17 ... h6? fails to 18 ♗xh6. And trying to drive off the rook with 17 ... ♗xg2 invites 18 ♗xf6! ♗xh3 19 ♗xg7+ ♔g8 and now 20 ♗xh7+! ♔xh7 21 ♕h5+ ♔xg7 22 ♖g1+ ♔f6 23 ♕g5 mate. But once again Black made the minimum concession: 17 ... ♖fe8!. Then on 18 ♗xf6 ♗xf6 19 ♖xh7+ ♔f8 his king has an escape route via f8 and e7. For example, 20 ♕h5 ♕xf4+ 21 ♔b1 ♔f8 and Black is better thanks to his powerful bishops (22 ♕e2 ♗xc3). In the game White backed off with 18 ♕e2 and a draw was agreed after 18 ... h6 19 ♖f1 ♔g8 20 ♗h4 ♘d5. There is a danger when facing serious threats - and when you see pretty ways to lose - that you will make concessions that are not only excessive but unnecessary. All of White's pieces are splendidly placed for a knockout blow. He prepares ♘xg6 followed by ♗xf6, among other ideas. Some obvious defensive measures allow White to be brilliant. For example, he can meet 1 ... ♕d8 with 2 ♘xf7! ♔xf7 3 ♖xh7! (3 ... ♘xh7 4 ♕xg6+ and ♕xg7+, or 3 ... ♗e4 4 ♕h6!). Another natural defense, 1 ... ♘d7, loses neatly to 2 ♖xh7! ♔xh7 3 ♗xg6+ fxg6 4 ♕xg6+ ♔g8 and 5 ♕f7+ ♔h7 6 ♘xd7 (or 2 ... ♘xe5 3 ♖xg7+ and 2 ... ♗xe5 3 ♗xg6). Black, a world-class player, chose 1 ... ♖d8. White won a pawn with 2 ♘xg6 fxg6! 3 ♗xf6 ♗xf6 4 ♕xf6 and threatened to win another. Black's 4 ... ♕d6 seemed like a limp bid for a swindle (5 ... ♕d1+ 6 ♗xd1 ♖xd1 mate). White replied 5 h3 and had a new threat, 6 ♖xh7! ♔xh7 7 ♕xg6+ and mates. But 5 ... ♖f8 6 ♕d4 ♖d8 7 ♕f6 e5 8 ♕xd6 ♖xd6 gave Black hope. Winning the endgame would not be easy, e.g. 9 c5 bxc5 10 bxc5 ♖d4. White played 9 ♖g4 instead. Black's rook was suddenly the more active one after 9 ... ♖d2!. An attacking piece, the White rook, is clumsy in defense. The game went 10 ♗b3 ♔g7 11 ♖g3 a5! 12 a3 ♗c6 13 ♖c3 ♔f6 and 14 c5 axb4 15 axb4 b5!. White discovered his b-pawn was lost to 16 ... ♖d4. He conceded a draw after 16 ♔f1 ♖d4 17 f3 ♖xb4 18 ♖d3. After the game, annotators were so charmed by Black's resourceful play that they didn't look for improvements. There are several, including 1... ♘h5 in the first diagram (2 ♖xh5 f6! 3 ♕g4 f5! and Black is better). Another is 1 ... ♘d5!, which wins. For example, 2 cxd5 ♕xc3 or 2 ♗b2 ♗f6. In other words, Black chose the practical concession 1 ... ♖d8? - which could have cost the game - when he should have been looking for ways to turn the table. In fact, the defender should always be looking for an opportunity to drastically alter the position. This can be done with a dramatic move, a sacrifice or something else that changes the nature of the struggle. Changing the Nature When the game is beginning to take a trend you don't like you may have to take strong measures. White is a pawn down but his last move, ♖f1-f4, dreams of mate on h8 or h7 after ♖h4. If Black brings in reinforcements to the kingside, 1 ... ♘f6, he walks into 2 e5!, which threatens the knight as well as ♖fxc4. Black decided to seek refuge in a trade of rooks, with 1 ... ♗a6. But 2 fxg6 was an unpleasant surprise. He realized that 2 ... fxg6, the move he intended, would be met by 3 ♖xc8 ♖xc8 and then 4 ♕g4! with winning threats of ♕xd7 and ♕e6+ (or 4 ... ♘f8 5 ♕xc8). Black had to retake 2 ... hxg6. White continued as planned with 3 ♖h4. This looked scary. On 3 ... ♖xc3 White can play 4 ♗d2, after which 5 ♗xc3 would threaten the queen on a5 as well as ♖h8 mate. On other Black moves, White will play 4 ♕d2!, which threatens 5 ♕h6 followed by mate on h7 or h8, as well as 5 ♖xc8! ♕xd2 6 ♖xf8+ and 7 ♗xd2. With the wrong attitude, Black might conclude that these variations represented an appropriate way for the game to end. But with the right attitude, Black concluded that he needed to change a very bad trend. He did it with 3 ... ♖xc3! 4 ♗d2 ♖fc8! 5 ♗xc3 ♖xc3. Then 6 bxc3 ♕xc3 would allow the queen to defend the kingside and give him ample compensation for the lost Exchange. In an endgame, his passed a-pawn is a dangerous, perhaps winning, asset. It was White's turn to try to change the trend. He found 6 ♕d2! so that 6 ... ♖c5 7 b4! ♕c7 8 bxc5 ♕xc5 could be met by 9 ♕h6 ♕e5 10 ♕h7+ ♔f8 11 ♕h8+ ♕xh8 12 ♖xh8+ ♔g7 13 ♖a8 and ♖xa7. Without a passed a-pawn, Black is no better than White. Black found the superior 6 ... ♕e5 which favors him in all lines. For example, 7 ♕xc3 ♕xc3 8 bxc3 ♗c4 and ... a5. Or 7 bxc3 ♗c4 8 ♖f4 ♘c5! and, as the game went, 8 ♕h6 ♘f8 9 ♖g4 a5! 10 ♖g5 ♕xc3 11 e5 ♕xc2 (threat of ... ♗f1) 12 ♔h1 ♕b1+ 13 ♔h2 ♕b2 14 ♔h1 dxe5, when the a-pawn won. Trends can be broken by surprise sacrifices - or just by creating a material imbalance, as in this case: Black is in trouble because a move of the attacked knight allows ♖xf7+. Even on 1 ... ♘xg4 White can pass up 2 ♖xg4 in favor of 2 ♖xf7+ ♖xf7 3 ♕xf7+ ♔h6 (forced). After 4 ♕f8+ ♔h5 5 ♘e4 his pieces swarm for the kill. Black's simple choice in the diagram was resignation or desperation. He chose the latter, 1 ... ♗xg4!?. It shouldn't work because White can move his queen, leaving the threat of ♖xf6 on the table. For example, 2 ♕h1! ♘h5? 3 ♖xg4 is quite lost. Better is 2 ... ♗f5. But 3 ♗xf5 gxf5 4 ♕g1+ ♘g4 5 ♔b1! threatens to win with 6 ♖xf5 now that ... ♕e3 isn't a check. If Black had inserted the check, 3 ... ♕e3+ 4 ♔b1 gxf5, White should win after 5 ♖xf5 ♘e8 6 ♘e4. However, White thought that 2 ♖xg4? ♘xg4 3 ♕xg4 was a winner. (Some computers agree.) What White didn't appreciate is that without his initiative, the nature of the middlegame has turned against him. Play went 3 ... ♖bd8 4 ♕f3 ♖d6 5 ♘e4 ♖b6 6 c3. Now 6 ... f5! would eliminate attacks on f7 and limit White's minor pieces. Black actually went pawn grabbing, 6 ... ♕h2 7 ♗c2 ♕xh4 and gave White chances of salvation after 8 ♖h1 ♕d8 9 ♕e3 h5 10 ♖d1 ♕c7 11 ♕d4+. (But Black won eventually.) Desperation, the Weapon A bad position can be easier to play because it allows you to consider desperate steps you might have rejected in a less-lost position. Belyavsky - Kasparov, Moscow 1981
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 g6 3 ♘c3 ♗g7 4 e4 d6 5 f3 O-O 6 ♗e3 ♘c6 7 ♕d2 a6 8 ♘ge2 ♖e8? 9
♘c1 e5 10 d5 ♘d4 11 ♘1e2! c5 12 dxc6 ♘xc6 13 ♘d5! White threatens ♗b6! followed by ♘c7, winning the Exchange. Garry Kasparov set a personal record here by thinking for 68 minutes. He needed that much time to convince himself that passive defense, such as 13 ... ♘d7 14 h4! or 13 ... ♘xd5 14 cxd5 ♘e7 15 ♘c3, would ultimately lose. That helped narrow his options: Kasparov realized he had to allow ♗b6. Better to go down fighting in a sharp position than to be slowly ground down in a helpless one. With that (proper) attitude, he went for 13 ... b5 14 ♗b6 ♕d7 15 ♘c7 ♖b8 16 ♘xe8 ♕xe8. It was White's turn to sink into thought. He didn't like the looks of 17 ♗c7 ♖b7 18 ♗xd6 bxc4 or 17 cxb5 ♖xb6 18 bxc6 d5!?. In hopes of reducing risk, he gave back a pawn 17 ♗e3? bxc4 18 ♘c3 ♗e6 19 ♗e2. But Black had sufficient play after 19 ... ♘d4 20 O-O d5 and eventually won. Another example: Anand - Belyavsky, Belgrade 1997
1 e4 d6 2 d4 ♘f6 3 ♘c3 g6 4 ♗e3 e5 5 f3 exd4? 6 ♕xd4! ♗g7 7 O-O-O O-O 8 ♕d2
♗e6 9 ♗h6! ♗xh6 10 ♕xh6 ♘bd7 11 g4 ♕e7 12 h4! ♘e5 13 ♗e2 c6 14 ♘h3 ♖ad8 15 h5 ♖fe8 16 ♘f4 White's last move advertises his knockout ideas: g4-g5 and/or hxg6. Black chose what he called "the last chance in a hopeless position" - 16 ... ♘fxg4!?! and 17 fxg4 g5!. And he used his acting skills: He looked at his opponent in a confident manner. It was more than a bluff. There are ways that White's queen, which has no safe moves, can be caught, such as 18 ♘h3 f6 19 ♘f2?? (to stop ... ♘xg4) ♘f7!. Nevertheless White had an extra piece in a winning position. The future world champion became nervous. Instead of 18 ♘d3! he chose 18 ♘xe6? fxe6 and then 19 ♖df1 ♖f8 20 ♘d1. White felt he had a simple way of sealing matters, ♘e3-c4! followed by trading knights and then all four rooks. He can meet 20 ... ♘f7 with 21 ♕f6. He didn't believe Black had a useful move - until he saw 20... ♖f7!!. Suddenly the queen-trapping idea was alive, e.g. 21 ♖xf7?? ♘xf7 or 21 ♘e3 ♖df8 followed by taking (twice) on f1 and ... ♘f7. After long thought, White conceded material 21 ♗c4 ♖xf1+ 22 ♖xf1 ♘xc4 and drew after 23 ♖f6 ♕g7 24 ♕xg7+ ♔xg7 25 ♖xe6. As Anand himself later said, when he escaped from a lost position against Anatoly Karpov, "Once you understand you are lost, you can do anything," So far we've considered proper attitudes for the defender as well as a few principles to guide him. What else can he rely on? Calculate, Calculate A common misconception is that attackers calculate while defenders do ... something else. Actually, an attacker can choose many of his moves based on intuition and general principles. Or, he can look just two or three moves into the future. If he misses something tactical by his opponent, it usually costs him nothing more than the initiative. Not so for a defender. Anand - Tiviakov, Wijk aan Zee 2006
1 e4 d5 2 exd5 ♕xd5 3 ♘c3 ♕d6 4 d4 ♘f6 5 ♘f3 c6 6 ♘e5 ♘bd7 7 ♗f4 ♘d5 8
♘xd5 ♕xd5 9 ♗e2!? ♘xe5 10 ♗xe5 ♕xg2! 11 ♗f3 ♕g6 12 d5 A pawn down, White seems to have a powerful initiative, e.g. 12 ... cxd5 13 ♕xd5 e6? 13 ♕b5+. Black was forced to calculate and found 12 ... ♗g4!. He would have the strong 13 ♗xg4 ♕e4+!. White had missed 12 ... ♗g4. But he didn't lose his head. He played 13 dxc6 bxc6 14 ♕e2 ♗xf3 15 ♕xf3 ♖d8 16 ♖d1 and built enough play to draw. Because the defender is typically at greater risk of losing, he must calculate more than the attacker. He can't stop at two moves into the future if there's a good chance that disaster awaits him at move three. The cost of an oversight is greater for him. Yusupov - A. Sokolov, Riga 1986
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 e6 3 ♘f3 b6 4 g3 ♗a6 5 b3 ♗b4+ 6 ♗d2 ♗e7 7 ♗g2 d5 8 ♘e5 ♗b7 9
O-O ♘bd7 10 ♘c3 c5 11 ♗f4 O-O 12 cxd5 ♘xe5 13 ♗xe5 ♘xd5 14 ♘xd5 ♗xd5 15 e4 ♗b7 16 ♕g4! White threatens 17 ♕xg7 mate. Black can readily see that he has five ways to meet it. But one of them, 16 ... g5, is so weakening that he can push it down to the bottom of his mental list. At the top of the list is 16 ... ♗f6, because it offers a trade of bishops and, in most positions, exchanges tend to favor a defender. In between these two alternatives are the other candidate moves that meet the ♕xg7 mate threat: 16 ... g6, 16 ... ♗g5 and 16 ... f6. As he takes a more serious look at the position, Black can see that 16 ... ♗f6 17 ♗xf6 and 18 dxc5 would isolate a potentially weak pawn at c5. White can play for more with 17 ♖fd1. Then 17 ... cxd4 18 ♖xd4 ♕e7 looks adequate. But a defender has to look further. Black would see that 19 ♖d7! wins (19 ... ♕xd7 20 ♗xf6 g6 21 ♕g5 and ♕h6-g7 mate). What about 17 ... ♗xe5 18 dxe5 ♕c7 instead? If Black looks further he'll see that 19 ♖d6! is another substantial positional plus for White. So he looked for other alternatives. Black can see that after 16 ... g6 or 16 ... ♗g5 White could keep a significant edge with the simple 17 ♖fd1, if there's not something sharper. Realizing that he must calculate more than White, Black looked at the unlikely 16 ... f6!? and then 17 ♕xe6+ ♔h8. Hmm, this is better than it seemed at first, he might say to himself. The White bishop must move because the combination 18 dxc5 fxe5! 19 ♖ad1 ♕e8 20 ♖d7 fails to 20 ... ♗c8!. So Black must evaluate 18 ♗f4 cxd4. At first glance, that looks risky because the pawn at d4 appears weak. But after ... ♗c5 the pawn is supported, while the e4 pawn would be threatened by with ... ♖e8. In the end, Black chose 16 ... f6! 17 ♕xe6+ ♔h8 18 ♗f4 cxd4. White had nothing better than 19 ♖fc1 ♗c5 and then 20 b4! ♗xb4 21 ♖c7. Black shot back 21 ... ♗c8 22 ♕c6 ♗g4 and coasted to a quick draw (23 h3 ♗e2! 24 ♕b7 ♖b8 25 ♕xa7 ♖a8 26 ♕b7 ♖b8 27 ♕a7 ♖a8). Coolness under Fire The good defender knows that he is going to be surprised from time to time. He cannot expect to see all of his opponents' moves in advance. Shock happens. With that attitude, he can prepare himself emotionally. What he must avoid is not so much surprise as being rattled by surprise. White found 1 ♘f6!. Taking the knight, 1 ... gxf6 2 ♗xh6, leads to mate and 1 ... ♘xf6 2 exf6 would expose both Black's king (3 ♗xh6) and queen (♗xc7) to deadly threats. White wasn't counting on those lines. His basic idea was to trade off the best defender of the kingside with ♘xg8!. Even if Black had not expected 1 ♘f6! he should take it in his stride and look for a saving resource. The one he found was 1 ... c4!, to eliminate one of the minor pieces essential to White's attack. There followed 2 ♘xg8 ♔xg8. Since 3 ♗e4 ♗b7 only helps Black, White searched for a killer and spotted 3 ♗xh6. Black faces new dangers because 3 ... cxd3? loses to 4 ♗xg7! ♔xg7 5 ♕g4+ and ♖f3-h3 mate. White also threatens 4 ♕g3 g6 5 ♗xg6!. But once again a good defender would just take a deep breath and look for a saving grace. It may not exist. But if you don't look, you won't find. What Black found was 3 ... gxh6! 4 ♕xh6 cxd3. Or rather, he found that the apparent killer, 5 ♖f3 and 6 ♖g3+ is refuted by 5 ... ♕xe5! 6 ♖g3+ ♕xg3. Black would have more than enough compensation for the queen. White played 5 ♖f4! but Black anticipated ♖g4+ with 5 ... ♖b4!. The game ended in perpetual check, 6 ♖xb4 ♗xb4 7 ♕g5+ ♔h7 8 ♕h4+ ♔g7. In double-edged positions the player with the stronger nerves is playing with an extra piece. We see the attack succeed so often that we can come to the mistaken conclusion that only the defender's nerves can fail. Radulov - R. Byrne, Leningrad 1973

Boldness came with the price: a mangled king position. To play this way required nerves - and seeing that the dangerous-looking 17 ♘e5 fails to 17 ... fxe5 18 ♕g4+ ♔h8 19 ♕h4 ♖g8! and the king escapes. And what about White? He also has to meet threats, such as 17 ... c3!, which threatens his queen and prepares 18 ... cxb2. White tried 17 ♘d4 to get his queen to the kingside quickly. Black calmly replied 17 ... ♖fd8! and there followed 18 ♕g4+ ♔f8 19 ♕h4 c5!. "If Radulov had shown the cold-bloodedness of his opponent," the tournament book said, "he would have played 20 ♘f3!." For example, 20 ... ♔e7 21 ♘e5! ♖xd1+ 22 ♖xd1 ♖d8 23 ♖xd8 with good chances, it added. But if Black's nerves remained strong, he would have met 20 ♘f3 with 20 ... ♕xb2! and challenged White to play 21 ♕xh7 c3 or 21 ♖db1 ♕c2 22 ♕xf6 ♕f5!, for example. Instead, White misfired with 20 ♘f5? exf5 21 ♕xh7, expecting to win with ♖e1 and ♕h8 mate. Black had calculated further - because he knew he had to. He found 21 ... ♗c8! 22 ♖e1 ♗e6!, and won in a few moves. And most of all, a good defender never resigns until he has considered virtually every legal move in his search for a saving resource.

♗b7 9 ♗d3 ♗e4 Black's last move was based on 10 ♗xe4 ♕h4+ and 11 ... ♕xe4. But she overlooked 10 ♗g5. Black appears to be losing a piece since ... ♕h4+ is ruled out and 11 ♗xe4 is coming. She played her worst possible move: 10 ... resigns??. There were two improvements. One was 10 ... ♗e7 so that 11 ♗xe7? ♕xe7 12 ♗xe4 ♕h4+ or 11 ♗xe4 ♗xg5 12 ♕c3 c6 13 ♗xc6+ ♘xc6 14 ♕xc6+ ♔f8 and Black can play on. But she had much better: 10 ... ♗b4! and then 11 ♗xd8 ♗xd2+ or 11 ♕xb4 ♕xg5 or 11 c3 ♕d5 (12 cxb4 ♗xg2) would have given her a fine game. The Limits of Attack One of the reassuring facts of middlegame play is that some attacks run out of steam. If the defender meets all the threats - and the attacker cannot add additional pieces - his initiative will die. White has just advanced his rook from d1 and hopes to bring it to good use on c3 or f3. Black could test him with 1 ... ♕c2 and then 2 ♖c3 ♕xa2. But White would justify his loss of the pawn with the combination 3 ♖c8 ♖xc8 4 ♘xe7+ ♔f8 5 ♘xc8. Then 5 ... ♕xb3 6 ♘xh7+! is messy. Black chose the more circumspect 1 ... ♕b7!. White had a problem because 2 ♖c3 fails to 2 ... ♘xd5 3 exd5? ♗xc3 and 3 ♗xg7 h5! favors Black. But the key to the position is that after 2 ♖f3 all of White's pieces are attacking the kingside - yet there is no threat or way to make progress. If it were his move, 3 ♗xg7 ♔xg7 4 ♘xf6 ♘xf6 achieves nothing because 5 ♖xf6? exf6 6 ♕xh7+ ♔f8 ends the attack. That's comforting for Black. He played for a win with 2 ... ♗h8!. Now ♗xg7 is ruled out. White has reached the end of his kingside buildup and must defend against threats such as 3 ... ♘e5 followed by 4 ... ♘xf3 or 4 ... ♘xd5. White didn't like the looks of 3 ♘xf6+ exf6! or 3 ♖d3 ♘c5!. So he played a move that only looks like it attacks, 3 g4?. His position fell apart after 3 ... ♘xe4!. For example, 4 ♘xe4 ♕xd5 or 4 ♘xe7+ ♖xe7 5 ♘xf7 ♗f6!. Masters often take what seems to be considerable risk because they can accurately evaluate the limits of an enemy attack. We'll examine risk further in Chapter Six. But for the time being let's see how a player can allow his kingside to be damaged - because he knows he can't be mated by a lone enemy piece. Carlsen - Kramnik, Dortmund 2009
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 e6 3 ♘c3 ♗b4 4 ♕c2 O-O 5 a3 ♗xc3+ 6 ♕xc3 d5 7 ♘f3 dxc4 8 ♕xc4
b6 9 ♗g5 ♗a6 10 ♕a4 Black is a bit constricted and his c7-pawn is a potential target. With 10 ... ♕d7 11 ♕c2!, preparing ♗xf6 or ♖c1, his troubles would remain. The thematic way to handle the position is 10 ... c5. But Black has to carefully weigh the consequences of 11 dxc5 bxc5 and 12 ♖d1. Then 12 ... ♘bd7? 13 ♕xa6 is out of the question and 12 ... ♕e8 is uncomfortable after 13 ♕xe8 ♖xe8 14 ♗xf6 gxf6 15 e3. And 12 ... ♕b6 allows doubled kingside pawns, 13 ♗xf6 gxf6. All true. But in the last line, Black threatens ... ♕xb2, e.g. 14 ♕g4+ ♔h8 15 ♕h4 ♕xb2!. Black liked what he saw and went into this. White had no good means of sacrificing the b-pawn, so 14 ♖d2 and then 14 ... ♘c6 were played. Black's kingside remains weakened. But White only has one piece to attack it with, e.g. 15 ♕g4+ ♔h8 16 ♕h4 ♔g7 17 ♘g5 fxg5 18 ♕xg5+ ♔h8 19 ♕f6+ ♔g8 is only a perpetual check. Since "a weakness is not a weakness ..." White took the draw with 17 ♕g4+ ♔h8 18 ♕h4 ♔g7 19 ♕g4+. Easier to Play Most players love to attack. If they had a choice, perhaps only one out of ten would say they prefer to defend. Why? Because it is fun to win with sacrifices, checks and mating nets. And because the attacker usually has an easier time finding good moves. But this is not always the case. Sometimes the defender has an easier task because his moves are forced or severely limited: He can rely on the process of elimination. Anything other than what he chooses would lose. It is the attacker who may face more difficult choices. White sacrificed two pawns to exploit Black's insecure king. (Black had previously played ... ♔e8-d8-e8 so he can't castle now.) White has a wide variety of discovered checks but they lack a strong follow-up. For example, 1 ♗c7+ may force 1 ... ♗e6. Then 2 f5 ♘xc7 3 fxe6 looks good - until you see 3 ... ♘d5!, when Black weathers the storm. e.g. 4 ♘b7 a5! 5 ♘d6+ ♔e7 6 exf7+ ♔xd6 7 fxg8(♕) ♖xg8 and the queenside pawns are strong. White found the inspired 1 c4! with the idea of 1 ... bxc4 2 ♖b1 or 2 ♗c3+. On 1 ... ♗xd1 he would continue 2 cxd5 because 2 ... ♗xc2?? 3 ♗c7+! ♔f8 4 ♗d6 is mate and 2 ... f6 3 ♗d6+ ♔f7 4 ♖xd1 is double-edged. But Black also found a great move, 1 ... f6!. His king now had an escape square at f7. The pressure is back on White. He had a difficult choice: 2 ♖b1 would be consistent but 2 cxd5 seems to win material. After 2 cxd5 ♗xd1 the 3 ♗c7+ idea is stronger than before and leads to 3 ... ♔f7 4 ♖xd1 cxd5 5 ♖xd5. White may have rejected that because at the end, 5 ... a5! favors Black a bit. He chose 2 ♖b1 instead, hoping for 2 ... fxe5 3 cxd5 or 2 ... bxc4 3 ♗xf6+ ♔f7 4 ♗e5 and ♖b7+. All of this was difficult for White to find. But it was relatively easy for Black to find the best move, 2 ... ♘b6!, since it closes the dangerous b-file. White could get one pawn back, 3 ♗d4+ ♔f7 4 cxb5 cxb5 5 ♖xb5, but he would be worse. Instead, White played 3 ♗xf6+ ♔f7 4 ♗g5 and Black was on the road to victory with two extra queenside pawns and a safe king, 4 ... ♘xc4 5 ♖e7+ ♔g6. White was able to delay matters with a few threats but he lost soon after 6 ♖be1 ♗f5 7 ♔f2 ♖ad8 8 ♘d3 a5 9 ♖g1 ♖d7! 10 ♗h4+ ♔h7. The two types of position - the ones in which it's easier to conduct the attack and the others when it's easier to defend - may occur at different times in the same game: Stein - Flohr, Kiev 1957
1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 ♘c3 dxe4 4 ♘xe4 ♘d7 5 ♗c4 ♘gf6 6 ♘g5 e6 7 ♕e2 ♕e7? 8 ♗d2
b6 9 O-O-O ♗b7 10 ♘1f3 h6 11 ♗b4! A rude shock for Black. He realized that 11 ... ♕xb4 makes 12 ♘xf7! strong. For example, 12 ... ♔xf7 13 ♕xe6+ ♔g6 14 ♗d3+ and mates. Or 12 ... ♖h7 13 ♕xe6+ ♗e7 14 ♖he1. What made this difficult for Black was not only finding those losing lines but choosing between the more playable 11 ... ♕xb4 12 ♘xf7 ♕xc4!? and the move he adopted in the game, 11 ... c5. White replied 12 dxc5 bxc5 13 ♗xc5!? ♘xc5 14 ♘e5! with a check coming up on b5. Yes, it took a bit of calculation to convince himself that 13 ♗xc5 might work. But so far it's been easier for White to find good moves than for Black to defend. Black found a way to avoid a quick loss: 14 ... ♘fd7 15 ♘gxf7 ♘xe5 16 ♘xe5 ♕g5+ and then 17 f4! ♕xf4+ 18 ♔b1 ♗e4!. White is still a piece down. He needed sharp moves and looked for checks, captures and other forcing moves. The game went 19 ♕h5+ g6 20 ♗b5+ ♔e7 21 ♘xg6+ ♗xg6 22 ♕xc5+ ♔f7 23 ♕c6. Only his last move and the dead end of 22 ♕xg6+? ♕g5! might be hard to calculate. This looked like a winning position because 24 ♖hf1 and 24 ♕xa8 are threatened. But a subtle change has occurred. Positions like this are easier for Black to play than earlier ones in this game because there is only one move to meet both threats, 23 ... ♕e4!. White had more shots to come: 24 ♕d7+ ♔g8 25 ♗d3 ♕g4 26 h3 ♕g5. The turning point of the game was 27 ♕xe6+?. The quieter 27 ♖hf1! might have won (27 ... ♖h7 28 ♕xe6+ or 27 ... ♗g7 28 ♕xe6+ ♔h7 29 h4). Black replied 27 ... ♗f7 28 ♕c6 ♖b8 29 ♕c7 ♖b6. It was harder and harder for White to find good-looking moves. Instead of 30 ♖hf1! he chose 30 ♗c4?. Black consolidated with virtually forced defensive moves, 30 ... ♖h7 31 ♖hf1 ♖f6! 32 ♖xf6 ♕xf6. In the end, White blundered with 33 ♖f1? ♕xf1+ and resigned when he saw that 34 ♗xf1 ♗xa2+ and ... ♖xc7 wins for Black. Quiz Good attitudes and spirit, backed by a few basic guidelines, are the foundation of successful defense. Let's see if you can apply them in these quiz positions. Take at least five minutes to study each diagram and try to find the answer. The solutions for this chapter and for the quizzes in later chapters can be found at the end of the book. Black's immediate threat of ... ♗xc5, winning back a pawn, would leave White with the better game positionally. Does Black have a greater threat brewing on the kingside? And how can White deal with it? White threatens ♕xg7. What is the best of Black's options? Four attacking pieces seem too many for Black to handle in lines such as 1 ... ♕xd5 2 ♖xg7+ ♔h8 3 ♘f6!. What can Black do? White threatens the pinned knight. How should Black respond? White played 1 ♗xg5. Analyze the consequences. White has just played 1 ♗d4 and clearly intends 2 g5 followed by a trade of bishops. What's best for Black? Chapter Three: New Defense You know how opening theory churns constantly. But you may not appreciate that middlegame theory changes, too, and no more so than in defense. The story of the evolution of defense begins with Wilhelm Steinitz. Steinitz was the first great player to make the transition from a young attacking player to a mature defensive master, who asked himself what made an attack succeed. It couldn't just be the genius of the player marshaling the attack, he concluded. Or the lack of skill of the defender. Some great attackers fail to beat weaker players and some weaker players mate great opponents. Steinitz reasoned that one of the players must have some form of superiority in the position before he could begin a successful initiative. For example, if he can deliver superior force at the point of the attack - that is, at a target - his attack will work. But if you realize there is no such advantage, the attack can be refuted. Steinitz's opponent controls a bit more space. But that is not enough to justify the bid for mate White began with 1 ♖e3?. Steinitz felt that the attack should fail. He countered with 1 ... ♕d6, attacking the most vulnerable White weakness, the d4-pawn. He saw that he could meet 2 ♖h3 with 2 ... h6 and push White back after 3 ♖d1 f6!. White chose 2 ♖d1 but 2 ... f6! again exposed the flaw in his optimism. If the attacked knight retreats to f3, Black would seize the initiative with 3 ... ♕a6! (4 ♘d2 e5). White continued with his anti-h7 plan, 3 ♖h3. Black had a major choice. He could take the knight, 3 ... fxe5 4 ♕xh7+ ♔f8. But White's initiative is not easily halted after 5 ♖f3+ ♗f7 6 ♕h8+ ♔e7 7 ♕xg7 ♖f8 8 ♖b1. Or 5 ♖g3 ♗f7 6 ♖xg7 ♖c7 7 c5. Steinitz opted for the low-risk approach, 3 ... h6!. This transposes into the position he considered after 2 ♖h3 h6 3 ♖d1 f6 and gives him excellent winning chances with little risk of losing. White saw that 4 ♘g6 fails to 4 ... ♗xg6 5 ♕xg6 ♖xc4 and then 6 ♖xh6 ♕xd4!, e.g. 7 ♖xd4?? ♖c1+ or 7 ♕h7+ ♔f8 8 ♕h8+ ♔f7 9 ♕xd8 ♕xd8. Instead he played 4 ♘g4. But his pieces were not coordinated well and Black was able to confuse them further with 4 ... ♕f4! 5 ♘e3 ♗a4 6 ♖f3 ♕d6 7 ♖d2 ♗c6 8 ♖g3 f5! 9 ♖g6 ♗e4 10 ♕b3 ♔h7. Black pieces then ran all over the board: 11 c5 ♖xc5 12 ♖xe6 ♖c1+ 13 ♘d1 ♕f4 14 ♕b2 ♖b1 15 ♕c3 ♖c8 16 ♖xe4 ♕xe4 and White resigned. But Steinitz was much too rigid. He often accepted sacrifices on principle and grossly underestimated his opponent's potential pressure. White wants to develop his bishop but 1 ♗e3? ♕xb2 just drops a pawn. He chose 1 ♗g5, perhaps counting on 1 ... ♘e4, which attacks as well as defends. Then he could do the same with 2 ♗e3 and threaten ♕xd5 as well as ♗xb6. But Steinitz felt confident in his king's ability to defend itself and met 1 ♗g5 with 1 ... ♕xb2?!. He likely concluded that he would have winning chances after 2 ♗xf6 ♕xf6 3 ♕xd5 and 3 ... ♖d8. More problematic is 2 ♖e2!. Then 2 ... ♕c3 3 ♖e3 ♕b2 allows 4 ♖b3 ♕xa2 5 ♗xf6 gxf6 6 ♖xb7 when White's chances are no worse than Black's. So instead of 2 ... ♕c3 the game went 2 ... ♕b5 3 ♗xf6 gxf6 4 ♖d2 ♖d8. A modern master would appreciate, as Steinitz did, that Black's kingside is hard to exploit. But he would also know what Steinitz discounted, that a slow buildup, say with 5 ♘d4 ♘xd4 6 ♖xd4, would give White excellent practical chances - especially because it is easier to play White than Black. Steinitz was vindicated after White went for direct mate, 5 ♘h4? d4! 6 ♖d3? ♘e5 7 ♖b3 ♕c6 8 ♖g3+ ♔f8 9 ♕d2?, and was lost after 9 ... ♖c8! 10 ♕h6+ ♔e7 11 ♘f5+ ♔d7. Steinitz's Heirs Steinitz's successors refined his approach. For Siegbert Tarrasch, piece activity and mobility were very high priorities when attacking, maneuvering positionally or defending. Tarrasch was willing to accept a sacrifice - but not if it meant accepting a passive position. When defending, his goal was to get his pieces quickly into play. He assumed that they would then be able to meet threats and, eventually, seize the initiative. White's compensation for a sacrificed piece lies in two strong center pawns, his fine bishop and the pawn at h5, which prevents ... ♘g6 and makes doubling rooks on the g-file a long-term threat. Tarrasch's characteristically active defense began with 1 ... ♖ad8!, intending ... ♘c5 and ... ♘xb3!. After 2 ♕e3 he still played 2 ... ♘c5 because the pinning 3 ... ♗d4 was threatened. Play went 3 c3 ♘xb3 4 axb3 a6 5 ♖h2. The instinctive response to White's plan of ♔h1/♖g1/♖hg2 would be 5 ... ♔h8. But Tarrasch continued to seek play for his under-used pieces with 5 ... ♖fe8!. The point of this wasn't clear until 6 ♘e2 ♘d5 7 ♕f2: With 7 ... ♘c7! 8 ♘g3 ♘e6 the knight is headed to the great blockade square at g5 and threatened 9 ... ♘xd4! along the way. Play went 9 ♘f5 ♘g5 10 ♔h1 ♔h8 11 ♖g2 ♗f6 12 ♘e3. White was preparing 13 e5 followed by f3-f4. Tarrasch foiled that by reorganizing his minor pieces, 12 ... ♘e6! and 13 ... ♗g5. On 13 d5 cxd5 14 ♘xd5 he intended to seize the initiative with 14 ... ♖xd5! 15 exd5 ♘f4 and ... ♕f5. White played 13 ♖g4 and still had powerful compensation after 13 ... ♗g5 14 ♘f5 ♖g8 15 f4 ♗f6. Even after a trade of all four rooks, 16 ♖ag1 ♖xg4 17 ♖xg4 ♖g8 18 ♖xg8+ ♕xg8 19 ♕f3, he would have had good chances. But White preferred 15 ♕h2 with the idea of ♕e5+. Play continued 15 ... ♗f6 16 ♖ag1 ♖g5!. The rook is the third defensive piece to occupy the g5 stronghold. Now an ♖xg5/... hxg5 exchange would render the g-file harmless and allow ... ♘f4!. White's last bullet was 17 f4 and it gives Black a chance to give up material for the initiative: 17 ... ♖xf5! 18 exf5 ♕xf5 19 ♖1g2 ♘g7. After a repetition of moves, 20 ♖4g3 ♕b1+ 21 ♖g1 ♕e4+ 22 ♖1g2 ♕b1+ 23 ♖g1 ♕e4+, he was ready for 24 ♖1g2 ♘f5 and ... ♘e3. Instead, White played 24 ♖3g2 and resigned soon after 24 ... ♖d5 25 f5 ♖xf5 26 ♕b8+ ♔h7. While mobility was Tarrasch's goal in all middlegames, Emanuel Lasker's emphasis was more practical. Chess is a struggle, Lasker said, and the defender had as much right to win the struggle as his opponent. Lasker Defends to Win No matter how bad a position is, Lasker felt, the defender should try to find a way to make threats. He should hold out hope of winning, not just surviving. Here is Lasker, lost after a dozen moves as White, in a world championship match: Lasker - Janowsky, Berlin 1910
1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 ♘c3 c5 4 cxd5 exd5 5 ♘f3 ♗e6 6 e4? dxe4 7 ♘xe4 ♘c6! 8 ♗e3
cxd4 9 ♘xd4? ♕a5+! 10 ♘c3 O-O-O 11 a3 ♘h6 12 b4 ♕e5 White faces disaster on the d-file where his knight is pinned (13 ♘xc6 ♖xd1 with check) and threatened by 13 ... ♘xd4 and 13 ... ♘f5. If Steinitz were sitting in White's chair he would have chosen 13 ♘ce2. But Lasker hated to play purely passive moves. White may be alive after 13 ♘ce2 ♘f5 14 ♖c1 but it's just barely that following 14 ... ♘xe3 15 fxe3 ♕xe3. He would be a pawn down and several moves away from castling. Lasker chose the audacious 13 ♘cb5!. Objectively it is inferior to 13 ♘ce2 but it adds a powerful, new element. After 14 ♖c1 White will begin to make threats of his own, such as ♘xa7+. On 13 ... a6 White also has 14 ♕c1! with the idea of 14 ... axb5 15 ♘xc6 bxc6 16 ♕xc6+ ♕c7 17 ♕a6+ and 18 ♖c1(+). Play went 13 ... ♘f5 14 ♖c1!. White is beginning to coordinate his pieces (15 ♖c3). There are immense complications after 14 ... ♖xd4 15 ♘xd4 ♘xe3 but White emerges on top. Play went 14 ... ♘xe3! 15 fxe3 ♕xe3+ 16 ♗e2. Black seemed ready to deliver a knockout with 16 ... ♗b3 since 17 ♕xb3? ♕xc1+ and 17 ♕d2 ♕xd2+ 18 ♔xd2 ♔b8! win. But there was another point to White's aggressive 13th move. He can answer 16 ... ♗b3? with 17 ♘xa7+! ♔c7 18 ♘db5+! since 18 ... ♔b6 allows 19 ♕xd8+! ♘xd8 20 ♘c8+ and mates. Black found the best move, 16 ... ♗e7!. This tempts White to try 17 ♘xa7+ ♔b8! 18 ♘axc6+ bxc6 19 ♘xc6+ ♔b7. Black would win after 20 ♘xd8+ ♖xd8 21 ♕c2 ♖c8 but the immediate 20 ♕c2! would have left chances unclear. Lasker went with the common-sense move, 17 ♖c3. He wanted to drive the Black queen back and make ♘xa7+ more dangerous. It also prepares to get out of the d-file pin with 18 ♖d3. A third benefit of 17 ♖c3 is that it offers Black a variety of unclear variations to calculate and evaluate, such as 17 ... ♕xc3+!? 18 ♘xc3 ♘xd4 and 18 ... ♗f6. In the end Black chose 17 ... ♗h4+ 18 g3 ♕e4? 19 O-O! ♗f6 and White took over the initiative with 20 ♖xf6! gxf6 21 ♗f3. White won swiftly after 21 ... ♕e5? (21 ... ♖xd4 lasts longer) 22 ♘xa7+ ♔c7 23 ♘axc6 bxc6 24 ♖xc6+. Origins of New Defense By the late 20th century, traditional defensive principles were being overthrown. Consider this position, from a Caro-Kann Defense variation we'll be examining later. Traditional defense thinking held that ... h6 had compromised Black's kingside so much that he doesn't dare castle there. He usually played 1 ... O-O-O even though it was clear that he would be worse after 2 ♗a6! because he would have virtually no counterplay. Conventional wisdom said what mattered most was that Black had few weaknesses. Play often went 2 ... ♗xa6 3 ♕xa6+ ♔b8 with a solid, if unpromising position. Black can rarely afford ... c5 when he castles long like this. But Anatoly Karpov introduced 1 ... O-O! and that became a main line. Yes, White can open lines with 2 g4 and 3 g5. But Black's king position is more solid than was thought, and his counterplay from ... c5 is strong. Another illustration from a Caro-Kann: White has liquidated part of the center with f2-f4-f5xe6 but failed to expose a weakness. For example, 1 ♘f5 can be met by 1 ... cxd4, which prepares a strong 2 ... ♕d5. White rejected the equal and toothless 1 dxc5 ♗xc5 2 ♕xd8+ ♖xd8 3 ♘d3 and opted for 1 ♘xf7 ♔xf7 2 ♖xe6 ♔xe6 3 ♕g6! instead. Wasn't this a violation of Steinitz's law? Yes, there was no obvious White advantage that justified attack, let alone a piece sacrifice. But defenders who had relied on Steinitz's law had been mated over and over by more daring opponents in the last half of the 20th century. Black's king has been forced into the open and faces dangers after dxc5 and ♗f4/♘f5. It's tempting to play 3 ... cxd4 and try to escape with ... ♔d7. But 4 ♘f5 ♔d7 5 ♗f4 or 5 ♘xg7 (5 ... ♗xg7 6 ♕xg7+ ♕e7?! 7 ♗xh6) would give White dangerous compensation for his knight. Instead, Black chose 3 ... ♕d5 4 dxc5 ♕xa2!. The threat of ... ♕a1 mate prevents White from a slow buildup of his forces. After 5 ♖e1+ ♔d7 6 ♕f5+ ♔d8 7 ♗c3 ♘bd5, for example, Black is remarkably safe. Instead, White tried 6 ♗c3 and Black replied 6 ... ♕a1+ 7 ♔d2 ♘c4+ 8 ♔e2 ��a6!. White has to meet 9 ... ♘e5+ and can't afford 9 ♔f2 ♗xc5+. Black's king proved to be relatively safe on c6 after play went 9 ♕f7+ ♔c6 10 ♔f3 ♗xc5. Then 11 ♕xg7 ♘d5 12 ♖e6+ ♘d6 would offer White little. He preferred 11 ♘f5 ♖f8. But neither 12 ♕xg7 ♔b5! 13 ♘d4+ ♗xd4 14 ♕xf8 ♕c6+ 15 ♔g3 ♗xc3 16 bxc3 ♘e4+ 17 ♔h2 ♕d6+ nor the game continuation, 12 ♘d4+ ♔b6 13 ♕e6+ ♗d6 14 ♘f5 ♖e8 could save him. Active defense trumped solid but passive defense. Myth of the 'Solid King Position' Another traditional defensive principle was: "There must be some weakness in the opponent's position" for an attack to succeed, as Tibor Florian wrote in Defense and Counterattack (1984). But well before that, masters began to suspect that even a solid king position could be breached if there are enough attacking pieces: Ragozin - Boleslavsky, Sverdlovsk 1942

♘f3 O-O 9 O-O ♗d6 10 ♖e1 ♗g4 11 ♕e4 ♗h5 12 ♘h4 ♘d7 13 ♕f5! ♘b6 14 ♕xh5 ♘xc4 Before this game, the chief drawback to 5 ... exf6 was believed to be that it gave White a queenside pawn majority. White should play to create a passed queenside pawn, opening theory said. But here White played 15 ♗h6! and the attack based on ♗xg7 and/or ♘f5 proved decisive. For example, 15 ... gxh6 16 b3 ♘b6 17 ♘f5 ♔h8 18 ♕xh6 ♖g8 and now 19 ♖e8! (19 ... ♕xe8 20 ♕xf6+ mates). The game went 15 ... ♕d7 16 ♗xg7! ♔xg7 17 ♘f5+ ♔h8 18 ♖e4! ♗xh2+ 19 ♔h1!. Black resigned because he had no defense to ♖h4/♕xh7 mate. Of course, you can call the doubled f-pawns a weakness. But since Black's f7, g7 and h7 pawns remained on their original squares, there were no holes and therefore his kingside should have been solid. It wasn't. Superior force - four White pieces - defeated Black's solid-but- passive defense setup. Dynamic Play vs. King Safety Another problem with solid-but-passive defense is this: If your pieces are well-placed for the protection of your weaknesses, they are probably incapable of exploiting your opponent's weaknesses. In the long run, if you can't make threats of your own, your opponent may be able to concentrate his forces at the weakest chain in your link of defense and win. Just protecting yourself doesn't always save games - and it rarely wins games. This is why New Defense places the highest priority on counterplay. In general, counterplay outranks pawn structure, development and even material. Only king safety rivals it - and doesn't necessarily exceed it - in importance. Duckstein - Petrosian, Varna 1962

But White's pieces remain a bit more active. He may obtain an initiative after ♖fe1, threatening ♗e5. Black chose the stunning 18 ... a5!. Yes, he invited the destruction of the pawn protection around his king. But Black can prevent a file from being opened, e.g. 19 bxa5 ♗xc5 20 a6 b6! 21 a5 b5!. In other words, Black is willing to trade some king safety for substantial piece play. White answered by seeking exchanges, 19 ♖ad1 ♖xd1 20 ♖xd1. But Black would have had an edge after 20 ... axb4!. However, he was so sure of his king that he tried the more ambitious 20 ... ♖h4?! 21 bxa5 ♗xc5. Then came 22 a6 b6! 23 ♖e1! ♔a7 24 ♗e5 ♕d7 25 ♘e4 ♗d4. White could have exploited this with 26 a5 so that 26 ... ♗xe5? 26 axb6+ and 27 ♘c5 is a strong attack. But he chose 26 g3? and invited a powerful sacrifice, 26 ... ♗xe5! 27 gxh4 ♘d4 28 ♕d1 ♕d5, that eventually won. Another illustration of balancing king safety and counterplay was: Short - Harikrishna, Gibraltar 2004
1 e4 e5 2 ♘f3 ♘c6 3 ♗b5 ♘f6 4 d3 ♗c5 5 O-O d6 6 ♘c3 ♗g4 7 ♘a4 ♘d7 8 ♘xc5
♘xc5 9 ♗e3 ♕f6 10 ♗xc6+! bxc6 11 ♗xc5 dxc5 12 ♕e2 White wants his queen on e3 where it will eye the c5-pawn and allow him to get out of the pin. Black shouldn't permit 13 ♕e3 and 14 ♘d2, so he chose 12 ... ��xf3. White replied 13 gxf3! rather than play an endgame (13 ♕xf3 ♕xf3 14 gxf3). He believed that his king would be safe at h1. This appeared so strong that Black didn't even try to test White with 13 ... g5 or 13 ... O-O 14 ♔h1 ♕d6 and ... f5. Instead, he preferred 13 ... O-O 14 ♔h1 ♖ad8. But after 15 ♖g1 it was easy to see that White could make progress with ♕e3, ♖g4, b2-b3, ♖ag1 and eventually f3-f4. Play went 15 ... ♕h6 16 ♕e3!. Black saw nothing better than 16 ... ♕xe3 17 fxe3, and White's 13 gxf3! had been vindicated. In the endgame the pawn structure is so lost for Black that he should have bid for counterplay with 17 ... c4! 18 dxc4 ♖d2. But he opted for 17 ... f5 18 exf5 ♖xf5 and was slowly ground down after 19 ♖af1 ♖b8 20 b3 ♖bf8 21 ♖g3. Geller's 'Clutching' Traditional defensive theory was created to meet the demands of traditional attacking theory. It said that a defender could expect his opponent to stay within certain reasonable, recognized limits. For example, a defender would not have to worry about an attacker offering purely speculative sacrifices. "To sacrifice a piece one should be absolutely sure that one will quickly gain compensation," Jose Capablanca wrote. But when Mikhail Tal began to win with outrageous sacrifices, he challenged traditional defense. Defenders needed a new approach. Yefim Geller, best known as an attacking player, offered this Laskerian advice: In a bad position, when there is no real counterplay, the defender should 'clutch' at enemy pieces and pawns. The idea is to inflict maximum annoyance until the opponent begins to err. Three pawns down, White is quite lost. Trying to construct a defensive wall to stop the extra enemy pawns from advancing is bound to fail. But White can 'clutch' and harass, 1 ♕f8+ ♔c7 2 ♕f4 ♖f7 3 ♕g5 ♕f5 4 ♕d2. This wasn't progress, of course. But the defender doesn't need progress. His opponent does. White kept finding annoying resources such as 5 ♕a5+, e.g. 5 ... ♔b8? 6 ♕d8+ ♔a7 7 e6!. After 4 ... ♖e7 5 ♕a5+ ♔c8 6 ♕c3 ♖e6 7 a4 ♕f2 8 ♖h1, annotator Mikhail Savinov said White was following the classic Geller recipe: attacking pawns, giving checks and sometimes defending his own material. Black found himself off-balance and blundered with 8 ... ♔d7?. That allowed White to regain one pawn with 9 ♕b4!. He was still lost. But even though Black was not in time trouble, he soon fell apart: 9 ... b5 10 ♕xg4 ♕f7 11 ♕d4! ♔c8 12 ♕b6! ♕c7 13 ♕xa6+. He lost his queen and resigned after 13 ... ♕b7?? 14 ♖h8+ ♔c7 15 ♕a5+ ♕b6 16 ♖c8+!. And White went on to win the tournament with nearly a 2900 performance rating. This was an extreme example, of course. White had no right to even draw. Whenever a defender escapes from a bad position, the post-mortem is bound to reveal improvements for his opponent. But it is also likely to demonstrate the superiority of clutching over passive defense. White has a substantial positional edge which she can enlarge with ♘d4/f4-f5, or h4-h5xg6 or a well-prepared e4-e5. Traditional defensive theory held that Black could delay a crisis for many moves with solid play. New Defense argues that given time, White will win this kind of position nine times out of ten. That's why Black needed to activate his dormant pieces, particularly his g7- bishop. He began with 1 ... f5!, even though it invited 2 e5! and granted White a powerful passed e-pawn. The benefit of this was 2 ... ♕c4! because the d5-pawn had become a target. There followed 3 ♖ad1 ♗a4! 4 ♖d2. Black exposed e6 to an invasion from ♘g5-e6. But he moved the bishop from d7 because he needed another piece to clutch with. He continued with 4 ... ♗c2!. He wanted to plug the e-file with ... ♗e4 and didn't fear 5 ♖c1 b3 6 exd6 ♗xb2, for example. Post-mortem analysis showed that White missed a strong 5 ♘g5 (since 5 ... ♗e4 6 exd6! ♗xd5 7 ♖ed1 ♗c6 8 d7 would create a monster d-pawn). Clutching paid off after 5 h4 ♗e4! 6 ♖d4 ♕b3 7 ♘g5 ♕xb2 led to a liquidation and a draw (8 ♘xe4 fxe4 9 ♖dxe4 dxe5). Ugly Moves Attackers win with pretty moves, such as queen sacrifices. The defender has to overcome the feeling of awe that he can get when an attacker dazzles him with tactical explosions. White has the Exchange for two Pawns. But the pawns are passed and, what's worse, his bishop is trapped at f8. It will be lost after ... ♘d7 or ... ♘c6. White came up with an inspired combination beginning with 1 ♖xb5!. Of course, 1 ... ♕xb5?? allows mate on g7. Black took 1 ... ♗xb5. Then 2 ♖c8 ♕a1+ 3 ♖c1 would not lead to a repetition of moves (3 ... ♕e5?) but to a win (3 ... ♕d4! 4 ♖c8 ♕d1 mate). But White had another dazzler, 2 ♗g7!. White threatens 3 ♗xe5 as well as 3 ♖c8+. A pretty additional point is that 2 ... ♕e6?? loses to 3 ♗h8! and ♕g7 mate (or 3... ♔xh8 4 ♕f8 mate). But the game is not over. In such positions the defender must recover his composure and look for a resource. The only possibility is 2 ... f6 and it works because of 3 ♗h8 ♔f7! and 4 ♕xh7+ ♔e6! (not 4 ... ♔e8?? 5 ♕g8+ ♔d7 6 ♕c8+ ♔d6 7 ♖d1+) . Now it was White's turn to dodge a trap. After 5 ♕g8+ ♔d6 6 ♖d1+? ♔c7 Black is escaping. White had to settle for 6 ♕d8+! ♔e6 7 ♕g8+ ♔d6, draw. There are few defensive moves that could be called aesthetic. Instead of pretty moves, the careful defender - the New Defender - often has to rely on 'ugly moves,' that is, moves that don't look right. They seem to violate traditional defensive canon if not common sense. White has made substantial inroads on the queenside. Conventional strategy calls for him to castle followed by (a) going after the a5-pawn with ♗e1 and ♘b5/ ♘xa5, or (b) bringing heavy pieces to the b- and c-files and crashing through with c4-c5. But 1 O-O gives Black a target for ... ♘f6, ... ♘f7, ... h5 and ... g4!. White realized that his king would be safest on the side of the board where he is strongest. He played 1 ♔d2! and 1 ... ♗d7 2 ♔c2 ♘f7 3 c5!. Black didn't like allowing 4 c6 so the game continued 3 ... dxc5 4 ♘xc5 ♘d6 5 ♘xd7 ♕xd7 6 ♗b5 ♘xb5 7 axb5. Now the a5-pawn is all but lost because White can double rooks on the a-file. But it's the absence of Black counterplay - no target! - that cost him the game, 7 ... ♖fb8 8 ♕d3 ♗f8 9 ♕c4 ♕d6 10 ♖a4 ♘f6 11 ♖ha1. White won after 11 ... ♘d7 12 ♕c6! ♘b6 (or 12... ♕xc6 13 bxc6 ♗c5!? 14 cxd7 ♗xf2 15 ♖c4 ♗b6 16 ♘b5) 13 ♖xa5 ♖xa5 14 ♖xa5. Viktor Korchnoi was one of the fathers of New Defense. He popularized a confrontational style designed to throw an attacker off balance. He sought to deny opponents the opportunity to make aggressive moves with confidence. Here that doesn't seem possible. White has built up a nice positional edge and has 'easy' attacking moves, such as ♘e4-f6+ and ♖f1-f4-g4. Black would like to put his knight to better work, with ... g6 and ... ♘g7-f5. But that weakens both f6 and h6, e.g. 1 ... g6 2 ♕h6 ♘g7 3 ♖h3 ♘h5 4 ♖dd3, threatening 5 ♖xh5 gxh5 6 ♖g3+. Traditional defensive thinking said pawns around a castled king should not be moved (1 ... g6?). New Defense adds "... unless there is a very good reason." That explains Korchnoi's 1 ... h5!. It averted a rook lift to g4 and threatened to disrupt White's coordination with ... h4. After 2 ♖f1 ♕b4! 3 ♘e2 ♕c4! 4 c3 White counted on his attack growing with 4 ... ♕xa2 5 ♘f4. But 5 ... h4! keeps Black solid. He preferred to get his knight in the game, 4 ... g6! 5 ♖gf3 ♘g7. The knight will have a terrific defensive post at f5, from where it watches the key g3, e3 and d4 squares. Lacking a way to better use his rooks, White tried 6 b3 ♕a6! 7 ♘g3 and was met by 7 ... h4! 8 ♘e4 ♘f5. Now we see why the queen retreated to a6. White can't win with 9 ♖xf5 and 10 ♘f6+ because Black would be threatening ... ♕xf1+. White played 9 ♕f4, perhaps hoping for 9 ... ♘xd4? 10 cxd4 ♕xa2? 11 ♘f6+ and wins. But Black calmly played 9 ... ♕xa2!. The outcome was still unclear as play went 10 ♗c5 ♕e2 and White repeated moves, 11 ♖3f2 ♕d3 12 ♖f3 ♕e2 13 ♖3f2 ♕d3. Instead of taking the draw White chose 14 ♖d2?! and was surprised by 14 ... ♕xd2! 15 ♘xd2 ♗xc5. This changed the nature of the position. Material is roughly even. But Black owns the only open file and his knight is worth a rook. Moreover, White had no targets. It was harder for the (former) attacker to find easy moves. No wonder that after one more error, 16 ♘e4 ♗e3 17 ♘f6+ ♔g7 18 ♕c4 ♖7d8 19 ♘g4 ♗b6 20 ♘f2? ♗xf2 21 ♖xf2 ♘e3!, he had to resign. Quiz And now it's your turn to see how you can apply what the world has learned in more than a century of evolving defensive thinking. Once again the solutions can be found at the end of this book. White played 1 f4. How should Black react? White had sacrificed a piece on h6 in expectation of a knockout blow from ♖g4+. What can Black do? White has an annoying ♘f6+ coming up. Is there anything better than 1 ... O-O or 1 ... f5 ? A natural move is 1 ... e6. What else should Black consider? Chapter Four: Weapons of Defense The weapons of attack, such as the sacrifice and the line-opening pawn break, are well known. Every how-to-play primer introduces at least a few of them. The weapons of defense, however, have suffered a bad press. They're not well known. Let's change that by examining these weapons: (1) Closing/controlling attacking lines (2) Dead Pawn (3) Repairing weaknesses (4) Trading into the endgame (5) Neutralizing a dangerous piece (6) Contesting a weak flank (7) Relieving pressure/pins (8) Confusing enemy pieces (9) Reinforcing (10) Striking in the center (11) Escaping Closing/Controlling Open files and diagonals are the canals of attack. If the player with the initiative has uncontested access to them, "the attack plays itself," as the annotators love to say. What they mean is: Winning tactics and threats will virtually suggest themselves. But remember what we said about exploitable and unexploitable weakness? The control of open files and diagonals doesn't mean much if there's no target at the end of them. White's bishop controls the clear b3-g8 diagonal. His rooks look fearsome on the g-file. But he lacks open lines to get at the Black king. Black is so safe that he may be tempted to open lines for his own rooks, with 1 ... f5 2 exf5 ♖xf5. But White's pieces would exploit the lines first with 3 ♖e1! (3 ... ♖ff8 4 ♖xe8 and 5 ♗f7!). The right way to proceed is 1 ... g6!. That shortens the g-file, the only line truly dangerous for Black. It frees the knight from the defense of g7 and prepares a sounder ... f5. White tried to discourage ... f5 with 2 ♗d3 and there followed 2 ... ♖e7 3 c4 ♘g7!. (This is based on 4 ♕xf4 ♕xf4 5 ♖xf4 ♘e6, when Black would regain the pawn favorably.) After 4 c3 was played instead Black prepared ... ♘g5 as well as the advance of his kingside pawns with 4 ... ♘e6!. White tried to cover everything with 5 ♗f1: But 5 ... f5! was powerful because 6 exf5 ♖xf5 would open a path to White's most vulnerable target, h3 ( 7 ... ♖h5 and 8 ... ♘g5). After play continued 6 ♖4g2 ♖f6 7 ♗d3 g5 Black threatened the cute mate 8 ... ♕xh3+! and 9 ... ♖h6 mate. White resigned after 8 ♖h1 g4 9 ♗e2 ♘g5 10 fxg4 f3 11 ♖g3 fxe2. The lesson here: Before a defender can open the lines he wants opened, he has to deal with the potential opening of lines that his opponent wants opened. What this means to the defender is that his goal is to (a) block, (b) contest the control of, or (c) minimize the effect of open lines. Andersson - Yusupov, Leningrad 1987 1 ♘f3 d5 2 d4 c6 3 c4 e6 4 ♘bd2 f5 5 g3 ♗d6 6 ♗g2 ♘d7 7 O-O ♕f6 8 ♘b3 h6 9 ♗f4 ♗xf4 10 gxf4 g5 11 ♕d2 ♘e7 12 fxg5 ♕g7 13 cxd5 ♘xd5 Black is offering a pawn (14 gxh6 ♖xh6) to open kingside files and threaten ... ♖g6. If White defends with 15 ♔h1 and ♖g1, Black would develop threats with ... ♘d7-f6-g4, ... ♗d7, ... O-O-O and ... ♖h8. But with 14 g6! White kept the h-file closed. And if 14 ... ♕xg6 15 ♔h1 ♖g8 16 ♖g1, the g-file might have been more useful to him than to Black (17 ♗h3 ♕f7 18 ♖xg8+ ♕xg8 19 ♖g1). Instead, Black developed, 14 ... b6 15 ♔h1 ♗b7 and White began positional pressure, 16 ♘c1! ♕xg6 17 ♘d3 O-O-O 18 ♖ac1. Black's lack of play on the h-file was felt after 18 ... ♖hg8 19 ♖g1 ♕f6 20 b4 ♔b8 21 a3. When Black tried to force matters with 21 ... f4 22 ♘fe5 c5 he quickly collapsed, 23 bxc5 ♘xe5 24 dxe5 ♕f5 25 c6. It's important for the defender to realize he may have a choice of which lines to open: White's bishop ���doesn't play' and his rook is a bit misplaced at d4. But what matters most is hxg6. For example, 1 ... ♘f6 2 hxg6 hxg6 and now 3 ♕g5! (3 ... ♕xd4 4 ♕xg6+ ♖g7 5 ♕xg7+ ♔xg7 6 ♘xf5+ and ♘xd4). Black solved his problem with 1 ... g5!. If White allows the kingside to be closed (2 ♕d2 h6) Black will dominate the e-file and/or win the d5-pawn after ... ♖e5. So White accepted the pawn, 2 ♕xg5+ ♖g7 3 ♕e3. But after 3 ... f4! 4 ♕e6+ ♔h8 5 ♘e2 ♘e5 it became clear that Black's threats were much more powerful, e.g. 6... ♗c8! 7 ♕h6 ♘g4, trapping the queen. White played 6 ♖xf4 and resigned soon after 6 ... ♘d3+ 7 ♔b1 ♘xf4. Dead Pawn One of the best ways to neutralize a potentially explosive file is to create a 'dead pawn.' This is an advanced enemy pawn that is deliberately not captured because it will block a file. A.Geller - Spassky, Leningrad 1954

But after 22 g6! at least one attacking file will be partly open. However, White saw that there was no follow-up to 23 gxh7+. He should deal instead with Black's threats, beginning with 23 ... bxc2+. The most natural defense is 23 cxb3 axb3 24 axb3. But this loses to 24 ... ♖a1+! 25 ♔xa1 ♕c2 and ... ♖a8 (mate). Moreover 24 a3, instead of 24 axb3, also fails, to 24 ... ♕c2+ 25 ♔a1 ♖xa3+! 26 bxa3 ♕a2 mate. And 23 axb3 axb3 24 c3 loses after 24 ... ♕a5. White found 23 cxb3 axb3 24 ♖c1! and then 24 ... bxa2+ 25 ♔a1. The pawn at a2 is 'dead' and blocking Black's attack. There is a new target now, at b2, but it will take at least three moves for Black's heavy pieces to menace it. And 25 ... ♘c5, with a threat of ... ♘b3 mate, loses to 25 ♖xc5! followed by a killing capture on f7 or h7. Black met the threat to his queen with 25 ... ♕d7 and left White to choose a pawn capture on the kingside. He picked 26 gxf7+ since 26 ... ♕xf7?? loses to 27 ♘h6+. Also bad is 26 ... ♔h8 because of 27 ♘xg7! ♘xg7 28 f8(♕)+ ♖xf8 29 ♕xd7. So 26 ... ♔f8 was forced. There were two dead pawns now. White's attack looks like the faster one because he can move his bishop and threaten ♘xg7. Chances would be roughly equal after 27 ♗f1 ♕xf7 (and 28 ♗c4 d5, for example). But White decided to take aim at d6. After 27 ♖gd1? ♖dc8! and 28 ♖xc8+ ♕xc8! Black was regaining the initiative. For example, 29 ♘xd6 ♘c5! threatens ... ♘b3 mate and allows 30 ♕g3 ♕g4! and wins. The rest was one-sided, 29 ♕g3 ♕c2 30 ♖e1 ♔xf7 31 ♘xd6+ ♔g8 32 h6? ♕d2!
33 f4 exf4 34 ♕c3 ♕xd6 33 ♕b3 ♗c8 34 ♖d1 ♖b8 White resigns.
Repairing Pushing pawns around your castled king is likely to make it more vulnerable. But some pawn weaknesses can be masked, if not eliminated, with the help of a piece. Tal - Witkowski, Riga 1959

He is preparing ... ♗g4, ... ♗f5 or ... ♗b7, followed by ... ♖ae8. It's natural to try to catch up in development. But 16 ♘d2? loses to 16 ... ♘f4!. And 16 ♗e3 walks into 16 ... ♗f5 (17 ♕d1 ♗g4 or 17 ♕d2 ♗e4 18 f4 ♘xg3). Instead, White repaired his only weakness with 16 ♗d5! followed by ♗g2. This turned his kingside into a solid fianchetto setup. Black tried 16 ... ♗f5. But after 17 ♕e3! he couldn't challenge the e-file because 17 ... ♖ae8? 18 ♕xe8! favors White. Instead, he chose 17 ... ♖ad8 and White had eliminated virtually all kingside danger with 18 ♗g2! ♕g4 19 ♘d2 ♕g6 20 ♘f3. Trading We're not done with that last example. After White had repaired his kingside with shifts of minor pieces, Black continued 20 ... ♗g4. Black is preparing ... f5 followed by ... f4 or ... ♖de8. He may even find an opportunity when the sacrifice ... ♘f4 works. But he didn't get the chance because White forced queens off the board with 21 ♕g5!. The attack that was fatally wounded by ♗d5-g2 was buried after 21 ... ♖de8 22 ♕xg6 hxg6 23 ♖xe8 ♖xe8 24 ♗e3. Black, still a pawn down, tried 24 ... f5? but his kingside pieces were at risk after 25 ♘e5 ♗xe5 26 dxe5 threatened f2-f3. He resigned soon after 26 ... f4 27 gxf4. Transition into an ending is a powerful resource because it exploits an imbalance that frequently emerges from an opening: One player concedes positional assets - such as a superior pawn structure or the two-bishop edge - in return for an initiative. He is offering a kind of non- material gambit. But if his opponent can swap down to an ending, what is left are those positional assets. Kharlov - Dreev, St. Petersburg 1993

b6 9 O-O-O ♗b7 10 ♕f4 ♗e7 11 ♗d3 ♘d7 12 h4 White is ready to put a knight on g5 and, if ... ♗xg5, retake with the h-pawn and obtain a powerful attack on the h-file. For example, 12 ... ♘f6 13 ♘xf6+ ♗xf6 14 ♘g5 ♗xg5? 15 hxg5 (15 ... g6 16 ♖h6 and 17 ♖dh1). Black lacks the usual center play because 12 ... c5 13 dxc5 poses problems on the d-file (13 ... bxc5 14 ♗b5; 13 ... ♘xc5 14 ♘xc5 bxc5 15 ♗xh7+ and ♖xd8). But Black has a nice resource, 12 ... ♕b8!. Then 13... c5 will not only attack the center but offer a queen trade that would favor his two bishops. White tried 13 ♘e5 but 13 ... c5! undermined the knight since 14 ♘xd7?? would hang the queen (14 ... ♕xf4+). White protected it with 14 g3?, rather than be more consistent with 14 ♘g5!. There followed 14 ... ♘xe5 15 dxe5. White seems to be ready for 16 ♘g5!? or g3-g4-g5 and ♘f6+!. But Black upset him with 15 ... f5!. White had to choose between a move of the pinned knight, which costs the Exchange, or the endgame of 16 exf6 ♕xf4+!. He chose 16 ♘g5? but after 16 ... ♗xh1 17 ♖xh1 ♕b7 and 18 f3 ♗xg5 19 hxg5 g6 he had no attack and little compensation. He lost quickly. Neutralizing You already know that it takes several pieces to mount a meaningful attack. If the defender can neutralize even one dangerous piece, he may reduce the chances of an initiative drastically. A.Sokolov - Karpov, Candidates match 1987

But he didn't like the looks of 15 ♖fe1 ♘c5! because ... ♘xd3! would have eliminated a very dangerous bishop. But now he is ready for kingside action with 18 f4 or 18 g3 followed by ♘g4. If Black trades queens, 17 ... ♗xe5 18 ♕xe5 ♕xe5 19 ♖xe5, White's two bishops and queenside majority favor him considerably. But Black killed the attack with 17 ... ♗b5! and the idea of 18 ... ♗xd3 (or 18 ... ♗xe5 19 ♕xe5 ♕xe5 20 ♖xe5 and then 20 ... ♗xd3). The game went 18 ♗xb5 ♗xe5 19 ♕xe5 ♕xe5 20 ♖xe5 ♖xd2. White's bishop-over-knight advantage is not nearly as strong as the two-bishop edge would have been. He temporarily trapped the advanced rook with 21 ♗d3. But with aggressive play, 21 ... ♖c8 22 ♖ee1 b5! and 23 a3 ♘d5 24 ♖d1 ♖xd1 25 ♖xd1 a5 26 g3 b4! 27 axb4 ♘xb4, Black was able to trade into a drawish rook endgame. It is particularly important to swap off an opponent's piece if it is vital to his defense as well as to his attack. White has potentially vulnerable pawns at b2, d4, f3 and h2 and a possibly mateable king. Black's last move, ... ♘(f6)-h5, prepared ... ♕f6 as well as ... ♘f4/... ♖h6/... ♕c8-h3. This position had arisen before, when 1 ♔h1 was played. Then 1 ... ♘f4 could be met by 2 ♖g1, safeguarding g2. But Black still had pressure against h2 after 2 ... ♖h6! and 3 ♘d5 ♘xd5 4 ♗xd5 ♕f6 followed by ... g6!, ... ♔g7 and ... ♖bh8. White's improvement was 1 ♘d5!. It stops ... ♕f6 and allows him to trade off the dangerous Black knight after it lands on f4. Black's chances for initiative vanished after 1 ... ♘f4 2 ♕d2! and 2 ... ♘xd5 3 ♗xd5. Moreover White was ready to grab the initiative after the game went 3 ... ♖h6 4 ♖fa1!. With ♖a8! coming up, Black's king is suddenly at greater risk than White's. For example, 4 ... ♕f6 5 ♖a8! ♖xa8 6 ♖xa8+ ♔h7 and now 7 e5! dxe5 8 ♕c2+! g6 9 ♖f8 and ♖xf7+ wins. Note how the splendid bishop defends f3 and also attacks f7. Black tried 4 ... ♕d7. But again 5 ♖a8! ♖xa8 6 ♖xa8+ ♔h7 made 7 e5! strong. If Black had gone after the h2-pawn, 7 ... ♕h3, he would lose to 8 ♗xf7 ♕xh2+ 9 ♔f1 ♕h3+ 10 ♔e2 (10 ... g4 11 ♕d3+ g6 12 e6!). Instead, Black played 7 ... dxe5 8 dxe5 ♕h3. But this time 9 ♗xf7 had a threat of 10 ♖h8+! ♔xh8 11 ♕d8+ and mates, which proved decisive. Trading isn't the only way to neutralize an annoying piece.

Black seems to have only unpleasant options such as 16 ... ♗d7 17 b4 O-O- 0, which allows 18 ♕d2 followed by ♖fb1/ a3-a4 and b4-b5. Or 16 ... ♕xb2 17 ♖b1 ♕c3 18 ♕a4. But Black found the 'ugly' solution to his problems, 16 ... ♔d7!. He would meet 17 ♗xc6+ with 17 ... ♔xd6!. Then he can keep his extra pawn and bring his king to safety (... ♔e7, ... ♖d8). White managed to equalize after 17 ♗f4 ♔e7 18 ♗xc6 bxc6 19 ♗e5 c5 20 b4!. But 17 ... f6! and ... e5 would have rendered the once powerful bishop harmless and given Black winning chances. Contesting The pawn structure that evolves from the opening often dictates the wing that a player will have more operating room. A common error is to write off the other flank as belonging to your opponent. Karjakin - Carlsen, Wijk aan Zee 2010
1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ♘c3 ♘f6 4 e5 ♘fd7 5 f4 c5 6 ♘f3 ♘c6 7 ♗e3 ♗e7 8 ♕d2 O-O 9

White moved his queen to h4 to target h7 with ♗d3 or ♖f3-h3. Should Black try to distract him with counterplay on the queenside, his wing? No, the right idea was 17 ... ♗xd4 18 ♖xd4 f6!. White replied 19 ♗d3 h6. Then 20 ♕g4 f5 would close the d3-h7 diagonal. White felt forced to liquidate with 20 exf6 ♖xf6. Black has turned the kingside from a liability into an asset. His bad bishop isn't as important as the target f4-pawn. White would be the one forced to defend after 21 ♖g1 ♖cf8 22 ♘e2 e5! 23 fxe5 ♘xe5, for example. No better is 21 g3, which may open the long diagonal for Black's bishop after 21 ... e5. White tried 21 f5 ♖cf8 22 ♖g1 instead. But he was distinctly worse after 22 ... ♘c5! 23 fxe6 ♘xe6 24 ♖g4?! ♘f4 25 ♕g3 ♕e7. To stop ... d4 and an attack on g2, he gave up the Exchange, 26 ♖xf4 ♖xf4, but it wasn't nearly enough. Relieving When we talk of an opponent's pressure, we often mean a pin on a file or diagonal. Breaking a pin can incur great cost: When a White bishop on g5 pins a Black knight at f6 it can be highly weakening to drive the bishop back with ... h6 and ... g5. Computers have taught us that many pins can be safely broken that way. But following Steinitz's principle of economy, it is often better to relieve the pin by either tactics or maneuver. Here's a tactical example. Spassky - Larsen, Belgrade 1970
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 e6 3 ♘f3 b6 4 ♘c3 ♗b7 5 ♗g5 ♗e7 6 e3 O-O 7 ♗d3 c5 8 O-O ♘c6 9
d5 ♘b4 10 d6 ♗xd6 11 ♗xh7+ ♔xh7 12 ♕xd6 ♗xf3 13 gxf3 Because Black's h-pawn is gone, he can't relieve the pin with ... h6. And if he doesn't do something fast he will lose the d7-pawn or be forced into passivity after 14 ♖ad1. But Black had counted on 13 ... ♘e8!. The first point is that on a retreat of the attacked White queen, to g3 for example, Black can safely embarrass the bishop with 14 ... f6. More complex are the two Exchange sacrifices that Black offered: (a) He would stand well after 14 ♗xd8 ♘xd6 15 ♗e7 ♘xc4 and 16 ♗xf8 ♖xf8. (b) Better is 14 ♕xf8! ♕xg5+ 15 ♔h1. Black thought he would have sufficient compensation after 15 ... ♕h5 16 ♖g1 ♕xf3+ 17 ♖g2 g6. (Actually, 18 ♔g1! favors White a bit.) Instead he got a tiny edge with 14 ♕e7 ♕xe7 15 ♗xe7 ♖g8 but lost. A creative way to break a pin by a maneuver is illustrated by this:
1 e4 e5 2 ♘f3 ♘c6 3 ♘c3 ♘f6 4 ♗b5 ♗b4 5 O-O O-O 6 d3 d6 7 ♗g5 ♗xc3 8 bxc3
♕e7 9 ♖e1 White protected his e-pawn with the rook so that he can exert pressure on the center with 10 d4. Black should avoid 10 ... exd4 11 cxd4, since White's edge in the center would mean he threatens 12 e5. A surprising plan discovered a century ago, known as the Metger Unpin, proves effective. It begins with 9 ... ♘d8! and then 10 d4 ♘e6. Black wants to play ... ♘xg5. If White retreats the bishop to d2 or c1, Black can apply his own pressure to the center with ... c5. (This is based on a small trap, 11 ♗c1 c5 2 dxe5 dxe5 13 ♘xe5? ♘c7! and Black wins one of the attacked minor pieces.) But what happens if White maintains the pin with 11 ♗h4 ? The answer is 11 ... ♘f4! followed by 12 ... ♘g6 13 ♗g5 h6!. True, Black spends four tempi with his knight. But it is worth it to break the pin that was the key to White's early middlegame pressure. Confusing By 'confusing' we don't mean complicating the position to such a degree that it bewilders an opponent. No, confusing is upsetting the harmonious interplay of enemy pieces. When enemy pieces are coordinated they become dangerous. To stop that, they should be driven to bad squares and their protection from other pieces should be cut. W.Adams - Reshevsky, New York 1936
1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ♘c3 ♗b4 4 ♗d3 dxe4 5 ♗xe4 ♘f6 6 ♗g5 h6 7 ♗xf6 ♕xf6 8 ♘f3

To thwart that Black needs to push White's pieces around. He started with 15 ... ♗f4! and then 16 ♖c3 ♖d8!. Black's pin on the d-file means he threatens 17 ... e5, e.g. 17 b4 e5! 18 bxc5 exd4 19 ♖d3 ♗e5 (20 ♖e1 ♗g4!). White found 17 ♕c2, feeling that 17 ... ♖xd4 18 ♘xd4 ♕xd4 19 ♖d1 and ♕h7+ was good for him. Black agreed and play went 17 ... g6 18 b4: A key to successful confusing is not to give your opponent time to regroup. Black shot back 18 ... e5! since 19 ♘e2 ♗f5! would have made his advantage obvious. White went for 19 bxc5 exd4 20 ♖b3 instead. Then 20 ... ♗d7! threatened 21 ... ♗a4 and invited 21 ♖xb7 ♗c6. White preferred 21 ♕b2 but Black kept hitting his pieces and pawns, 21 ... ♗c6 22 ♖d1 ♕e7 23 ♖bd3 ♕xc5 24 ♘xd4 ♗e5!. After a liquidation, 25 ♕d2 ♗xd4! 26 ♖xd4 ♖xd4 27 ♕xd4, he won with 27 ... ♕xa3 28 ♕f6 ♕b3! 29 ♖e1 ♖e8! 30 ♖f1 ♕xc4. Traditional defense said enemy pieces should be restrained. New Defense said they should be confused, usually by threatening them or other pieces. The most forceful threat is, of course, a check. Euwe - Reshevsky, AVRO 1938
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 g6 3 f3 d5 4 cxd5 ♘xd5 5 e4 ♘b6 6 ♘c3 ♗g7 7 ♗e3 O-O 8 f4 ♘c6 9
d5 ♘b8 10 ♘f3 c6 11 ♕b3 cxd5 12 ♘xd5 ♘xd5 13 exd5 ♘d7 14 ♗e2 After 13 exd5 White's d-pawn can become weak or strong, depending on whether he can coordinate his pieces and defend it (O-O and ♖fd1). But 14 ... ♕a5+! offered White a choice of which of three pieces to misplace. He decided against 15 ♘d2 ♘b6 because he can't defend the pawn with ♖d1. And he rejected 15 ♔f2 because 15 ... ♘f6 would threaten the d-pawn as well as ... ♘g4+. That left 15 ♗d2. Black replied 15 ... ♕b6! since a trade of queens (16 ♕xb6 ♘xb6) would cost the d-pawn. White tried 16 ♗c3 ♗xc3+ 17 bxc3. But then 17 ... ♕e3! ruined White's plans. He would be losing after 18 g3 ♘c5 19 ♕c4 ♘e4 or 19 ♕c2 ♗f5. Instead, he gave up a pawn, 18 c4 ♕xf4 19 O-O. But his hopes of kingside attack were squelched by a piece trade, 19 ... ♕c7 20 ♔h1 ♘f6 21 ♕e3 ♗g4 22 ♕h6 ♗xf3!. Black won following 23 ♖xf3 b5 24 cxb5 ♕e5 25 ♖e1 ♘xd5. Reinforcing Successful attacks are based on a local superiority in firepower: Two attacking pieces are likely to beat one defender. Three attackers will usually outmuscle two defenders, and so on. The simplest way to change an unfavorable imbalance is to add one or more defenders: White's last move, g2-g4, guarantees that he will get back his sacrificed piece with g4-g5. But he's also aiming for mate after f4-f5 followed by f5-f6 or ♗xh6. His queen and rook, with the potential addition of his knight and bishop, might overwhelm the kingside. But Black's 1 ... ♕d8! rushed his queen back in time to defend f6 and g5 or offer a trade (after ... f6, ... ♕e8). And while 2 g5 f6! 3 gxh6 would get White's piece back, 3 ... g6! would close key lines thanks to the dead h-pawn. White would be worse. Another idea is 2 f5 and ♗xh6. But 2 ... ♔g8 3 ♗xh6 g6! would trap the queen (4 fxg6 fxg6+). White chose 2 ♘g1 so that his knight can emerge at f3. But after 2 ... f6 3 f5 ♕e8! a queen trade was coming. White was losing after 4 ♕xe8 ♖xe8 5 exf6 ♗xf6 and resigned after 6 g5 ♖xf5+ 7 ♘f3 ♗d8 8 gxh6 g5! 9 ♖g3 g4 10 ♖xg4 ♖xf3+ 11 ♔e2 ♖ef8. Reinforcement pieces don't nominate themselves. The defender may need to re- examine each of his pieces to find the right one. Black is taking aim at g3 and preparing to attack h2. Until White deals with that he can't safely harvest pawns on the queenside. For example, after 1 ♕xa7? ♕h5 Black has a powerful threat of 2 ... ♖h6 and 3 ... ♕xh2 mate. Another illustration of the force of her pieces is 1 f4 ♕xg3+! with perpetual check (2 hxg3 ♖xg3+ 3 ♔h1 ♖h3+). But White can defend his kingside if he realizes he has a rook doing nothing on the queenside. With 1 ♖a2! he anticipated 1 ... ♕f6 2 f3! ♘g5 3 f4, for example. He even has a threat, 2 f4! (since ... ♕xg3+ no longer works). Black freed her queen from defending the rook at d8 with 1 ... ♖f8 and that permitted her to meet 2 f4 with 2 ... ♕g4. The point is that 3 fxe5 allows 3 ... ♘xg3! (4 ♖g2? ♘e2+!). However, White secured his king's safety with 3 ♕e7 ♖g8 4 ♖g2!. Now g3 and h2 are rock solid and White is free to cash the queenside. After 4 ... ♘d3 5 ♕xa7 Black saw that sacrifices on g3 were doomed to fail. For example, 5 ... ♕h3 6 ♕a6! ♘xg3 7 ♕xd3! wins for White. The same for 6 ... ♘xc1 7 ♖xc1 ♘xg3 8 hxg3 ♖xg3 9 ♖xg3 ♕xg3+ 10 ♔f1 ♕xe3 11 ♘e2. Black had one remaining attacking idea, ... h5-h4xg3. But thanks to that rook at g2 White defended easily, 5 ... h5 6 ♕a6! ♘xc1 7 ♖xc1 h4 8 ♕e2!, and forced a trade of queens into a won endgame. Striking The defender often finds himself with a limited presence in the center. Advancing a pawn to the fourth rank is a way of (a) countering a wing attack, or (b) establishing a foothold for later counterplay. Botvinnik - Ragozin, training match 1936
1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 d6 6 ♗e2 a6 7 ♗e3 ♕c7 8 a4 b6 9 f4
♗b7 10 ♗f3 ♘bd7 11 ♕e2 ♗e7 12 O-O O-O 13 g4 Black faces 14 g5 and an attack on h7 after ♗g2/♖f3-h3/♕h5. He could have played 13 ... h6. But this violates the principle of economy and makes 14 h4/15 g5 stronger. Steinitz might have played 13 ... ♖fd8 so he could defend with ... ♘f8. But Black wanted counterplay with 13 ... d5! 14 e5 ♘e4! instead. Then 15 ♗xe4 dxe4 16 g5 enables Black to fight for the initiative after 16 ... ♖fd8 and ... ♖ac8/... ♗b4. White preferred 15 ♘xe4 dxe4 16 ♗g2. Even though Black may lose the pawn at e4 he has favorably changed the nature of the middlegame. Play went 16 ... ♗d5 17 ♖fc1 ♖ac8 - so that 18 ♕xa6 ♗c4 19 ♘b5 ♕c6 would threaten 20 ... ♖a8. White went after the e-pawn instead with 18 ♗f2 ♘c5 19 b4. Black unleashed his defensive power with 19 ... ♘d3! 20 cxd3 ♕xc1+ 21 ♖xc1 ♖xc1+. He would overwhelm White after 22 ♗e1 ♗h4 or, as the game went, with 22 ♗f1 ♖fc8 followed by ... ♖a1 and ... ♖cc1. Another example: Suttles - Fischer, Palma de Mallorca 1970

♕xd4 O-O 10 ♘c3 There are no Black kingside pieces to counter a plan such as h2-h4-h5xg6. Bringing in reinforcements (... ♘8d7-f6) would leave Black on the defensive for some time. The correct defense is 10 ... e5!. Black would have too much play after 11 dxe6 ♗xe6 and 12 ... ♘c6. So White let the new center stand with 11 ♕d2 f5! 12 ♘f3 ♘8d7 13 O-O-O ♕f6. Black had the better prospects following 14 ♕h6 ♕e7 15 ♖e1 e4! 16 ♘d2 ♘e5 17 h3 ♘bd7 and his superiority was obvious after 18 ♕e3 ♕h4 19 g3 ♕f6 20 ♔b1 ♘c5 21 f4? exf3 22 ♘xf3 f4! 23 gxf4 ♘xf3 24 ♕xf3 ♕h4. Escaping When reinforcements are not readily available to an endangered wing, it may make sense just to flee. In many cases you don't have to run far. Bernstein - Fischer, Montreal 1956
1 d4 ♘f6 2 ♘f3 g6 3 ♘c3 d5 4 ♗f4 ♗g7 5 e3 O-O 6 ♗e2 ♘h5 7 ♗g5 h6 8 ♗h4 g5 9

But after 18 dxe5 White threatens 19 ♖h1 followed by 20 ♖h8+! ♔xh8 21 ♕h7 mate. Easier seems 17 ... ♖f6 18 ♕xg5 fxe3 but White still has some play after 19 ♘xc6 bxc6 21 fxe3 followed by ♗g6/♕h5/g4-g5. Black opted for the simplest way out, 17 ... ♘xe5 18 dxe5 ♖f7 and 19 ♘b5 ♔f8!. Black seized the initiative after 20 ♘d6 ♖d7 21 ♗b5 ♖xd6 22 exd6 ♗d7 23 ♗xd7 ♕xd7. A more elaborate example of escape: Speelman - Luther, Lippstadt 2000 1 ♘f3 d5 2 c4 e6 3 d4 ♘f6 4 ♘c3 c6 5 e3 ♘bd7 6 ♕c2 ♗d6 7 ♗d3 O-O 8 O-O dxc4 9 ♗xc4 a6 10 ♗d3 c5 11 ♗d2 ♕c7 12 ♖ac1 c4 13 ♘e4 ♘xe4 14 ♗xe4 f5 15 ♗d3 b5 16 b3! ♗b7 17 bxc4 ♖f6 Black's last move prepares 18 ... ♖g6 and 18 ... ♗xf3 19 gxf3 ♗xh2+ (20 ♔g2 ♖g6+). What about reinforcements? The problem with 18 ♕d1 is that 18 ... ♖g6 already threatens 19 ... ♗xh2+ 20 ♘xh2? ♖xg2+. Rather than 18 cxb5 ♕b8 White preferred 18 ♖fe1!? because it creates an escape hatch for the king at f1. (The rook is better placed at e1 than d1 in case White gets to play 19 e4.) Black inflicted kingside damage, 18 ... ♗xf3 19 gxf3 ♖g6+ 20 ♔f1, and then played 20 ... ♗a3!, clearing a path for his queen to h2. Play continued 21 cxb5 ♕xh2. White would like to break the Black initiative with 22 ♕c7 and then 22 ... ♕h3+ 23 ♔e2 ♗xc1 24 ♖xc1 ♘f6 25 b6 and 26 b7. But Black has better in 22 ... ♗d6! 23 ♕xd7 ♖g2!. White's king is a fatal liability, e.g. 24 ♖e2 ♕h1 mate; 24 ♔e2 ♖xf2+ 25 ♔d1 ♖xd2 mate and 24 ♕xe6+ ♔h8 25 ♖c8+ ♗f8!. The right defense is escape: 22 ♔e2! since he can cover f2 with a rook or bishop (22 ... ♖g2 23 ♖f1). The game went 22 ... ♗xc1 23 ♖xc1 axb5 24 ♕c6 ♖a7? 25 ♗xf5! and wins (25 ... exf5 26 ♕d5+ and ♖c8+ or 25 ... ♖f6 26 ♗xe6+! ♔h8 27 ♕xd7!). And now let's see what you've learned about the weapons of defense. Quiz White can make progress with ♖af1. What can Black do? Should Black capture on h5, allow hxg6 or pick door number three? Should Black be worried about a sacrifice on h6? How does he best safeguard his king? White will have attacking chances if he can play ♖e3 and ♘h5. For example, 1 ... ♗a6 2 ♖e3 ♗xc4 and now 3 ♘h5 ♘xh5 leaves White with a choice between 4 ♕xh5 f5 5 ♗xg7! (or 5 ♖g3 g6 6 ♖xg6+) and 4 ♗xh7+! ♔xh7 5 ♕xh5+ ♔g8 6 ♗xg7! and wins. What can Black do instead? White's attack is based on h4-h5xg6 and ♖h4. Is 1 ... ♗g7 the best? White can try to penetrate on the h-file. But ♖g2, ♘f2 and g3-g4xf5 - or the immediate g3-g4 - are also attractive. What should Black do? Mikhail Tal could defend when he wanted to. Here he faces an ominous ♖h3. Does 1 ... g6 work? Is there anything better? White seems to have an edge in the center. What can Black do? Evaluate 1...fxg6 2 hxg6 h6 and 2...hxg6. Should Black just ignore the g6-pawn? Chapter Five: Counterplay "When you have Black, your goal is to equalize," masters used to say. "If you accomplish that, you can try for an advantage," they added. That was the credo of great players like Jose Capablanca, Akiba Rubinstein and Paul Keres. But they didn't play the Najdorf Sicilian. One of the problems with the Najdorf is that "it's useless to play for equality," as GM Yuri Razuvaev put it. That is, Black cannot reach an equal sign by trading a few minor pieces as Capablanca et al did when they defended a Queen's Gambit Declined or a 1 e4 e5 opening. Instead, Black must seek counterplay. That could also be said of many other sharp openings - the King's Indian, Pirc and Benoni Defenses, the Dragon and Sveshnikov Sicilian, and the Winawer Variation of the French Defense to name a few. In this position, which arose from a Najdorf, the only easy way to trade pieces, with 1 ... ♗c4, just hands White ♘f5!. Instead, Black chose the aggressive 1 ... ♘h5!? and ... ♘hf4, which seeks a kingside advantage. (Black doesn't fear ♘xe6 because after ... fxe6 the e6 pawn can't be attacked and it stops ♘d5.) White's reply, 2 ♘d5 ♗xd5 3 exd5, was logical. But after 3 ... ♘hf4 4 ♗f1 ♕d7 5 c4 h5! 6 ♖c1 ♗e5. Black's pieces were better coordinated than his. Black's impending ... g4 offers more than mere counterchances. Black can't stop that push but he can take precautions such as 7 ♕d2 and 7 ... g4 8 h4, to keep the h-file closed. Instead, he went into 7 ♔g1 g4! 8 fxg4 hxg4 9 ♕xg4? ♕xg4 10 hxg4, overlooking 10 ... ♘xd5! (11 cxd5 ♗h2+ 12 ♔h1 ♗f4+). Black had the edge after 11 ♗d3 ♗h2+ 12 ♔f1 ♗f4 13 ♖cd1 ♘f6 and won soon after 14 g3 ♗e5 15 ♗e2 ♘e4! 16 ♘f5 e6! 17 ♗f3 ♘xf2 18 ♖xd6!? ♘h1!. The First Line of Defense Traditional defense set the priorities this way: First, you make sure your king is safe. Second, you need to secure other potential targets. Third - and only then - you can begin looking for ways to make threats and exert pressure. Counterplay is appropriate when you're in trouble. It's the last line of defense. But according to New Defense it's the first line. An illustration comes when the Nimzo-Indian Defense, 1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 e6 3 ♘c3 ♗b4, is challenged by 4 a3 ♗xc3+ 5 bxc3. White accepts doubled c-pawns in return for freedom to expand in the center. Early efforts at defense tried to exploit the c-pawns - but only after Black was safely castled, e.g., 5 ... c5 6 e3 ♘c6 7 ♗d3 O-O 8 ♘e2 b6 9 e4! ♘e8 10 O-O d6. Black's ... ♘e8 is a prophylactic idea introduced by Capablanca in a similar position. Black retreats so that he can stop a powerful f2-f4-f5! by meeting 11 f4 with 11 ... f5. But in a 1948 game, White found a tactical flaw here: 11 e5! dxe5 12 dxe5 so that 12 ... ♘xe5?? 13 ♗xh7+ and ♕xd8 costs a queen. The strategic point is that the pawn at e5 prevents a Black knight from returning to defend at f6. For example, 12 ... ♗a6 13 ♗f4 ♘a5 goes after the c4-pawn. But White's attack is faster, 14 ♕c2 g6 15 ♗h6 and ♘g3. In the game, Black tried 12 ... ♗b7 13 ♗f4 f5 to contest the kingside. After 14 exf6 he didn't like the looks of 14 ... ♕xf6 15 ♕c2 or 14 ... ♘xf6 (although 15 ♗d6 ♖f7 is fairly harmless). He went in for 14 ... e5 and White won after 15 fxg7! ♖xf4 16 ♘xf4 exf4 17 ♗xh7+! ♔xh7 18 ♕h5+ ♔xg7 19 ♖ad1 ♕f6 20 ♖d7+. Or 19 ... ♕c7 20 ♕g4+ and ♖d7(+). Improvements were found, of course. Black can delay ... d6 in favor of 10 ... ♗a6 and win the c4-pawn after ... ♘d6. And that indicated what Black's real problem was: He was seeking counterplay too late. Today one of the best ways to handle this variation begins with 5 ... b6, rather than 5 ... c5, with quicker pressure against the c4-pawn. A main line runs 5 ... b6 6 f3 ♗a6 7 e4 ♘c6! 8 ♗d3 ♘a5. By not castling Black saves a tempo. But he also denies his opponent a more stationary target, a king at g8. True, he allows 9 e5. But experience has shown that 9 ... ♘g8 offers Black excellent chances. The c4-pawn cannot be defended for long. After 9 ♕e2 Black can play 9 ... d6 followed by ... ♕d7-a4 and, if necessary, ... c5 and ... ♖c8. It is virtually certain Black will achieve his goal - winning the pawn - and put the onus on White. The moral is simple: If you can generate threats, even in the opening, in a part of the board where your opponent is vulnerable, you may distract him from the area where you are weaker. Then his pressure never becomes an initiative. Or his initiative never becomes overwhelming. This is why today's players are willing to delay castling much longer than their predecessors: Granda Zuniga - Lenier Dominguez, Wijk aan Zee 2004
1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 ♘c3 ♘f6 4 ♘f3 e6 5 e3 ♘bd7 6 ♕c2 ♗d6 7 g4 dxc4 8 g5 ♘d5 9
♗xc4 b6 10 ♗d2 ♗b7 11 O-O-O A player of an older generation might have reacted to White's quick g-pawn push with the safety-minded 11 ... ♕c7 and ... O-O-O. But that is unnecessary because Black's king isn't a target yet. However, the White queen and king on the c-file were, after 11 ... ♖c8! and ... c5. White got his king off the file, 12 ♔b1. But 12 ... b5 13 ♗e2 ♘xc3+ was still good, as 14 ♗xc3? b4 15 ♗d2 c5! with an edge would have shown. White played the more accurate 14 ♕xc3 b4 15 ♕d3. But Black would have excellent compensation after 15 ... c5 16 dxc5 ♘xc5 and then 17 ♕b5+ ♗c6 18 ♕xb4 ♘e4 19 ♕d4 O-O. For example, 20 ♗e1 ♕c7 and ... ♗d5, threatening ... ♕c2+, or ... ♖fd8. (Note that the check at move 17 was the only drawback to Black's delay in castling.) Instead of 16 dxc5, White went for 16 b3. Only now did Black play 16 ... O-O. His queenside initiative was well ahead of whatever White had hoped to do on the other wing. Black was headed to victory after 17 ♖hg1 ♕b6 18 ♗c1 ♗d5! 19 e4 c4!. The different attitude of New Defense is reflected in openings with quiet reputations, such as the Caro-Kann Defense. Masters used to assume that Black would have to deal cautiously with pressure until he can equalize. Today Black thinks differently:
1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 ♘c3 dxe4 4 ♘xe4 ♘d7 5 ♗c4 ♘gf6 6 ♘g5 e6 7 ♕e2 ♘b6 8 ♗d3
h6 9 ♘5f3 c5 10 dxc5 ♗xc5 11 ♗d2 O-O 12 O-O-O White has two aggressive ideas: He can centralize one knight, ♘e5, reinforce it with ♘gf3, and then push his protected g-pawn to g5. Or he can go for an open kingside with a quicker g2-g4!. For example, 12 ... ♘bd7 discourages 13 ♘e5 but invites 13 ♘h3 and 14 g4, e.g. 13 ... a6 14 g4! ♘xg4 15 ♖hg1 with a strong attack. After Black lost several times in this variation, annotators blamed the passive Caro-Kann. But the timid 12 ... ♘bd7 was the culprit. The right idea is 12 ... ♘a4!. White's king can be as vulnerable as Black's, e.g. 13 ♘e5? ♕b6! 14 b3? ♗a3+ 15 ♔b1 ♘d5!, threatening a 'family check' on c3. White does better with 13 ♗b5. But retreating the attacked knight is out of the question. Black's best is 13 ... ♗d7, e.g. 14 ♗xd7 ♕xd7! and now the discovered attack on the queen, 15 ♗xh6, allows 15 ... ♕c7 and 16 ... ♕b6. The same goes for 14 ♗xa4 ♗xa4 15 ♗xh6, when Black has compensation after 15 ... ♕b6. Other-Wing Counterplay The defender typically launches action on 'his' wing, the queenside for Black in these last examples. But New Defense also explores counter-intuitive counterplay. White's kingside attack is well ahead of Black's queenside effort and he would have the edge after hxg6. Then ... fxg6 would allow ♗xe5 followed by f6-f7+ while ... hxg6 and ... ♘xg6 invite a heavy piece invasion of the h-file. Black's 1 ... gxh5! was stunning but logical. The only real targets he had to attack were White pawns, at h5, g5 and e4, and this exploits them (2 ♕xh5? ♗xe4). Still, 1 ... gxh5! looked risky. Can Black last long after 2 ♗g2 protects the e-pawn and prepares 3 ♕xh5 and 4 ♖h1 ? The answer came from 2 ... ♘g4!, which threatened ... ♖xg5. Play continued 3 ♕d2 ♕a5 and White set a trap with 4 ♖h1. If 4 ... ♖xg5?, White can cut communication of the heavy pieces with 5 e5! and threaten both 6 ♕xg5+ and 6 ♗xb7. But Black had another surprise, 4 ... h6! so that 5 gxh6 ♗xh6 or 5 ♖xh5 ♖xg5 favors him. White gambled on 5 e5 dxe5 6 ♗b6 instead. But Black's two extra minor pieces were better than White's extra rook after 6 ... ♖xb6 7 ♘xb6 ♕xb6 8 ♖xh5 ♗xg2 9 ♕xg2 ♘e3! 10 ♕g1 ♘d5!. Counterplay = Threats For counterplay to go beyond mere 'clutching' it has to generate threats. This may require ingenuity. White is a pawn ahead and his knights have pawn-protected outposts at e4 and c5 that make them at least as good as Black's bishops. It is easy to visualize White improving his position with ♘bc5 followed by ♕a6 or ♖d1-d6. Or he can play ♖a1 followed by ♘bc5 and ♖a6 or ♖a7. His winning chances would be excellent. Black kick-started his counterplay with a major decision, 1 ... ♗xe4!. His first point was tactical, 2 ♕xe4? ♕a2+ loses a knight. His second point was strategic: after 2 fxe4 there were potential targets at e4 and c3. Clutching followed: 2 ... ♕a3 3 ♕c2 ♕a6 4 ♘c5 ♕c4 5 ♕d3. With 5 ... ♕g8! Black began to go beyond harassment. He prepared ... ♖d8 and could refute 6 ♖d1? with 6 ... ♕a2+! (7 ♔g1 ♕h2+). At first it appears 6 ♕d7 ♖d8 7 ♕xc6 is winning. But 7 ... ♕c4 would get messy. Safer is 6 ♖f2 (to guard against ... ♖d8-d2+). White would remain in control after 6 ... ♖d8 7 ♕a6 ♗e3 8 ♖e2. However, he opted for 6 ♕d7 ♖d8 7 ♕e6? because it seems to shut out the Black queen. But this failed after 7 ... ♖d2+ 8 ♖f2 ♕d8!. It was a good time to head towards a draw with 9 ♖xd2 ♕xd2+ 10 ♔f1 ♕d1+ and a perpetual check. But White didn't appreciate how much counterplay had developed and he allowed 9 ♘b3? ♖d3!. In the face of a killing 10 ... ♖g3+ White tried 10 ♖f3 ♖xf3 11 ♔xf3. But Black picked off three pawns - all with check (11 ... ♕d3+ 12 ♔f2 ♕e3+! 13 ♔f1 ♕f3+ 14 ♔e1 ♕xc3+ etc.) - and won. Counterplay vs. Material Defending a difficult position often seems like taking a school test with a long list of questions about material: Is it worth grabbing a pawn when you know it hands your opponent an initiative? Is it better to make prophylactic moves before seeking a material edge? We'll get to those questions in later chapters. But here's another: Is it better to have counterplay or an extra pawn? Anatoly Karpov gave his answer three times in this game: Kamsky - Karpov, Elista 1996
1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 ♘d2 dxe4 4 ♘xe4 ♘d7 5 ♘g5 ♘gf6 6 ♗d3 e6 7 ♘1f3 ♗d6 8 ♕e2
h6 9 ♘e4 ♘xe4 10 ♕xe4 ♘f6 11 ♕e2 ♕c7 12 ♗d2 b6 13 O-O-O ♗b7 14 ♖he1 O-O 15 g4!? First, he rejected 15 ... ♘xg4? because 16 ♖g1 is too dangerous (16 ... ♘f6 17 ♗xh6). Instead, he used one of the basic weapons we examined in Chapter Four, a strike in the center, 15 ... c5!. Then came 16 g5 hxg5. By getting his b7-bishop into the game Black could punish 17 ♗xg5? with 17 ... ♗f4+! 18 ♔b1? ♗xf3! or 18 ♗xf4 ♕xf4+ (19 ♔b1 ♗xf3 or 19 ♘d2 cxd4). White's 17 ♘xg5 posed a second question for Black. Should he grab another pawn, 17 ... ♗xh2 ? No, he decided. Opening the other half of the h-file was foolhardy when he could limit the coordination of White pieces with 17 ... ♗f4! instead. White posed a third question with 18 h4 and Black went into "a long think," as he put it. Black can take the pawn at d4, perhaps reinforcing it later with a trade of bishops and ... e5. "But the d-file would be closed and the White king would be secure," Karpov said. The White bishop at d3 would be immune to ... c4 and "I would have little counterplay and be on the defensive for quite a while," he added. He preferred 18 ... ♖ad8! to get his rook to the fine d4 square. Then his pieces would be well-coordinated and ... c4 would be in the air. Play went 19 dxc5 bxc5. Black's queen rook would make itself felt after 20 ♖g1 c4! 21 ♗xc4 ♖xd2! 22 ♖xd2 ♗xd2+ (23 ♕xd2 ♕xc4 or 23 ♔xd2 ♕f4+). White avoided that with 20 ♗e3 but then came 20 ... ♖d4!. Black is in better shape for material grabbing than before, thanks to his counterplay, e.g. 21 h5 ♗xe3+ 22 fxe3 ♖h4 followed by ... ♖xh5 or ... c4. White got better mileage out of 21 ♖g1! and then 21 ... ♗xe3+ 22 fxe3 (not 22 ♕xe3 ♕f4!) ♖xh4 23 ♖df1 because of his prospects for ♖xf6. Black organized his pieces well, 23 ... ♕e5 24 ♕f2 ♖h6!. But White was still able to obtain enough play, 25 ♖g3 ♗e4 26 ♖fg1! g6 (26 ... ♗xd3? 27 ♘f3! and ♖xg7+) 27 ♖f1 ♔g7 28 ♕xf6+! ♕xf6 29 ♖xf6 ♗xd3 30 ♖xf7+ to reach a salvageable ending. Sacrifice for Counterplay There's a related puzzle for defenders to solve: If counterplay can be better than pawn-grabbing, what about giving up a pawn to seize the initiative from an attacker? This question taxed 19th century defenders. White had steadily increased the pressure on the c6-pawn during the middlegame and would have continued to do so after 1 ... ♕e8 2 ♖a1 followed by ♖a6-b6. But Black looked for a target and naturally saw b4. He played 1 ... ♖cb7! and then 2 ♖b1 ♖d7!. It was a tacit offer of a pawn - or of a draw by repetition (3 ♖bd1 ♖db7!). White accepted the pawn, 3 ♖xc6, and Black seized the d-file with 3 ... ♖bd8. In the tournament book, Siegbert Tarrasch seemed shocked in the change. Black's position had not been this good "in the entire game," he wrote. When White prepared to push the c-pawn with 4 ♖b6 Black got to make threats, 4 ... f5 5 ♗f3 ♖d4 6 ♕a6 ♕h4! (rather than 6 ... ♖xf4? 7 ♖b7 ♖d7 8 c6!). Black's heavy pieces are active: Now 7 ♖b7+ ♔g8 8 c6? would have been met by 8 ... ♕xf4 9 c7 ♕e3+ 10 ♔f1 ♖d2 11 ♗e2 ♖c8 and Black holds (or 10 ♔h1? ♖d1+!). White did better with 7 g3 ♕f6 8 ♕e2. But 8 ... ♖d3! prepared a strong queen check on d4. Play went 9 c6 ♕d4+ 10 ♔h1 ♖e3 11 ♕f1 ♕c3. Now 12 ♖c1 would fail to 12 ... ♖xf3 13 ♖xc3 ♖xf1+ 14 ♔g2 ♖fd1!. A key point is that 15 c7 ♖8d2+ 16 ♔h3? ♖h1! walks into a mating net. So the Black rooks took over the seventh rank, 12 ♗g2 ♖d2 13 c7 ♖c2! 14 ♖d1 ♖3e2 15 ♕f3 ♖xg2! 16 ♕xc3 ♖xh2+ and drew by perpetual check. Tarrasch added that the turn of events after 3 ... ♖bd8 "is quite a common occurrence." It happens when a player converts positional pressure into a material edge, he said. "A crisis arises in which the strategically lost player obtains the opportunity for counterattack." Tarrasch hinted that a "strategically lost player" didn't deserve this reversal of fortune. But it makes sense: In the first diagram Black's pieces were passively tied to the defense of the c6-pawn. Once freed from that duty, they came into their own. Here's how this works in a modern opening, the Dragon Sicilian. Black had fared badly when this position arose in previous games because he tried to defend the backward pawn at d6. After 1 ... ♖c6 2 ♘a5 ♖b6 3 ♘c4 he is only helping White. But in this game he just ignored the threat, 1 ... ♖ec8! 2 ♕xd6 ♗e6. Black's rooks and bishop were then ready to make threats of their own. And after 3 c3 b5: White no longer has a target at d6. Instead, he faces the prospect of ... a5-a4 or ... b4. Play went 4 ♕d2 a5 and now 5 ♘xa5 ♖a4 6 ♘b3 ♖8a8 7 ♘c1 ♗xa2+ would be fine for Black. But he also had compensation in the game after 5 ♕g5 ♕xg5 6 hxg5 a4. He sailed into a draw after 7 ♘d2 ♖4c7 8 a3 ♖d7 9 ♔c1 f6 10 gxf6+ ♔xf6 11 ♘f1 ♖xd1+ 12 ♔xf1 ♖d8+ and ... ♔g5. The initiative-stealing sacrifice is another version of changing the nature of the struggle. An opponent who wins a weak pawn may feel that he is winning the game. That often lures him into carelessness: Both players have pawns to attack, at d7 and e5. But Black is behind in development and that would cost him after 1 ... ♘xe5? 2 ♘xe5 ♗xe5 3 ♗xe5 ♕xe5? 4 ♘d6+ and White wins. If he tries to protect d7 with 1 ... ♕a7 and ... ♖d8 - so that he can castle without hanging the d-pawn - White would get an edge from 2 c4! bxc4 3 ♕xc4 ♖d8 and then 4 h4! ♘c6 5 ♘c5. Black would love to play the blocking 1 ... ♘d5 but 2 ♖xd5! is dangerous (2 ... exd5 3 ♘d6+ ♗xd6 4 exd6+ ♔f8 5 ♘h4! ♘xh4 6 ♗xh4 with strong compensation and a much easier position for White to play than Black). Black solved his problem with 1 ... O-O!, abandoning the d-pawn. After White grabbed it, 2 ♖xd7, he brought his knight to an outpost, 2 ... ♘d5. White has no obvious goal now that the d-pawn is gone. Moreover, his e-pawn is threatened and his rook, now behind enemy lines, may be embarrassed by ... ♕c8. White chose the natural 3 ♘d6. It rules out ... ♕c8 and ... ♘xe5. It also prepares an attack on f7 using the rook and both knights. White had a positional edge previously so the attack seems to make sense. But after 3 ... ♘b6! White had to sacrifice, 4 ♖xf7 ♖xf7 5 ♘xf7 ♔xf7. Even though chances were roughly equal after 6 ♘g5+ ♔g8! (6 ... ♔e7 7 ♕g4) 7 ♘xe6 ♕c8 and 8 ♕g4 ♖a7!, White was soon outplayed and lost, 9 ♖d1 ♘a4! 10 h3 ♘xb2 11 ♖d5 ♗b6 12 ♖d6 ♘c4. Three becomes Two We usually think of counterplay as a feature of middlegames. But changing a trend at the cost of material can also alter the likely outcomes of an early endgame. Once again this has a psychological benefit. Black threatens 1 ... ♖xa2+ and there is no good way to defend the pawn (1 ♔b2 ♖b8+ 2 ♔a1?? ♘b3+). Of course, losing the a-pawn would simply make material equal. But with the only passed pawn and more active pieces than White's, Black would have reasonable winning chances. "All three outcomes are possible," grandmasters say - meaning a win, a loss or a draw. White changed that with 1 ♖xa5! ♖xa5 2 ♗xc4. Then he had two pawns and a strong bishop for a rook. With his king to shepherd the a-pawn and a potentially passed d-pawn, his winning chances had risen and his losing chances had dropped. Two outcomes - a White win or a draw - were much more likely. Black appreciated that and played 2 ... h5 3 h4 ♖c8! 4 ♔d3. Now on 4 ... ♖a3+ 5 ♗b3 White would have excellent winning chances once he creates a passed d-pawn (6 e4 and 7 d5). Black defended with 4 ... ♖xc4! 5 ♔xc4 ♖xa2. White now had an extra pawn in a rook endgame. But there was no passed pawn and Black's rook was very active. The most likely outcome, by far, was a draw. After 25 more moves that was the result. We saw a related phenomenon when we considered Lasker's aggressive approach in Chapter Three. He sought to turn a position with two likely results - a loss and a draw - into one with three outcomes. Typically, this requires the defender to choose the best practical move over the objectively best move. A pawn down and facing two bishops, Black's best drawing chance lies in trading pawns. After 1 ... cxd4! 2 ♕xd4 ♘c5 White is a long way from making progress. Better is 2 exd4 but the d-pawn will be held in check by ... ♘f6 followed by ... ♖d8. But Black chose the objectively inferior 1 ... c4!? because it creates a passed pawn and potential winning chances. It also poses some difficult choices for White. After the game he concluded that he should have played 2 ♕e4 ♘f6 3 ♕c2 followed by pushing his e-pawn. But psychologically it is very hard, in such an apparently favorable position, to retreat like that instead of taking a second pawn with 2 ♗xh7+? ♔xh7 3 ♕e4+ ♔g8 4 ♕xe7. But Black's passed pawn grew in power after 4 ... c3!. For example, 5 a4 c2 6 ♗a3 would be met by 6 ... ♖b8 followed by ... ♖b1 or ... ♕c6 and ... ♕xa4. White tried instead to push his center pawns, 5 e4 c2! 6 d5 but they were less threatening than the c-pawn after 6 ... ♖b8, Play went 7 g3 ♕c8 8 ♕g5 ♕c4 9 f3 ♖b3 with the idea of ... ♕d4+ and ... ♘e5. White couldn't adjust to the idea that he might lose. He played 10 ♕d2? ♖d3 11 ♕e2 ♘e5 12 ♔g2 ♖d1! and lost after 13 ♕xc4 ♘xc4 14 d6 ♔f8 15 a4 ♔e8 16 ♔f2 ♘d2! 17 ♖e1 ♘xf3!. Is active always better than solid? No, some players will feel more comfortable and have better results with moves like 1 ... cxd4. And in some positions, solid will outscore active nine times out of ten. But you should still be looking for counterplay as your first line of defense. Quiz What should Black be thinking? Where does Black's best chance for counterplay lie? White threatens to win a pawn with 1 gxh6. After 1 ... hxg5 2 ♕xg5 the impending 3 h6 retains his winning chances. What can Black do? Chapter Six: Risk Management Risk is bad, according to traditional defense. It should be reduced to the minimum. Of course, this point of view recognized that risk couldn't be eliminated entirely. But a position with a 20 percent chance of losing was considered good - even though there might only be a 20 percent of winning. That situation was preferable, according to the conventional wisdom, to a highly double-edged position with a 40 percent chance of losing - even if there is a 50 percent chance of winning. This, too, has changed. Today's masters are more willing to take an acceptable risk. What is acceptable? Defining that has become as important as identifying risk itself.

But he knew that if he survived, his extra material would win easily. Should he calculate 19 ... ♗xa1 as far as he can see? Or is it better to look for mating chances against White? Should he investigate 19 ... ♘f6, instead? And what about offering a trade of queens with 19 ... ♕d4 ? Pragmatism is a good guide here. Black realized that the simple and solid 19 ... ♕c6 made sense. After 20 ♕xc6 bxc6 his risk of losing would be tiny - and his winning chances would be much greater than if he damaged his pawn with 19 ... ♕a6+ 20 ♕xa6 bxa6. He also had to evaluate his chances if White avoided the endgame, (19 ... ♕c6) 20 ♕a3+ ♔d7 or 20 ♗a3+ ♔d7 21 ♕f4 ♘f6. Of course, he might lose due to a blunder in a complex position then. But his winning chances would be much greater than his losing chances. In the end Black chose 19 ... ♕c6 and won the endgame after 20 ♕xc6 bxc6 21 ♖b1 ♔d6 22 ♗a3+ c5. He had found an acceptable - and successful - degree of risk. Comfort Zone Every defender wants to find his or her comfort zone. But what may seem safe to one player may not feel safe to another. There are many positions that are objectively safe because that's what a superior player - or a computer - says. But they may not be acceptable to you. With h4-h5 and ♘f6+ coming up Black took the common-sense precaution 1 ... ♔f8. We'll consider moves like that - what we call prophylactic - in more detail in Chapter Eight. For the time being, let's consider Black's comfort zone. He later found that a computer recommended 1 ... ♘xe5 and 2 ♘f6+ ♔h8. For example, 3 ♖xe5 can be met by 3 ... ♗xf3. And 3 ♘xe5 could lead to 3 ... gxf6 4 ♗xf5 exf5 and 5 ... fxe5. "But of course I wouldn't dream of this," Black added. Few humans would. The risk is outside their comfort zone. There are many positions on which humans disagree about what is acceptable risk. Morozevich - Gelfand, Biel 2009

A previous grandmaster game went 12 ♕xd5 ♕b6! and 13 ♖e2 ♘f6 14 ♕b3 ♕a6 15 ♘c3 ♗e6 16 ♕a4. White eventually won - but perhaps not because the gambit was unsound. In this game White considered 12 ♕xd5 only briefly because it seemed to him that Black had plenty of compensation. That doesn't mean that Black would be better after 12 ♕xd5. White just felt that his opponent would have enough play to make his life unpleasant for several moves. It's clear in the diagram that Black is going to gain time with ... ♕b6 no matter what White does. He looked at 12 ♕d3 and realized it would give him a small edge, in view of the isolated d5-pawn, but with very little risk. White was the one making threats after 12 ... ♕b6 13 ♖e2 ♘f6 14 ♘c3 ♗g4 15 ♘a4 ♕c6, as the game went, and eventually won the ending after 16 ♘xc5 ♕xc5 17 ♗e3 ♕c4 18 ♖d2 ♕xd3 19 ♖xd3. Tal's Credo Mikhail Tal helped overthrow the traditional view of risk. "A chess player sacrifices a piece for attack," he wrote in a celebrated article. "Does he risk? Of course, because the attack could be repelled." Then Tal asked a second question: What about his opponent? "A chess player accepts the sacrifice (even though he could decline), hoping to repel the attack. Does he risk? Of course, because the attack can be irresistible." "Whose risk is greater? There's no device that can measure that clearly," Tal concluded. Let's see how two great modern players evaluate risk: Anand - Ivanchuk, Belgrade 1997
1 e4 e5 2 ♘f3 ♘c6 3 ♗b5 a6 4 ♗a4 ♘f6 5 O-O b5 6 ♗b3 ♗b7 7 ♖e1 ♗c5 8 c3 O-O 9
d4 ♗b6 10 ♗e3 cxd4 11 exd4 ♘a5 12 ♗g5 ♘xb3 13 axb3 h6 14 ♗h4 g5 Black's last move met the threat of 15 e5. Was it risky? To properly answer that you have to measure it against a safer-looking alternative. But is 14 ... d6 really safer? It doesn't appear so in view of 15 ♘bd2 followed by ♕c2 and the renewed threat of e4-e5. To judge 15 ♘xg5 correctly we have to examine the alternative, 15 ♗g3 and the natural response 15 ... ♘xe4!. And when we can't find compensation for White's lost pawn then, we should look for compensation instead after the piece sacrifice, 15 ♘xg5 hxg5 16 ♗xg5. The threat of 17 e5 offers plenty of 'comp,' as 16 ... d6 17 ♖e3 ♖e8 18 ♖f3 indicates. This explains why White chose 15 ♘xg5! - and Black replied 15 ... ♘xe4!. A quick look indicates 16 ♖xe4? ♗xe4 is unsound, e.g. 17 ♕h5 hxg5 18 ♗xg5 f6 or 18 ... ♗g6. So he had to content himself with 16 ♘xe4 ♕xh4 17 ♘bc3. Material is still equal. The most striking features of the position are Black's two bishops and ruptured kingside. Can he afford to take a new risk, say with 17 ... b4 ? After a brief examination of 18 g3! Black backed off (18 ... ♕h3 19 ♘f6+ ♔- moves 20 ♘cd5 or 18 ... ♕d8 19 ♕g4+ ♔h8 20 ♕h5 or 19 ... ♔h7 20 ♕f5+ with a strong attack). Instead he opted for the safety of 17 ... ♔h8. His bishops and play along the g- file were enough to grant him equal chances after 18 ♘c5 ♗c6 19 g3 ♖g8 20 ♖e5! ♖g4! 21 ♘5e4 ♖ag8. A draw was reached at move 32. A variation on that theme is this position:
1 e4 e6 3 d4 d5 3 ♘c3 dxe4 4 ♘xe4 ♘d7 5 ♘f3 ♘gf6 6 ♗d3 c5 7 ♘xf6+ ♘xf6 8
dxc5 ♗xc5 9 ♕e2 O-O 10 ♗g5 h6 11 h4 ♕a5+ 12 ♗d2 ♕b6 Black rejected one sacrifice, 11 ... hxg5? 12 hxg5 because if the attacked knight moves, White has at least a perpetual check and likely more. In the diagram, the natural 13 ♘e5 invites 13 ... ♕xb2 14 O-O followed perhaps by ♘c4/♗c3. But it is refuted by 13 ... ♗xf2+! 14 ♕xf2 ♕xb2 and Black will be at least one safe pawn ahead. The most appealing alternative is 13 O-O-O. Some computers regard 13 ... ♗xf2 (or 13 ... ♘g4 first) as safe for Black. But GM Alexander Morozevich gave 13 O-O-O a question mark because it allows a strong sacrifice by Black, 13 ... e5!. For example, 14 ♘xe5 ♖e8 15 ♘c4 ♕a6! is fine for Black, as is 14 ♕xe5 ♘g4. White's best in the diagram may be 13 O-O after which 13 ... e5! (14 ♘xe5 ♖e8 15 ♘c4 ♕d8 16 ♕f3 ♗g4 17 ♕xb7 ♖b8) offers compensation. Change of Mind The New Defender takes more risks than his predecessors. But unless he burns his bridges, he can change his mind about how much risk he accepts: Topalov - Kramnik, Novgorod 1997
1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 ♘c6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 d6 6 ♗c4 ♕b6 7 ♘xc6 bxc6 8 O-O
g6 9 e5 dxe5 10 ♕e2 ♕d4 11 ♗e3 ♕d6 12 ♖ad1 ♕c7 13 f4 ♗g4 14 ♕f2 If Black wanted to defend the e-pawn with ... ♕c7 why didn't he do it at the 10th move? Because he wanted to lure White into the tempo-gaining ♖ad1, which allows ... ♗g4 after 13 f4. But in the diagram Black had second thoughts. He looked at 14 ... ♗xd1 and didn't feel comfortable with what he'd face after 15 fxe5! ♕xe5 16 ♗d4. It wasn't too late. He took the cautious way out with 14 ... e4!, limiting the number of open lines. White had nothing better than to try to regain his lost pawn with 15 ♖de1 and Black replied 15 ... ♗f5! 16 h3 h5. White had to swap down to regain his pawn, 17 ♗d4 ♗g7 18 b3 O-O 19 ♗xf6 ♗xf6 20 ♘xe4. After 20 ... ♗xe4! 21 ♖xe4 ♕b6 he accepted Black's draw offer in view of the coming bishops-of-opposite-color ending. As Tal pointed out, the psychology of sacrifice cuts two ways. Yes, taking material forces you to defend. But it also forces your opponent to prove he has compensation. Who, then, is under greater pressure?
1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 ♘c6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 d6 6 g3 ♘xd4 7 ♕xd4 g6 8 ♗b5+
♗d7 9 ♗xd7+ ♕xd7 10 ♗g5 ♗g7 11 ♘d5 White threatens to win a pawn with captures on f6. When this position first occurred, Black either got insufficient compensation for a lost pawn after 11 ... O-O? 12 ♘xf6+ or a poor game positionally after 11 ... e5. So attention turned to 11 ... ♘h5. Now it's White's turn to consider a gambit. The riskless 12 ♕b4 leads to nothing after 12 ... e6!. But if the queen retreats to d3 or d2 instead of b4, can Black safely take on b2? The answer is yes. After 12 ♕d3 ♗xb2! 13 ♖b1 ♗f6 Black prompts a trade of pieces. True, he will face pressure after 14 ♗xf6 ♘xf6 15 ♕d4 or 15 ♕c3. But the onus will be on White to prove he has a pawn's worth of play. In one GM game, 15 ♕c3, which threatens ♘c7+ as well as ♘xf6+, was answered by 15 ... ♖c8! (not 15 ... O-O?? 16 ♕xf6! exf6 17 ♘xf6+ and ♘xd7). Then 16 ♘xf6+ gxf6 17 ♕xf6 regains the pawn. But White has weak pawns that would cost him the initiative, after 17 ... O-O 18 ♕b2 b6 19 O-O ♕c6, for example. White went for 16 ♕xf6 and 16 ... exf6 17 ♘xf6+ ♔e7 18 ♘xd7. But the position became drawish after 18 ... ♖xc2 19 O-O ♔xd7 20 ♖xb7+ ♖c7. Another game went 15 ♕d4 (instead of 15 ♕c3). Black could afford 15 ... b6 and then 16 O-O ♕d8 17 ♖b3 O-O 18 ♘xf6+ gxf6. Black couldn't keep his pawn but after 19 ♖f3 ♖c8 20 ♖xf6 ♖xc2 21 ♖xd6 ♕c8 chances were roughly equal. Black eventually won. In these cases, grabbing a pawn led to a temporary White initiative that quickly turned sour. But Tal's credo raises another question: Is there a cost of not grabbing? When Refusing is Risky Traditional defense warned against a pawn grab that would open files or diagonals leading to your king. That is sound as far as it goes. But that's not far enough. It doesn't take into account the possibility that those lines are going to be forced open, whether you like it or not.
1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 ♘c3 dxe4 4 ♘xe4 ♗f5 5 ♘g3 ♗g6 6 h4 h6 7 ♘f3 ♘d7 8 h5 ♗h7 9
♗d3 ♗xd3 10 ♕xd3 e6 11 ♗f4 ♘gf6 12 O-O-O ♗e7 13 ♘e4 O-O Here 14 g4 has been tried. White plans 15 ♘xf6+ ♘xf6 16 g5! or 15 ... ♗xf6 16 ♖dg1 and 17 g5!. In either case at least half of the g-file is opened and White enjoys good attacking chances. But 14 g4? fell out of favor when it was found that 14 ... ♘xg4! is safe in view of 15 ♖dg1 f5!. For example, 16 ♕b3 ♖f7! 17 ♘d6 ♗xd6 18 ♗xd6 and now 18 ... ♘b6 19 ♕xe6 ♕d7 reaches a nice endgame (20 ♕xd7 ♖xd7 21 ♗g3 ♖e8). In this case, grabbing was safer than ignoring the g-pawn. But suppose White improves with the immediate 14 ♘xf6+! ♘xf6 and only then 15 g4: Once again Black has to evaluate the risk of grabbing - and the risk of not grabbing. Experience has shown that 15 ... ♕a5 is well met by 16 g5! hxg5 17 ♗xg5. White would have a solid attack after 18 ♖dg1 or 18 h6 - even if Black decides to take a pawn on the other wing, 17 ... ♕xa2. Here again the lesser risk comes from 15 ... ♘xg4!. Then on 16 ♖hg1! Black should avoid 16 ... ♘xf2 17 ♕d2! ♘xd1 18 ♗xh6 (18 ... ♗f6 19 ♗xg7 ♗xg7 20 ♕h6). Safety comes from 16 ... f5!. For example, 17 ♕e2 ♔h7 18 ♕xe6 ♕d5 19 ♕xe7 ♕xf3 with equal chances. A defender's best policy may turn out to be a slight sacrifice of his own: Black's last move was ... ♗h3. A bishop trade would: (a) Eliminate White's pressure against his best target, the pawn at b7, (b) Limit White's control of key light squares such as d5 and e4 and allow Black to open the center with ... ♘f6 and ... d5, and (c) Enable Black to mount a kingside attack, such as with ... ♘f6 followed by ... ♕g4-h5, ... ♘g4 and ... ♖af8. White's kingside is vulnerable because its best defensive piece was the now-missing bishop. White appreciated these factors when he played 1 ♗xb7 and 1 ... ♗xf1 2 ♖xf1. This is technically a sacrifice, the Exchange for a pawn. But for a master, it's a no- risk no-brainer. Of course, 1 ♗xb7! is good. A rule of thumb holds that you can't mate a fianchetto king position if you lack a bishop of the same color as the fianchettoed one. After 2 ... ♘f6 3 ♘c3 Black didn't even try with 3 ... ♕h3. Following 4 ♗g2 and h2-h3/♘e4 White would have more than enough protection. Tal's question returns once more. Who has taken a risk? Black's losing chances have soared because of the impending collapse of his queenside after ♗g2/♘c6. On the other hand, his winning chances have risen only slightly. He tried for attack with 3 ... ♔h8 4 ♘e4 ♘g4. But White comfortably created a light-square fortress with 5 ♗d5 ♖f5 6 h3 ♘h6 7 ♔g2 ♖df8 8 f3!. Black's rooks would just become vulnerable after, say, 8 ... ♖h5 9 g4 ♖h4 10 ♕g5! ♕d8 11 ♕xd8 ♖xd8 12 ♔g3!. After 9 g4 he tried 9 ... ♖xh3?! 10 ♔xh3 ♖xf3+ 11 ♖xf3 ♕xg4+ 12 ♔h2 ♕xf3 and should have lost after 13 ♗e6! ♘f5 14 ♗xf5 gxf5 15 ♘g3. Against a good attacker, it will take more than one good decision to navigate the middlegame safely. You may have to evaluate risk at several points. That's what Black faced in this example: Shirov - Timman, Carlsbad 2008
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 e6 3 ♘f3 b6 4 g3 ♗a6 5 ♕c2 ♗b7 6 ♗g2 c5 7 d5!? exd5 8 cxd5 ♘xd5
9 O-O ♗e7 10 ♖d1 ♕c8 11 ♗g5 h6
White's gambit came into fashion when it was appreciated that Black can equalize easily after 7 O-O cxd4 8 ♘xd4 ♗xg2. In the diagram White would get some compensation from 12 ♗xe7 ♘xe7 13 e4 followed by ♘c3, ♖d2 and doubling rooks on the d-file. But he opted for the more ambitious 12 ♖xd5. The first point is that 12 ... ♗xd5 13 ♗xe7 ♔xe7 14 ♘c3 would leave Black behind in development and with an insecure king for several moves. Black opted for 12 ... hxg5! instead. He would have a much easier game to play after 13 ♖d2 d5 and still be ahead material. White renewed the offer with 13 ♘c3!. Black realized that defending would be difficult if he had to give up his light-squared bishop for the d5-knight. Play went 13 ... ♘c6 14 ♖ad1 ♘b4 15 ♕e4. Here 15 ... ♘xd5 16 ♘xd5 would virtually force 16 ... ♗xd5 17 ♕xd5 and give White a promising position (17 ... ♕c6 18 ♘e5 ♕xd5 19 ♗xd5). However, White can't withdraw the Exchange offer. Black minimized his risk before taking on d5, with 15 ... ♔f8! and prepared ... ♗f6xc3. Since ... hxg5 was played he didn't need to castle to develop his h8-rook. White tried 16 ♘e5 and Black replied 16 ... ♘xd5 17 ♘xd5 ♗f6. White would still have had compensation after, say, 18 ♕f5, but his pressure was slowly eliminated after 18 ♘c4 ♕c6 19 ♕g4 ♖d8! 20 ♘de3 d5! (21 ♖xd5 ♕c8; 21 ♘xd5 ♕d7) and he lost. Risk-Taking After You've Equalized When you're playing the Black pieces and have gotten through the middlegame unscathed, the position may seem destined to end in a draw. If you want more than a half point, you're going to face a new question: How much risk can you accept to play for win? White's initiative was over and he played 1 ♗xc6. Black could take stock: The natural 1 ... ♕xc6 would give White a very slight edge. Barring a blunder, the most likely result is a draw. If you have to put it in numbers, it might be: an 80 percent of a draw, 12 percent of a White win, 8 percent of a Black win. But the only alternative is 1 ... bxc6!?. Then the c-pawn is a potential target. But so is the b2-pawn. And since White is almost certain to protect his pawn with 2 b3, Black could play 2 ... ♖ed8 and try to make something of his control of the board's only open file. For example, 3 ♖ad1 ♖d5! 4 ♖xd5 cxd5 is a position that favors Black because White's queenside pawns are targets. Maybe it is still an '80 percent draw.' But Black would have the greater of the winning chances. Instead, play went 3 ♖ac1 ♖d5 4 ♕e3 a5 5 ♕c3 ♖ad8. A draw would be even more likely after 6 ♕xc6 ♕xc6 7 ♖xc6 ♖xe5 8 ♔f1!. But White, perhaps convinced that the isolated Black pawns favored him, played 6 h3?. He was mis-evaluating his own risk. There followed 6 ... c5 7 ♖e4 h6 8 ♖c4. White had underestimated the power of the Black rooks after 8 ... ♖d3! 9 ♕e1 ♖8d5 with a threat of ... ♕d7 and ... ♖d1. White should have tried to swap rooks with ♖4c3 at some point but gradually slipped into a position that grew worse and worse: 10 ♔h2 ♕b6 11 ♖1c2 ♕c7 12 ♖a4? ♖d1!. Suddenly White's king was a factor (13 ♕xa5 ♕xe5+ 14 f4 ♕e3). The final act began with 13 ♕c3 ♖xe5! 14 ♕xa5? (rather than 14 ♕g3). The quiet 14 ... ♕d6! set up a devastating discovered check (or 15 ♕a8+ ♔h7 16 ♖a6 ♖h1+! 17 ♔xh1 ♖e1 mate). White resigned after 15 g3 ♔h7 16 ♕a8 ♕d3 17 ♖ac4 ♖d5! in view of a mate after ... ♕f3 or ... ♕f1. We'll consider risk in more detail when we examine sacrifices in the next chapter. But for now let's see what we've learned. Quiz White's attack will be close to decisive if he can play f4-f5. How does Black minimize his risk of losing? Black threatens to blow open the kingside with 1 ... gxh3 or 1 ... h4. The basic weapon of line closing, 1 h4, invites a sacrifice on h4. Should White allow it? Chapter Seven: Sacrifice The only way to refute a sacrifice is to accept it, traditional defense declared. But this rule put defenders at an enormous disadvantage: They took every piece that was thrown at them 'on principle.' One of the best defenders of his era, Amos Burn, famously paid the price in this game: Marshall - Burn, Ostend 1907
1 d4 ♘f6 2 ♘f3 d6 3 ♗f4 ♘bd7 4 e3 g6 5 ♗d3 ♗g7 6 ♘bd2 O-O 7 h4? ♖e8 8 h5
♘xh5! 9 ♖xh5? gxh5 The natural follow-up to White's speculation was 10 ♗xh7+!. Black grabbed the bishop 'on principle' and was mated after 10 ... ♔xh7?? 11 ♘g5+ (11 ... ♔g8 12 ♕xh5 or 11 ... ♔g6 12 ♘df3 e5 13 ♘h4+ ♔f6 14 ♘h7+!). But Black would have had enough material to win after 10 ... ♔f8! (11 ♘g5 ♘f6 12 ♘de4 ♗g4 or 11 ♘h4 e5). Good modern defenders never accept material automatically. They recognize that some sacrifices cannot be refuted and that acceptance can be fatal. When weighing whether to accept, they rely primarily on calculation, common sense and their sense of acceptable risk. Black's last move, ... g6, was designed to keep a White knight off f5 and h5. He can meet the 1 ♗h6 mating threat with 1 ... ♗f6. But White played 1 ♘h5 anyway. Black had to choose between accepting the knight or making an ugly but far-from-fatal concession, 1 ... f6. He was willing to invest time in calculating 1 ... gxh5. It wasn't hard to see that White would reply 2 e5, intending 3 ♕e4 or 3 ♕d3 and a quick mate after ♕xh7+. Clearly 2 ... f5, to block the d3-h7 diagonal, would fail to 3 exf6 ♗xf6 4 ♖xe8+ and ♕xf6. More critical would be 2 ... ♗f8 and then 3 ♕d3 ♗g7. Black might not be able to calculate 4 ♕xh7+ ♔f8 5 ♗h6 to a conclusion. But that would put him out of his comfort zone. He took a deeper look at 2 e5. And he spotted a resource. He can create an escape route for his king and also force matters with 2 ... ♗f6!, a move that White may have overlooked when he considered 1 ♘h5. White had to go ahead with 3 ♕e4 ♖xe5! 4 ♕xh7+. But after 4 ... ♔f8 5 ♗h6+ ♔e7 the e-file was effectively blocked. White tried to force it open with 6 f4 and then 6 ... ♖e6 7 ♗f5 (no better is 7 ♗g6 ♕e8). But 7 ... ♕h8! did the trick. After 8 ♗xe6 ♗xe6! (not 8 ... ♕xh7 9 ♗f5+ and ♗xh7) Black would have two good minor pieces for a rook and would win the 9 ♕xh8 ♖xh8 10 ♗g5 ♗xg5 endgame. White kept his attack alive with 9 ♖xe6+! ♔xe6 10 ♖e1+. But blocking the file, 10 ... ♗e5!, works again because 11 ♕xh8 ♖xh8 12 ♗g5+ f6 is another lost ending. White tried 11 ♕c2. Black consolidated with 11 ... ♕xh6 12 fxe5 ♖c8! 13 exd6+ ♔xd6 14 ♕d3+ ♘d5 and won when the checks ran out. The Vulnerable Sacrificer When a player sacrifices he tries to put his opponent under emotional pressure. But what about the sacrificer? What pressure is he subjected to? To begin with, he has to justify his surrender of material. That may lead to misfires when the sacrifice begins to look dubious. Spassky - Suetin, Soviet Spartakiad 1964
1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 ♘f3 ♘f6 4 e3 e6 5 ♗xc4 c5 6 O-O a6 7 ♕e2 b5 8 ♗b3 ♗b7 9
♖d1 ♘bd7 10 ♘c3 ♕c7 11 e4 cxd4 12 e5 dxc3 13 exf6 ♘xf6 14 ♘e5 ♗c5 15 ♗f4 ♕b6 The forcing sequence begun by 12 e5 gave White a lead in development. But he's under pressure to use it. After 16 bxc3 O-O Black would be a safe pawn up. White felt 16 ♘xf7 was the only way to keep his initiative alive. Black quickly saw that 16 ... ♔xf7 would lose to 17 ♖d6!. For example, 17 ... ♗xd6 18 ♕xe6+ ♔f8 18 ♕f7 mate and 18 ... ♔g6 18 ♗c2+ ♔h5 19 ♕h3 mate. Black also understood the power of 16 ... O-O!. Yes, castling is legal. Black is still a pawn ahead but he has dramatically changed the nature of the struggle. His king is safe and he has 17 ... ♘d5, 17 ... ♘e4 and 17 ... cxb2 at his disposal, not to mention 17 ... ♖xf7. White rejected 17 ♘d6 ♗d5 and 17 ♗xe6 ♖xf7 and tried to prepare a more effective capture on e6 with 17 ♘g5?. This was easily handled by 17 ... cxb2! 18 ♖ab1 ♖ae8!. Then captures on e6 have no punch (19 ♘xe6 ♖f7 and 19 ♗xe6+ ♔h8). White limped onward with 19 ♖xb2 ♕c6 20 ♘f3 but Black was already winning after 20 ... ♘e4!. In fact, back at the previous diagram there was a similar scenario: If White had tried 16 bxc3 O-O and then 17 ♘xf7 Black would have gotten a fine game from 17 ... ♘e4 or 17 ... ♘d5. Many sacrifices, like 16 ♘xf7, have hidden weaknesses. They are mistakenly based on the defender accepting the offer - or accepting a second and third follow- up offer. But the defender can say yes, yes - and then no. After White had taken aim at h6 with ♗d2 and ♕c1, Black replied ... ♕a7. Should White retreat the attacked rook from b6? It doesn't look promising for him after 1 ♖b1 ♘xd4. White opted for 1 ♗xh6 and Black called his bluff with 1 ... ♕xb6! 2 ♗xg7 ♔xg7. At first, it looks like White gambled on 3 ♕g5, which is easily handled by 3 ... ♖h8 and 4 ♕f6+ ♔g8. But White had seen further: his second sacrifice, 3 ♘h5+!, would win after 3 ... ♔g8 4 ♕h6. Black had to choose between 3 ... ♔h7 4 ♘g5+ ♔g8 and the acceptance, 3 ... gxh5. The former is hard to calculate after 5 ♘xe6 and 6 ♕h6. The latter is based on 3 ... gxh5 4 ♕g5+ ♔h8? 5 ♕h6+ and mates. Black chose the latter and play went 3 ... gxh5 4 ♕g5+ ♘g6! 5 ♕f6+ ♔g8. White played 6 ♗xg6, hoping for 6 ... fxg6 7 ♕xg6+ But Black shot back 6 ... ♕d8!. Down a rook, White's only resource was more checks: 7 ♗h7+ ♔xh7 8 ♘g5+ ♔g8 9 ♕h6, which gave him two mating threats, ♕h7 and ♘h7-f6+. But the arrival of a reinforcement, 9 ... ♗d3!, was sufficient. White resigned soon after 10 ♖e3 ♕b6! (threatening ... ♕b1+) 11 h3 h4! 12 ♕xh4 ♗g6. The Joys of Pawn Grabbing The philosophy of sacrifice in the 19th century taught that gambits were generally sound because a few extra tempi were worth a pawn. Players like Paul Morphy were even willing to gambit all of their kingside pawns, with 1 e4 e5 2 f4 exf4 3 ♘f3 ♗e7 4 ♗c4 ♗h4+ and 5 g3?! fxg3 6 O-O gxh2+ 7 ♔h1. In the era of New Defense we learned that some gambits - such as the Poisoned Pawn Variation of the Sicilian Defense, 1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 a6 6 ♗g5 e6 7 f4 ♕b6 and then 8 ♕d2 ♕xb2 - can be safely accepted. Grandmasters predicted that in the 21st century computer analysis would make gambits a thing of the past. They didn't go away. In fact, new gambits arose, including some in queenside openings such as 1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 e6 3 ♘f3 b6 4 g3 ♗a6 5 ♕c2 ♗b7 6 ♗g2 c5 7 d5!? exd5 8 cxd5 ♘xd5. So where does that leave us? The best conclusion was known in the 19th century: a pawn is usually worth a little trouble. This is particularly true when the defender isn't forced to meet several specific threats. Brinckmann - Nimzovich, Berlin 1927
1 e4 ♘c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 ♕xd5 4 ♗e3 e6 5 ♗e2!? ♕xg2! 6 ♗f3 ♕g6 7 ♘e2
If we measure only time and space, White has excellent compensation for a pawn. He will gain more time by harassing the Black queen with moves such as ♖g1. Once he is castled queenside White may be able to profitably blast open the center with d4-d5. But White had no immediate threats. So Black could take time for 7 ... ♘b4! 8 ♘a3 ♘d5. The loss of two tempi was not as important as fixing the problem of the poorly placed knight and forestalling d4-d5. White continued 9 ♘c4 and Black surrendered two more tempi, 9 ... ♕f6! 10 ♘g3 ♕d8, to fix another problem, his misplaced, easily harassed queen. If chess was purely arithmetic, the numerical superiority of White's developed pieces over Black's would be decisive. But there are no exploitable Black weaknesses. White tried 11 ♕d2 ♘gf6 12 ♘e5 c6 13 O-O and Black won without incident following 13 ... ♗d6. Could White improve? Clearly 13 c4?? ♗b4 is out of the question and 13 O-O-O ♗b4 14 c3 ♗d6 and ... ♕a5 is insufficient 'comp.' An earlier try is 9 ♘b5 (instead of 9 ♘c4) and then 9 ... c6 10 ♘f4! ♘xf4 11 ♘c7+ ♔d8 12 ♘xa8 ♘g2+ 13 ♔d2. But Black can play more simply, 9 ... ♘xe3 10 fxe3 ♗d6. If a pawn is worth a little trouble, it's very little here. Many Happy Returns Masters love to grab material - while looking for a favorable way to give it back. They are seeking a kind of indirect trade in which they profit by eliminating weaknesses, gaining time or benefiting in some other way. White has an advantage in space on both wings. With his last move he traded pawns on a5. His goal was to create a pin on the newly-opened file with 1 ♖ab1. Black surprised him with 1 ... ♗xa3!, which he said was "an essential defensive move." On the one hand, he removed the bishop from the danger of f4-f5-f6!. On the other, he prepared to neutralize the queenside pressure with ... ♗b4!. White found nothing better than 2 f5. He eyed 3 f6 gxf6 4 ♗xh6. But 2 ... ♗b4! safeguarded both wings. After 3 ♗xb4 axb4 4 ♖xb4 ♕c7 Black's queen rook is in the game, he threatens ... ♕c5+ and the pawn at c4 is a potential target. White tried 5 ♔h1 and Black was able to win the e-pawn safely, 5 ... exf5 6 ♗xf5 ♗c6 7 ♕d2 (7 ♕c3 ♖a5) ♕xe5. He eventually won. It's usually easier to return a sacrificed pawn in a positional middlegame like that than in a largely tactical one. In attacking situations you're more likely to see a successful return of a sacrificed minor piece. A classic example of that was: Ahues - Carls, Hamburg 1921
1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 ♘f3 ♘c6 5 c3 e6 6 ♗d3 ♗d6 7 O-O ♘ge7 8 ♕e2 ♘g6
9 ♘g5 ♘ce7 10 f4 O-O 11 ♕h5 h6 12 ♘xf7 ♔xf7 13 g4 White threatens to regain his knight with 14 f5. Black can avoid that with 13 ... ♔f6, a move only a computer could love. White's calculation was accurate as far as that goes. But he assumed that ripping open the kingside must favor him. Black showed the flaw in his thinking with 13 ... ♕e8! and then 14 f5 exf5 15 gxf5 ♗xf5! 16 ♗xf5 ♔g8!. Black's king is safe and he is ready to seize the attack with 17 ... ♘xf5 18 ♖xf5 ♕e1+. White's best hope may have been 17 ♗e6+ ♔h7 18 ♖xf8. Then Black may like the solid endgame of 18 ... ♘xf8 19 ♕xe8 ♖xe8. But 18 ... ♕xf8 is more promising (19 ♗xd5? ♘xd5 20 ♕xd5 ♖e8 and the attack has changed hands). Instead, White chose to keep his bishop on the b1-h7 diagonal with 17 ♗d3? ♖xf1+ 18 ♔xf1?. After 18 ... ♕f7+ 19 ♔g1 ♖f8: It's easy to predict what happened to White's undermanned king position: 20 ♗e3 ♗f4! 21 ♕e2 ♕f6 22 ♔h1 ♕g5 23 ♗g1 ♗c1! 24 ♗xg6 ♘xg6 White resigned (25 ♘a3 ♘f4). A more subtle case was the next game. Black had a choice of being up the Exchange or one, two - or zero - pawns. The best option, it turned out, was the last. Olafsson - Tal, Bled-Zagreb-Belgrade 1959
1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 a6 5 c4 ♘f6 6 ♘c3 ♗b4 7 ♗d3 ♘c6 8 ♘e2 ♕c7
9 O-O ♘e5 10 f4! ♘xc4 11 ♔h1 ♗e7 12 b3 ♘b6 13 e5 ♘fd5 14 ♘e4! f5 15 exf6 ♘xf6
16 ♘2g3 ♘bd5 17 ♗b2! Black saw that 17 ... ♘e3 would not win the Exchange because of 18 ♕c1!. Would White have enough compensation for the sacrificed pawn in the 18 ... ♕xc1 19 ♖fxc1 endgame? Both players believed so because of Black's difficulty developing his queenside and the prospect of ♗e5-d6. Black also had to consider taking a second pawn, 17... ♘xf4. This time it's clearly too risky because of 18 ♖c1 followed by a capture on f6. For example, 18 ... ♕b8 19 ♗xf6! ♗xf6?? loses to the fork, 20 ♖xc8+! ♕xc8 21 ♘d6+. Black would have to retake 19 ... gxf6 but his prospects are dim after 20 ♘h5. Instead, Black went for 17... O-O! 18 ♖c1 ♕d8!, reinforcing f6. The game went 19 ♕e2 b5 20 ♘xf6+ (better was 20 f5!). Black saw through 20 ... ♘xf6? 21 ♗xf6! and 22 ♕e4, hitting h7 and a8. His next big test came after 20 ... ♗xf6 21 ♕h5. Black - who was, after all, Mikhail Tal - didn't have to spend a lot of time to realize that 21... g6 would invite 22 ♗xg6! hxg6 23 ♕xg6+ ♔h8 and then 24 ♘f5! followed by ♖f3! with a deadly attack. The other way to stop 22 ♗xh7+ is 21... h6. Then 22 ♕g6 isn't convinc ing because there is no mate after 22 ... ♗xb2. But White has alternatives such as 22 ♗a3 and 23 ♗e5! (23 ... d6? 24 ♕g6 works now because of 24 ... dxe5 25 fxe5 ♗xe5?? 26 ♕h7 mate). He seemed to have plenty of play for the sacrificed pawn. When there seems to be few alternatives - and all of them are poor - the defender has to broaden his choice. Black must remember that he's a pawn up. That made 21 ... g6 22 ♗xg6 and 22 ... ♕e7! an option. This stops mate on h7 and threatens both 23 ... ♗xb2 and 23 ... hxg6. As a result Black can count on 23 ♗xf6 ♘xf6 and 24 ♕f3 being played. After he replied 24 ... ♖b8 he finally completed development with ... ♗b7. Play went 25 ♗d3 ♗b7 26 ♕e2 ♔h8 27 ♖ce1 ♖be8. Chances would have been equal - no more - after 28 ♘e4. But White thought he was still better and so he chose 28 ♘f5? ♕b4 29 ♕b2 because this was the only way to maintain the initiative (based on 29 ... exf5? 30 ♖xe8). But he underestimated 29 ... ♖c8!. Once again, pieces that were well-placed for attack are clumsy when the attack is over. Black threatens to take the knight. After 30 ♘g3 ♕c3! an endgame would have favored him. Play went 31 ♕e2 ♖g8 32 ♘e4 ♕d4! and Black had turned the tables (33 ♘xf6 ♖xg2!). He won the ending after 33 ♘g5 ♖g7! 34 ♕e3 ♕xe3. Post-Sacrifice The period immediately after a sacrifice is typically the most delicate time for the defender. His opponent has likely calculated a few moves further than him. The situation is almost certain to be one of the easier-for-the-attacker-to-play type. The defender has to set priorities: No. 1 is stopping immediate threats and No. 2 is anticipating longer-term threats. Lombardy - Keres, Mar del Plata 1957
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 e6 3 ♘c3 ♗b4 4 e3 b6 5 ♘e2 ♗a6 6 a3 ♗e7 7 ♘f4 d5 8 cxd5 ♗xf1 9
dxe6!? ♗a6 10 exf7+ ♔xf7 White has two pawns for his bishop and Black's king is vulnerable. White need not try to exploit this immediately, with 11 ♕b3+ ♔e8 12 ♘e6. That gains a third pawn but 12 ... ♕d7 13 ♘xg7+ ♔d8 would allow Black to coordinate his forces (e.g. 14 ♘e6+ ♔c8 15 ♗d2 ♘c6 and ... ♘a5). White chose the superior 11 e4!. If he can play e4-e5, then ♕b3+ will have much more punch. White can also just fortify his center with ♗e3, O-O, ♕b3+, ♖ad1 and ♖fe1 while Black is struggling to develop. Black realized he had to put immediate pressure on the White pawns with 11 ... c5!. One of his ideas was to answer 12 e5 with 12 ... ♕xd4! 13 exf6 ♗xf6, returning material advantageously. Another point is that 12 d5 ♘bd7 halts White's progress after 13 d6 ♗f8 or 13 ♘e6 ♕b8 14 f4 ♖e8 and ... ♘f8. White tried to keep control of the situation after 11 ... c5 with 12 ♗e3 ♘c6 13 ♕b3+!. To avoid a powerful 14 ♕a4, Black had to release pressure on the center, 13 ... c4. Then 14 ♕d1 prepared e4-e5! once again. But Black responded with 14 ... ♗d6!, threatening 15 ... ♗xf4. White had nothing better than 15 e5 ♘xe5 16 dxe5 ♗xe5. The give-back strategy has paid big dividends. Black was soon better after 17 ♘fd5 ♖e8 18 ♘xf6 ♕xf6 and won a long endgame. Consolidating The defender's task doesn't end when he survives a sacrificial attack. The position is likely to remain messy for several moves. His pieces need to be reorganized before he can make use of a material advantage. We call this process consolidating. Botvinnik - Stein, Moscow 1964
1 c4 g6 2 ♘c3 ♗g7 3 d4 ♘f6 4 e4 O-O 5 ♗e3 d6 6 f3 b6 7 ♗d3 ♗b7 8 ♘ge2 c5 9 O-O
♘c6 10 ♗c2 e5 11 dxe5 dxe5 12 ♗g5 h6 13 ♗h4 ♘d4 14 ♘d5 ♘xd5?! 15 ♗xd8 ♘e3 16 ♕d3! ♖axd8 17 ♕xe3! ♘xc2 18 ♕c3 ♘xa1 19 ♖xa1 ♗a6 Black's queen sacrifice has yielded only a rook and a bishop. But he has the two bishops, control of the d-file and chances for play with ... f5. White's winning plan is not clear, as 20 b3 h5 and ... ♗h6 followed by ... ♖d2 or ... ♗d2 (21 ♕e3 ♔h7) indicates. White began with 20 ♕c2!, with three ideas. He wants to drive the bishop back with ♕a4. He cleared c3 so his knight can reach d5 and ne gate the power of Black's rooks. And he creates the option of trading rooks with ♖d1. Black prepared to get his KB into the game with 20 ... h5. White didn't like 21 ♖d1? ♖xd1+ 22 ♕xd1 ♗xc4 and chose 21 ♕a4. His best winning chance lies in a creating a passed pawn. That's why Black played 21 ... ♖d2! and invited 22 ♕xa6 ♖xe2 23 ♕xa7? ♖xb2 (24 ♖d1 ♗h6 and ... ♗e3+-d4). White needed to reduce Black's counterplay before he thought about a passed pawn. He accomplished that with 22 ♘c3 ♗c8 23 ♖d1!. Black cannot double rooks (23 ... ♖fd8? 24 ♖xd2 ♖xd2 25 ♕e8+ and ♕xc8). He was near material equality after 23 ... ♖xb2. But his pieces were disorganized after 24 ♘d5!. This was better than 24 ♕xa7 because Black's rook is vulnerable (24 ... a6? 25 ♕a3! ♖c2 26 ♕b3 ♖e2 27 ♔f1! and wins). Black tried 24 ... ♗e6, with the idea of 25 ♕a3 ♗xd5 26 ♕xb2 ♗xc4. Then his two bishops and two extra pawns offer surprising resistance. White chose the more accurate 25 ♕xa7 ♗xd5 26 exd5! to obtain a passed pawn. There was more than one way to win after 26 ... b5 and White decided to run his pawn, 27 d6 bxc4 28 d7. Black's c-pawns offered counterplay with 28 ... c3 so White chose 29 ♕xc5 c2 30 ♖c1 ♖d8 31 ♖xc2 (so that 31 ... ♖xc2 32 ♕xc2 ♖xd7 33 ♕c8+). Black made one last try, 31 ... ♗f8, hoping for 32 ♕c6 ♖xc2 33 ♕xc2 ♖xd7. But White finished off with 32 ♕c8! ♖b8 33 ♕xb8! (33 ... ♖xb8 34 ♖c8). When your material edge is relatively minor, such as an extra pawn (or the Exchange), there is a strong temptation to make it grow, by grabbing a second pawn. Then you're certain you have enough material to win. But king safety and limiting enemy pieces usually takes the priority. Tal - Trifunovic, Havana 1963
1 e4 e5 2 f4 d5 3 exd5 e4 4 d3 ♘f6 5 dxe4 ♘xe4 6 ♗e3 ♕h4+ 7 g3 ♘xg3 8 hxg3?
♕xh1 9 ♕e2 White is preparing a discovered check (or 9 ... ♗e7 10 ♗c5!) as well as the quick development (♘c3, O-O-O, ♗g2). Can Black safely take the d-pawn? Yes. A computer might be happy with 9 ... ♕xd5 10 ♘c3 ♕d8 and 11 ♖d1 ♗d6 12 ♗d4+ ♔f8. Black chose the practical 9 ... ♗b4+!. On 10 ♘c3 he can castle safely, and his extra Exchange must be enough to win. White replied 10 c3 instead. But Black's finesse had denied him the best square for his knight. Black retreated the bishop to a protected square, 10 ... ♗d6. Then came 11 ♗g2, which sets a simple trap (11... ♕h2? 12 ♘f3 ♕xg3+?? 13 ♗f2+). Play went 11 ... ♕h6 12 ♗d4+ ♔d8. The Black king is perfectly safe on d8 since the d-file is blocked. Black's consolidation will involve: (1) Playing ... ♖e8(+) to disorient White's pieces, (2) Mobilizing his queenside pieces with... ♗g4 and ... ♘d7, and (3) Taking squares away from White bishop and (after ♘f3) his knight with ... f6!. Play went 13 ♘f3 ♗g4! 14 ♕f2 ♖e8+ 15 ♔f1 ♘d7 16 ♘bd2 ♕g6 17 ♔g1. White needs a new plan. Among the options: a well-prepared ♘e5, a push of the c-pawn to c5 and c6, and an attack on the queenside pawns from ♘c4-a5 and perhaps ♗xa7 (The immediate ♗xa7 fails to ... ♖xa7 and ... ♗c5+). Black ruled out the first idea with 17 ... f6!. He was ready to thwart oth ers with 18 ... ♕c2. And he could meet 18 ♘c4 with 18 ... ♕d3! followed by ... ♖e2. Then his initiative would be the more forceful one (19 ♘e3 ♗xf3 20 ♗xf3 ♗c5 21 ♖d1 ♕xe3! is a winning liquidation). White fell back on the c3-c4-c5 idea with 18 ♖c1, But Black countered with 18 ... b6 19 b4 a5! and then 20 ♘h4 ♕d3 21 ♘df3 ♖e2. The rest was: 22 ♕f1 axb4 23 ♖d1 ♖xg2+! 24 ♔xg2 ♖xa2+ 25 ♔g1 ♕xf1+ 26 ♔xf1 g5! White resigns. More complex post-sack situations occur when the defender risks not having enough pawns left to win. White's target is h7 but 1 ♖h3 f5 defends easily. Black might even be bet ter after 2 exf6 ♖xf6. White tried to keep matters moving with 1 ♗f5. Of course, 1... gxf5 is punished by 2 ♖g3+. But the main point is that White can shoot for 2 e6 and 2 ♖h3 (2 ... f6 3 ♗xg6). Black brought in a reinforcement, 1 ... ♗c8!. The attack would again be over following 2 ♖h3 f6 3 exf6 ♖xf6 (or 3 ♗xg6? ♗xh3). But White went for broke with 2 e6?, based on 2 ... ♗xe6 3 ♖ae1. The game went 2 ... fxe6 3 ♗xg6 and 3 ... hxg6 4 ♕xg6+ ♕g7 5 ♕h5. He was betting that Black would have no defense to ♖g3(+). But he was surprised by 5 ... ♖f5! 6 ♕h4 ♕f6!, not 6 ... ♖g5? 7 ♖g3! ♖xg3 8 ♕xd8+!. The game wasn't over. Black needed to consolidate after 7 ♖g3+ ♔f8 8 ♕h7 Consolidating is usually a slow process that consists of coordinating your pieces, getting your king to a safer place and offering trades - while meeting end-of-attack threats and retaining enough pawns to win. Here Black must stop ♖g8 mate - but not with 8 ... ♖g5? 9 ♕xa7! ♖xg3 10 fxg3!. That would give White chances for ♖f1 and ♕xb6. Black would be running out of winning pawns. He chose 8 ... ♕f7! and invited 9 ♕h8+ ♔e7 10 ♕h4+ ♔d7 because his king would be getting out of the danger zone. He was happier still when White played 9 ♕h6+ ♔e8 10 ♖g7 and allowed 10 ... ♖h5!, which forced an exchange of queens. True, White got a second pawn for his missing bishop, 11 ♖xf7 ♖xh6 12 ♖xa7. But with queens off the board, Black could coordinate his pieces more easily, 12 ... ♗d7 13 f4 ♖c8, and protected one of the pawns he needed to win, 13 ♖b1 b5!. Bad bishops defend good pawns. White's two extra pawns are slow (14 ♖b3 ♖c4
15 g3 ♔e7 16 h4 ♖h8 and ... ♖hc8 wins, for example).
He made a final gamble, 14 a4 bxa4 15 ♖bb7, which Black handled with 15 ... ♖h7 16 ♖xa4 ♗xa4! 17 ♖xh7 ♖xc3. White still had a pawn for a bishop, and his rook was on the seventh rank. But his pawns are no threat to queen. The game ended with 18 h4 ♗c2! 19 ♖a7 ♗e4 20 ♔h2 ♖c2 21 ♖g7 d4 22 h5 d3 23 h6 d2 White resigns. Brilliancy prizes are rarely awarded for refuting a sacrifice. The de fender has to content himself with putting points on a scoretable. And that should be satisfaction enough. Quiz White has just played ♘g3-f5. How should Black respond? Black threatens to seize the initiative with 1... ♖e2. He can punish 1 ♖e3 with
1... ♗f4!.
With that in mind he chose 1 ♗xg7 What should Black do? Chapter Eight: Prophylaxis Prophylaxis is the most mysterious realm of defense: It typically involves quiet, 'little' moves that don't seem to do much. But when you consider what they stop you appreciate how powerful they can be. This looks like a textbook illustration of a favorable isolated d-pawn middlegame. White owns the c-file and can take his time piling up on the d5-pawn. He threatens 2 ♘f4 followed by ♘xg6 or ♘xd5/♕xe4. Everything is falling into place for him except ... Except that Black's last move was ... ♘f5, which prepared a sacrifice on e3. If White allows 1 ... ♘xe3 2 fxe3 ♖xe3 Black would win with ... ♖xf3 or another killing discovered check. But White's reply changed the position powerfully - even though it was just 1 ♔h1!. Now a sacrifice on e3 would be harmless. And Black would gain nothing from 1 ... ♘h4 2 ♕g3 since a trade of queens magnifies the weakness of the d- pawn. Black chose 1 ... ♕g5 but the reply 2 ♖d1 prepared 3 ♖xd5! ♖xd5 4 ♕xe4. And after 2 ... ♘e7. White increased the pressure with 3 ♖cd2. None of White's last three moves looked strong. But by removing the threat of ... ♘xe3 White made the d-pawn what matters most in the position. Black can't defend it for long in face of ♘f4 or ♕g3 and a trade of queens. He tried 3 ... ♗a5 4 ♖d3 ♘g6 but after 5 ♘g3 he realized that even 5 ... ♖e5 (6 ♗xe5? ♘xe5) would fail in view of 6 e4!. He resigned. Prophylaxis is difficult to appreciate because there is a natural human preference for taking action rather than taking cover. Given a choice between counterplay and prophylaxis, most players lean heavily towards the former. Here's how they can be wrong: This position arises in the Dragon Sicilian. White's last move, h2-h4, advertises his intent to open the kingside with h4-h5xg6, with or without the support of g2- g4. In similar positions, 1 ... b5 is the right idea. Black offers a pawn to open lines and mobilize heavy pieces quickly (2 ♘dxb5 ♕b8 3 ♘d4 ♖fc8 and 4 ♘b3 a5 followed by ... a4). If White doesn't take the b-pawn, Black gets in ... b4 before White can accomplish anything on the kingside. But here 1 ... b5? is dubious as 2 h5! b4 3 ♘d5 shows. White's attack is faster after 3 ... ♘xd5 4 exd5 ♕c7 5 g4, for example (5 ... ♖c8 6 hxg6 fxg6 7 ♕h2 h6 8 ♖d2). And 2 ... ♘xh5 3 g4 ♘f6 4 ♕h2 or 4 b3 has been shown to favor White. The right defense is 1 ... h5!. Black will now have time to activate his heavy pieces (with ♕b8 and ... ♖fc8) without a kingside distraction. The usual downside to moves like 1 ... h5 is that they trade one point of attack at h7 for a more exposed one at h5. But 2 g4, the obvious way to attack the apparent new weakness, fails to 2 ... hxg4! 3 h5 ♘xh5 4 fxg4 ♗xg4 (5 ♖dg1 ♕d7 6 ♖h4 e5). Started with Steinitz Prophylaxis is hardly new. It was recommended by Wilhelm Steinitz when he annotated this consultation game: The Black allies intended 1 ... g4 2 ♗e2 g3, blasting open the White king position. If Black gets in 3 hxg3 ♖xg3, he would win with ... ♕g5. White made a natural attempt, 1 h3, to keep lines closed. But this overlooked the strength of 1 ... g4! 2 hxg4 h5!. Black would win a piece after 3 gxh5 ♖xf3 and would crash through after 3 ♗e2 ♖xf2 or 3 ♕e1 hxg4 (also 3 ... ♖xf3) 4 ♗d1 g3. In the game, the White team tried to minimize the danger with 3 g5 ♖xg5 4 ♔h2. But the attack was decisive after 4 ... ♖h4+ 5 ♔g1 ♕f4! 6 ♖e1 ♖xg2+! (7 ♗xg2 ♕xf2 mate or 7 ♔xg2 ♕h2+ and mates). So was White just lost in the diagram? After all, 1 h3 g4 2 ♗xg4 would also have been bad in view of 2 ... ♖gxg4! 3 hxg4 ♖xf2 ( 4 ♖xf2 ♕xf2+ and mates). No, said Steinitz. White's only vulnerable target was f2 - and losing the f-pawn shouldn't be fatal. What killed him was allowing the checks or possible discovered checks after ... ♖xf2. Steinitz recommended 1 ♔h1! and analyzed 1 ... g4 2 ♗e2. Then 2 ... ♗xf2 can be met by 3 g3!. White is safe after 3 ... ♖xe4 4 ♔g2 or 3 ... ♕h6 4 ♕d3! (but not 4 gxf4? ♗g3). In fact, taking the f-pawn is second best. Black would have greater winning chances after 2 ... ♖xe4. But with bishops of opposite color a win is far off. Curiously, the key move was the same ♔h1, as in the first example of this chapter. It's surprising how often king-to-corner pays off. White prepares ♖ef1 followed by a capture on f7 that would allow his queen to create mating chances around g8. For example, 1 ... ♖c3 2 ♖xc3 ♕xc3 seems to help Black because it trades off an active White rook for a somewhat passive Black one. But then 3 ♖f1 would threaten 4 ♖xf7 ♖xf7 5 ♕xf7+ ♔h7 6 ♕f5+ and mates (6 ... ♔h8 7 ♕f8+ ♔h7 8 ♗g8+). Black's solution was 1 ... ♔h8!. He came to the realization, similar to Steinitz's, that a capture on f7 is only dangerous if it is followed by checks. After the king move, 2 ♖xf7 ♖xf7 3 ♗xf7 lacks punch and Black would win with the 3 ... ♕f2! double attack. Better, but still not good, is 2 ♗xf7 because of 2 ... ♕xe4! when White has the more vulnerable king (3 ♖xe4 ♖c1+). Instead, White played 2 ♖ef1 and found his pieces in a mess after 2 ... ♕e2!. There were no tactics to exploit on f7 so play went 3 h4 ♗f4 and since 4 g3? is foiled by 4 ... ♗xg3 White tried 4 ♕g4 ♖c2. But he had no threats while Black's winning ideas include ... ♖d2-d1. White tried 5 h5 ♖d2 6 ♖xf4 exf4 but soon resigned. And her downfall began with 1 ... ♔h8!. Middlegame Fortress Creating an impregnable fortress is a basic defensive technique in the endgame, as we'll see in Chapter Ten. But prophylaxis can help build a middlegame version of it by ruling out the most aggressive enemy plans. With the center blocked, White turns his attention to the wings. Fortunately, he has a good plan on either one. The first is a queenside break with b2-b4. This would require minimal preparation (♕d2 and ♖ab1, for example). The second plan is g2-g4. It requires more buildup (♕c2, ♘f2, ♔h1, ♖g1). But it offers a bigger payoff by targeting the Black king as well as the e4-pawn. Yet Black was able to foil the first plan and make the second more difficult with one move, 1 ... ♗xc3!. After 2 bxc3 ♘f6: Clearly b2-b4 is impossible and White has no exploitable queenside target. On the other wing, Black can pile up heavy pieces on the g-file and make g2-g4 difficult, if not impossible. Play went 3 a4 ♔h8 4 ♘f2 ♖g8 5 ♔h1 ♕e8 6 ♖g1 ♕g6. If White had tried to hurry the g-pawn push with 7 h3 Black could simply block him with 7 ... ♕g3. White needed several more moves. The result was 7 ♕d2 ♗d7 8 g3 ♖ae8 9 a5 ♖e7! 10 ♖ab1 ♗c8 11 ♖g2 ♖eg7 12 ♖bg1 ♘ce8 13 h3 h5. White cannot increase his support for g3-g4 beyond ♕d1 (which isn't enough). Black had built an iron-clad fortress. The players agreed to a draw here. Prophylaxis and Counterplay Aron Nimzovich elaborated on the uses of prophylaxis in the 1920s. However, the emphasis then and for the decades to come was on safety for the sake of safety. It was the ounce of prevention to avoid needing a pound of cure. Prophylaxis was considered an alternative to counterplay. New Defense changes the focus: Prophylaxis can be the necessary preparation for counterplay. Anand - Ivanchuk, Leon 2008

His 14th move anticipated lines in which the center is opened and Black delivers a key check on the open g1-a7 diagonal. These are common prophylactic moves in the Sicilian Defense. Black also took a prophylactic step, ... ♖ad8 to deter e4-e5. For example, 15 e5 dxe5 16 fxe5? ♖xd4. In the diagram, he played 18 ... ♔h8!. That prevented ♗h6. But it also prepared ... d5. The push wouldn't work immediately, 18 ... d5? 19 exd5 ♘xd5? 20 ♘xd5 ♗xd5 21 f6 or 21 ♗h6 ♗f6 22 ♗xg7 ♗xg7 23 f6. White tried to exploit the king's new position with 19 ♗g5, hoping for ♕h4, ♖e3-h3 and then ♗xf6/♕xh7 mate. For example, 19 ... ♗c6 20 ♕h4 ♕b7 readies 21 ... a5 and 22 ... b4. But 22 ♖e3 makes 23 ♖h3 strong. Black was happy to trade dark-squared bishops, 19 ... ♘h5! 20 ♕h4 ♗xg5 21 ♕xg5 ♘f6, because it put him on the verge of counterplay with ... d5 (or ... a5 and ... b4 first). Play went 22 ♖f3 ♕c5 23 ♖g3 ♖g8. The kingside is secure and Black, with a powerfully placed queen, is at least equal. After 24 ♖h3 he could have broken in the center with 24 ... d5 25 exd5 ♗xd5 (not 25... ♘xd5?? 26 ♖xh7+! ♔xh7 27 ♕h5 mate). He preferred 24 ... b4 25 axb4 ♕xb4 26 ♖b1 ♖c7 and won after ... d5. But what would happen in a similar position if there is no prospect of counterplay? The defender can wait with prophylactic measures: It's tempting to open the a-file with ... a5 and a trade of pawns on b4. But Black doesn't have much play on the file then after ... ♖a8 - and he has made his b5- pawn a potential target. Even though there was no immediate danger of ♘f6+, Black took the precaution of 1 ... ♔h8. After 2 c3 he added 2 ... ♖g8!. With his rook defending g7 he can decide, after ♘d6, whether to play ... ♗xd6. Then exd6 would threaten the Black queen but not ♕xg7 mate. After 3 ♖d3 Black decided to anticipate ♘d6 in another way, with the curious- looking 3 ... ♖cf8. This rules out ♘xf7+. 4 ♔h1 ♕b7. Black was not threatening anything. His waiting was rewarded by 5 ♕g4?. White prepared 6 ♗d1 followed by ♖h3 and ♗c2. But now the pent-up power of Black's kingside pieces made 5 ... ♘xe5! 6 ♗xe5 f5 work. White's position collapsed in a few moves, 7 ♘c5 fxg4 8 ♘xb7 gxf3 9 ♘a5 fxg2+ 10 ♔g1 ♗d5! 11 ♖xd5!? exd5 12 ♔xg2 ♗f6, and he resigned. Anticipation Prophylaxis is basically the anticipating of threats before they are threats. One reason that Tigran Petrosian was such a great defender is that he visualized threats before they occurred to his opponents. Bisguier - Petrosian, USA-USSR match 1954
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 c5 3 ♘f3 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘c6 5 ♘c3 e6 6 g3 ♗c5 7 ♘b3 ♗e7 8 ♗g2 0-
0 9 O-O d6 10 e4 ♘e5 11 ♕e2 ♕c7 12 ♘d2 a6 13 b3 b5 14 f4 ♘c6 15 ♗b2 White can seek play in the center, with the aim of e4-e5, or on the kingside with g3-g4-g5 followed by f4-f5-f6. Black would gain little from 15 ... bxc4 16 ♘xc4 because then White can favorably turn his sights to the other wing, with ♖ac1. With that in mind, Black chose 15 ... b4!. If the attacked knight goes to a4 it would be out of play for quite some time. White preferred 16 ♘d1. Then 16 ... a5 17 ♘e3 a4 allowed Black to open the a-file, 18 ♖ab1 axb3 19 axb3 ♖a2. But his queenside initiative had temporarily come to an end. White began kingside operations with 20 g4. Black anticipated him with 20 ... ♘d7!. He can reorganize his kingside with ... ♖e8 and ... ♗f8 well before they are necessary. For example, 21 g5 could be met by 21 ... ♘c5 22 h4 ♖e8 23 f5 ♘e5 24 f6 ♗f8, for example, with a rock-solid position. He preferred 21 ... ♖e8 and then 22 ♔h1 ♘c5 23 h4 ♕d8. What is the queen doing on d8? It is there to prevent a pawn push to f6. But it also anticipates that he will strike in the center with ... e5! and doesn't want to allow ♘d5 with tempo. White didn't like 24 f5 ♘e5 (25 ♗xe5 dxe5 26 ♖fd1 ♕d4). He switched to a new plan, the preparation of g5-g6 by means of ♖f3-g3 and h4-h5. 24 ♖f3 ♗f8 25 ♖g3. Thanks to his preparations Black was ready for 25 ... e5! 26 f5 ♘d4!. White would be losing after 27 ♗xd4 exd4 28 ♘d5 ♗xf5 or 27 ♕d1 ♘d3!. He gave up a pawn under better circumstances, 27 ♕f1 ♘dxb3 28 ♘xb3 ♘xb3 29 ♕e1. He would have gotten some play after 29 ... ♕a5 30 ♘d5. But Black converted the extra pawn to piece activity: 29 ... ♘c5! 30 ♕xb4 ♗b7 31 ♘d5 ♖a4 32 ♕d2 (or 32 ♕c3 ♗a6 33 ♘e3 ♕b8 and ... ♖b4). He won soon after 32 ... ♗xd5! 33 ♕xd5 ♖b4! 34 ♗f3 ♕a8 35 ♕d2 ♕b7 36 ♖g2 ♖b8. As we've seen before, White's aggressively placed pieces were poor defenders when his threats or initiative ended. Here's another case. White shifted his knights to the kingside and prepared ♖g3, which would threaten ♘f6+ or ♘xh6+. If it were his move, 1 ♖g3 would favor him after 1 ... ♗xg4 2 ♕xg4 g6 3 f4 and 1 ... ♘g6 2 ♘xg6. But it just takes two precautions, 1 ... ♔h7! followed by ... ♘g8!, to defang the dangers. After 2 ♖g3 ♘g8 White discovered that his pieces were misplaced: Black threatens ... ♕xh4, and the natural 3 ♘f5? allows a knight to be trapped after 3 ... g6! 4 ♘fe3 h5!. Winning a piece that way may seem too risky. But here, because of Black's first two moves, it is perfectly safe. Instead, White retreated 3 ♘f3. Black seized the initiative with 3 ... ♗xg4! 4 ♖xg4 ♘f6 5 ♖h4 ♔g8 6 ♖h3 d5!. Now the biggest difference between White and Black is that the rook is offside at h3. As a result, White can't easily deal with the opening of the center. He made one last bid for attack, 7 ♕e2 ♕d7 8 ♘h4 dxe4 9 dxe4 ♖ad8 10 ♘f5. Then he threatened 11 ♖g3 and prepared 12 ♕f3 followed by ♘xh6+. But Black's pieces proved superior after 10 ... ♕d2! 11 ♕f3 ♖e6!. His rook defended f6 and his queen watched h6. Black headed to a winning endgame after 12 ♖g3 g6 13 ♖f1 ♕f4! (not 13 ... ♕xb2 14 ♕e3!). White still had tricks, 14 ♖d1 ♖ee8 15 ♘e7+. But they were foiled by 15 ... ♔g7 16 ♘d5 ♕xf3 and he lost the endgame after 17 ♖xf3 c6 18 ♘e3 ♖xd1+ 19 ♘xd1 ♖d8 20 ♘e3 ♘xe4. Counter-Intuitive It is relatively easy to find aggressive, forcing moves. They readily occur to the improving player. Prophylactic moves don't. To find them you have to put yourself in your opponent's chair and see what he wants to do. White has more space and more active pieces. But he needs one more piece to make things happen on the kingside. The only one not helping out is the rook at a1. However, when White thinks about 1 O-O-O he realizes the danger from 1 ... b4!. Then Black would have the target he desperately needs. By thinking prophylactically, White found 1 ♔e2!, He had safeguarded his king and prepared ♖ah1-h8 in the safest manner. 1 ... ♖c8 2 ♖ah1! ♘xd3 3 ♕xd3 ♖c4? 4 ♖h8!. White's heavy pieces invaded - 4 ... ♖xh8 5 ♖xh8+ ♔e7 6 ♕h7! with a threat of ♕h4+ and mates. The end was 6 ... ♗e8 7 ♕g8 ♖c8 8 f5! resigns in view of fxe6, e.g. 8 ... exf5 9 ♕f8+ ♔d7 10 e6+ ♔c7 11 ♕e7+ or 10 ... fxe6 11 ♖h7+. Another reason prophylaxis is counter-intuitive is that it seems to lose time: Jakovenko - Karjakin, Sochi 2012 1 ♘f3 ♘f6 2 c4 b6 3 g3 c5 4 ♗g2 ♗b7 5 O-O g6 6 ♘c3 ♗g7 7 d4 cxd4 8 ♕xd4 d6 9 ♖d1 ♘bd7 10 ♗e3 ♖c8 11 ♖ac1 a6 12 b3 O-O 13 ♕h4 Black played 13 ... ♖c7 for two reasons. One is aggressive. He wants to play ... ♕a8 and ... ♖fc8 so that ... b5 will be strong. The other reason is defensive. He anticipated ♗h3, which would pin the d7-knight if the rook still stood at c8. The picture changed when White replied 14 g4. Black recalled how he played 14 ... ♖c8!? and another of the elite GMs in the tournament "looked at me like I was a complete idiot." Black's play was again prophylactic. He knew that g4-g5 might be coming and, after he answered it with ... ♘h5, he didn't want ♘d5 to attack the c7-rook. White replied 15 ♗h3. It might seem that Black has just wasted two tempi and White used the time to make good moves, ♗h3 and g3-g4. But those moves didn't look useful after Black shot back 15 ... b5! 16 cxb5 ♕a5 and threatened 17 ... ♖xc3 (and 18 ♗d2 ♖xc1 19 ♗xa5 ♖xd1+). If White didn't have his extra moves, 17 bxa6 would be fine. But here Black would have had excellent compensation for a pawn after 17 ... ♗xf3 18 exf3 ♘e5 or
18 g5 ♖xc3 19 exf3 ♘d5! (and 20 ♗xd7 ♘xe3 21 fxe3 ♖xc1 22 ♖xc1 ♕xa6).
The game went 17 ♗d2 ♗xf3 18 exf3 axb5 19 g5 b4! and Black had the better of the complications (20 gxf6 ♗xf6 21 ♕e4 bxc3 22 ♗xd7 ♖cd8 23 ♗xc3 ♗xc3 24 ♕xe7 d5). And a third reason that prophylactic moves are counter-intuitive is that they often seem to overprotect the already well-protected. Black chose 1 ... ♖e6, with ... ♕c7 and ... ♖ae8 in mind. But the e-file is closed. What would the rooks do on e6 and e8? Well, Black first had to deal with an immediate threat (2 ♘h6+ gxh6 3 ♗xf6). He also had to face a longer-term threat, ♖ad1 and d3-d4!, which could embarrass his queen at d8. The wisdom of his maneuvers was clear after 2 ♕g3 ♕c7 3 ♖ad1 ♖ae8 4 axb5 axb5. He was ready to play for an edge with ... d4 and/or ... c4. White continued with his plan, 5 d4?, perhaps expecting 5 ... ♘xe4 6 ♗xe4 dxe4 7 d5!, which favors him. But Black improved with 5 ... dxe4. 6 ♗xf6 ♖xf6 7 ♗xe4 ♗xe4 8 ♖xe4. White had overlooked 8 ... ♕c8! and the threat of ... ♖xf5. The f5-knight has no good retreat (9 ♘e3 ♖f4!). He would be losing after 9 ♘xg6 ♕xf5! or 9 ♕g4 ♘xh4 10 ♘xh4 ♕xg4 11 ♖xg4 exd4 12 cxd4 c4!. In the end he played 9 dxe5 and 9 ... ♖xf5 10 ♘xf5 ♕xf5 11 ♖de1. But the minor pieces prevailed after 11 ... ♖d8 12 ♕e3 c4 13 e6 fxe6 14 ♖xe6 ♗c5 15 ♖e8+ ♔f7. Sacrificial Prophylaxis Finally, it should be noted that not all prophylactic moves are quiet. Some are dramatic because they give up material. White has positional trumps, including two potential passed queenside pawns that could be decisive. But he has to deal with ... h4, which would blow open his king position. The short-term response, 1 ♕f2, seems adequate. But after 1 ... f5 Black's counterplay from 2 ... h4 3 gxh4 ♕h6 and ... f4, or from ... ♖f6-h6, is beginning to get serious. White found a long-term solution in 1 ♖f4! and 1 ... ♗xf4 2 gxf4. This keeps his kingside firm and makes his knight a powerhouse when it goes to d4. True, Black still had an h-pawn to push and did: 2 ... ♕g6 3 ♘d4 h4 4 ♔h1 h3. It appeared as if White's sacrifice had failed when 4 ♗f1 ♗g4 made ... ♗f3+ a threat. Yet White had another prophylactic measure, 5 ♔g1! followed by ♔f2. There followed 5 ... ♗e2+ 6 ♔f2 ♗xf1 7 ♖xf1 ♖fc8 8 ♖g1 ♕f6 9 ♕c3. White has all the play (♖g5, ♕b3, b4-b5). He eventually won three pawns and coasted to victory. You can defend many, if not most, positions without prophylaxis. But to become a complete defender, to get the most out of the wide variety of situations you'll find yourself in, it pays to learn what prophylaxis can do for you. Quiz Black's position looks dire in view of ♗xf6/♕xh7 mate. What can he do? White has been preparing e4-e5!. How can Black anticipate that? White's plan is ♗xf6 and g2-g4-g5. Do any ideas occur to you? Chapter Nine: You Against Tal Decades after his death, Mikhail Tal remains the iconic ideal of the all-out aggressive player, the attacker against whom all others can be measured. But his sacrifices didn't automatically succeed. Nor did his initiatives always translate into brilliancy prizes. He was beaten by good defense. Let's see what Tal's games can teach us about the limits of attack. In this chapter we'll put you in the chair of his opponents. Can you defend against Tal? Tal - Romanishin, Riga 1981

♕xd4 b5 9 ♖d1 ♗b7 10 O-O ♘c6 11 ♕d2 ♗e7 12 ♗f4 ♖c8 13 ♖fe1 ♘a5 14 ♗d6! ♗xd6 15 ♕xd6 ♕c7 16 ♕a3 ♘c4 17 ♗xc4 ♕xc4 White met the threat of 18 ... b4 with his own threat, 18 ♘d5, of mate on e7. Do you accept the knight sacrifice or refuse? And if you refuse, how? Take a few minutes to figure out a response before reading on. The first thing you may have noticed is that after 18 ... exd5 19 exd5+ ♔d8 White has a major choice. He can grab a second pawn (or a third) with 20 ♕e7+ ♔c7 21 ♕xf7. But then his threats are dwindling and he will have a hard time making his compensation count. On the other hand, White can stop Black's king from escaping to c7 with either 20 ♕g3 or 20 d6 (with its threat of 21 ♕a5+). The outcome would be unclear. In the game, Black let Tal take the risks. He played 18 ... ♕c5!. That gave Tal a chance to be consistently aggressive - and get the worst of it with 19 b4? ♕xc2!. For example, 20 ♖c1 ♕d2 or 20 ♕g3 ♗xd5! 21 exd5 O-O or 21 ♕xg7 ♕c3!. Tal appreciated that the 19 ♕xc5 endgame would be fine for Black. To keep his attacking hopes alive he tried 19 ♕g3. He invited 19 ... exd5 20 ♕xg7! followed by exd5+. But once again Black was able to shift the burden back to White, with 19 ... ♗xd5!. He dared Tal to play 20 ♕xg7? ♕f8! 21 ♕xf8+ ♖xf8 because 22 exd5 ♖xc2 favors Black. Tal saw the light, recaptured 20 exd5 - and offered a draw. It was accepted because the position is balanced after 20 ... O-O 21 c3. Another way to deal with an attack-mad opponent is to take super-precautions. Don't give a Tal the chance to play like a Tal. Tal - Andersson, Las Palmas 1975
1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 e6 6 ♗e2 a6 7 O-O ♗e7 8 f4 ♕c7 9
♗e3 O-O 10 ♕e1 ♘c6 11 ♕g3 ♘xd4 12 ♗xd4 b5 13 a3 ♗b7 14 ♖ae1 ♗c6 15 ♔h1 ♖ab8 16 e5! ♘e8 17 ♗d3 White would get a small positional edge from 17 ... b4 18 axb4 ♖xb4 19 ♘e2. But 18 ♕h3! is far more promising. Then 18 ... h6 19 ♘e4 prepares ♘f6+. And 18 ... g6 19 ♖e3! bxc3? 20 exd6 ♗xd6 21 ♕xh7+! ♔xh7 22 ♖h3+ is a mate. Black played 17 ... g6! (instead of 17 ... b4) so his knight can go to g7. He didn't fear 18 f5 exf5 19 ♗xf5 because of 19 ... dxe5 20 ♗xe5 ♗d6!. True, White has good alternatives to 18 f5, such as 18 ♘e4 or 18 exd6 ♗xd6 (18 ... ♘xd6? 19 f5! exf5 20 ♕e5! wins) 19 ♕h4. But the biggest drawback to 17 ... g6 is that it made h7 more vulnerable to ♕h3- h6/♖e3-h3. Tal went for the quick knockout with 18 ♕h3 and 18 ... ♘g7 19 ♕h6. White threatens to win immediately with 20 exd6 followed by ♕xg7 mate or dxc7. If that is thwarted, he also has 20 ♖e3 and ♖h3. What would you do as Black? Take a few minutes. The best defense turns out to be bunkering down with the highly cautious 19 ... f6! 20 ♖e3 ♖f7!. He protected g7 and prepared ... ♗f8 followed by ... ♘f5 or ... ♘h5. By adding this over-protection he could refute 21 ♖h3 ♘h5 22 ♖xh5? with 22 ... ♗f8!. The effect on Tal was crucial. He could have kept an edge (after 21 ♖h3 ♘h5) with 22 exf6! ♗xf6 23 ♗xf6 ♘xf6 24 ♗xg6! (24 ... ♖g7 25 ♘e4!). However, Tal was intrigued by a pretty move, 21 f5. It works wonderfully after 21 ... exf5 22 e6! ♖ff8 23 ♖h3 ♘h5 and now 24 ♖xf5!. Also winning is 21 ... fxe5 22 fxg6 ♖xf1+ 23 ♗xf1 hxg6 and now 24 ♗d3! exd4 25 ♖h3. But it doesn't matter how many pretty ways to lose there are if there is one line that successfully defends. Black found 21 ... ♘xf5!. This turned the tables. Play went 22 ♗xf5 exf5! 23 e6 ♖g7 24 ♘e2 and a draw was agreed - but 24 ... ♗e4! would have given Black strong winning chances. Choice of Weapons The defensive weapons we examined in Chapter Four occur over and over in Tal's games. Which weapon occurs to you in the next position? With five pieces aimed at the Black kingside, White looked for a way to sacrifice on h6 or g7. This time super-caution can be dangerous: If Black overprotects h6 with 1 ... ♘g8, for example, he allows 2 ♘xh6! ♘xh6 3 ♗xh6 gxh6? 4 ♕xf7+ or 3 ... ♕xh4 4 ♗g5 and 3 ... ♔xh6 4 ♘f5+. Black's solution was long-distance reinforcement, 1 ... ♖a6!. The rook protects the f6-knight in key lines. It also frees a8 for Black's queen, which can take aim at e4 and provide counterplay. White pulled the trigger with 2 ♘xh6 gxh6 3 ♘f5. His idea was 4 ♘xh6 ♗xh6 5 ♕f5+ ♔h8 6 ♗xh6 followed by ♗g7+ (if allowed) or ♗g5. That might win if he can also get his other rook or bishop into the game after f2-f4. Black carried out his regrouping with 3 ... ♕a8! and threatened 4 ... cxd3 5 ♗xd3 ♗xe4! to kill the attack. Play went 4 ♘xh6 ♗xh6 5 ♕f5+ ♔h8 6 ♗xh6 ♖g8 7 ♗g5. Now we can appreciate how the rook at a6 defends f6. But Black can't play 7 ... cxd3 8 ♗xd3 ♗xe4 because of 9 ♗xe4 ♕xe4 10 ♗xf6+! ♘xf6 11 ♖xg8+ ♔xg8 12 ♕c8+! and ♕xa6. Black could have over-protected further with 7 ... ♖g6 but White would pick up a third pawn for the piece after 8 ♗xf6+ (8 ... ♖axf6? 9 ♕xd7). And 7 ... ♖xg5 would give away his material edge. Black found 7 ... ♕e8!, which protects d7 and f7 and prepares to trade pieces with 8 ... ♘h7!. White tried 8 f4 ♘h7! 9 ♗h4 ♖xg3 10 ♗xg3. But Black's pieces took over the board, 10 ... ♖f6! 11 ♕g4 ♖g6 12 ♕h4 exf4 13 ♕xf4 f6!. He won after 14 ♗f2 cxd3 15 ♗xd3 ♘e5! 16 ♗f1 ♘g5 17 ♔h1 ♘xe4. White's weapons were good. Black's were better. Most Exciting Draw Tal's finest draw - and what's been called the most exciting draw ever played - featured a remarkable insight by the defender. His opponent had to figure out what was the indispensable member of Tal's attacking army and get rid of it. He passed the test. Can you? Both ... ♖xd3 and ... ♗xd1 are threatened. Tal blithely ignored both with 1 hxg6!. The first question Black must answer is whether he can allow gxf7+ or gxh7+. He figured out that 1 ... ♖xd3! was safe because 2 gxf7+ ♕xf7! wins for Black. And 2 gxh7+ ♔h8 3 ♖xd3 is simply met by 3 ... ♗e6. White recaptured 2 ♖xd3! and was ready to beat 2 ... ♖d8 with 3 gxh7+! ♔h8 4 ♘f7+!. Black found the correct 2 ... hxg6! and White revealed the point of his queen sacrifice with 3 ♖h7!. The real threat is 4 f3!, of all things. Then if the attacked bishop retreats to h5, White wins with 5 ♖d7 and 6 ♖dxf7. If, instead, the bishop goes the other way, say to e6, White has 5 ♖d2 and 6 ♖dh2 followed by mate on h8. The natural responses of a defender in a position like this are (a) panic and (b) confusion, followed by (c) trying to trade off one of the rooks. If (c) fails, he is left with (d), giving back some material. But 3 ... ♖d8? loses to the pretty 4 ♖xd8 ♕xd8 5 ♖h8+! ♔xh8 6 ♘xf7+ and ♘xd8. And the giveback option, 3 ... ♖e6 4 ♘xe6 ♗xe6, would allow 5 ♖g7+ and ♖d1-h1+ or 4 ... fxe6 5 ♖g7+ ♔h8 6 ♖dd7 ♕xf6 7 ♖gf7!. But there is also option (e). Black can look for a key element to White's attacking force and eliminate it. Can you spot it? Take a few minutes. Black realized that it was the pawn at f6. That told him he had to find a safe way (not 3 ... ♖e6?) to get rid of it. He found 3 ... ♖c8! 4 f3 ♖c6!. Tal saw that 5 fxg4 ♖xf6 would favor Black. He bailed out with 5 ♖xf7 and a draw was agreed soon after 5 ... ♕xf7 6 ♘xf7 ♔xf7 7 fxg4 ♔xf6. Over-Reaching Tal's ingenuity required defenders to thread their way through a ticket of traps, as Black did in the last example. The defender's reward for navigating his way to safety was that Tal occasionally over-reached. Tal - Bhend, Zurich 1959

But 21 ... ♗xd5? 22 ♗xd5+ ♔h8 23 ♖e7 helps White. What else should you consider as Black? In the absence of counterplay, prophylaxis, 21 ... ♔h8!, stands out. White was threatening 22 ♘e7+ ♔h8 23 ♗xg6 or 22 ♗xg6 hxg6 23 ♘e7+. Also, since ... ♗xd5 may be inevitable, Black wanted to make sure that ♗xd5 would not be check. For example, 22 ♖e3 could be met by 22 ... ♗xd5 23 ♗xd5 ♖be8!. Then with bishops of opposite color, Black's target at f2 is as least as vulnerable as White's at h7 (and 24 ♖h3 ♗d4 25 ♕xg6 fails to 25 ... ♕xh3!). Tal accepted the challenge and played 22 ♗xg6 anyway, because 22 ... hxg6 23 ♘e7! still wins (23 ... ♖f5 24 ♕h4+ ♖h5 25 ♘xg6+). Black's timely 21st move allowed him to answer 22 ♗xg6 with 22 ... ♗xd5!. The first point is that 23 cxd5 or 23 ♕xd5 allows Black to pocket a piece safely (23 ... hxg6). But the more subtle second point is that 23 ♕h5 also fails, to 23 ... ♗g8!. Did Tal just miss that retreat when he sacrificed the bishop? No, he calculated quite a bit further. This became apparent after 23 ♖e7!. Then 23 ... ♗f6? allows White to swap down to a favorable endgame (24 ♕xf6+ or 24 ♖xd7 ♗xg5 25 ♖xh7+ and 26 cxd5). Also 23 ... ♕c8?? fails to, among other moves, 24 ♗f5!. But 23 ... ♕d8! pins the e7-rook. Black can meet 24 ♗xh7? and the threat of ♕xg7 mate with 24 ... ♗f6! 25 ♕h6 ♕xe7 and wins (26 ♗e4+ ♔g8 27 ♗d5+ ♖f7). Black has passed three tests so far. But Tal posed a fourth with 24 ♖fe1!. Now on 24 ... ♗g8 White wins with 25 ♗xh7!. And against 24 ... ♖g8 he has 25 ♕h6! ♗xh6 26 ♖xh7 mate. Black had to be impressed by that. But remember that the rook at e7 is pinned. Take a few minutes to consider Black's options. He can't defend with 24 ... ♖b7 (25 ♖xb7?? ♕xg5) because White has 25 ♕h5 ♗g8 26 ♖xb7. Black found a way to exploit the pin: 24 ... ♗f7! so that 25 ♗xf7 ♖xf7. This prepares to kill the attack with 26 ... ♖xe7 27 ♖xe7 ♕f8. Note that 26 ♖e8+ ♕xe8 27 ♖xe8+ ♖xe8 would give Black more than enough material for the queen. In this calculation contest, Tal erred first. He could have held the position with the unlikely 25 ♗h5! because then 25 ... ♖b7? can be met by 26 ♗xf7 ♖xf7? 27 ♖e8+!. After 25 ♗h5 Black can draw - but just draw - with 25 ... ♗d4 26 ♕h6! ♗g7! 27 ♕g5 ♗d4. Instead, White played 25 ♗c2? and there followed 25 ... ♖b7! 26 h4 ♖xe7 27 ♖xe7. White's queen is protected now, so he threatens 28 ♖xf7 ♕xg5 29 ♖xf8+ or 28 ... ♖xf7 29 ♕xd8+. Black has to pass one final test. There are two defenses. The simplest is 27 ... ♗g6, again exploiting the pin and trading off another piece. This would require Black to win the endgame after 28 ♗xg6 hxg6 29 ♖xa7. Black preferred to think out 27 ... h6!. The attack ended after 28 ♕f5 ♗g8! and Black's extra piece won (29 ♕e4 d5 30 cxd5 ♕xd5 31 ♕g6 ♕d4 32 ♕g3 ♖f7!). Accept or Not? When trying to decide whether to accept a sacrifice it pays to recall that there are positions that are more difficult for the attacker to play than for the defender. That helped defeat Tal in this game. Polugayevsky - Tal, Moscow 1973

♘xe5 ♕e7 9 f4 ♘bd7 10 ♘xd7 ♗xd7 11 e5 White grabbed the e-pawn because he saw that if Black tried to win a pawn back, 8 ... ♕d4, he could be punished by 9 ♘d3! ♘xe4 10 ♕e2!. The position in the diagram is risky for White - yet difficult to play as Black because he has three appealing alternatives, 11 ... g5, 11 ... ♘h5 and 11 ... O-O-O. The first one looks good after 12 fxg5 ♘g4!. But the simple 12 ♗e2 would force a knight retreat and send Black's initiative floundering. The ... g5 idea works much better after 11 ... ♘h5! 12 ♕f3 ♗c6 and 13 ♕f2 g5!. White could improve with 13 ♕g4 but 13 ... ♗d7 would repeat the position and 13 ... ♕c5 and ... ♕e3(+) might offer more than a draw. Tal chose 11 ... O-O-O and that could be considered his first error of the game, although a minor one. Take a moment here to imagine what you would play as White. His task is actually easier than Black's. In view of the possibility of 12 ... ♘h5, 12 ... ♖he8 and other dangerous ideas, White's reply was virtually forced. Did you find 12 ♗e2 ? Good. Then if Black retreats 12 ... ♘e8 White must stand well after 13 ♕b3 (13 ... ♗c6 14 ♗f3!). A bit trickier is 12 ... ♘h5! because 13 ♗xh5 gxh5 14 ♕xh5 ♖hg8 gives Black good play. But White doesn't need the second pawn and would have the upper hand after just 14 O-O!. Black again had the more difficult task and 12 ... ♗c6? was second best. It helped White by narrowing his choices. White saw he could either defend against ... ♗xg2 or take the knight on f6. He also saw that he would have a hard defense after 13 ♗f3 ♘e4 14 ♗xe4 ♗xe4 (15 O-O ♕b4). So he might as well devote his calculation to 13 exf6!. It wasn't hard to see that the best response would be 13 ... ♕e3!. White's moves are easy to find when you can rule out the losing alternatives (14 ♕b3? ♕xd2+; 14 ♘f1? ♖xd1+; 14 ♔f1 ♖xd2 and 14 ♕c1? ♖he8). That left 14 ♖f1! and then 14 ... ♗xg2 15 ♖f2. The threat of ♖xg2 gave White time to take a breath and study the position after 15 ... ♗h3. It should be obvious that White can only move his queen and QR. The queen moves would prepare ♘f1! while 16 ♖c1 would set up ♖c3. White opted for 16 ♕c1! - rather than 16 ♕c2 ♗f5 17 ♕c3 ♖d3. Then came 16 ... ♖he8 17 ♘f1! ♕e6 18 ♕c3. He had survived the initial crisis and met 18 ... ♗g4 with 19 ♘g3. Then 19 ... ♗xe2 20 ♖xe2 ♕g4 would win the f4-pawn. But with a knight to defend the kingside White can escape to safety with 21 ♖xe8 ♖xe8+ 22 ♔f2 ♕xf4+ 23 ♔g2 (23 ... ♖e3 24 ♖f1!). The last major challenge was posed by 19 ... h5! (instead of 19 ... ♗xe2). Once again White's choices are so limited that it helped him decide. He can quickly reject 20 ♕e5 ♕c6, for example. More attractive is 20 h4 but he might be losing that pawn after ... ♗xe2 and ... ♕g4. The choice is mainly between seeking king safety (20 ♔f1) and trading pieces (20 ♖d1 and ♖xd8+). Both policies have merits, since 20 ♔f1 h4 21 ♘e4! defends (21 ... ♕xe4 22 ♗xg4+). But White opted for 20 ♖d1 h4 21 ♖xd8+. After 21 ... ♖xd8 he could defend with 22 ♘f1 ♖e8 since 23 ♕e5! works this time. Black's choice was once again difficult and he preferred 21 ... ♔xd8. He apparently overlooked or underestimated 22 f5! which led to 22 ... gxf5 23 ♕d3+ ♔c8 24 ♘xf5. The knight was ready to kill the attack with ♘e7+ or ♘d4. Black tried 24 ... ♕xf6 but he resigned soon after 25 ♘e3! ♗xe2 26 ♖xe2 ♕g7 27 ♘d5. Give-Back Time Even Tal could be thrown off when an opponent gave sacrificed material back to him. Can you figure out how to do it effectively? Tal - Huebner, Leningrad 1973

16 f6 ♗xf6 17 ♖xf6 gxf6
Black knew that an Exchange sacrifice on f6 was possible when he castled. But he appreciated that 15 ... ♘e5, for example, would be more dangerous. Then 16 fxe6 fxe6 17 ♕g3! ♗f6 18 ♗h5+ ♘f7 and now 19 ♖xf6! gxf6 20 ♕g7 would promise a winning attack. In the diagram it looks like White has all the weapons. But Black has an extra pawn and Exchange. He can give up some of his material surplus. For example, 18 ♖d3 ♘e5 19 ♗h6 prepares ♕h4. This looks dangerous in view of 19 ... ♔h8 20 ♕h4 ♕e7 21 ♖h3 followed by ♗xf8 or ♗g7+ (or 21 ... ♖g8 22 ♗f8!). But the knight reinforcement would arrive in time, 19 ... ♘g6! (20 ♖g3 ♕c5+ 21 ♔h1 ♔h8 with advantage). So instead of the immediate 18 ♖d3 Tal played 18 ♕h4 ♕e7 19 ♖d3. He set a delicious trap. This time the safety-minded 19 ... ♔h8?? loses to 20 ♗d4! ♘xd4 21 ♖h3!. Black found the superior 19 ... f5!. Of course, White declined to trade queens. But his 20 ♗g5 f6 21 ♗h6 was simply met by 21 ... fxe4!. White was so far behind in material that he had no alternative to 22 ♖g3+ ♔h8 23 ♗g7+ ♕xg7 24 ♖xg7 ♔xg7. Then material was roughly equal. But Black had the better chances, e.g. 25 ♕g4+ ♔h8 26 ♕xe6 ♘e5 and ... f5-f4 or 25 ♘xe4 ♘e5 26 ♘g3 ♔g8. He eventually won. One final defensive technique works best when facing a strong opponent: Look for the resource that even a good calculator might have overlooked when he first considered the sacrifice.

What could have convinced him that the knight sacrifice was sound? One answer is the threats he would get from 17 ♗xh6+! ♔xh6 18 ♘xf7+ ♔g7 19 ♖e5! (19 ... ♘xe5 20 ♘xe5 and ♕g6+ or 19 ... ♕c7 20 ♖g5+). He might also have thought in general terms: The knight on e5 keeps Black's queen from joining the kingside defense. After 16 ... ♘xe5 he can choose between 17 ♗xe5, with the idea of ♖e3-g3+ or -f3, and 17 ♖xe5. This is far from convincing, as 16 ... ♘xe5 17 ♗xe5 ♖g8 and ... ♔f8 indicates. But Black preferred 16 ... ♖h8, which has the advantage of protecting h6 and clearing an escape route for the king. Tal had an ingenious response, 17 ♕h3, with the idea of 18 ♘xf7! ♔xf7 19 ♕xe6+ and ♕xe7+ (or 19 ... ♔g6 20 ♖e3 and ♖g3+). White may have seen this far when he sacrificed the knight. In that case he would have examined 17 ... ♘xe5 and then 18 ♗xe5 followed by ♖e3-f3. But there's an alternative to 17 ... ♘xe5 and it's one that would have been very hard to visualize, let along calculate with certainty, when White was looking at 15 ♘xg7. Take a few minutes to look at this position and see if you can figure out what that might be. The answer Black came up with was 17 ... ♖h7!. Not only does it meet the threat - 18 ♘xf7? ♔xf7 19 ♕xe6+ ♔e8 (20 ♗d6 ♕d5) - but it does so in a way that White probably didn't foresee when the rook was at f8 and the king at g8 in the first diagram. White's attack began to run out of steam after 18 c4 ♘f8! 19 ♖ad1 ♖d8 20 ♗d2 ♕b6 21 ♗c3 ♔g8 and he was on the way to a loss after 22 ♖e3 ♘e8 23 ♖g3+ ♘g7 24 ♖dd3 f6 25 ♘g6 ♘xg6 26 ♖xg6 ♔f7. And now for some quiz positions drawn from Tal's games. Quiz The first defensive move that would occur to many players is 1 ... g6. Then White could try to win a good-N-vs-bad-B ending after 2 ♖c1. Is there better for Black? White, a pawn down, threatens ♖xh5. There are four ways to parry that. How many are good? White plans ♗xf6 and ♕g5 mate and also has ♖f1/♘f5 coming up. Is 1 ... fxg5 2 ♕xg5+ with a perpetual check the best Black has? White prepared ♖xh6+. For example on 1 ... ♗e2, he would obtain the edge with 2 ♖xh6+! gxh6 3 ♖f6 ♕c7+ 4 ♘c6!! (not 4 ♔d2 ♕a5+ 5 ♔xe2 ♕g5!). What else can Black do? Black is in check. What is the safe way out? Chapter Ten: Last Chance to Defend When you have a worse position and you're getting closer to an endgame, your defensive resources begin to dwindle. This means you should evaluate your losing chances carefully. Once you know how near you are to a hopeless position you may appreciate what it takes to draw. Black is a pawn down and may lose another. Just a trade of queens would likely doom him. He realized he needs to take extreme measures. Even with just seconds left to reach the time control seven moves away, he saw tactical chances: White's queen is temporarily tied to the defense of g2, he lacks luft and Black has a passed pawn. With 1 ... c2! Black forced White to worry about 2 ... ♕b2/3 ... c1(♕). After White replied 2 ♖c1, Black came back with 2 ... ♖c8! and renewed the threat of 3 ... ♕b2! (3 ♖xc2?? ♕a1+). White's response, 3 ♕xe6, attacked the rook. But Black had 3 ... ♖d8! with a threat of 4 ... ♖d1+. White's lack of luft cost him (4 ♖xc2?? ♖d1 mate.) He played 4 ♕b3 but Black found 4 ... ♖d2!. Black was a move away (... ♕d4, ... ♕f6) from serious winning threats. White had no way of untangling himself so he forced a draw with checks at b8 and b2. Black's position became easier to play - even in bad time pressure - once he realized how desperate he had to be. A less clear situation arises when your position is not obviously worse but vulnerable to a bad trend: Some computers evaluate this position as more or less equal. They don't appreciate how useless the bishop would be when Black begins to push his f-pawn. Only when forced to examine 1 ... f5! followed by ... ♕e7/ ... f4 will those programs recognize that Black can make progress. White correctly understood how bad things could get and took the desperate- looking step of 1 ♖xe5! dxe5 2 d6. The White pawn cannot be prevented from reaching d7. On that protected square it will tie at least one Black piece to d8 and free the White queen to raid pawns. Now it was Black who was forced to evaluate his chances. He recognized his winning prospects had evaporated and went for the perpetual check of 2 ... ♕d8 3 ♕d5 ♕g5! and 4 ♕xc5 ♕c1+ 5 ♔h2 ♕f4+ 6 ♔g1 ♕c1+. What it Takes to Lose When queens are traded off the defender can almost always make a more accurate appraisal of his chances than before. That will tell him whether he can rely on passive defense or must seek counterplay, whether he should trade pawns or can await events, and so on. Appraising the position is easier if you know what it takes to lose - or to win. White is lost because his rook is not far enough away to check the Black king when it tries to shepherd the winning f-pawn. For example, 1 ... ♔e3! threatens 2 ... ♖-moves and 3 ... f1(♕). Then 2 ♖e5+ can be met by 2 ... ♔f4!. This attack on the rook gains time for Black and he can win in various ways, such as 3 ♖e8 ♖e1 4 ♖f8+ ♔g3. Yet in the game Black only drew because he didn't know what it takes to win. He played 1 ... ♔xc4??. White recovered with 2 ♖f8!. The rook is then in splendid position to check the king away if it tried to promote the f-pawn (2 ... ♔d4 3 ♖d8+ ♔e5 4 ♖e8+ ♔d6 5 ♖f8 etc.). Black's only winning try lies in advancing the a-pawn. But after ♔a2 White can just pass with his rook or check. For example, 2 ... a5 3 ♖f7 a4 4 ♖f8! a3+ 5 ♔a2 (not 5 ♔xa3?? ♖a1+ or 5 ♔c2?? a2) ♔d3 6 ♖d8+ ♔e3 7 ♖e8+ ♔d2 8 ♖d8+ ♔c2 9 ♖f8 is one of many drawing lines. The defender is typically torn between impulses. The first is to play actively: "I want to force a draw. I don't want to give him a chance to find a way to win." The second is passive: "Come and get me. My position is solid. I'm not going to do something rash that might lose." Both are valid attitudes. In most cases, one is better than the other. In some cases, much better. This kind of position rarely occurs in master games - because masters would have agreed to a draw earlier. The reason is that if Black allows a trade of pawns, the result is likely to reach the famously drawn 'Philidor position.' And if he doesn't trade pawns he has no way to make progress. White doesn't have to do anything but 'pass' with his rook along the fourth rank to stop ... ♔g4. For example, 1 ♖b4 ♖a6 2 ♖c4 ♖a3+ 3 ♔g2 ♔h5 and now 4 ♖h4+ ♔g5 5 ♖b4 ♔f6 6 ♖b6+ ♔g5 7 ♖b4. Or 2 ... ♔f6 3 ♖b4 g5 4 ♖c4 g4+ 5 ♔f4 or even 5 ♔g2 ♔g5 6 ♖b4. Notice that in this last line White can also play actively and try to force a Philidor-like position with 3 g4. Play might go 3 ... ♖a3+ 4 ♔g2 ♔g5 5 gxf5 gxf5 and now 6 ♖b4 (pass) f4 7 ♖b8 ♔g4 8 ♖g8+ draws. But the last diagram could be a study: How can White lose in one (reasonable) move? He did it with 1 g4??. White wanted to force a draw, not wait for it. But active defense was a disastrous choice here. Black replied 1 ... ♖e4!. Now White faces a dismal choice between giving up a second pawn (2 ♖a8 ♖xg4) or the equally lost pawn ending, 2 ♖xe4 fxe4+ 3 ♔xe4 ♔xg4 or 3 ♔g3 e3 4 ♔f3 e2. Even in a battle between two of the world's top-20 players, a defender can make a losing choice between active and passive. If the pawn on f5 didn't exist White would have known that 1 ♖h3! is the road to Philidor. The c-pawn is irrelevant: 1 ... ♖xc5 2 ♔f1 (or 2 ♖a3, 2 ♖b3 etc.). If Black pushes his advanced pawn, 1 ... f3, the draw is obvious after 2 ♖h8! (2 ... ♔e3 3 ♖e8+ ♔f4 4 ♖g8 or 4 ♖e7 or 4 ♔f1). But White was hypnotized by that extra pawn and felt he had to play 1 ♖c8?. He was not lost - yet. But after 1 ... f3: White can still draw by putting his rook in a position to give check, with, 2 ♖a8, 2 ♖b8, 2 ♖d8, or to check immediately, 2 ♖e8+. But he blundered with 2 c6?? and resigned after 2 ... f2+ in view of 3 ♔f1 ♔f3 and ... ♖c1 mate. (In fact, 2 ♔f1 would also draw because then 2 ... f2 would alert White to play 2 ♖a8, 2 ♖b8 etc. The opposite side of the coin is shown by this. Passive play is fatal: Since Black only has one pawn, its elimination would, at worst, leave White to defend K+R-vs.-K+R+B. That is a difficult endgame but it is drawable with best play. Therefore White should get rid of the Black pawn by means of f2-f3 and g3- g4!. But White played 1 f4?, depriving himself of the pawn-trading option. Worse, it fixed his f- and -g-pawns on squares where they will ultimately be lost. White held out for a long time but the course of the game, after 1 ... ♖g8 2 ♖b7 ♔d6 3 ♔f2 ♗d7 4 ♖b6+ ♔e7 5 ♖g6 ♔f7 6 ♖d6 ♗e6 7 ♖a6 ♖xg7, was determined. New Defense in the Endgame If New Defense has given us any insight into the endgame it is an emphasis on - guess what? - counterplay. Here's how we look today at one of the great endings of the past. This endgame has found its way into dozens of textbooks. It was used as a model of how to make slow progress: 1 ♖c3 ♖a4 2 ♖d3 ♔e7 3 ♔g3 ♔e6 4 ♔f3 ♔d5 5 ♔e2 g5! (Not 5 ... ♖xd4? 6 ♔e3! when White's outside passed pawn allows him to draw the pawn ending). Black won after 6 ♖b3 f6 7 ♔e3 ♔c4 8 ♖d3 d5! 9 ♔e2 ♖a7 10 ♔d2 ♖e7! 11 ♖c3+ ♔xd4. Although White wrote a book about rook endgames his play is much worse than analysts have given him credit. As Russian GM Alexey Bezgodov put it, he played at about the level of an Expert. The real lesson of this game should be: Rook endings reward active play and punish passivity. Grab your hand whenever it tries to make a passive rook move. One way to start is 1 ♖a2, getting behind the passed pawn and threatening to tie up Black's rook after 2 a4, 3 a5, etc. Black should blockade, 1 ... ♖a4!. But after 2 ♔g3 White's king races to break the blockade, e.g. 2 ... ♔e7 3 ♔f3 ♔e6 4 ♔e4 and then 4 ... f5+ 5 ♔d3 ♔d5 6 ♔c3, for example. When Black captures on d4 he releases the a-pawn, e.g. 2 ... ♖xd4 3 a4!. Yes, Black can re-establish the blockade with 3 ... ♖b4 4 a5 ♖b7 5 a6 ♖a7. But then his pieces are too passive to make progress after 6 ♔f4 ♔e7 7 ♔e4 ♔e6 8 ♖a5!. White could also have drawn with another active use of the rook, 1 ♖c6! ♔e7 2 ♖c7+ ♔f6 3 ♖c6! ♔e6 4 ♖c7! and then 4 ... ♖xa3 5 d5+! (5 ... ♔xd5 6 ♖xf7) ♔f6 6 ♖d7! ♖a6 7 h4. Black has no way to make progress. Passing fails (7 ... ♖b6 8 ♔g3). And there's another way to draw with an active rook. After the game went 1 ♖c3? ♖a4 White could have played 2 ♔g3! ♖xd4 3 ♖c8+ ♔e7 4 ♖a8! and again he has made his rook active. Black will eventually have to trade his d-pawn for the White a-pawn, e.g. 4 ... ♖d3+ 5 f3 g5 6 a4 ♖a3 7 a5 d5 8 a5! d5 9 a6 d4 10 ♖a7+ ♔e6 11 ♖a8 d3 12 ♖d8!. There are still other ways to draw, after the game went 2 ♖d3? ♔e7. Even here active play is rewarded: 3 ♖e3+! ♔d7 4 ♖f3! f6 5 ♖g3! g5 6 h4!. Just keep the rook active! The Insufficient Extra Pawn A good defender knows a basic difference: If he is down two pawns, his position is almost certainly lost. But if he is down only one pawn, the outcome depends on other factors. Those factors are the identity of what other pieces are on the board, how many pawns are left and where they are. That sounds like a lot of information but it gets easier to sort out as you gain experience. For example, one extra pawn is usually not enough to win if it's a rook ending and all the pawns are on the kingside. In the next example, White has much better chances if he can trade rooks rather than knights. He should proceed slowly, such as with 1 g3 and 2 ♖c7 or 2 ♖c6. He should avoid the immediate 1 ♖c6 because 1 ... ♘e5! would force knights off the board. A key point is 2 ♖xf6 ♘xf3+ 3 ♖xf3?? allows 3 ... ♖e1 mate. That means 3 gxf3 would be forced. The pawn structure that results is highly drawish. Endgame books show many examples of R+f-pawn+h-pawn-versus-R that are drawn. In the game, White made it easier, with 1 g4?. Then 1 ... ♘e5! either wins the g- pawn or trades knights. White played 2 ♘xe5 ♖xe5. Black was able to swap a pair of pawns, 3 ♔g2 h5!, and a draw was agreed soon after 4 f4 ♖e2+ 5 ♔f3 ♖xh2 6 ♔g3 ♖a2 7 gxh5 ♖a5 8 ♔g4 ♔g7. White's king cannot advance and his lone rook cannot promote the passed h- pawn. After benefiting from active moves (1 ... ♘e5! and 3 ... h5!) Black can now rely on passive defense: He can just pass. In fact, Black could also draw with other passes such as 8 ... ♖b5. The more generic drawable endings you know, the greater your ability to steer out of a dubious middlegame. For example, even with more pawns on the kingside in a rook ending, the defender has excellent drawing chances when he's only one pawn down. Black's pinned pawn at c5 appears to be doomed by ♘d2-b3xc5. Black can't change the situation by 1 ... cxb4?? 2 ♖xc7 or 1 ... ♘b6 2 ♖xc5. However, he saved himself with a forcing sequence, beginning with 1 ... e4!. The worst would be behind him after 2 ♖xe4 cxb4!. The same goes for 2 ♘d4 ♘e5! because of 3 ♖xc5 ♖xc5 4 bxc5 ♘d3! and 5 ... ♖xc5. The crucial line goes 2 ♕xe4 ♕xe4 3 ♖xe4 cxb4. White can improve his winning chances with 4 ♖e8+! ♖xe8 5 ♖xc7. Material is still equal but White's powerfully placed rook must win at least a pawn. If Black tries to swap off all the queenside pawns, say with 5 ... ♘f6 6 ♖xa7 ♖c8 White retains chances with 7 ♔f1. Even worse is trading rooks, with 5 ... ♘b6 6 ♖xa7 ♖a8? because 7 ♖xa8+ ♘xa8 9 ♘d4 offers strong winning chances. Knight endgames are often much more winnable than rook endings with the same pawns. Black's saving grace was 5 ... ♘e5! and 6 ♘xe5 ♖xe5 7 ♖xa7 h5 6 h3 ♖b5. White cannot avoid ... b3/axb3/ ... ♖xb3. What will be left is K+R+4Ps-vs.- K+R+3Ps. But since all the pawns will be on the kingside and Black has no real weakness there, a draw is the most likely result. White tried to win with 7 g4 hxg4 8 hxg4 g6 9 ♔g2 b3 10 axb3 ♖xb3 11 g5 ♔g7 12 ♔g3. But he couldn't penetrate Black's position and a draw was eventually agreed, after 12 ... ♖c3 13 ♖e7 ♖a3 14 ♖d7 ♔f8 15 ♖c7 ♔g7 16 ♖c8 ♔h7 17 ♖c7 ♔g7 etc. Trick Positions There are a few unusual drawable positions that violate many endgame principles. A good defender knows them. Many of these involve rook pawns. Any good endgame textbook will show you the cases when K+Q-vs.-K+P is drawn if the defender has a rook pawn (or a bishop pawn) that is on the seventh and protected by a king. You can also find the notorious case of K+B+RP-vs.-K which is a draw when the defender's king can reach the queening square and that square cannot be attacked by the bishop. In addition, K+R+P-vs.-K+R may be drawn when it's a rook pawn - but quite lost in similar positions with any other pawn. This is confusing to many amateurs because it is generally bad for the defender to be facing a RP in cases of K+N+P- vs.-K+N or K+B+P-vs.-K+same colored B. In the simplest endgame of all, with just kings and a pawn (or two), the rook pawn often saves the defender. This looks resignable because White will win the a-pawn. For example, 1 ... ♔d4 can be met by 2 ♔d6 ♔c3 3 ♔c5 ♔b2 and now 4 a4! ♔xb3 5 ♔b5 ♔c3 6 ♔xa5. Black's king cannot get back in time to stop promotion, It gets shouldered out by the enemy king (6 ... ♔c4 7 ♔b6 ♔d5 8 a5 ♔d6 9 a6). A better try is 1 ... ♔d5 but White reaches the same positions after 2 a4. Yet Black drew with 1 ... a4!. The main point is 2 bxa4 ♔d5 3 ♔d7 ♔c5 and ... ♔b4xa4 also dooms the a2-pawn. A secondary point is that after White found 2 b4! ... ... Black replied 2 ... a3!. He will either win the b-pawn (3 b5 ♔d5) or the a-pawn (3 ♔d7 ♔d4 4 b5 ♔c3 5 b6 ♔b2 6 b7 ♔xa2). Special Cases: Bishops of Opposite Color There are also a few other special situations a defender should know. Even if there are pawns on both wings, you can often draw one pawn or even two pawns down when there are bishops of opposite color. Leonhardt - Teichmann, Karlsbad 1907
1 e4 e5 2 ♘f3 ♘c6 3 ♘c3 ♘f6 4 ♗b5 ♗b4 5 O-O O-O 6 d3 d6 7 ♗g5 ♘e7 8 ♗xf6
gxf6 9 ♘h4 c6 10 ♗c4 b5 11 ♗b3 ♗c5? 12 ♕h5 ♔g7 13 ♘e2 ♘g6 Black dodged disaster because 14 ♘g3 can be met by 14 ... ♘xh4 15 ♕xh4 f5! 16 ♘h5+ ♔h6! and his king is remarkably safe. Play went 14 ♘f5+ ♗xf5 15 exf5 ♘f4! 16 ♘xf4 exf4 17 ♕g4+ ♔h8 18 ♕xf4. Despite White's extra pawn and Black's doubled pawns, a draw is the most likely result simply because of the bishops. Black made a swap of all four rooks virtually inevitable after he took control of the e-file, 18 ... d5 19 d4 ♗d6 20 ♕h4 ♖e8!. Then came 21 ♖ae1 ♖xe1 22 ♖xe1 ♔g7 23 ♕g4+ ♔h8 24 ♕h4 ♔g7 25 c3 ♕d7 26 ♗c2 ♖e8 27 ♖e3 ♖xe3 28 fxe3. White retains remote winning chances if he can play an effective e3-e4. But Black snuffed them out with 28 ... b4 so that if 29 e4 bxc3 30 bxc3 dxe4 and ... c5. The game saw 29 cxb4 ♕b7!, which is better than 29 ... ♗xb4 30 ♕g3+ ♔h6 because it offers counterplay against White's queenside pawns. After 30 a3 a5! White didn't like the looks of 31 bxa5 ♕xb2, so a draw was agreed after 31 ♕g4+ ♔f8 32 ♕h4 ♔g7 33 ♕g4+ ♔f8 34 ♕h4 ♔g7. Fortress Good defenders try to trade pawns when they are behind in material because it reduces the chances of the opponent queening or of winning another pawn. But eliminating enemy pawns is crucial to another drawing technique - the creation of an impregnable fortress. In this position from a candidates match, White seems to have excellent chances of making his extra pawn count because it's a passed queenside pawn. After a routine move of the attacked rook, 1 ... ♖c8, White can secure his king, 2 g3, and prepare to increase pressure with ♕d5/♖b7. Black has no tactical tricks since 1 ... ♕e8, hoping for 2 ♘xc4? ♕xb5 with a draw, is foiled by 2 ♘d7! and 2 ... ♖c7 3 ♖d5. There is one other trap in the position and Black eagerly fell into it, 1 ... ♖xb4! 2 ♘c6, and then 2 ... ♖xb5 3 ♘xe7+ ♗xe7. White's material edge had grown but his winning chances are greatly diminished. He began the final stage with 4 ♕d7 ♖b1+ 5 ♔h2 ♗f8. To win White will need a passed pawn or the penetration of his king - and possibly both. His difficulties are illustrated by 6 g4 ♖b2 7 ♔g3 g5! with a likely draw. The game went 6 f4 h5 7 f5 ♖b6! 8 e4 g6! and the outlines of a fortress were becoming apparent. After 9 fxg6 ♖xg6 Black could shuttle his rook between g6 and e6 forever and draw. White made a valiant effort, 9 ♕d8 ♖d6 10 ♕g5 ♗g7 11 ♕e7 ♗f8 12 ♕g5 ♗g7 13 ♕f4 ♖a6 14 ♕b8+ ♗f8 15 ♕b5 ♖f6 and then 16 ♔h3 gxf5 17 exf5 ♖h6 18 g3. White's king can get as far as g5 but no further because of the Black rook. Play went 18 ... ♖h7 19 ♕e2 ♖h6 20 ♔h4 ♖h7 21 ♕e8 ♖h6 22 ♔g5 ♖h7 23 ♕c8 ♔g7 24 ♕d8 ♔g8. White made one last try, advancing his f-pawn: 25 ♔f4 ♖h6 26 ♔e5 ♔g7 27 ♕g5+ ♔h7 28 f6 and then 28 ... ♔h8 29 ♔e4 ♔h7 30 ♔d5 ♔h8. If the king heads for e8 with 31 ♔c6 Black has 31 ... ♖g6! 32 ♕xh5+ ♔g8 and he wins the f6-pawn (33 ♕e5 ♗g7!) or draws by repetition. White saw the light and agreed to a draw after 31 ♕e5 ♔g8 32 ♔e4 ♖g6 33 ♔f5 ♖g4 34 ♕e3. Simple techniques like trading pawns and obtaining bishops of opposite color and more elaborate ones such as fortress are powerful aids to the defender. But the most important element in drawing an ending is knowing what it takes to lose and when active defense is a must. And now for our final set of quiz positions. Quiz Black has all the winning chances. Evaluate 1 ♘d2. Black can draw easily. How? White's pawn is the more dangerous one. What can Black do? White appears to be a move or two (g2-g3, ♖d1-d7) away from gaining a second extra pawn and a textbook win. How does Black stop him? White's rook is tied to the a-file to prevent queening. But she envisions an iron- clad drawing position. Which? Solutions
1. Black can attack h2 by means of ... ♖h5 (after ... ♗g4, for example). If White
defends with h2-h3, Black would win with ... ♗xh3. This explains 1 ♕g1!, an extreme example of the principle of economy. Yes, White is using his best piece to defend just one square. But this is less of a concession than h2-h3. White's advantage emerged after 1 ... ♗g4 2 ♖a5 ♗e2 3 ♘b3 ♗b4 4 ♖a4 ♖b8 5 ♘e5 ♖bb5 6 ♘xc6, White would also have had the edge after 1 ... ♗xc5 2 dxc5 ♖xc5 3 ♘d6.
2. Giving up castling, 1 ... ♖g8 or 1 ... ♔f8, is too great a concession. But 1 ... g6 2
♗b5! is a problem (2 ... ♖d8 3 O-O and ♗c6 at some point). Best is 1 ... O-O even though it costs the Exchange, 2 ♗h6 g6 3 ♗xf8 ♗xf8. By changing the nature Black has strong counterchances such as 4 ♗b5 ♗h6 or, as the game went, 4 ♗e2? ♗h6 5 ♖c2 ♘f4 6 O-O ♗xg2, with advantage.
3. Black looked at 1 ... g6 2 ♘f6+ and considered it lost (2 ... ♗xf6 3 ♕xf6 cxb2 4
♗h6 ♕xf1+ 5 ♕xf1 and ♕b1xb2; 2 ... ♔h8 3 ♖h4 h5 4 ♖xh5+; 2 ... ♔g7 3 ♗h6+). "Desperation is in order," he wrote about the move he played, 1 ... f5!?. After 2 ♖xg7+ ♔h8 he would still lose after 3 ♕g3!, threatening ♖xh7+ and ♕g7 mate. For instance, 3 ... ♗f6 4 ♖xf5 cxb2 5 ♖xh7+! ♔xh7 6 ♘xf6+ ♖xf6 7 ♖h5+. But White found what looks like a simpler win, 3 ♕h3. The threat is 4 ♖xh7+! ♔xh7 5 ♘f6+ ♔g7 6 ♕h7+ ♔xf6 7 ♖xf5 mate. But Black had time for 3 ... ♕xf1+! 4 ♔xf1 cxb2. Without a rook at f1, the threat of queening prompted White to force a perpetual check, 5 ♖xh7+ ♔xh7 6 ♘f4+ ♔g8 7 ♕g3+ ♔h7 8 ♕g6+ ♔h8 9 ♕h6+.
4. The least expensive defense against the threat is 1 ... ♖e8!. Then on 2 d6 he
replied 2 ... ♘d5. Black has an edge after 3 ♕d3 ♕b6 (4 ♘bd2 h6 5 ♗h4 ♘f4! 6 ♕f1 ♖ac8) or, as the game went, 3 ♗xd8 ♖xe2. Better for White was 2 ♖e1 since that forces the move Black has been trying to avoid, 2 ... f6. Black would be better after 3 d6 ♘d5.
5. Black wins after 1 ♗xg5? fxg5 2 ♘xg5+ ♔f6! - a move that defends and
attacks. For example, 3 ♕f3+ ♔xg5!. White played 3 ♖xe6+, hoping for 3 ... ♖xe6 4 ♕f3+. But he resigned after 3 ... ♔xg5! 4 ♕f3 ♖c1+ 5 ♔g2 ♘h4+ 6 ♔g3 ♖g1+.
6. Black is as entitled to tactics as White. He won a pawn with 1 ... ♗xg4!, based
on 2 ♗xf6 ♗xf3 and 2 ♗xg4 ♘xg4 3 ♕xg4 ♗xd4+ (or 3 ♗xg7 ♕h5!, threatening mate on h2).
7. The position was roughly balanced before 1 f4?. That's an unjustified
attacking move that Black began to punish with 1 ... ♗d5!. White's pawns would be over-extended after 2 e4 ♖e8 3 ♖e3 ♗b7. So he maneuvered his heavy pieces, 2 ♖d2 ♗e4! 3 ♕f2, while Black made progress with 3 ... ♖d7 4 ♕g3 ♖e8 5 ♕f2 ♗d3!. The e-pawn is falling (6 ♖c1 ♖de7 7 ♖e1? ♕xd4! 8 exd4 ♖xe1+) and Black won after 6 ♖c1 ♖de7 7 ♘f3 ♖xe3.
8. Black violated the rule against making new weaknesses with 1 ... f5!. White
would get nowhere from 2 ♕g3+ ♔h7 3 ♖fd1 ♘c5. He penetrated the eighth rank, 2 ♖fd1 ♘c5 3 ♖d8. But the improved communication of Black pieces stopped him, 3 ... ♕f7 4 ♖xe8 ♕xe8, and Black took over the initiative after 5 ♗d4 ♘e4 6 f3 e5! 7 fxe4 exd4.
9. Yes, 1 ... f6! is much better. It is based tactically on 2 ♘xf6+ ♗xf6 3 ♕xf6 ♖f8 4
♕-moves ♖xf3! since 5 gxf3 ♕xf3 leads to mate. It is based positionally on the superior pawn structure that Black will have after ... e5. He won after 2 ♗h6 O-O 3 ♗xg7 ♔xg7 4 ♖fe1 e5 5 b4 ♖ad8 and ... ♘e6-f4.
10. Black can't safely castle kingside. Delaying a decision about his king (1 ... e6
2 O-O ♗d6 3 ♖ae1) doesn't help.
It's time for an ugly move, 1 ... ♔d8!, to get the king to safety at b8. One possible line would run 2 O-O ♔c7 3 ♔h1 ♔b8 and Black stands well.
11. Endgames should favor Black's superior pawns. He won after 1 ... h5! 2 ♖af1
♕g4!.
12. The first two options allow the dangerous h-file to be opened. Black may be
able to escape with his material - computers tend to like 1 ... gxh5 2 ♖xh5 ♗f6 and 3 ♖g1 ♕d7. But for humans, the safest policy is 1 ... g5! since after 2 ♗xg5 Black is still a pawn ahead and the pawn at h5 is usefully 'dead.' The game went 2 ... ♕d6 3 ♖h4. Then 3 ... g3 4 ♖g4 ♔h8 is wrong because 5 ♗xe7! wins. Black gave back a second extra pawn with 3 ... ♘f6! 4 ♗xf6 ♕xf6 5 ♖xg4+ ♔h8 and had a strong attack (6 ♖g6? ♗f4! wins).
13. Black is safe after 1 ♗xh6 gxh6 2 ♖xh6 ♗f6. But in the longer run, g7 and
h6 can become targets after ♘g3-f5. Black made a wise decision to eliminate White's good bishop with 1 ... ♗g5!. Black stood well after 2 ♗xg5 ♕xg5 3 ♖h5 ♕g6 with ideas such as ... ♘f6-h7-g5. The weakest target on the board then is at f3. He got the edge following 4 ♘g3 ♘f6 5 ♘f5 ♗xf5 6 exf5? ♕e8 with the idea of ... e4. White's 7 ♖xh6? sacrifice was unsound and lost after 7 ... gxh6 8 ♖xh6 e4 9 ♕e3 ♕e5+ 10 ♔c1 ♖a1.
14. He can reinforce his king position with 1 ... ♖f8! followed by ... ♘e8 and ...
f6. This works because 2 ♘h5 ♘e8 3 ♗xg7 fails to 3 ... ♕g5!, threatening mate on g2 as well as ... ♘xg7. Black was better when a draw was agreed, after 3 ♖e3 f6 4 ♗d4.
15. No, Black seized the edge with 1 ... e5! 2 dxe5 ♗f5. He had good winning
chances after 3 ♖e2 ♗g4! 4 ♖ae1 ♗xf3 5 gxf3 ♖xe5.
16. He should flee. After 1 ... ♔f7! 2 g4 ♔e8! 3 ♖h2 ♔d7 Black was secure.
White's king could have been the more vulnerable one after 4 ♘g3 ♕f7 5 gxf5 gxf5 6 ♖h5 ♖g8. In the game White preferred 5 ♔g2 fxg4 6 ♗e3 and Black seized the initiative after 6 ... ♖h8.
17. With 1 ... ♗c8! Black reinforces the kingside with a piece that wasn't doing
much on b7. He looks at 2 ... ♗xf5 and is able to meet 2 ♗xe4 dxe4 3 ♖h3 h6 4 ♘xh6+ gxh6 5 ♕xh6 with 5 ... ♗xh3!. (In the game White played 5 ♖g3+ ♔h7 6 ♖xf7+ ♖xf7 7 ♕xf7+ ♔h8 and lost.) On the other hand, 1 ... g6 2 ♕h6! gxf5 3 ♗xe4 dxe4 would have walked into 4 ♖h3 ♕g7 5 ♖g3.
18. Once White's strong bishop is traded off and his d-pawn is block aded, his
weakened king position and the pawn at b2 will matter most. The game went 1 ... ♕b6 2 ♖d2 ♗f8! 3 ♖2e2 ♗d6! 4 ♕c1 g5! 5 ♗xd6 ♕xd6. White's d-pawn had gone from a strength to a weakness. His best chance for survival lay on the kingside but Black had the better chances there and won after 6 ♖f1 ♖f8 7 ♖2f2 ♗e8! 8 ♘f3 ♖g7 9 ♕d2 h5!.
19. White would have a strong attack after 1 ... fxg6 2 hxg6 hxg6 3 ♖dg1 or 2 ... h6
3 ♗xh6! gxh6 4 ♕xh6 (4 ... ♗f6 5 g7! ♗xg7 6 ♖dg1 and wins). With 1 ... ♗f6! and 2 ♖dg1 ♗a8 Black safeguarded g7 and began opera tions on the b-file. After 3 ♗g5 ♗e5 4 gxh7+ he avoided the dead pawn (4 ... ♔h8? 5 h6 g6 6 f4!) with 4 ... ♔xh7. Black can keep lines closed after 5 h6 g6 6 f4 ♗h8 (7 f5 ♘xe4). White tried to block the b-file with 5 ♘b3? and overlooked 5 ... ♘xc2! (6 ♕xc2 ♖xb3: 6 ♘xc5 ♘a3+! 7 ♔a2 ♕xc5 8 ♘a4 ♘c2! 9 ♔b1 ♕a3 and wins).
20. Black should realize that White has an attack brewing with g2-g4-g5.
Moreover, he should see that 1 ... dxc4? 2 ♘xc4 favors White's space and development edge. And he should understand that counterplay with 1 ... b5! is good. His attack would come first after 2 cxb5?! axb5 3 ♗xb5 ♗d7 or 3 ♘xb5 e5 4 ♗g3 ♗a6 and 4 ♕xc6 ♗d7 5 ♕c2 ♗xb5. In the game White was worse after 2 cxd5 exd5 3 g4 ♗e6.
21. In the center, with 1 ... f6! since 2 fxe6? fxe5 would give Black fine play. The
game went 2 exf6 ♗xf6 3 fxe6 d4! and Black had ample compensation. A draw resulted after 4 e7 ♕xe7 5 ♗xd4 ♗xd4 6 ♕xd4 ♕g5.
22. With the counterattack 1 ... ♕e7! 2 gxh6 ♕h4! Black has at least perpetual
check, e.g. 3 hxg7 ♗h3+ 4 ♔g1 ♕g3+ or 3 ♗xd5 ♗h3+ 4 ♔g1 ♕g3+ 5 ♗g2 ♗xg2 6 ♕xg2 ♕e1+.
23. With 1 ... ♖xd3! 2 ♖xd3 ♗e4 Black sharply reduced White's attacking
chances (3 ♖g3 ♕xc4 4 ♗xg7? ♗f5! 5 ♕h5 ♗xg7 6 ♕xh6 ♗g6). His loss of the Exchange was offset by winning a pawn, 3 ♖d2 ♕xc4. White set some traps and offered a second pawn, 4 ♖fd1 ♗d5 (else ♖d8!) 5 h3 f5 (not 5 ... ♕xa2 6 ♖xd5!) 6 ♕g6 ♕xf4. The end-result was a hard-fought draw after 7 ♖xd5! ♕e3+ 8 ♔h1 exd5 9 ♕xf5 ♖d8 10 ♖xd5 ♕c1+ 11 ♔h2 ♗d6+ 12 ♗e5 ♗c7!.
24. The less risky alternative to 1 h4 ♘xh4 2 gxh4 g3+ 3 ♔g1 ♕xh4 is 1 ♖xf5!
♗xf5 2 h4!. The attack is over and White pressure on the f-file and her great knight offers solid compensation. After 2 ... ♔b8 3 ♕e3 ♗c8 4 ♖f1 she can continue with ♖f4 and ♕f2 to tie Black to the f7-pawn while she prepares to attack with b2-b3 and c3-c4. Black decided to minimize her losing chances by trading rooks with 4 ... f6 5 ♖xf6 ♖gf8 6 ♖xf8 ♕xf8. But White was at least equal and following 7 ♘d3 ♕f5 8 ♘f4 ♕c2 she should have played to win with 9 e6! (9 ... ♕f5 10 b3! and c3-c4) rather than head for the draw as she did (9 ♕e2 ♕xe2 10 ♘xe2).
25. It's tempting to try 1 ... gxf5 2 ♕xf5 and defend against ♕xh7 mate with 2 ...
♘f6. Then 3 ♗g5 ♖e8! allows Black to escape and win. But this overlooks 3 ♗h6!, which threatens 4 ♕g5+ and ♕g7 mate. Then on 3 ... ♔h8 White has 4 ♗g5! with mate to follow ♗xf6+. Even if you didn't see all that, 1 ... ♗g5! was a good positional choice. Black got the edge after 2 ♕g4 ♗xc1 3 ♖axc1 ♘g7! (not 3 ... ♘xb2 4 ♘e7+) 4 ♘xg7 ♔xg7 and won the good-♘-vs.-bad-♗ position.
26. Black deserves more than perpetual check (1 ... ♔xg7 2 ♕g5+ ♔h8 3 ♕f6+).
But he shouldn't allow 2 ♗f6 or 2 ♕g5. The right response to the sacrifice was 1 ... ♕f5!. Black had the edge af ter 2 ♗h6 ♖e2! 3 ♕g5+ ♕xg5 4 ♗xg5 ♗e5! 5 ♖d1 ♗xb2 (or 5 ♖b1? ♗d4+!) and won the endgame.
27. Not 1 ... h6?, which loses to 2 ♗xh6! (2 ... ♘g8 3 ♗g5+ ♘h6 allows 4 f6!).
Once again the saving move is 1 ... ♔g8!. White grabbed the pawn, 2 ♗xf6 ♗xf6 3 ♕xh7+ ♔f8, lost the initiative after 4 ♕h8+ ♔e7 5 ♕h5 ♖d7 6 ♖e1+ ♔d8 7 ♖xe8+ ♔xe8 8 ♕h8+? ♔e7, and allowed Black a winning counterattack following 9 ♘d1 d4 10 ♕g8 ♕e5. There were better ways to play after 2 ♗xf6 but White might have been content to play 2 ♖g3, threatening ♗xf6. Then Black has nothing better than 2 ... ♔h8 - after which 3 ♖h3! ♔g8! leads to a draw by repetition (Not 2 ... ♔f8? 3 ♗h6!).
28. The position would be tactically dangerous if ♘xe7 or e6xf7 deliv ered check.
Black's 1 ... ♔h8! eliminated the checks. It had an additional benefit of threatening to trap the White bishop with ... ♘g8 and ... f6. For example, 2 ♖ad1 ♘g8! 3 ♘xe7 ♘xe7 4 ♗xe7 f6!. White replied 2 e5 dxe5 3 fxe5 but 3 ... ♘xd5! 4 ♘xd5 ♕xc6 was good. Now 5 ♘xe7?? is not check and allows 5 ... ♕xg2 mate. Play went 5 e6! because 5 ... fxe6 6 ♘f4! would have exploited the king's position at h8. Black played 5 ... ♘e5! and won after 6 ♖xe5? ♗xe5 7 exf7 (not check!) ♖f8 8 h3? ♖xf7 9 ♘f4 ♖xf4!. Afterwards it was pointed out that 6 ♗h6! was the right way: 6 ... f6 7 ♖xe5! fxe5 8 ♖f1 threatens ♖f7 (8 ... ♖f8? 9 ♗xg7+ ♔xg7 10 ♕xe7+). Black's best is the equality of 8 ... ♕xe6 9 ♘c7.
29. With 1 ... h5! Black halted White's kingside plans and created the prospect of
... ♘g4. Play went 2 ♔b1 ♘b6! 3 ♘d2? ♘g4! 4 ♗xe7 ♕xe7 and after 5 ♘f1 ♖xc3! 6 bxc3 d5 7 ♕e2 O-O Black had a winning attack.
30. Why give White chances when you can force at least a draw with 1 ... ♖c2! (2
♘xc2? ♗xc2+ and 3 ... ♕xe3). The game went 2 b3 ♗xb3! 3 axb3 ♖c3 with a draw, in view of 4 hxg7 ♖xb3+ 5 ♘xb3 ♕xb3+ 6 ♔a1! ♕a3+ (not 6 ♔c1? ♖c8+ 7 ♔d2 ♖c2+ and wins).
31. Both the overprotective 1 ... g6 and 1 ... ♕f7 2 ♕h3 ♗g6 3 ♕g4 ♔g8 (as Black
played) are good. But 1 ... ♗g6? just drops a piece (2 ♕xg6). And 1 ... ♗f7? is also bad because it would give Tal a chance to be Tal. He would start with 2 ♖xh7+ ♔xh7 3 ♖h1+ ♔g8 4 ♘g4!, which threatens ♘h6+. After 4 ... ♗e7 5 ♕h3 White would threaten ♕h8 mate as well as ♘h6+/ ♕xd7. This could have been one of Tal's greatest combinations: 5 ... ♔f8 6 ♗h6! ♗g8 7 ♗xg7+! ♔xg7 8 ♖g1! ♔f8 9 ♕h6+ ♔f7 10 ♘e5+! and mates.
32. It's not perpetual check because 2 ... ♔h8 3 ♕f6+ ♔g8 4 ♘f5! forces Black
to give up his queen. Black defended well with 1 ... ♕g4! 2 ♗xf6 c5! 3 ♘c2 ♕g6!. He confused White's pieces with 4 ♖f1 ♗e4 5 ♘e3 ♖ae8 6 h3 ♖e6! 7 ♘g4 h5! and won.
33. He can steal the initiative with 1 ... ♖c8+! 2 ♘xc8 ♕c7+!. Then 3 ♔d2 would
be met by 3 ... ♕a5+! 4 ♔c1 ♖xc8+. White chose 3 ♔b1 but Black had the edge following 3 ... ♖xc8 4 ♖6f2 ♗e6 7 ♕h5 b5 and 8 ... ♕a5.
34. With 1 ... ♔f7? Black leaves his king in potential danger after 2 ♖xe5 (2 ...
♔g8 3 ♕h4 and ♗f6). Black escaped to the queenside with 1 ... ♔d6! 2 dxe5+ ♔c7 and won after 3 e6 ♖g8 4 ♗f4+ ♗d6 5 ♗xd6+ ♔xd6 6 ♖d1+ ♔c7 7 ♕f4+ ♔c8. No better is 2 ♕f4 ♖g8! 3 ♖xe5 ♔d7 4 ♕f5+ ♔c7.
35. The a-pawn will cost White a piece and result in an Exchange-up ending with
two pawns apiece on the kingside. The knight should be left at bl so it can be sacrificed on a3 after ... a3. But in the game White lost after 1 ♘d2? ♖b2 2 ♔e3 a3 3 ♗f7 (otherwise the a-pawn queens) a2 4 ♗xa2 ♖xa2 5 ♘f3 ♔g8 6 ♔f4 ♖a4+ 7 ♔f5 ♖a3. The bishop defends better than the short-range knight because it can 'pass' and avoid zugzwang. The rest was 8 ♔f4 ♔f7 9 h5 ♔e6 10 g4 ♖a4+ 11 ♔g3 ♖b4 12 ♘h4 ♔e5 13 ♘f5 ♖b7 (zugzwang) 14 ♔h4 ♔f4 15 ♘d4 ♖b4 16 ♘e2+ ♔f3 17 ♘g1+ ♔g2! 18 ♘e2 ♖b1 19 ♘g3 ♖a1 and White resigned be cause a knight move allows 20 ... ♖h1 mate.
36. With 1 ... h3! and 2 gxh3 ♔e6 he reaches the queening square area and draws.
No better is 2 g4 ♔e6 3 ♔g3 ♔f6 4 ♔xh3 ♔g6, a book draw.
37. Black played 1 ... ♖g6+? 2 e6 and was close to losing. She completed the
collapse with 2 ... ♖g2 3 ♖xf3 ♖d2+ 4 ♔e7 and resigned when she realized the Lucena position was near. Black can draw with 1 ... f2! 2 ♖xf2 ♖a3! and giving checks on the a-file (or 3 ♖c2 ♖a6+ 4 ♖c6 ♖a8). Even after 1 ... ♖g6+? 2 e6 ♖g2 3 ♖xf3 she could have drawn with 3 ... ♖a2! 4 e7 ♖a6+!.
38. The active 1 ... ♖d8! ensures he can double rooks on the seventh rank. That
alone is not enough to draw, as 2 ♖xa7 ♖dd2 3 ♖a3 showed. Now 3 ... ♖xf2 regains a pawn but enables White, with 4 ♖g3+ ♔f8 5 a3! to keep the more valuable a-pawn. A much clearer path to a draw was 3 ... ♔f8!. White had nothing better than 4 ♖f1 ♖xa2 5 ♖xa2 ♖xa2, reaching a 3-to-2 pawn situation on the kingside. A draw was agreed soon after 6 g3 ♔g7 7 ♔g2 ♖b2 8 ♖a1 ♖c2 9 g4 h5! 10 gxh5 ♖c5 and ... ♖xh5 (or 10 g5 ♖c4 11 ♖a3 ♖g3+ 12 ♖g3 ♔g6).
39. With 1 e5+! ♔xe5 2 g4! White's secures a draw. Black's king cannot help
promote the a-pawn, 2 ... ♔d5 3 ♔g2 ♔c5 4 ♖a8 ♔b4 5 ♖a6 because 5 ... ♔b3 (threatening a rook move and queening) will be met by 6 ♖b6+. The other key point is that even if Black managed to achieve ... f5 and trade pawns, the result would look like this. If Black advances the g-pawn to g3 White will let it sit there (not ♔xg3?? because of ... ♖g1+ and queens). Black cannot make progress.

Preface by John Nunn Attacking the enemy king is one of the most exciting parts of chess, but it is also one of the hardest to play accurately. Every chess player has had the experience of seeing a promising-looking attack crumble into dust, whereupon the enemy counter-attack sweeps aside everything in its path. Vukovic's excellent book The Art of Attack in Chess is a thought- provoking attempt to explain why some at- tacks succeed while other fail to reach their goal. The author himself points out that not everything in chess can be reduced to a set of rules, but the general prin- ciples he establishes in this book provide excellent guidance on when to launch an attack and how to ensure that it has the maximum chance of success. As usual with classic books I have edited, I will take a little time to explain ex- actly how I have prepared this new edition. First and foremost is the conversion to algebraic notation. In addition to this, I have added 1 28 extra diagrams and in some cases, where it seemed appropriate, I have added further moves from the quoted games (for example, by giving the actual finish instead of 'and White won in another ten moves'). I have lightly edited the rather ponderous English of the original translation, and brought the method of displaying variations into line with current practice. The index of the original book included only complete games, but I have also indexed the game excerpts. In two of the complete games, Alekhine-Asztalos and Alekhine-Kmoch, I have brought the moves of the game into line with the move-order given in the original tournament books. There are also a fair number of analytical footnotes (readers should note that where there is no room for a footnote on a particular page, the footnote appears on the following page). I hope readers will not form the opinion that Vukovic's analysis was especially unsound - this is certainly not the case. The fact is that most authors are prepared to quote the annotations of famous players uncriti- cally, but Vukovic brought his own talents to bear and subjected all the positions to careful analysis. Quite often the results were startling; in the well-known game Alekhine-Botvinnik, Nottingham 1936 he found a flaw which had eluded the many annotators who simply accepted the version of events Alekhine gave in the tournament book. Inevitably, the high percentage of original analysis implies a greater risk of the occasional slip, but personally I far prefer original comment to a bland recital of the 'party line'. In any case, it is Vukovic's general principles which will prove of most value to the practical player, and here there can be no argument about the enduring quality of his work. Introduction Action is the essential basis on which the game of chess is founded and any ac- tion which contains a threat - i.e. attack in its widest sense - stands out as a prom- inent feature of the game. To the outside observer, a chess game is dominated by the conflict between the two players. The ultimate aim of each player is, as a rule, the mating of the opponent's king, and an action with this aim, whether it is direct or indirect, is called an attack (in a narrower sense of the word) or a mating at- tack; that is the subject of this book. Being the most important action in chess and the central element of the game in ancient times, attack appears at all stages of the game's development and in various forms of perfection. Moreover, it can be said that the reforms which have been made in the rules of chess have always been in the direction of increasing and stimulating the opportunities for attack. The great reform of c. 1485, which created modern European chess, was par- ticularly responsible for opening up new opportunities for attack and ushered in a period of rich development in chess technique. For three centuries of chess his- tory, attack predominated over defence in the practice of the great players, and mastery at that time meant skill in conducting an attack. Only with Philidor did the first positional ideas appear, and with them more mature defensive strategies; these were to find in Steinitz a century later a legislator of genius. During the classic era of chess from Morphy to Steinitz and on to Lasker the value placed on attack gradually decreased, for with greater positional under- standing the foundations were also provided for the perfection of defensive technique. This, however, was followed by a new period in which Capablanca, and particularly Alekhine, perfected the technique of attack, above all that of the attack on the castled position, founded on exact positional play. With Alekhine the aggressive and dynamic style of play reached a zenith; in the period which followed the tide again turned away gradually from the risks of the direct attack in search of new paths. The main reason for this is not to be found in any weak- ness inherent in the attacking style, but in the simple fact that, given the condi- tions of present-day tournaments, it is more profitable and advantageous to make a study of openings. Now, it must be understood that the present theory of open- ings represents a detailed development of Nimzowitsch's ideas concerning the central squares. There are still many gaps to be filled and there is a wealth of op- portunity for innovation; as a result, great masters are inclined to concern Introduction 7 themselves intensively with openings and to opt for a 'safety-first' style. When this source of opening innovations begins to dry up, the problem of attack will present itself once more. The time may even come when the principles on which Alekhine built up his attacks will be completely understood, and those ideas which in the case of Alekhine had the appearance of a spark of genius will take on the more approachable aspect of attacking technique. It will be more conve- nient to discuss these questions at the end of the book. At this point it should be enough to point out that there exists an extremely large group of chess players, who are no longer beginners nor, on the other hand, masters or point-hunters, but players who aim primarily at deriving an aesthetic satisfaction from the game. For such players an attacking game is more attractive than positional technique and they will continue to attack regardless of risk, for their stormy contests are not going to be noted down in theoretical textbooks. So why should such play- ers not become acquainted with the general principles of attack and why should they not perfect themselves in that style of chess with which they are most at home? Various kinds of attack We have said that we shall deal with attack in its narrower, or proper, sense, where it involves a direct or indirect threat to the opponent's king. Attacks of this kind can be distinguished according to the following categories. 1 ) The main action is not in fact an attack on the king, but there is the possibil- ity of such an attack latent in the position; some threat or other is being nurtured, or else the attack is concealed in at least one variation. Let us take the following position as an example (D): The Art of Attack in Chess Here White makes the normal positional move 1 d4, which obviously does not represent an attack against the black king; but in one variation it contains the ele- ments of mate. That is, if Black is careless, and plays for example l..Bb7?, there then follows 2 dxc5, and Black has lost a pawn, since 2...Nxc5? is answered by 3 Rd4, attacking the knight and also threatening mate on g7. 2) A player's action really does contain a direct threat to his opponent's king, but his opponent can stave off this threat at a certain price, e.g. by giving up ma- terial or spoiling his position. The vast majority of attacks in fact fall into this very wide category. A simple example is given by this position: White plays 1 g5, carrying out an attack on h7. Black has three practical al- ternatives l...g6, l...Nf6, and l...Nf8. If l...g6, then 2 £}e4 with the threat of which gains a tempo; however, White's main plan will be a further attack based on the weaknesses on the dark squares in the region of the king arising from the move ...g6. If White will no doubt again continue his attacking play, e.g. with 2 Af4, preparing for Be5. However, on l...Nf8, attacking play does not promise success, and White will be content with a positional alternative, playing 2 £}e4. Then Black cannot really prevent 3 Nc5, after which the knight will have a strong position on c5 and the black bishop will be poorly placed on b7. 3) The attacker carries out an uncompromising mating attack, in which he can invest even a considerable amount of material, as long as he is certain of mating in the end. This is the third and highest degree of attack. We can categorize attack in another way if we take castling into account. Thus we have: Introduction 9 1) Attack before castling, i.e. against a king which has not yet castled, and 2) Attack against the castled king. Attack can also be divided on the basis of so-called mating patterns; of focal- points; of basic formations of pieces, files, ranks, and diagonals; of basic sacri- fices; as well as by the stage which the attack has reached. These divisions ac- cording to the spatial, material, and temporal aspects of an attack will help us arrange the material so as to reveal the part played by each factor. The basic pattern of mate For mate to be obtained, the king must be deprived of nine squares if it is in the middle of the board, six squares if it is on the edge, or four if it is in the corner. Some of these squares may be blocked by the king's own supporting pieces, but the rest must be taken by the attacker through the agency of his own pieces or pawns. If all the squares surrounding the king are taken from it - some through being blocked, others by being 'in check' - and if the square on which the king stands is also in check and without means of defence, then the king is check- mated. This is well known, and it seems rather banal to start out from this basic pattern or anatomy of mate; but in fact certain elementary rules can be formu- lated only on this basis. In the next position Black, to move, is unable to avoid mate in 4 different vari- ations. He is threatened by 2 .g7# (first mating pattern). If he plays there fol- lows 2 Bg7# (second mating pattern); moving the knight leads to 2 Re6# (third mating pattern); while if l...gxf5, we get 2 .g7+ Ne4 3 Rxd4# (fourth mating pattern).
10 The Art of Attack in Chess
The final or mating position is called the mating pattern, and this term is espe- cially useful when such a pattern is worth remembering. A mating pattern can be typical (i.e. one which frequently occurs) or atypical. We call a mate (or mating pattern) pure if none of the squares concerned is covered by two or more attack- ing units. Thus l...€)e2 2 Re6 is a pure mate, whereas l... f6 2 .g7 is not, though it would be if we were to remove the bishop on f5. Pure mates are valued in chess problems, but in practical play they are unimportant. In the mating patterns which we have seen, some of the black king's flight squares have been blocked by its own pieces, while the rest have been covered by the opponent's forces. The sum of these combined factors is known as a mating net. Mating square and focal-point The mating square is that on which the king stands when it is mated, and the mat- ing focal-point is that from which an opponent's piece (other than a king, knight or pawn) mates the king at close quarters. Thus in the above diagram, after L..£te2 the focal-point is e6, since it is from there that the queen mates at close quarters. Similarly, after l...gxf5 2 Jtg7+ Ne4 the queen mates at close quarters from d4, and that square is then the focal-point. However, if Black plays, for in- stance, 1...Bc3 and is answered by 2 .g7#, then we are dealing with a bishop at- tacking from a distance, and here the term 'focal-point' is not used. To carry out a mating attack successfully it is always useful to survey the pos- sible mating patterns, to prepare a mating net accordingly, and to concentrate on the focal-point. In this connection it is in many cases important to clear the fo- cal-point, that is to deprive any opposing pieces of their control over a square which would be convenient as a focal-point. The following diagram shows us an example of this (D): White, to move, observes correctly that the square d4 is a potential focal-point and that his queen could mate from there, if it were not for its being controlled by Black's knight and bishop. So he clears the focal-point d4 as follows: 1 2xe2 (eliminating the knight) l...dxe2 (if l... d5, then 2 f4#; if l...Wcl then 2 Rd4#, or if l...f4, then 2 Rd4+ Nf5 3 Rf6#) 2 f4+ (forcing the bishop away from d4) 2... xf4 3 Rd4#. Many readers will object that the patterns of mating attack shown here are so obvious, indeed banal, that they need not even have been mentioned. However, I think it is useful to strengthen just this simple kind of knowledge, since in fact there are many mistakes made precisely in this field. Here are a few instances of mistakes concerning mating patterns. Introduction 11 • The attacker fails to perceive that he can neither stop his opponent from mov- ing his king nor drive him into a mating net, but still plays for mate. Such a course of action is naturally futile, and though it may possibly produce perpet- ual check, it cannot produce mate. • The attacker plays on the basis of typical mating patterns, overlooking the pos- sibility of an 'atypical' one in a particular continuation. • The player sees all the possible mating patterns based on one focal-point, but fails to realize that all this is cancelled out when the king moves, and that what matters then are new mating patterns, for which he has not made preparations. • The player decides on a course of action based on a certain focal-point, with- out realizing that he cannot provide cover for it or even clear it of the influence of his opponent's pieces. Mistakes made in the selection of a focal-point will be found even in the games of the masters. So it is useful to get to know the general pattern and structure of mating; less experienced players are especially recommended to study games to see whether a player has made a mistake with regard to the pattern and, if so, where he has made it. The art of the mating attack We must now make some finer distinctions, and put a series of questions which arise out of the basic conceptions of a mating attack, and which at the same time also touch on the most difficult departments of the art of chess today. How does a mating attack relate to the other operations which take place in a game of chess? How much is a mating attack conditioned by the actual position on the chess- board, and how much by the skill of the attacker?
12 The Art of Attack in Chess
Where does the risk attached to a mating attack lie? About which points are the minds of players today still unclear with respect to carrying out a mating attack? The relationship between these questions can be easily perceived, although they are posed separately. A separate reply, however, cannot be given to each, and an attempt must be made to answer them collectively. Mate is the final aim and crowning achievement of the contest and the mating attack is the ultimate operation in relation to all the rest, which are only contribu- tory. Consequently, the mating attack demands more preconditions than other operations. There exist a number of definite preconditions for a mating attack, and these combine to require a considerable degree of superiority on the part of the attacker. In the case where he has abundant superiority, great knowledge and ability on the part of the attacker are not necessary, but if his superiority just bor- ders on what would justify a correct attack, then the maximum skill is also re- quired in carrying out the attack. The Romantics knew little, but they had great confidence in themselves; the first small increase in knowledge diverted their style from its course. The new formula, still accepted today, is: carry out a series of preliminary operations, which require only a smaller degree of advantage, and then you will attain the abundant superiority which facilitates a mating attack. However the consequence of this is that there has been a failure to exploit the art of attack to the full and masters have been over-inclined to see a risk in an attack. It is still not clear what the minimum preconditions are, or what kind of advan- tage is necessary, for a mating attack. It may be a question, for example, of a sin- gle moment in a game which never returns. Another still unresolved question is that of a player's skill in weighing up the obligations which he has undertaken when preparing for an attack. The order of his preparatory moves is extraordi- narily important. The only really simple thing is the principle itself - that moves entailing fewer obligations should be carried out before those which are more strongly binding. Putting this principle into practice, however, demands great skill of a kind which is very rare - it was fully possessed by Capablanca and Alekhine, but by few others. A few more words should be said about the kind of superiority which is neces- sary before a mating attack can be undertaken. We are interested in the case where the advantage is not one of material but of position and time. The attacker is, as a rule, stronger in the area where the attack takes place by virtue of his ma- terial preponderance there, but his superiority in this respect must be consider- able. Even a simple pattern with the queen mating from the focal-point needs at least one other piece to cover the focal-point, which already means an advantage of two pieces against a lone king. For such pieces to be brought into the attack, Introduction 13 together with any further attacking pieces which may be necessary, one must also have a temporal advantage, that is, the ability to carry out a series of attack- ing moves without one's opponent being able to organize either a direct defence or a sufficiently strong counterattack. A temporal advantage of this kind is usu- ally based on the attacker's positional advantage, i.e. by the comparative lack of mobility of his opponent's pieces for defensive purposes. The attacker often does not possess such outstanding overall superiority at the commencement of his at- tack, but it may manifest itself later as a consequence of the immobility of some of the defending pieces or through a particular attacking combination. The skill of perceiving the right moment to launch one' s attack in fact consists of making a correct assessment of possibilities such as these. All these points go to show that the correct launching of an attack is the cru- cial difficulty which has caused so many masters to turn away from the attacking style. They would rather try to obtain something through positional technique, where the downside is nothing worse than a draw; all too often this is exactly what they do achieve. Still, if advancement in the art of attack is neglected, if op- portunities for a perfectly feasible attack are passed by, how are games going to be won when technique comes up against technique? Without exploring the art of attack more deeply, there can be no further advance in chess. Attack is an es- sential component of the game of chess; it is a spark which smoulders in every corner and only the player who knows how to keep it alive and make it burst into flame at the right moment has reached the heights of true mastery. Lasker once acutely observed that if there is ever any possibility of an attack one must carry it out, since otherwise one's advantage will evaporate.
1 The attack against the
uncastled king Making a mating attack on a king which had not yet castled was one of the joys of chess players in the past. These days the victim of such an attack is usually some- one playing a master in a simultaneous display who has failed to castle at the right time. The initial position of the king before it castles contains two main weaknesses. One is that it is exposed if the e-file is opened up; the second is that the square f7 in Black's position (f2 is the corresponding weak point for White) is vulnerable, since it is covered by the king alone. It is therefore natural that the vast majority of attacks on an uncastled king exploit one of these weaknesses. The attack along the e-file The first and most fundamental condition for an attack along the e-file is that the opponent's king should be on that file, and that for some reason it is impossible or difficult for it to move away. If all the adjacent squares are occupied by the king's own pieces or controlled by the opponent's, its escape is absolutely impos- sible. However, if the player is simply being prevented from castling, but other squares are not covered, the movement of the king is only relatively restricted; in other words, it can move at the cost of losing the right to castle. Castling can also be thwarted indirectly; for instance, if the king has to guard one of the pieces which is protecting it (e.g. on e7 in Black's case). The second condition for an attack of this kind depends on the attacker's own circumstances. First of all, the e-file should be open, or it should at any rate be in the attacker's power to open it; the attacker should also either have a piece which can control a file (a rook or queen) on the file or be able quickly to post one on it. Besides this, he usually needs to strengthen his pressure on the e-file, for instance by doubling rooks or by attacking one of his opponent's pieces which is on the file and protecting the king. From these necessary conditions it transpires that in an attack along the e-file there tends to be a chain of defence, and the attack is carried out against the cen- tral unit of the chain, that is, the piece protecting the king. If this piece is on the square directly in front of the king (e7 or e2), the attacker may be able to mate by The attack against the uncastled king 15 capturing it with his queen (or rook), i.e. by making the square into the focal- point. An attack on the e-file tends to occur most frequently at an early stage of the game. The following miniature is an example of how rapidly this kind of attack may develop after an opening mistake: Meesen - H. Muller Correspondence Game, 1928/9 English Opening

opening up of the file, especially if everything else has already been achieved, as, for example, in the following game: Chigorin - Burn Ostend, 1906 King's Gambit Declined Nb3 (D) This position contains the three elements already referred to (king on el, queen on e2 and the black rook on e8), and it is only a question of opening up the e-file. This aim can be promoted by the sacrifice of Black's bishop on f5:
9..Bxf5!
After 10 exf5 e4, the important point is that White cannot avoid opening up the e-file since removing his knight would be followed by 11...exd3. But if Black had played more weakly with 9...dxe4? 10 dxe4 Bxf5 11 exf5 e4, he would have lost the chance of playing ...exd3, and White could have moved his knight and avoided opening up the file. The play after 10...e4 is no longer of interest; White could still try 11 dl exf3 12 Rxf3, after which 12... e5 followed by 13...£}g4 or 13...d4 would lead to a great advantage for Black. In the game itself, White declined the sacrifice by 10 Bg5, but lost quickly:
10...dxe4 11 dxe4 .Nxe4 12 Rc4 Rd5 13 Rb5 .f2+ 0-1
If the e-file is already open and the last defender is a piece on e2 (or e7 for Black) then the operation often takes the form of a systematic attempt to The attack against the uncastled king 17 undermine the defence of the critical square, thus making e2 into a focal-point. The following diagram gives an example of this kind of operation: This position is from the game Hansen-Lundin, Oslo 1928.

This position supplies a convenient example of the method of play against a piece protecting the king. White, to move, must discover the correct way to increase his pressure against the bishop on e7. He would not achieve enough by 1 Re2 f8 2 Bxe7+ £}xe7 3

A rook sacrifice of this type is often necessary if an attack along the e-file is to be forced home. It is essentially a question of freeing the square el for the second rook, while the first, in being sacrificed, eliminates one of the pieces defending e7\

White's play in the following position (Ravinsky-Panov, Moscow 1943) is an excellent example of a well-conducted attack along the e-file. 1 2 Rd3! is even more convincing. Black can only prevent the deadly 3 Sxe7+ Nxe7 4 Sei by 2... d7, but after 3 Rb5+ his position collapses immediately. In Vukovic's main line, 4...O-O-O 5 jLxe7 Sde8 would enable Black to fight on.

In playing 14...f6, Black aims at 'artificial castling* by means of ...Nf7 followed by ...Bhe8 and ...Ng8; the move also limits the activity of White's knight. However, these are all excuses made in a situation which is already unhealthy for Black as a result of his weak 10th move.

At this point Steinitz's opponent left the tournament hall and never reap- peared. By these offensive means he hoped to deprive Steinitz of 'a piece of im- mortality', but the textbooks have noted White's intentions all the same:

Rg7+ *e8 31 Rg8+ 4>e7 32 Rf7+ Nd8 33 Rf8+ Re8 34 Nf7+ <Nd7 35 Rd6# The attack on the square f7 Black's weakest square on the board before castling is f7 (f2 for White). Even in the opening stages, threats of a sacrificial assault on f7 (or f2) are common; they are usually connected with an attack on the king or even with the idea of mate, in which case the square becomes the focal-point of a mating attack. Later on, after castling kingside, the rook protects this vulnerable square and its weakness is greatly diminished, while after castling queenside the weakness of the square has no connection with a mating attack. The most straightforward examples of assaults on f7 are to be seen at the be- ginning of certain open games, especially in the Petroff Defence and the Philidor Defence. We shall examine one example of this kind:
1 e4 e5 2 f3 d6 3 Nc4 <Ne7?
Let us allow Black to play this bad move so as to reach a typical crisis over the square f7 as quickly as possible.
4 Ng5 d5 5 exd5 xd5 6 Rf3
6 d4 is also good.
6...Rxg5
After 6,.. .e6 7 ?)xe6 fxe6 8 Rh5+ Black loses a pawn and the right to castle. 7Nxd5 and Black loses at least a pawn. If 7...f5, then 8 Jlxb7 e4 9 Rb3 Rxg2 10 Efl and White wins. Naturally, various attacks can be made on the uncastled king other than via the e-file or f7; these are only two of the commonest and most typical methods. The T1 The Art of Attack in Chess following example shows how a threat along the e-file can be indirectly com- bined with pre-castling attacks of another kind. Keres - Kotov Budapest Ct, 1950 Sicilian Najdorf
1 e4 c5 2 3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 £}f6 5 Nc3 a6 6 Be2 Qc7 7 Jtg5 Nbd7 8
O-O e6 9 Nh5 Rc4? (D) Here White carried out the following Sicilian trick, the kind of thing at which Keres was a master: 10 xe6! Rxe6 11 4bd5 Black now went on to parry the threat of £te7+ with ll...<Nd8?, and after 12 Bg4 e5 13 f4 Rxe4 14 Bxd7 Bxd7 15 Nxf6 he found himself in a hopeless position. An alternative was to let the e-file be opened up by 11...Nxd5 12 exd5 Rf5 13 Eel+ Ne5 14 f4, which would perhaps have been less unpleasant for Black, e.g.
14.. .g6 15 fxe5 (15 g4 is weaker on account of 15...Rxg5 16 fxg5 Bg7, etc.)
15...dxe5 16 e2 f6, etc1.
A few further examples will show different aspects of the attack against the square f7 :
1 Indeed, after 16 Re2 the reply 16...Rxg5 just leaves Black a piece up. Keres
himself gave the continuation 13 Wel-i- (instead of 13 fiel-i-) 13... e5 14 f4 h6 15 fxe5 fxg5 16 exd6+ as leading to a winning attack for White. The attack against the uncastled king 23 Keres - Winter Warsaw OL, 1935 Sicilian, 2... f6

13 Nxf7! <Nxf7 14 Rh5+
A sacrificial assault on f7 must as a rule be followed up by aggressive action, so as not to allow Black time to consolidate (e.g. with an artificial castling by means of ...Sf8 and ...Ng8). The advantage of the capture is twofold: the king, in moving to f7, loses the right to castle and is exposed still further; at the same time, a weakness appears on the diagonal h5-e8. Such features should be quickly and energetically exploited, since they are on the whole of a transitory nature.

2 The attack on the king that has
lost the right to castle This situation arises when the king is either no longer able to castle or has been driven by the opponent away from the castling area. In spite of these possible dif- ferences of origin, the general picture and the problem involved are identical and ought to be dealt with in one and the same chapter. First of all, it must be emphasized that the actual fact that a king has lost the right to castle does not necessarily always justify undertaking an attack aimed at mate (as will be shown by the examples of the voluntary loss of castling rights in chapter three). For an attack of this kind to be feasible, the loss of castling rights must at the same time involve the exposure of the king and an increased vulnera- bility to attack. In the majority of cases the attack is in fact in order, and we shall only consider such positive cases and not the rest. It only remains to be added that the loss of the right to castle can also entail a further weakness besides the danger which faces the king; that is, communication between the rooks is made more difficult. In fact, an attack may logically direct itself against this lack of co- operation between the rooks, e.g. in a struggle for control of an open file. We shall first examine a few typical examples portraying the drama of the king which has lost the right to castle. Such a drama can be divided up into the follow- ing episodes: 1) spoiling the king's castling chances, or drawing it away from the castling position; 2) the pursuit of the king across the board by checking; and 3) the final mating attack in the middle of the board or on the edge. The following game is an illustration of just such a drama in three acts: Potemkin - Alekhine St. Petersburg, 1912 Closed Sicilian
1 e4 c5 2 g3 g6 3 Ng2 Ng7 4 Ne2 5 c3 f6 6 Na3? d5 7 exd5 Nxd5 8

13...Ndb4 14 2>xf5 Rxf5 15 g4 Nd3+
The second act (a short one) starts: the king has to move again. White decides on 16 igS?, a weak move, but even after the stronger 16 stfl, Black retains the advantage with 16...Rb5.
16 Ng3? (D)
16,..Nxd4! 17 gxf5 £}xf5+ 0-1 as Black mates in 2 moves : 18 Ng4 h5+ 19 Nh3 (or 19 Ng5 4Lh6#) 19...£tf2# (As an old chess player said on a similar occa- sion, 'He's lucky to be mated, otherwise he would lose his queen...'). We called hunting the king about the board 'the second act of the drama' . However, it must be stressed that it is not the actual fact that the king has to move about that is of prime importance, but the extent to which its position is weak- ened. Instead of travelling all over the board it may happen that the king merely roams a little and gets itself tied up in a small space of two or three squares, while the opponent harries it with checks and thus manages to bring up his pieces with gain of time. A typical case where checks help to 'nourish the development of the attack' arises in the following short game: Clemens - Eisenschmidt St Petersburg, 1890 Evans Gambit

Rb4fia49Wxb6 xdl, and Black won on the basis of his material superiority. The pursuit of a king that has lost the right to castle is not, however, always such a successful undertaking as in the examples quoted. There have in fact been many occasions when the hunted king has come out the winner by successfully escaping to safety, and when the whole of his flight turns out in the end to be arti- ficial castling on a large scale/ A player who is pursuing a king in such circumstances must therefore keep his eyes open to make sure that the prey does not elude him. Two factors are particu- larly important: the tempo of the attack and slowly but surely building up a mat- ing net from which the king has no escape. As a matter of fact, this net is often of more importance than tempi, and quiet moves which 'spin the threads' often point the correct way, whereas many juicy checks may prove to be mistakes. The position of the king that has lost the right to castle represents, as it were, the at- tacker's capital, which he has acquired at the price of sacrifices or positional dis- advantages. The attacker should retain his hold on this capital without worrying too much about 'short-term gains' in the form of tempting checks; the decisive point in the end is whether the king is going to fall or not. These remarks are intended to inspire the reader to be cautious in his pursuit of a king that has lost the right to castle. Two maxims here oppose each other: the first instructs one to keep up the tempo of the attack by means of checks in order to give the king no time to recover its breath; the second warns that it is important

to finish off the pursuit by cornering the king and forcing it into a mating posi- tion. In practice players struggle to find a balance between these two maxims and on their correct choice success itself depends. Now that the problem is clear, it will be examined in a series of practical examples. Smyslov-Florian and Belavenets-Chistiakov are cases where the building of a mating net takes precedence over the pursuit of the king. In Tarta- kower-Euwe, however, we shall see the opposite, with Euwe hunting his oppo- nent's king without giving it a moment's respite. In the game Chigorin-Caro we have an illustration of when a king's pursuit should be halted and its retreat cut off, or, conversely, what happens if an opportunity to 'fix' the king is lost and it reaches a position of safety, as in fact occurred in this game.

White offers a piece in order to keep up the tempo of the attack. Black should now have played 16...Nxg5, for after 17 Rxg5 his position would only have been slightly inferior. Instead, he became greedy and replied:
16... xc3 17 Rxh7+ <Nf6 18 bxc3!
White does not hurry with his action against the displaced king, but calmly takes the knight and waits for the mating network to develop of itself. The attack on the king that has lost the right to castle 35

This position arose in the game Tartakower-Euwe, Venice 1948. It is Black's move; first of all, he draws the king out from his castled position by a sacrifice:
1...Nf4+! 2 gxf4 .h3+ 3 <4?g3

A fine example of a consistent pursuit of the king. The following unusual game, which dates from long ago, gave rise to amuse- ment at the tournament itself and only superficial comments in the tournament book. Chess books concerned themselves with the game no further, and in doing so let slip some fine material with which to illustrate the theme of 'the king's wanderings and flight'. Only with the commentary below, containing a discus- sion of the king's journey and an exposition of the technique of 'net-building', has this game been placed in correct perspective. Chigorin - Caro Vienna, 1898 Vienna Game

A risky move, first played by Steinitz against Blackburne in 1876. Correct here is 12gxf3 on which Black can get a draw with 12...Wel+ 13 f4 Rh4+, etc. Chigorin, in playing 12 Bb5+, avoids this possibility, for a draw was naturally Nxf3 12 Nb5+ not to his liking.
12...c6 13 gxf3 (D)
13...Qh6+!
The co-creator of the Caro- Kann Defence departs from the theory of his time and hits on the very best move. The theoreticians of the day rejected it, probably because Caro lost the game, and noted in their books that Black obtains the ad- vantage by continuing 13...cxb5 14 Rxe4 Rxe4+ 15 xe4 O-O 16 Jte3 £ki7. However, it seems that these old masters either examined this position by feeble gas-light or else they supposed that White would now have to succumb by play- ing 1 7 Sad 1? <53xe5 18 xe5 Sfe8+ 19 f4 g5+. However, by modern reckoning White would have the better game, if he were to play consistently for a central position with 17 jtd4. In view of the threat of 18 Sabi a6 19 a4, Black's best re- ply is 17...a6; then there follows 18 Shgl with the intention of weakening Black's position on the long dark diagonal.
14 Nxe4
Chigorin takes a further risk; 14 Ne2 would have been good enough for a draw after 14...Rh3 (not 14...exf3+on account of 15 Nf2 Rh3 16 Jlfl!) 15 Sdl exf3+ 1 4 fxe5 usually transposes to the game continuation after 4... xe4 5 d3 b4. White has other possibilities at move 5, but none gives him any advantage.

Sd8?! (D) Black clearly cannot take the e-pawn because of 20 Nf2, but 19...b4 would have been better and safer than the move played. After 20 Bxb4 (20 cxb4 O-O 21 b5 Efe8 is in Black's favour) 20...Nxb4 21 cxb4 O-O the exposed position of White's king together with his scattered pawns gives Black a considerable ad- vantage.

The queen's great manoeuvrability comes into its own in situations like this.

1 In fact 21 Wfl Nd7 can be met by 22 Rd3+ and White escapes into a playable
ending. 21 Wfl is best answered by 21...Nxe5 and White cannot exploit the line-up on the e-file because his own king is so exposed. The attack on the king that has lost the right to castle 41
21.. >g5+ 22 f4
White has to consent to this move, which exposes his king still further; 22 is not good on account of 22...Rh4+ 23 ifl (neither 23 Ne3 Rh6+ nor 23 stgl Hd2 is any better) 23...Rh3+ 24 Nf2 Rxh2+ 25 si?e3 Rd2+ 26 4*64 g5 and Black wins.

The opening up of the e-file is of no help to White, since his king has nowhere to go; in view of the threat of mate he is forced to play 26 f5, on which 26...£te5 wins.
23...Rh3+ 24 *e4
To engineer a possible escape for the king via d2 White would have to give up his h-pawn; moreover, there would also be a permanent danger of the exchange of queens. For this reason he prefers to embark on new adventures.
24..J5+ 25 *d5 (D)
This position caused amazement among some of the spectators, who attempted to get the manager of the tournament to intervene, since it was clear that White's piece on d5 was his queen and that on bl his king! The position is, of course, a strange one; what is also unusual is that within seven moves the white king has reached al. Clearly, it is helped in this by Black, who checks unnecessarily in- stead of building up a mating net. Black played 25...Rg2+?, when the correct move was 25...Hc8!. In that case White's king would get into trouble on the c- file, which it would have to cross to extract itself from the scrape it has got into. The following variations illustrate the strength of the rook move and are at the same time instructive as regards play against an exposed king: 25..JJc8! and now:
42 The Art of Attack in Chess
1) White carries out a counterattack with his queen: 26 Rxb7 wg2+ 27 Qc5 Ne7+ 28 Nb6 Ec6+ 29 Na7 Rf2+ 30 Na8 O-O+ 31 Bb8 Sb6 and Black wins. 2) The white king tries to force its way through to the al -corner; this gives rise to the most interesting point in the analysis. After 26 c4 Black does not try any checking moves, but instead first consolidates his own position by 26...g6!!, having observed that White has no good move to make. If 27 Sc2 or 27 Rc2, then 27,..b5+ 28 Nb3 d4+, while if 27 Scdl, then 27... d4+; if 27 Sedl or 27 Ifl, the ring is tightened by 27...Re3, and if T1 Rb6, then 27...<Na5+ 28 Nd5 (or 28 Nb4 Rxh2 !) 28...Rg2+ 29 e6 Rxa2+ 30 ?f6 (or 30 c4 £}xc4, etc.) 30...Sc6

There is admittedly no mating net then, but with 27...Rxh2 Black obtains a material advantage and goes on to threaten both 28...Rxf4 and 28... a5+ followed by ...£te4. 3) The white king tries to defy the danger of mate by advancing to b6. Black then has a number of continuations, the simplest of which seems to be 26 c5 Rxh2 27 bb fxf4 28 Nxb7 (if 28 Rb3, then 28...Rf2+ 29 .c5 Rxc5+ 30 <Nxc5 Na5+ with a won ending) 28...Rc4 29 xc8 b4+ 30 <Nb7 Rb5+ 3 1 ?a7 £106+ followed by 32...'Nd7+ and mates.

25...Rg2+? 26 Nc4 b5+ 27 Nd3 Rf3+ 28 <Nc2 Rf2+ 29 Nb3 Sc8 (D)
1 In this line Vukovic fails to take his own advice and gives too many checks,
which actually allow White to escape by 34 <Nh6! Rxh2+ 35 Si?g5 Rg3+ 36 Nf6, etc. The correct continuation is 32..,Re6! and there is no way to meet the threat of 33...Hg8+ 34 Nh6 g5+. The attack on the king that has lost the right to castle 43
30 Sc2
White obviously cannot play 30 Rxf5 since then 3O...£3a5+ leads to mate; in- stead, he gives up his f-pawn and then by retreating his king quickly to al safe- guards his position.
30.,.Nxf4 31 Nb2 2Ba5 32 Nal Rc4?
A further mistake; he could still have fought for a draw by 32. ..Rf3!. The square c4 is naturally more suitable for the knight. 33 e6 After 33...Hc6 34 Nb7 35 Be5 Black cannot play 35...Sxe6 because of 36 .xg7 Sg8 37 Sxe6+ and White wins.
34 Wdl h5?

35 Sgl! fih7 36 fixg7! 1-0
Since if 36...Bxg7, then 37 Rxh5+ followed by 38 Rh8+ and White forces mate. In addition to this strange game, I shall extract from the treasury of chess curi- osities three more encounters which have particular relevance to the theme of a king's successful wandering. The series opens with a game between Hamppe and Meitner, in which the pursued king seeks asylum among the enemy pawns and is successful to the extent that the opponent cannot obtain anything beyond perpet- ual check. Hamppe - Meitner Vienna, 1872 Vienna Game

2...Bc5. Hamppe's move is of doubtful value because of the bishop sacrifice on

In return for the bishop, Black obtains a promising attack on the king, which is deprived of the right to castle. 4 <Nxf2 Rh4+ 5 Ne3 If 5 g3 then 5...Rxe4 6 Re2 xa4 (not 6...Wxhl because of 7 £M'3 and 8 Ag2) 7 xe5+ Ne7 8 Rxg7 Sg8 9 ?xh7 d6 and Black has the better position.

9 c4? would be weak because of 9...b5!. Similarly, 9 Bxa6 bxa6 10 c3 Rxg2 1 11 f3 (or 11 Jlg4 12 Sei e7!) 11.. Bh3! is bad for White2. This is atyp- ical example of an attack against a displaced king being deferred on the grounds that further action would only help the consolidation of the king's position. Thus, for example, after 9 Bxa6 bxa6 10 c3, 10...Sb8+ would enable White to prepare a new home for his king on b2 by 1 1 Na3 and b3. Instead, Black directs his attack against the other flank and, while mowing down some pawns, tries to exploit the general lack of development of White's position.
9...Rxa4+!
Effective, and probably necessary, although it gives no more than a draw. If
9...jLe6 White would reply 10 d4! exd4 11 Bxa6 bxa6 12 £}f3 with the better

The attack on the king that has lost the right to castle 47 Owing to the weakness on c4, White's position has lost its sting. Morphy now decides to compromise his game still further by sacrificing his knight; there is probably nothing better.

26 Sd4 Rh5
Black begins to have his threats. 27 h3 is obviously met by 27...Re5, while if 27 g3, then 27...Sh8 28 h4 Re2, threatening mate by either 29...Wxfl+ or
29...Sxh4+. Morphy now finds the one reply which still offers resistance.

29 gxh5 elW+ 30 Ng2 Se2+ 31 <Nh3 f5? Black has drawn his opponent's king out of position but now, when he is faced with the task of producing a mating attack, he stumbles. 31...f5? only appears to tighten the net (that is, by the threat of 32...W1+ 33 Sxfl Sxh2#); in fact it al- lows the king to escape via g5. 31...Wfl+ 32 Sxfl Sxh2+ 33 g4 would also have been unsound, since after 34 Ng3 !

31...Rxc3+ 32 Sd3 (forced) 32...Re5 33 Rf3 e7, etc. was one line which
led to victory.

After this fresh mistake Black ought to have lost. 34...Wgl+ 35 Sg4 Re3+ might still have resulted in a win .
35 Sg4! (D)
B
By sacrificing his rook White succeeds in blocking the g-file and thus obtain- ing a respite for his king in the comparative safety of g5. Naturally, the king is only secure there for one or two moves, but in the present position that is enough, for White also has some threats at his disposal. The initiative now passes to White, and he should win quickly. The creation of a 'makeshift shelter' for one or two moves is often extremely important when the king is being pursued, always on the assumption, of course, that the counterat- tack made possible by the gain of time promises to be successful.

Barnes played a number of games against Morphy; with his distinctive posi- tional style, he was the most successful of all the British masters against that combinative genius. Now comes the third and last example from the collection of curiosities - the game between Michelet and Kieseritzky, in which the hunted white king is not only saved but goes on actively to participate in the attack on his black colleague. The key to this success is the confinement of Black's queen in a most unusual 'cage'. Michelet - Kieseritzky Paris, 1845 King's Gambit Accepted

White actually encourages Black to carry out his threat to win the queen, pro- ducing an original riposte to it. White now wins the other rook, leaving the black queen boxed in at g2. White conducts the ending with what is in effect an extra piece and, logically enough, takes his king into battle as well . Nxe5 hxg3 31 Nf6 1-0 The final position deserves a diagram. Black is lost, since he has no proper defence against .g6+ followed by e7+ and e8W, etc. Black's play throughout this game is an example of how not to con- duct an attack on a wandering king.
3 On castling and attacking the
castled position in general The origin of castling Castling, the most distinctive move in the whole of chess, affects the nature of mating attacks in various ways and because of its importance in this connection, the general significance of the move is worth examining. Castling is not of any great antiquity. It is also obvious that such a complex and distinctive operation as the modern castling move was not born in a day, but rather developed gradually from century to century with the evolution of the rules of the game themselves. In the Indian game of chaturanga (pre-chess) there is no trace of the move, nor can it be found in the Arab shatranj. The first traces of any unusual or exceptional movement being made by the king, out of which the castling move evolved, are to be found in mediaeval European chess, which in its first stages can be de- scribed as the first and not very significant revision of shatranj towards providing the pieces with greater mobility. A historical source attesting to this first revision is a work by the Lombard monk Jacobus de Cessolis, in which are recorded the rules governing the movements of the individual chess pieces at the time. There it is stated that king, queen, and pawns have the right to make an initial move of two squares as well as the normal one. From this early reform the double opening step taken by the pawn survives to this day, while in the case of the queen it be- came obsolete when the piece was given its present powers of movement during the great reform of the game at the end of the fifteenth century. In the case of the king it was further developed and altered until it eventually took its present-day shape as castling. There is extensive confirmation of the introduction of the king's move from other sources after Cessolis, though the particular conditions governing the move vary. The form most frequently recorded is that where the king moves like a knight ('Freudensprung'), with the limitation that it is not allowed to go beyond the second rank. The next form, which made its appearance in Italy in the six- teenth century, already included a movement by the rook in the same move - a step nearer to the castling of today. The king's use of the knight's jump disap- pears at this point and the rules state that the king is free to move from el to gl or
52 The Art of Attack in Chess
hl and the rook from hl to fl or el. This type of 'free castling' or 'Italian cas- tling' persisted in Italy right up to the nineteenth century, when it was superseded by the present rules, which were introduced in France during the eighteenth cen- tury. This short survey of the historical evolution of castling is a good illustration of the gradual development of the rules of chess and it makes it particularly clear that these rules have been changed and perfected with the desire of enriching the game; the general tendency towards giving the pieces more dynamic movement reflects the increased animation of social movements in Europe from the Middle Ages onwards. In addition to this general line of development in the laws of chess, we also owe the introduction and eventual adoption of the castling move to the indirect influence of the great reform of the fifteenth century. This reform created a pow- erful queen out of thefers (which moved one square) and the modern bishop out of the alfil (which moved exactly two squares). In this new type of chess, with three long-range pieces, the fighting ability of the king declined; once in the days of pre-chess it had been the strongest piece of all. The king now became a hin- drance with its slow movement, and its position in the centre of the back rank stood out immediately as a fault in the game 's structure. On the one hand, it had to be safeguarded against the formidable new forces, and on the other it had to be removed from the centre so as not to hamper them. For this reason it was neces- sary for the king to get away from the centre as quickly as possible, and it was to this end that the king's double move was built on and transformed into the full castling move. Therefore, not only the development of this most distinctive move can be traced through the history of chess but also its logic: it exists as the neces- sary complement to the reform of the other pieces' movements. We start a game of chess today with the pieces placed in the ancient order which derives from chaturanga, and then we switch over by castling to a new position, which is better suited to the alterations made in the game's rules. The dynamic and positional significance of castling Chess moves in general can be looked at from the dynamic or the positional point of view, depending on whether we are considering them as part of an active com- bination or as static features. The castling move without doubt powerfully increases the dynamic potential of a position. A player who has castled at once obtains a whole range of possibili- ties which he did not have before. He has increased the influence of the rook, cleared the square el for a possible attack along the e-file, and on top of this he On castling and attacking the castled position in general 53 has prepared the ground for the quick establishment of 'communication between the rooks', i.e. the entire clearing of the back rank, as a result of which the rooks cover each other or can combine together in attacks. On the other hand, castling is also a positional move, and one which provides a particular element of permanency to the position. For it is unique and irrevoca- ble; it can only be carried out once in a game, which means that the king will as a rule stay on the side on which it has castled. In special cases it can, it is true, travel with a greater or lesser degree of difficulty from its castled position to vari- ous parts of the board. Thus castling is only relatively irrevocable (unlike a pawn's move, which is absolutely so) but for practical purposes the king's posi- tion after castling is, at least until the arrival of the endgame, fairly definitely a permanent positional feature. Before castling, the king has three possible courses of action: to remain in the middle or to castle either to right or left. Once it has castled it no longer has any choice; it then has a definite shelter, a 'permanent ad- dress', a fact which the opponent naturally takes into account. It is certainly safer against attack, but it has at the same time committed itself positionally to one par- ticular area of the board; thus the undoubted advantages of castling are offset by certain disadvantages. Artificial castling Chess also contains the term 'artificial castling', which involves a player creating a position the same as or similar to that reached after genuine castling. It is at- tained not by a single castling move but a series of moves by the king and the rook. In the continuation from the following diagram we shall encounter the sim- plest example of 'artificial castling.'
54 The Art of Attack in Chess
Black, to move, played:
1...Nxe4
White's best would now be 2 Nxe4 d5 3 Bd3 dxe4 4 Bxe4, in which case the prospects would remain even. However, before taking the knight on e4 White de- cides to use his bishop to prevent his opponent from castling - an idea which, in this position, is faulty.
2 Nxf7+ <Nxf7 3 Nxe4
At first sight White's plan appears to have succeeded, since, as well as main- taining the material balance, he has prevented Black from castling. However, the further play shows that Black can carry out 'artificial castling' without difficulty and has made a clear gain in that he is left with strong pawns in the centre.
3...d5 4 g3 Sf8 5 d3 #g8
Now the superiority of Black's position is quite obvious, and one can easily appreciate the part played by 'artificial castling' ; Black has admittedly expended three moves on it, but White has derived no advantage from this fact, since he has made three moves of even less value, i.e. Bxf7+, Nxe4, and £3g3. In a sense, Black was castling while White was transferring his knight from c3 to g3. The correct moment for castling Beginners are often advised to castle as quickly as possible. This is a useful and sensible piece of advice in the majority of instances. Certainly, less experienced players offend against this general precept extremely often, postponing castling unnecessarily and as a result suddenly finding themselves in an awkward situa- tion, by which time it is far too late to castle. The present writer once made a sta- tistical survey of late castling using a number of simultaneous games and came to the conclusion that a common characteristic of so-called 'simultaneous massa- cres' (when the master wins all, or nearly all, of the games) was precisely the lateness of castling. Around the twelfth move of one such simultaneous display the situation was as follows: the master had castled on eighteen of the boards and not yet on two, while his opponents had castled on three boards but not on the rest. The result: 20-0 to the master - a real massacre! This is a typical example which indicates the disadvantages resulting from a delay in castling. In other si- multaneous displays, where masters had a harder task and poorer results, the sta- tistics on castling, taken around the twelfth to fifteenth moves, on the whole showed smaller discrepancies. The general rule that one should castle as soon as possible is therefore quite in order, though it must at once be emphasized that there are also many exceptions to it. Every chess player of greater experience is well acquainted with those On castling and attacking the castled position in general 55 particular situations when it is correct to postpone castling or when it is alto- gether unnecessary. To make the matter clearer, I shall set out some situations of this kind and support them with examples: 1 ) Castling is postponed or not carried out at all, because some other action is more useful. This might be quite simply the capture of an opponent's piece, the spoiling of his position, or, indeed, an attack. If such an attack is sufficiently strong and profitable, the attacker often never castles, because he is victorious first. This kind of situation needs no particular examples. 2) Castling is postponed, because for the time being it is still dangerous. It is better to prepare it by removing the danger first, e.g. by exchanging the oppo- nent's threatening pieces or by some other manoeuvre. As an example of the dangers of castling too early, let us take the following variation of the Giuoco Piano.
1 e4 e5 2 £tf3 c6 3 Nc4 Nc5 4 d3 <Nf6 5 Ng5 h6 6 Nh4 d6 7 O-O?
At this point castling is premature and incorrect. There is a danger of Black's replying ...g5 and following up with a pawn attack against White's castled posi- tion; this danger ought to be averted first. 7 Nc3 is a step in this direction; if Black continues with 7...O-O? 8 £ki5 g5, then White can reply 9 Nxg5! £W5 10 Rh5 hxg5 1 1 Bxg5 with an overwhelming attack. Moreover, if Black answers 7 with 7...g5 8 Bg3 and then ... .g4 or ...h5 !?, the situation is less dangerous because White has not yet castled and can therefore prepare to castle on the queenside, which is not threatened.
7...g5 8 Ng3 h5! 9 Nxg5 h4! (D)

Black does not worry about the consequences of Bxf7 but continues his attack consistently. In fact, he gives up his queen for the bishop on g3; this would not be
56 The Art of Attack in Chess
a good exchange if White had not castled, but against the castled position the at- tack is decisive.
10 Nxf7 hxg3 11 £}xd8
If 11 hxg3, then ll...Re7 12 Nxh8 Rh7 followed by ...£}g4, with a decisive attack.

Hg2+ 17 £hl Exf2+ 18 Ngl Eg2+ 19 £hl Sgl# 3) The player does not castle at once because, although he is able to castle on one side, he actually wishes to castle on the other side and needs to make further preparations. Alternatively, he delays until his opponent castles, and only then decides which side to castle. If he is aiming for an attack, he may decide to castle on the opposite side to his opponent; if he is aiming to forestall an attack, then he will more likely castle on the same side as his opponent. There are many examples in the games of the masters of this kind of pause be- fore castling. It is assumed, of course, that this pause does not entail any dangers. In open positions such dangers are more frequent than in closed ones. The following situation will serve as an example of this pause before castling. It is White's move and he may, if he wishes, castle short immediately. But he calculates as follows: after 1 O-O Black will play ...O-O, and then how can I attack him? The pieces by themselves can achieve nothing in this blocked position; h3 and g4 still need to be played and must be prepared by Rd2. But in the meantime Black will consolidate his position on the kingside (e.g. by means of ...g6 and ...Sf8-f7-g7) after which the attack will have lost its power. There is no doubt that for an attack based on g4, White's king is not well placed at gl, and it is better for that purpose to castle on the queenside and then deploy the rooks on the g- and h-files. However, if White chooses 1 Rd2 and then 2 O-O-O, Black can play On castling and attacking the castled position in general 57
2...O-O-O, whereupon the attack with g4 no longer applies; White will have to
play a hasty b4, in which case it will be quickly seen that his king is badly placed on cl. Consequently, he must put off castling and wait. White therefore plays 1 Re2, and if 1...O-O, then 2 O-O-O, while if 1...O-O-O, then 2 O-O. He castles on the opposite side from Black in order to get the maximum freedom for carrying out his attack. 4) Castling may be postponed, and perhaps forgone forever, in certain posi- tions where the centre is permanently blocked. The reason for being able to postpone castling in such positions is, of course, that the pawns form an obstruction in the centre and so make it impossible to open the central files and diagonals without painful sacrifices. With the centre blocked, the kings are also safer in the middle, at least for some time. The logical course of attack in such cases tends to be on the unblocked flanks, and there are times when the king is more exposed by being in a castled position on the wing than in the middle, where it is protected by the blocked pawns. A convenient example to illustrate this can be obtained by re-examining the above diagram, which we ought to do anyway because we left White's move 1 Re2 unanswered. Black's best reply also consists of a postponement of castling, e.g. I...a6 or l...£kl8. The postponement of castling is feasible for both sides in this position, and for a very obvious reason: the pronounced blockade in the cen- tre. Attacks can only take place down the flanks and as a result the kings are at the moment relatively safe in the middle. Play from this position might develop as follows:
1 Re2 Nd8 2 h3 f7 3 Rd2 O-O-O
It is less dangerous for Black to castle on the queenside now; if White plays 4 O-O, Black replies 4,..Edg8, threatening ...g5, while after 4 O-O-O the danger of an attack on the flank disappears and Black can relax. In this case the preliminary skirmish has in fact ended with castling, but there are blocked positions where castling does not occur at all and the kings stay per- manently in the middle. Even in the above position White has the alternative of not castling and instead co-ordinating his rooks by Nf2; later on he can even take his king up to e3. 5) Castling is unnecessary, because the endgame is already not far off, in which case the king is well placed in the middle of the board. These cases too are not infrequent in master chess; we shall select two exam- ples from opening theory, where the white king forfeits the right to castle as a re- sult of the exchange of queens.

5...Wxdl+ 6 &xdl! (D)
White could have retained his right to castle by playing 6 £}xdl ; however, it is better to use the king since castling is no longer necessary in this position, and it On castling and attacking the castled position in general 59 is more important that the knight should remain on c3. For example, after 6 £jxdl b5 7 a4 Black is not obliged to continue with ...b4, whereas after 6 xdl b5 7 a4 he has nothing better than 7...b4, whereupon White obtains the advantage by 8 Nbl Ba6 9 3d2. In this instance White, in playing xdl , does not gain the 'centralizing tempo' which he did on the thirteenth move in the previous example, but he prefers to lose his chance to castle just to keep his knight on c3. Many occasions for renouncing castling in this way arise in practice, but one should avoid taking the king too far afield. This comment applies to so-called 'queenless middlegames' and not to true endgames, in which the king is nearly always better placed in the centre. One should keep one's eyes open and weigh up the opponent's opportunities for an attack on one's king, for they can easily develop in 'queenless middlegames'. Safety from attack and a genuine prospect of making further piece exchanges - these are the two important criteria affecting a decision on the forfeiture of the right to castle. The cases I have mentioned in which castling can be justifiably postponed or dispensed with are meant to induce the reader to think about the problem more deeply, for every rule in chess should be applied flexibly. To make a correct deci- sion on exactly when to castle one needs considerable knowledge and experi- ence. Finally, one more hint: even in cases where there is justification for a delay in castling, it is still a good thing to have the opportunity to castle quickly on one side at least. When the pieces have been moved out on one side of the back rank, we have an opportunity to castle 'at hand', and this castling will cost just one tempo. However, if there is one piece which has still not left the back rank then obviously castling will cost us two tempi. Now there is a big difference between one tempo and two, if one's opponent can discover some concealed means for a sudden attack on the king before it has reached its castled residence! For this rea- son it is good policy to get ready to castle as soon as possible, and then consider whether it can still be put off for a while. The basic elements of the attack on the castled king The attack on the castled king is a particular type of mating attack, but in practice it is the most important, since castling takes place in the majority of games. In considering an attack of this kind, we must begin with a general survey of the action involved, acquainting ourselves, on the one hand, with the basic char- acteristics of the actual castled position itself and, on the other, with the good and bad aspects of an attack on that position.
60 The Art of Attack in Chess
The castled position consists of the castled king and the protective pawns and also to a certain extent the pieces which are in the vicinity or in some other way connected with the formation. This structure should be regarded as a positional formation, i.e. a group of pieces having one or more fairly permanent features. One could also go further and say that castled positions are, as a rule, passive rather than active positional formations, i.e. their more permanent feature stems ultimately from a certain im- mobility of the pieces, and not in their mobility, as is the case when the pieces are in strong positions. (This is, of course, the general rule, but in practice the castled position may also contain a piece in a strong position, for example a fianchettoed bishop.) The passive nature of the castled position results from the lack of mobility of the king, and this is indirectly transferred to the other pieces in the position as well; the first to be affected are the pawns, which 'may not be moved, if the cas- tled position is not to be weakened', and which are as a result made indirectly im- mobile. If they in fact move from their initial squares and so create weaknesses in the castled position, these weaknesses result from the reduced options entailed by the advance. (A pawn at h2 controls the square g3 and also has it in its power, by advancing, to govern g4, g5, g6, etc. If it moves to h3, then, out of its total number of actual or potential areas of control, it loses that over g3, and so loses part of its active potential.) Even the pieces associated with the castled position are affected to a certain extent by the general immobility of the formation, whether functionally because of the need for a certain square to be defended or spatially because of the difficulty involved in their centralization. The structure and the degree of weakness of the opponent's castled position also influence the way in which the attacker employs his pieces in a mating at- tack. The variety here is extremely wide, ranging from lightning assaults to purely positional manoeuvres and from uncompromising charges to cautious preparations, in which the player really only flirts with an attack on the king in order to restrict his opponent's options. More will be said on these and similar points later on. However, the basic weaknesses of the castled position which I have described also contain one positive feature which becomes apparent when an attempt is made to exploit them. This positive feature derives from the fact that the castled position is always a decentralized one, so that as a rule any attack on it demands a greater or lesser decentralization of the attacker's pieces. This factor is particu- larly important in that the main positional rule for normal play is that pieces should be centralized. There is, then, a basic contradiction between consistent centralization and an attack on the castled king, and it is here that the principal On castling and attacking the castled position in general 61 risk of such an attack lies. If the attack does not succeed, the fact that some of the attacker's pieces are out of position as a rule tells against the attacker. The reader will come to understand the deeper significance of this argument in the final chapters of this book. To understand the attack on the castled king we shall start with the basic fac- tors involved, spatial, material and temporal (the method I applied in my Intro- duction to Chess and School of Combinations). It is true that in every action which takes place on the chessboard all these three factors can be observed to- gether, since each move has its own spatial, material and temporal significance; however, the emphasis of one's actual observation may be in one case on the spa- tial, in another on the material, and in a third on the temporal, aspect. For this rea- son, the separation of the different factors is the most effective and the clearest method for teaching purposes. The attack on the castled king in the past At the time when modern chess was in its infancy, i.e. after the reforms of the rules in the last quarter of the fifteenth century, the attack on the castled king did not yet exist, or at any rate there was no trace of it in the games recorded. The cas- tling move itself was at that time only in the process of being created (some were still using the mediaeval king's jump, while others were castling but in two moves - i.e. first Ehl-fl, and then on the next move &el-gl, etc.) and combina- tive technique - especially with the 'new pieces', the queen and the knight - was still fairly primitive, so that the decision in a game was usually reached by cruder methods than by attacking the castled king, e.g. by capturing on f7 before cas- tling had taken place or simply by winning material. The first recorded instance of an attack on the castled king occurs in the so-called Paris MS., which origi- nated about 1500, a more mature and fuller development of Lucena's work of 1497, the oldest printed book on modern chess. In the course of analysing an opening (one later given the name of Philidor Defence) the author arrives at the position at the top of the following page: Black, to move, plays: l...g5! 2 Nh2 h5 He uses his pawns to carry out an attack on the king, a plan suited to this posi- tion as it takes advantage of White's weakness on h3. 3f3? A mistake, which Lucena makes 'in accordance with the thought of his times' . White could have defended himself satisfactorily if he had immediately played 3 b5!.

A further mistake. White should at once have played 5 bxc6 Nxc6 6 d5 Rd7
7 Xa3, when Black, pinned down at c6 and g8, would have had to refrain from
going straight ahead with ...g4 and consolidate his position first.

11 c4? White could have put up more resistance by 11 Sa3. No real advantage would come of 11 Rc4 because of 11 ... ?d7. Naturally, 1 1 c4? is very weak and quite inappropriate, since it does nothing to help the defence and only obstructs the di- agonal for the white queen. ll...Sa7 12 Sf2 Sh7 13 Wdl? Rh6?!

The manuscript follows on from here with 17 Ne2 Sxal 18 JLxal Sxg2 and concludes: 'Black has the better prospects'. To all appearances the author was mainly concerned with the win of a pawn, forgetting that the primary aim of an attack on the castled king is mate! By 16...Sg3 17 Rc2 Rg4 18 &el Ba5+ the matter could have been brought to an end considerably more quickly. The advance in technique in attacking the castled king was extremely slow throughout the sixteenth century, and it was only at the beginning of the seven- teenth that Greco in his manual indicated some combinations which, though new then, now strike modern minds as nothing more than elementary tricks. As an ex- ample of the technical level reached by Greco, let us look at a continuation from his book.
1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Nc4 Nc5 4 O-O 2tf6 5 Sei O-O 6 c3 Re7?
Greco had not yet realized the importance of keeping control of the centre and gives Black this weak move instead of the correct 6...d6.

1 As we shall see, this comment is incorrect. After 8 cxd4 White has a clear ad-
vantage, since Black has no compensation for White's central control. The move 8 e5 is a mistake which gives Black at least equality.
64 The Art of Attack in Chess
9 cxd4? Weakly played. By 9 Bg5 (an intermediate move!) 9... e8 10 cxd4 White would have obtained a winning position. (Greco and other authors right up to the middle of the nineteenth century did not see the intermediate move 9 J&g5, so that 8 e5 came to be regarded in the textbooks as a mistake! )
9...£jxd4! 10 Nxd4 Rh4
This is Greco's trick. White has two exposed spots, at h2 and f2. Ili.e3 Greco naturally also gives the continuation 11 Nf3 Rxf2+ followed by
12...Wgl+ and a smothered mate by the knight at f2.
Il..>xh2+ 12 &fl Whl+?! In carrying his attack further Greco does not notice all the finesses. 12...Nxe3+ * followed by .. .d6 would have been better here2.
13 Ne2 Rxg2 14 Sgl Bxe3 15 Nxe3?
This way White loses two valuable pawns, and Greco concludes his analysis with 15...Nxd4+ 16 Nxd4 Rxf2+ 17 Nc3 Re3+ 18 Nd3 xe5+, with advan- tage to Black. Instead of 15 Nxe3?, the correct continuation is 15 Sxg2 <5)xdl 16 Nf5, when Black must find the reply 16...d5! 17 Bxg7 Bh3!, if he is to retain the better pros- pects (though even here there is still some uncertainty after 18 Sg3 .xf2 19 Exh3 dxc4 20 d2, etc.). If he played 16... xb2 17 2)h6+ <Nh8 18 Nxf7+, he would have to consent to a draw, since 18...Sxf7 is probably not a good idea3. In step with the general advance in chess skill there can also be seen an ad- vance in the technique of attacking the castled king, first with Philidor and then, particularly, with Morphy. The romantic reaction which followed led to the Black should meet 9 Ag5 by 9...dxc3!. After 10 Bxe7 Jlxf2+ 11 S ?f1 cxb2 12 £}c3 (12 Na3 ixel also favours Black) 12...JLxel (12...bxalW 13 xal -&xel 14 £}d5 is unclear) 13 #ki5 xe7 14 £}xe7+ 'i'hS Black has a clear advantage in view of the threats of 15...bxal and 15...Ne3+. White's strongest move is 9 b4!" but an analysis of the resulting complications (which lead to a roughly equal position) would take us too far afield. Perhaps those old analysts knew a thing or two after all!
2 A baffling comment, as after 12... xe3+ 13 fxe3 d6 14 #}f3 White starts to con-
3 solidate his extra material. Greco's continuation appears best to me. After 18...fixf7 19 .xf7 b6!, followed by ...jLa6+ and developing the rook, Black is virtually winning - three pawns for the exchange and a pair of active bishops is surely too much. On castling and attacking the castled position in general 65 development of a number of particular types of sacrificial attacks, but without in general reaching Morphy's level. Steinitz was concerned with perfecting defen- sive technique, and his influence on the style of the period was slowly beginning to make the attack on the castled king fade from master chess. Lasker, too, the new World Champion, was even in his youth already turning away from forcing such attacks, preferring to aim at perfection in the endgame. At the end of the century, however, there were three great masters who defended the thesis of at- tacking chess and who in doing so clearly showed themselves to be supporters of the attack on the castled king. These were Chigorin, Tarrasch and Pillsbury, each of whom in his own way helped to enrich the technique of attack. Chigorin illus- trated particularly the power of the positional sacrifice in his games; Tarrasch's thesis was that the rapid development of the pieces and a strong centre were the basic requisites for an attack on the castled king; while Pillsbury created a kind of synthesis of the attacking style and the positional and endgame play of Steinitz and Lasker. In other words, the American grandmaster showed how a rapid switch can be made from attack to a simplification which gives the better ending. In this way all the basic elements of a perfected technique for attacking the cas- tled king were set out, and after a short period of stagnation in the first two de- cades of the present century there followed the real blossoming of the dynamic style with the arrival of Capablanca and Alekhine. This development is still rele- vant to the theme of the attack on the castled king today, and more will be said about it at the end of the book.
4 Mating patterns
Spatial relationships in a mating attack can be observed by examining mating patterns, focal-points, and the roles played by the ranks, files, and diagonals. In this chapter we shall be concerned with mating patterns. This choice has a practi- cal justification in that mating patterns can be more easily remembered than the ways leading up to mate. For this reason mating patterns, even though they occur only at the very end of a mating attack, are fundamental for practical purposes because of the excellent mnemonic assistance which they provide to the player. Our first concern is for the most common mating patterns; these hardly ever occur in the middle of the board, but they are very frequent in the castling area, i.e. near the king's position on the edge of the board. Typical mates without enemy pieces There are a very large number of typical mates of this kind and most of them are elementary, so we shall consider only a few examples. (For the sake of greater clarity the diagrams are shown without the white king.) In the first position White, to move, has a choice between two typical mates: 1) 1 Ng6+ Ng8 2 Rh7+ <Nf8 3 Rf7#. 2) 1 ±f5+ Ng8 2 Be6#. Mating patterns 67 In this position there are again two possible mates, depending on how Black replies. If 1 Nh8, then 2 Sh7# (the so-called Arab mate, because it is recorded in Arabic manuscripts of the ninth century). If 1 £jf6+ *Nf8, then there follows 2 Sf7#, a mating pattern which is worth remembering.
B
Another mate which should be known is this one with two knights, but if there are no other pieces on the board then it cannot be forced. Typical mates with enemy pieces
B
The so-called back-row mate by the rook (or queen) is one of the most typical mating patterns.
B
Of the fairly large number of typical mates with queen and pawn this one is given first. Black is to move; he cannot escape mate, since he is threatened by 1 Rh6 and 2 g7#. If he plays l...( 'h7, then 2 Fh4+ and 3 Rh6, etc. If Black had a pawn on h7 he would have the defence l... h8 2 Rh6 Sg8.
68 The Art of Attack in Chess
W
Damiano's Mate This is a position from the book (1512) by Damiano, a Portuguese apothecary, one of the first authors in the literature of European chess. White mates in five moves.
1 Sh8+ Nxh8 2 Hhl+ Ng8 3 Sh8+ 3?xh8 4 Whl+ Ng8 5 Rh7#.
The rook sacrifices were naturally introduced to make the essential point clear: the queen must reach the h-file with gain of tempo. The pattern of Damiano's mate can be seen more clearly in the following ex- amples.
1 Rh5 Ne7 2 fh7+ 8 3 Rh8#.
In this case a bishop has been placed on f8 and also a pawn on d6, with the re- sult that the bishop can only move to e7, where it blocks the king's escape. The general theme of Damiano's mate, the pattern of which is characterized by a black pawn on g7 and a white pawn or bishop on g6, can be subjected to numer- ous variations. The following diagram serves as a memory aid for mates with queen and rook: Black, to move, cannot avoid mate; if he plays 1..J±>g7, then 2 Rh6+ and 3 Rh7# Mating patterns 69 or 3 Rh8#, while if l...f6, then 2 Rh7#. If Black has another pawn on g7 he can save himself from immediate mate by 1...f6, while if he has one on g6 he can ex- tricate himself by l... g7.
B
Of the mates with queen and bishop this position is worth remembering. Black cannot save himself from mate, but if he plays 1.. .g6, White does not re- ply 2 Bxg6+ (which is answered by 2... g7, and Black's king slips away) but 2 Rh6, in which case there is no remedy against mate. Smothered Mate The smothered mate with queen and knight is a celebrated one: 1 £}f7+ <Ng8 2 Nh6+ Nh8 (or 2 3 W7#) 3 Rg8+! Sxg8 (or 3...Nxg8) 4 2Bf7#.
70 The Art of Attack in Chess
This position falls into category of typical mates, and it is useful to know the mating patterns which arise if Black tries to parry the threat of Rh7#, e.g. with l...fib8. If there is a black pawn on e7 or if the square is otherwise occupied by Black, then there follows 2 Rh7+ Nf8 3 Rh8#; if this is not so, mate can be achieved, for example, by 2 Rxf7+ Nh8 3 Sg8 4 Rh5#. Of the various attacking positions with queen and knight this scheme is also well worth remembering. On 1 Nf6+, Black replies l...Nh8 and if 2 Nh5+, then
2...f6.
If l...Ng7, White has a double check with 2 £te8+ (in some cases, depending on the arrangement of the other pieces, 2 Nh5+ may be stronger) and after
2.. . h6 3 4+ g5 4 Vfrf6+ *N115 5 Ng7+ White only needs a pawn on g2 or h2 to
force mate. Greco fs Mate This position is also worth knowing; Black is forced he is mated by 2 Nxf7+ <Nh8 3 g6! hxg5 4 Rh5#. to play l...h6, after which Mating patterns 71 In the case of mating patterns with rook and bishop one should first of all get to know the above position. It is Black's move and he must try to parry Sg5#; this cannot be achieved by 1 ...h6, because of 2 Sxh6, which leaves him with no way out. So l...Nc8 2 fig5+ Nf8 3 Sg7!, and now too mate is unavoidable, for Black is unable to free the square d7 in time to provide the king with an escape square. If he did not have, for instance, the pawn on c6, he could play 3...jLc6 4 Sxh7 e8 and then 5 2h8+ could be met by 5... d7. One could replace Black's bishop and c6-pawn by a white pawn on c6 and a black one on c7; mate would still be unavoidable . Morphy's Mate The pattern of this mate with rook and bishop becomes clear in its final stage. 1 xf6 gxf6 2 Sgl+ <Nh8 3 Nxf6#.
1 In the diagram position, Black can avoid mate by l...Ha8 2 fig5+ f8 3 Sg7
Ha4 4 fixh7 Xtg4. It is true to say that this defence is not often available in prac- tical situations, but it is worth bearing in mind the idea of 'defending from be- hind' because it is often overlooked.
72 The Art of Attack in Chess
Morphy's Concealed Mate A similar mating pattern occurs in this diagram: 1 Exg7+ Nh8 2 Exf7+ (not 2 Sgl+ because of 2...f6) 2...<Ng8 3 Eg7+ Nh8 4 Egl+ Ef6 5 Nxf6#.
1 Zd8+ <Nf7 (or 1...< 'h7 2 Eh8#) 2 fif8# is a typical mating pattern well worth
remembering. Anastasia's Mate
1 Ne7+ Nh8 2 Exh7+ Nxh7 3 Eh5#.
(The name comes from W. Heinse's novel Anastasia and chess (1803), in which this mate is recorded.) Mating patterns 73 Here the continuation ends with a typical mating pattern with a rook and pawn.
1 Rg5 *h8 2 Rh6 Sg8 3 Rxh7+ Nxh7 4 Hhl#.
'Blind swine' If it is White's move, he mates with 1 Sg7+, 2 Bh7+, and 3 fibg7#. If Black is to move and plays l.."Sfd8, White can neither force mate or even win. That is to say, after 2 fig7+ *h8 3 Hh7+ <4>g8 4 Sbg7+ <±>f8 5 5b7, Black simply plays
5...Ng8, 'questioning* the white rook and countering the threat of mate. (It de-
pends of course on the distribution of the other pieces whether White can in fact win. In this position he can easily mate if he has a pawn on h4, for he plays 6 h5 followed by 7 h6, 8 Hbg7+, and 9 Sh8# ~ a mate which is worth remembering. In this line Black's pawn on f6 is actually a help to White. If it were not there, Black could get a draw after 6 h5 by playing 6...Sa6!.)
74 The Art of Attack in Chess
The pair of rooks which 'grunt out check' on the seventh rank but cannot get a sight of mate were once nicknamed 'blind swine'by Janowski. An acquaintance with typical mating patterns is extremely useful when mak- ing a quick survey of the board in an actual game. The addition of further mate- rial to the position can be especially useful, for then one can see which changes help to prevent mate and which enrich the mating patterns in new situations. Less usual mating patterns Of the large number of less usual, and even exotic, mating patterns, I have chosen ones which bear some nickname or which can easily be given one.

Boden's Mate This position is from the game Schulder-Boden, London 1853 , in which the following mate with two bishops was recorded for the first time; it is not uncom- mon after castling queenside. Black plays: l...Rxc3+! 2 bxc3 Ba3#. Pillsbury's Mate
1 Sxg7+ <Nh8 2 Sg8+! Nxg8 3 Sgl+ and mate.
This is really a variation on Morphy's mate, contrived in such a way that it is the rook which mates and not the bishop, which is under attack from Black's rook.
1 In the original book this example was incorrectly given as Macdonell-Boden,
1869 and Black's rook on e8 was missing. Mating patterns 77 Legall's Mate Legall was Philidor's teacher and this position arose in the game Legall-St Brie, Paris 1750. The moves leading up to the diagram were 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 d6 3 Jlc4 Bg4 4 Nc3 g6? and Legall now played: 5 Nxe5! .xdl? (5... .e6 would have been better) 6 Bxf7+ e7 7 Nd5#. (This is of course a case of an attack be- fore castling, but the example is given here for purely practical reasons.) The next mate is similar to Greco's, but differs in that the attacker (here Black) opens the h-file not only for his opponent but also for himself. It arose in the game Anderssen-Max Lange, Breslau 1859 after 1 e4 e5 2 £13 Nc6 3 Bb5 Nd4

Blackburne's Mate Mating patterns 79 For this mate the attacker needs three minor pieces (two bishops and a knight) and usually a queen as well, which is sacrificed. 1 hl h5 2 Rxh5! gxh5 3 ±h7#. This mating pattern is named after Black- burne, who was the first to mate in this way.
5 Focal-points
The series of examples examined in the chapter on mating patterns has given us a good idea of the difficulties a defender encounters when his forces (especially the pawns in front of his castled king) are poorly placed and when the attacker's one aim is to fill the various 'holes and cracks' in the weakened enemy defences with his own pieces and thus obtain an even tighter grip. It follows from this that the squares in the immediate vicinity of the king, where the drama of the mating attack usually reaches its climax, play a special role. If the attacker threatens mate or actually mates on these squares, they are mating focal-points, but if he only harries the king from them or uses them as points from which to break into the castled position, they are called strategic or auxiliary focal-points. It may be that there is more than one mating focal-point, and in that case we speak of com- pound focal-points. If there are many focal-points (both mating and strategic) on squares of the same colour, we speak of a network of weak squares. Generally speaking, every focal-point is a weak square in the defender's terri- tory and a potentially strong one for the attacker. In addition to the focal-points there are also other squares in the castling area which have a specific function, e.g. blocked squares, particularly those occupied by the defender's pawns, and also any weak squares on which the attacker can safely post his pieces. As an illustration of this, take the following position (which we have already seen earlier). Here we have the following scheme: Focal-points 81 • mating squares: g8 and f8; • mating focal-points: h7 and h8; • auxiliary focal-point: h7 (after Black parries mate by ...Be7) • attacker's strong squares: f7, g6 and h7; • blocked squares: g7 and later e7. The focal-point at g7 As usual, when referring to specific squares we assume that White is the attacker. It is understood that if Black is the attacker, then the discussion applies equally to the square g2. The most important focal-points where castling kingside is concerned are g7 and h7, since these squares are more accessible to the attacker than the others in the castling area. Of the two, h7 is the more frequent object of attack (since it co- mes under fire from the bishop operating from d3, a natural point of develop- ment, while the king's knight can reach g5, for example, more easily than f5 or h5). However, attacks against g7 are the more dangerous. The reasons for this are very simple: the queen can mate more easily from g7 than h7 (owing to the king's ability to flee to f8), but as well as this, a weakness on g7 usually brings with it two more on f6 and h6, while one on h7 generally only entails a single ex- tra one at g6. Every player of any experience is well acquainted with this fact and knows that ...g6 involves a greater weakening than ...h6. On the other hand, h7 is usually harder to defend than g7, which the king's bishop can support in two ways (from f8 or f6). The next position illustrates a typical example of an action against the square g7:
82 The Art of Attack in Chess
White, to play, has excellent prospects for an attack on g7. His knight is al- ready observing the square, while his queen and bishop are in a position to threaten it in one move. An extremely useful point is the fact that the queen has the choice of attacking from either c3 or g3. Nevertheless, the situation is not quite as simple as that, and White must be prepared to sacrifice his bishop on h6 if he is to obtain a winning position; by simply playing 1 Rg3, White would only gain a relatively small advantage, e.g. I...g6 2 Bg5 Rc5 3 W6+ Bxf6 4 Bxf6, when Black can counter with 4...h6 followed by ..&hT Only 1 Bh6! guarantees complete success; the main reason why it is better to move the bishop rather than the queen is that in order to attack g7 the bishop has only the one move to h6, whereas the queen has a choice between c3 and g3. Thus the bishop enters the fray first, while the queen waits to see which will be better, depending on Black's reply. Thus: If 1...gxh6, then 2 Rc3 f6 (if 2...Nf8, then 3 W'6+ leads to a quick conclusion) 3 g3+ Bg4 (otherwise the queen mates on g7) 4 Rxg4+ f7 5 g7+ <Ne6 6 £}f4+ d7 7 £k!5 followed by 8 Nxf6+. In this variation the queen is most effec- tive if it goes first to c3 and then to g3. If 1...Bf8, then White plays 2 .xg7 .xg7 3 Rg3 as
4 Rxg7+ e7 5 Rg5+
2 Rc3 f6 3 Nxf6+ and White wins, for after 3...Bxf6 4 Rxf6 Black has no de-
fence against mate on g7. In order not to be unfair to Black, who tends to suffer in books such as this, here are some actual cases where White came to grief on the analogous square - g2. Focal-points 83 This position arose in the game Coria-Capablanca, Buenos Aires 1914. Black, to move, attacks g2: White played this in desperation; if 3 Nxg2 Rg5 4 f3, Black plays 4...£}h3+ and wins White's queen - a typical trick in positions such as this.
3...Nxe4 4 Ng3 £413#.
This position is taken from Field-Tenner, New York 1933. It is Black's move. I...Nf4 2 xe41 Rh3! 0-1 The attack on g2, with its threat of mate, is carried on regardless. White re- signed since he sees that 3 gxh3 is followed by 3... xh3#. The following position arose in the game Boleslavsky-Ufimtsev, Semi-finals USSR Championship, Omsk 1944. The Soviet master and geologist Ufimtsev, playing Black, overcame his great opponent as follows:
1...£te4! 2 Ra5
After 2 Bxb6 4bxd2 White cannot play 3 Nxd2 because of the attack on g2, so he would lose either his bishop on b6 or his knight on f3.

Since 26...hxg6 is answered by 27 Sh3+ and mate. A pointed end to a game which contained some typical manoeuvres in the struggle by the queen and knight for the focal-point g7. Further examples of play against the focal-point g7 are contained in the chap- ter on fianchettoed positions. The focal-point h7 While the attacker cannot easily target g7, the square h7 is often exposed to dan- ger even in the opening stages of a game, although attacks based on h7 as a fo- cal-point are generally not so dangerous as those aimed at g7. This important point has already been noted, together with the reason for it, i.e. the fact that the 1 24 xb7, winning a piece, is even more convincing. Focal-points 89 king can escape from g8 to f8, whereas to avoid the threat of the queen on g7 the king has to travel further (to e8 or e7). Because of this, the main task involved in attacks on the focal-point g7 is the 'clearing' of that square, while the possible escape of the king is a minor worry. In attacks on h7 the 'clearing' is usually the easier task, while the attacker's main preoccupation is to stop the king escaping; this means essentially that he should have a new focal-point in view, if the attack is to be successful. In other words, the possible escape of the king turns the pri- mary focal-point h7 into a secondary one, so that a new, real focal-point becomes necessary. It is worth keeping this important fact in mind, since in practice the majority of possible attacks on h7 founder precisely on the king's use of the sim- ple defensive expedient of running away. These factors, which apply to most attacks on h7, are well illustrated by the following example. White, to move, begins with 1 Wbl!. Black's queen has to guard the square e8, and so has only two replies: 1) l...Rd7 2 Se7! (after 2 Sxe8+? Rxe8 3 Rh7+ Nf8 White's attack comes to a dead end, since the black king has e7 to escape to) 2...Rxe7 (2...Sxe7 has the same effect, while if 2...Rd8, then 3 Rh7+ followed by 4 2xf7#) 3 Rh7+ <Nf8 4 Rh8#. 2) l...Rc6 2 d5 Rc8 3 £Lxe8+ (this is all right now, but 3 He7? would not do because of 3...jtxg5) 3...Rxe8 4 Rh7+ f8 5 d6, and Black cannot avoid mate next move by 6 Rh8#. White's combination, then, has two variations, and the point of each is to de- prive Black's king of an escape to e7, either by blocking it or playing d6. The square h7 appears here as a secondary focal-point, while the crucial factor in the combination is the mate when the king reaches f8.
90 The Art of Attack in Chess
There is in fact such an abundance of attacks against the castled king with a real or secondary focal-point at h7, and they differ so widely, that an attempt to systematize them would take us too far afield; let us be content with a few general examples, and then deal in more detail with 'the classic bishop sacrifice on h7', which in practice is the most important kind of attack on the focal-point h7.

This position arose in Szabo- Kotov, Groningen 1946. It is White's move, and he effects the 'clearing' of the focal-point h7 by eliminating the knight on f6: 1 2kd5! exd5 2 Nxf6 £Af5 The only reply, though an inadequate one.
3 Rxf5 g6
White now continued with 4 Rxg6+ fxg6 5 Bxd5+ Sf7 6 kxel and won on the basis of his material advantage, but 4 Bxe7 gxf5 5 Bxf8 would have been even clearer. Focal-points 91 Here we have a straightforward example of the creation of a mating position by directing the queen and a pawn against the focal-point h7, followed by a typi- cal new mate after the black king has escaped.

In this position Black aims to drive White's rook from f4 and then proceed with ...g3, creating a threat against h2. He plays:

If 2 d4 Bxf4 3 Bxf4, Black continues 3...g3 4 Rf3 Rh2+ 5 &fl hl+ 6 Ne2 Nf6 7 xg3 Bg4+ 8 Ne3 Wcl+ 9 Nd3 Wfl+ 10 ?c2 Rxc4 and wins. If 2 W3 Nxf4 3 Rxf4 Wel+ 4 Nh2 (both 4 Afl Sh7 and 4 #fl Wxfi+ 5 xfl Sh7 are in Black's favour) 4...Nf6! 5 Nxh8, Black wins by 5...g3+6 Rxg3 Ng4+.
2...dxe5 3 Sf7
If 3 Sfl, Black plays 3. ..O-O-O and then ...g3, forcing mate. At once 3...g3 would not be good because of 4 Jlf7+ and 5 h5.
3...g3
This move is now playable; indeed, it is obligatory, since after 3...O-O-O 4 d3 g3 Black is a tempo behind with his attack; White then has the following defence, a characteristic one in such positions: 5 Qh2+ 6 &fl Whl+ 7 JLgl, and Black's attack has come to nothing.
4 Rf3 .g4! (D)
A typical method of preparing the mating net; one should not check if this only simplifies the opponent's defence. It should be noted that checking at h2 and then hl loses a tempo. Black's aim is to oblige the white king to move to fl of its own free will, and then give check with the queen directly at hl , without stopping at h2.

Admittedly, he controls the square h7, but, at the same time, he cannot prevent the black king from escaping via f7 when it is checked. If the game is continued correctly, White can only obtain perpetual check, not mate. Both 17

Never- theless, Black can then win by 20...Nf8 21 Rh5+ g6, etc. This simple continua- tion was, strangely enough, not noticed by Keres's 'correspondence customers', and Euwe also fails to record it in his opening works, giving instead a draw by 2O... .xe6? 21 dxe6+ Sxe6 22 Bxe6+ ixeb 23 xg6+ Rf6 24 Se3+, etc.

The reader will find further examples concerning the focal-point h7 in the next chapter, which deals with the classic bishop sacrifice. These examples provide a typical illustration of the part played by the square h7 as a mating and secondary focal-point. The auxiliary focal-point f7 Mention has already been made of the vulnerability of the square f7 before cas- tling, and now we shall examine the part played by an assault on that square after

the king has castled. First of all, it should be remarked that the square f7 is only in exceptional cases the focal-point in the true sense, i.e. the square from which mate is effected. However, it is very often an auxiliary focal-point, which is at- tacked either in order to drive the king away from g8 or, by means of a sacrifice, to draw the king on to the actual square itself. The following position from the game Tylor-Koltanowski, Hastings 1930 arose after the moves 1 d4 CT6 2 3f3 d6 3 c3 £}bd7 4 e4 e5 5 Bc4 $Le7 6 O-O a O-O 7 e2 exd4 8 <Nxd4 Ee8 (D). White, by attacking f7, drew Black's king out from the safety of its castled po- sition.

Black therefore played 13...Nd5, but after 14 dxe7 Sxe7 15 Nd5 his position was hopeless. The following position from the game Burn-E. Cohn, Breslau 1912 illustrates a faulty attack on f7. It was White's move and he played:

This presents White with a tempo, which is decisive. After the correct 2... f8! one cannot see how White's attack can succeed, for example 3 Bxf6 Jtxf6 4 Rxh7 Sac8! 5 d5 Ng5 6 Qh8+ e7, and Black can defend himself satisfacto- rily.

Focal-points 99 This position occurred in the game Najdorf-Ivkov from the last round of the tournament at Mar del Plata 1955.

Focal-points 101 Complex focal-points Just as a successful combination derives essentially from the multiple effects of single moves, so attacks on the castled king are also more likely to succeed if they are built up with the assistance of threats against a number of different squares. We shall find that in many attacks of this kind the attacker tries to comer the king by creating a second or even a third focal-point. There have already been cases of such complex focal-points in previous examples, but we shall now ex- amine the matter more closely. We have already mentioned the part played by secondary focal-points and by the combination of this kind of focal-point with a real one. However, here we will examine only the combining of two or more real focal-points, i.e. squares from which a player either actually mates or could do so in a variation. These real com- plex focal-points can be divided up as follows: 1 ) The focal-points are adjacent squares of different colours (e.g. g7 and h7). 2) The focal-points are nearby squares of the same colour (e.g. h7 and f7). 3) The focal-points are of the same colour and make up a whole complex or network of squares (e.g. f6, g7 and h8). In general, one or more of the attacker's pieces control both focal-points, while the rest, in the course of the attack, transfer their influence from one focal- point to the other, preferably in the shortest time possible (i.e. one move). As far as simultaneous influence over two squares of different colours is concerned, for practical purposes only the queen comes into consideration, and in exceptional cases the rook; but if the focal -points are of the same colour, both the knight and, in particular, the bishop are effective. All the pieces are capable of transferring the attack from one focal-point to the other, though the bishop is unable to do this if the focal-points are of different colours. The bishop is, however, well suited to the case of focal-points of the same colour, while when the focal-points belong to the third group, it is indeed the classic piece by which the whole network is domi- nated. When play is based on focal-points of different colours, the attack may be switched rapidly from one of the squares to the other. However, the commoner and more important cases are those in which there are two separate stages, the at- tack on the first focal-point being exhausted before the player transfers it deci- sively to the second. This transfer is often combined with a transformation of the mating pattern. An example of this is given in the following diagram (D). White, to move, begins with a sharp threat against the focal-point g7.

102 The Art of Attack in Chess
In order to be able to meet 2 Rh6 by 2...2g8. l...Rc6 is weaker because of 2 Ef3 and Black has only made his position worse.
2 Ih6 Sg8
White can clearly go no further in his threats against g7, but a new opportunity now offers itself - a rapid preparation for mate on h7, for which the queen is al- ready excellently placed; all that is needed is to bring a rook on to the h-file.
3 Ef3! Nxf3
Forced, since there was a threat not only of 4 Hh3 (against which, for example, 1 3... c6 would have helped2) but also of 4 Rxh7+ and 5 Sh3#. 4 gxf3 d5 The new threat of a queen sacrifice followed by Hh2# wipes out Black's de- fence. White does not play 5 Sh2 now, in which case Black would give up his queen for the rook, but 5 f4, when Black can only stave off mate for a move or two by sacrificing his queen at f4. In the following diagram we have an instructive example of play using focal- points of different colours. The threat against the focal-point h7 is replaced by one against g7. Then comes the decisive moment in the main variation - a sudden simultaneous attack on h7 and g7. In one sub- variation there even appears a third focal-point at f7.
1 Hhl g8!
By l...Bxg3+ 2 Ne2 Black would only make the defence more difficult for himself. In playing l... g8! he attempts to defend by running with his king, i.e. he surrenders h7 to White and hopes for the continuation 2 xh7+? f8 3 hS-F 1 2 Rh6 forces immediate mate.

Focal-points 103 Ne7, which leads to a complete consolidation of the black king's position; the ta- bles are then turned and Black threatens ...Ec3 followed by play on the queenside against the weak spots in White's camp. Therefore, White does not capture on h7, but hits on a manoeuvre to open up the d3-h7 diagonal by the lethal f6. 2Hh5! The passive 2 Eh3 would be weak, while 2 Eh4? is clearly no good because of
2...jlxg3+ and 3..Bxh4.
The text move threatens 3 Sg5+ fxg5 4 f6 with the double threat of 5 Rg7# and 5 Bxh7+ h8 6 Bg6+ Sfcg8 7 Rh7+ f8 8 Rxf7#. This main variation, cul- minating in simultaneous threats against h7 and g7 can, it is true, be countered by
2...Rd6, but that allows 3 Rxh7+, 4 Rh8+, and 5 1 xc8, when White is a rook
up. After 2....Nxg3+ 3 Ne2 Black can do nothing in the face of Eg5+ and f6. However, he discovers a subtle defence, which is typical for such positions.
2...Rc7 (D)
104 The Art of Attack in Chess
This protects the third focal-point at f7, which is important as the final mating square in the combination beginning with 3 Sg5+; thus after 3...fxg5 4 f6 -Nxf6 5 Bxh7+ there is no mate. But White still has one trump card left. 3b6! Attacking Black's queen, which is overloaded with duties at the key square c7: it is obliged to guard the rook (against the possibility of Rxh7+ and Rh8+) and also watch the square f7. Black therefore played:
3..>d7
If 3... .xg3+, White would in this case have to play 4 si?f3'1. 4fih4 A simple move and one which shows that Black's queen has yet another func- tion - to maintain control of the b8-h2 diagonal. There is now an irresistible threat of fig4+; 4...Bxg3+ 5 <4?xg31Bfd6+ 6 <£ 3 Rf8 is useless due to 7 Rxh7#. An excellent example of the shift of threats from one focal-point to another, and at the same time a lesson in the troubles facing a piece which is overburdened with different functions. In this position, from Szabo- van Scheltinga, Hil versum 1947, White won in interesting fashion. 1 2>g5 g6 2 d5 White's first move, with its attack on h7, forced a weakening on the long diag- onal, and his subsequent manoeuvres aim to bring the queen to that diagonal. Black should try 3...Well, creating serious counter-threats and preventing 4 Hg5+ fxg5 5 f6 because of 5...IIc2+ 6 Bxc2 Rxc2+, followed by 7...Rg6. White should continue 4 fih4 Sc2+ 5 jLxc2 Rxc2+ 6 d?gl Rxf5 7 Rh5 with a large advantage, but of course there is no mate. Focal-points 105

After 10...Rxe5 the attack returns to the original focal-point at h7 in the shape of 11 Sxh7#. This position arose in the game V. Vukovic-Endzelins from the match between Yugoslavia and Latvia at the 1936 Munich Olympiad. White first obtained free- dom of action for himself by blocking the long light diagonal. 1 d5! exd5 If l... Bxd5, then 2 Rg5 g6 3 Jlxg6, etc.
2 Qtel 3 Nxg7! Nxg7 4 Rg5+ Nh8 5 Rh4+
White checks from h4 rather than h6 to give Black the chance to make a mis- take. Endzelins did in fact fall for it and played 5...<Ng7?; this was followed by 6 £}d4, and Black lost his queen, since Nf5+ leads to a terrible catastrophe on the focal-point g7. The rest of the actual game is of no interest (it finished 6...Sg8 7 Rg5+ *3?f8 8 Nxe6+ <Ne7 9 Bg7 Sxg7 10 Hifxg7 Sg8 11 £el+ 1-0), but what does interest is an analysis of Black's more tenacious reply 5...Ng8 (D). Rellstab in his book of the tournament states that White would then have to satisfy himself with perpetual check, but this is not correct. Admittedly, after 6 £jd4 Sxcl! 7 fixcl Re5 8 £}f5 Black has the reply 8... e4!, an interesting ex- ample of a move with a double defensive purpose with reference to the focal- points h7 and g7, around which White's attack revolves. Further attempts, e.g. by
9 Rg4+ Nh8 10 f3, are dangerous for White because of 10...Bc8!, while other
short-cuts also have obstacles in their way. It was, however, White's intention to

take the rook with his queen, and this would in fact have won the game, as the following analysis shows:
6 Rg5+ Nh8 7 Rh6+ Ng8 8 2>d4 Sxcl 9 Wxcl! WeS 10
There is now an attack on the two focal-points h7 and g7, combined in some variations with another on f7. If Black plays 10...£te4, there follows 11 Bxe4 dxe4 12 Rg5+ Nh8 13 Sd7! when Black has no proper defence against the threat of 14 h6+ and 15 e7+ winning his queen, e.g. if 13...fie8, then 14 115+ Ng8 15 Rxf7+ mating.

The only way to meet the threat of 12 £}e7+ and 13 1fifxh7#.
12 Bd6! Jlxd6
Neither 12...£}g5 13 Nxe8 nor 12...Ee7 13 .xh7+ h8 14 £}f5 hold out any hope for Black.
13 Jlxh7+ h8 14 .g6+ with the final mate on f7 .
Into the second group fall focal-points of the same colour which do not qualify as 'a network of squares'. The most typical case is that of h7 and f7, and in the next example we shall examine the most typical attack by the queen and bishop against these two squares. In the following diagram White begins with:
1 Rh5
He is threatening to sacrifice his bishop on h6 because all the essential precon- ditions for such a sacrifice have been fulfilled, as will be seen from the following analysis. We shall examine those replies by Black which lead to the characteristic formation of white queen on h6 and bishop on the bl-h7 diagonal. We shall leave aside the replies 1...Qe6 and l...f6, the first of which is bad because of 2 Bf5 and the second because of 2 1iFg6. Focal-points 107 First of all, the naive capture l...Rxb4?. This is defeated by the sacrifice 2 jlxh6 gxh6 3 Rxh6, threatening mate on h7. This could be parried by 3,..Ee8, but Black then has to pay for the unprotected focal-point at f7 after 4 Bh7+ hS
5 Ng6+ *g8 6 Rh7+ *f8 7 Rxf7#.
We have seen that the square f7 must be protected by the queen, since the rook on f8 has to move after the sacrifice, which suggests 1 ...£}b6 or 1...£}a7. These too are answered by 2 Bxh6 gxh6 3 Rxh6, and if 3...He8, then 4 Rh7+ and 5 Rh8#; nor is there any future in 3,..f6 4 exf6 Hxf6 5 Hxe7 Hxh6 6 Hxb7. Black realizes that his queen is not well placed on e7 because it blocks this es- cape square and thus enables White to mate with his queen on h8. Black can try to move his queen away, but in such a way that it still protects the focal-point f7: L.Rc7 2 Bxh6 gxh6 3 Rxh6 He8 (or 3...f6 4 exf6, with the decisive threat of 5 He7) 4 Had Rd7 5 ±h7+ 4>h8 6 Nf5+ and White wins the queen. From this it can be seen that Black's queen could not even have gone to d7 on the first move. We can now cut our speculation short; there only remain l...He8 and l...Hd8. That l...Hd8 is no good can be seen after 2 Bxh6 gxh6 3 Qxh6, since then l.'.'Vitf) cannot be played because of 4 Rg5+. Thus we arrive at the main variation: l...He8 After this move the sacrifice of the bishop on h6 is somewhat more compli- cated, but it is still White's best continuation. On the other hand, 2 Nf4 is also good; less useful here (as on the first move) is 2 Rg4 because of 2...<4?h8 3 Rxd4 Hd8 4 Rc3 $3b6 and Black can hold his own.
2 Jkxh6 gxh6 3 Rxh6 6
This is the right reply. After 4 Bh7+ <Nh8 White now gets nowhere by 5 g6+, while the other discovered checks fail because White's queen is attacked
108 The Art of Attack in Chess
by Black's; furthermore, if 5 Rh5, Black has the reply 5... g7 6 jLf5 Rh6 with an adequate defence. White's later play is interesting, even if it is no longer as typical of this kind of attack as the possibilities cited hitherto.
4 Rh7+ £f 8 5 Bf5 (D )
White's queen is now best placed where it is, on h7; further checks would only make it easier for Black to defend himself.
5..>c6
After 5... d5 6 Rh6+ Black cannot play 6...Ng8 due to 7 jLh7+ and 8 Be4+, while 6...Ne7 7 Jle4 wins the black bishop, for 7...Rd7 is defeated by 8 e6. 5 ...Rb6 is of no use either, since 6 Sac 1! leaves Black without a reasonable re- ply, e.g. if 6...£te7, then 7 e6 fxe6 8 Bxe6 is quickly decisive. e4 Rb6 7 Bxb7 Rxb7 8 e6 and White wins. The threat is 9 Rh8+ <Ne7 10 exf7+ and the reply 8... d6 fails against 9 e7+ and 10 Rh8#. This analysis shows what great power there is in the formation of queen at h6 and bishop at d3 when combined with a rook at e1 and a pawn at e5. The various operations connected with the focal-points h7 and f7 are well worth remember- ing, since opportunities to use them arise frequently in actual games. Since the defender must move his rook from f8 when mate is threatened at h7, it is clearly a decisive factor whether or not the focal-point f7 is protected by other pieces. An alternative defence involves ...f6 or ...f5, but the success of such a reply depends on the other features of the position, which must be carefully assessed. The main feature of the third group is the network of weak squares of the same colour; here the attacker's bishop is, as a rule, the piece which controls the Focal-points 109 focal -points permanently, while the others are used for manoeuvring purposes. It should be noted that control over a network of squares is also an important factor in positional play, but in attacks on the castled king it is particularly effective. The reason for this is a positional one, since control over a network is often of a fairly permanent nature. The most essential precondition is to 'clear' the network not only of the influence of the opponent's bishop (either by eliminating it or driving it away) but also of possible resistance from the opponent's pawns at im- portant points in the network. When the attacker has 'cleared' the network and fixed the position, the attack- ing operation proper follows; the squares which are candidate focal-points can easily be determined, while the other squares in the network may serve as sec- ondary focal-points or else as strong squares for the attacker to post his pieces on. In the above diagram the network of dark squares is already 'cleared' and cov- ered by White's bishop, which is firmly installed at f6. The network consists of the squares f6, g7 and h8, and also the connected squares f8 and h6. The squares g7 and h8 are candidates as focal-points, f6 is a strong square for the attacker's pieces while f8 and h6 can serve as secondary focal-points or strong squares. All this concentration of white power encircles the unfortunate black king, which has no real prospect of extricating itself from the net and escaping to the queenside, since e7 is also controlled by White. Black does not even have a dark-squared bishop to provide resistance on the network, and because of the blocked position in the centre he cannot undertake a counterattack; he is confined to defending himself. The only minor piece he has left is a knight, but this piece can in fact exercise considerable defensive influence in positions of this kind. If White's domination is based on a dark-square network, Black still has one thing on which he can logically rely - the solid structure of his position on the
110 The Art of Attack in Chess
light squares. In some such cases the success of an attack depends on the ability to break down resistance on the light squares by means of a sacrifice. This fea- ture appears in the analysis of the above position, which, by virtue of its simplic- ity and its typical character, will well repay study. It is Black's move, and his first concern is to provide a defence against White's manoeuvre Rd2-h6, which threatens to bring about disaster on the focal-point g7. Various attempts at defence by Black and attacking stratagems by White, all of them typical and consequently instructive, will now be examined in a series of continuations. A) l...h6 Black is contemplating a defensive system with his king on h7 and his knight on g8, which could be reached after, say, 2 Rd2 h7 3 Se3 £te7 4 Sh3 £}g8. White can then assert his superiority by 5 -&.g5 h5 6 g4, but l...h6 can be better punished as follows:
2 Ee3! <Nh7 3 Sh3 Ne7 4 Sxh6+! 3>xh6 5 Rg4 <Nh7 6 Rh3+ Ng8 7 Rh8#.
Here we see the part played by the focal-points at h6 and h8. B) l...h5 2 Rd2 Nh7 (D) Forced, as White threatened mate by 3 h6; if 2... f8, then 3 Rh6+ also mates. 3Wg5 The simplest answer, as it prevents ...£}e7 for a decisive tempo. Also good is 3 g4, for 3...hxg4 is met by 4 Rg5 and mate. If 3 Se3, Black can defend himself more stubbornly with 3...£te7 4 Sh3 5 g4 Nh6 followed by 6...Sg8.
3...Sc7 4 Se3 Ne7 5 Sh3
Otherwise White mates by 6 Sxh5+!. Focal-points 111
6 g4 Hg8
Or 6...£jh6 7 Sxh5, etc. 7 gxf5 gxf5 8 fixh5#. In this example it is the resistance on the light squares that is overcome. C) l...Re8 Black's queen is hoping to defend from f8. 2 fie3 Rf8 3 Zh3 h6 4 Rd2 Nh7 5 Ng5 h5 6 Re2 £te7 7 Sxh5+! gxh5 8 Rxh5+ sfc'gS 9 Bf6 £3g6 10 flel, and Black has no answer to the threat of Se3-h3 followed by Rh8+ and mate. This is an important mating pattern in such positions. D) 2 Rd2 Re8 Or 2...Nf5 3 g4 £}g7 4 Rh6 £}e8 5 Se3, threatening both 6 fih3 and 6 xh7-K
3 Ze3 Rf8 4 Sh3 Sc7
This position can also arise in variation C.
5 Rg5 b5 6 Rh4
White may also play 6 g4, 7 Sh6, and 8 Rh4.
6...h5 7 Rg5 Nh7 8 SxhS+I gxh5 9 Rxh5+ Rh6 10 Rxf7+ and mate.
Yet another instructive mating pattern !

112 The Art of Attack in Chess
4 Rxh7 a4 5 Se3
At this point White gains nothing from checking, but must instead bring his rook to f3.
5.. >c2 6 Sf3 Rxb2 7 Hfl Ra3
This parries the threat of 8 $Lxe7, but now 8 Bg5 £}f5 9 g4 decides the game. In this variation the black king wriggled out to the edge of the network of weak dark squares, but even there he met his fate, its cause being the last square in the network, e7. We shall not leave the above diagram yet, because a feature of very great prac- tical importance should be pointed out. This is the benefit derived by White from the action of his rook on the h-file. Without an opportunity of making the ma- noeuvre Se3-h3, White cannot take Black's position by storm, because he lacks a threat against h7 ; if this does not exist, Black does not have to weaken his posi- tion, since he can easily ward off the threats against g7 alone. So even in this case, where there is a definite 'same-colour network', there is still a part to be played by alternative focal-points on squares of different colours (h7 or f7), and this applies in most practical cases. The weaknesses on the squares of the net- work are usually only the more sensitive ones, which does not mean that squares of the other colour will necessarily be safe - the king may succumb on them too ! We have noted the important part played by the rook on the h-file in the varia- tions above, and we shall now go on to examine how positions of this kind can be exploited if there is no chance of employing a rook. Suppose that we move White's h-pawn from h2 to h4 in the above diagram; this gives a new situation of a type which often arises in practice, for the h-pawn is frequently advanced dur- ing the game. The pawn's being on h4 considerably blunts White's attack, and 1 h4? in the diagrammed position would be a poor move. Nevertheless, even with the pawn on h4 White has the better game, although he can only exploit his ad- vantage slowly and Black retains chances of attacking on the queenside. Indeed, if Black's position on that side were a little further advanced, one could conclude that he would be able to preserve the balance. However, as things stand White is still the stronger, and we shall examine one continuation arising out of the new situation. The modified diagram (with the pawn on h4) is given on the following page.
1...b5 2 Rd2 Re8 3 Se3
In this case too White's rook belongs on h3, even though his attack along the h-file is only a 'thing of the future'.
3...W8 4 Sh3 aS
4.. .h5 would be to White's advantage, since it would simplify his task of open-
ing up the g- and h-files, for example 5 g4 hxg4 6 Sh2 a5 7 h5 followed by 8 hxg6 Focal-points 113 (but not 8 h6? because of 8... h7, and Black is at once in a safe position!) with a decisive attack.
5 h5 b4 6 g3
White's plan, a typical one in positions of this kind, is to play Ng2 and then Sahl. The immediate 6 hxg6 would be weaker, for Black would reply 6...fxg6 opening up the second rank for defensive purposes. White must first of all post his heavy pieces in their assault positions and only then venture on hxg6.
6...a4 7 a3!
Otherwise Black obtains good prospects with ...a3.
7...bxc3 8 bxc3 (D)
B
8...Na5
A raid by a black rook along the b-file will not succeed, since both rooks are needed to defend the second rank, as can be seen from the following variation:
8...Sab8 9 <Ng2 Bb3 10 Sahl Bc7 11 Rg5 Sxa3 (or ll..>xa3 12 h6 Rf8 13
114 The Art of Attack in Chess
Rxh7+ xh7 14 hxg6+ xg6 15 Sh5 and mate) 12 hxg6 fxg6 13 Sxh7 Sxh7 14 Rxg6+ Sg7 15 Jtxg7 Rxg7 16 Re8+ and White wins. Black could, it is true, play 1 l...Sb2, in which case the above combination would not work; however, it would not stop the manoeuvre Sh4-f4.
9 Rg5 Nb3 10 Sei Sc7
Clearly, 10...h6 is bad because of 11 hxg6.
11 Ng2 Saa7 12 Sehl Sab7 13 Sh4! Sd7 14 Sf4 Sdc7
Black is unable to parry the combination which White has prepared. If White had previously made an incorrect exchange on g6, ...Re8 would now be the an- swer to everything; in the present position this move would be answered by 15 Rh6 Rf8 16 xh7+ <Nxh7 17 hxg6+ <Nxg6 18 Sg4+ Nf5 19 Sh5+ <Nxg4 20 Sg5#. 15 hxg6 fxg6 16 Rxg6+! hxg6 17 Sh8+ Nf7 18 Jld8+ and White finally wins. It is well worth remembering this analysis, especially the method of delaying the attack with the h-pawn is and how the winning position is prepared by a cal- culated deployment of the pieces. The reader will be reminded of this extremely important practical technique in the section on the role of the rook files in the at- tack on the castled king. As for the part played by the network of weak squares in attacks on the castled king, one more diagram and one interesting master game will be given as exam- ples. This position is from the game Euwe-Flohr, Amsterdam 1939. White's bishop has reached the square f6, but the network is still guarded by the opponent's dark-squared bishop, which is preparing to effect a delayed fianchetto by ...Bg7. For this reason forceful play by White is indicated. Focal-points 115
1 Bc5!
With the idea of eliminating the dark-squared bishop. If Black plays l...Bxc5, then 2 dxc5 uncovers an attack on the bishop at d7, which Black cannot defend, e.g. if 2...Rc7, the manoeuvre Qe3-h6 is decisive.
1...Rxa2 2 Bh5! e5
If 2...gxh5, then 3 Rg3+ wins, while 2..Jlg7 is answered by 3 Nxg7 Nxg7 4 Sxh7+ ixh? 5 Rxf7+, followed by 6 Bd3. Also interesting is 2...h6 3 e5 ! i'h? 4 Re3 Rxb2 5 Bd3 Wbl+ 6 JLfl g5 (if 6...gxh5, then 7 Re4+ and 8 Eg3+ wins; otherwise Black is mated by 7 Bxh6+ Bxh6 8 Rxh6+ Si?xh6 9 Bh3#) 7 Re4+ <2?g8 8 Bxg5+ hxg5 9 Bh3, etc. The move played parries the threat of 3 Rh3. 3 dxe5 i.e6 4 Rf4 Rxb2 5 £fl Ne7 He still cannot play 5.. Bg7, because of 6 Bxg7 and 7 Rh6+. 6Wh4 Euwe notes in his commentary that Black's queen is fairly well placed on b2 (by controlling f2 and f6 it prevents Rh6 being played at once) and cites as more precise 6 Bbl Rd4 (if 6...Wxbl, then 7 Rh6) 7 Bb4! Rd8 8 Rh4, etc. 6 Bd3 would also win more quickly than the move played.
6...1c5!
The great defensive master's last trump: 7 Exh7? is now no good because of
7...Qxf2+. Even so, Black is lost; the process merely takes a little longer.
7 Bh6 a5
If 7...Bg4, then 8 Ed3 with the threat of 9 Ee3!.
8 Bd3 i.xf2+
Otherwise White will play 9 Bf3.
9 Rxf2 Rxf2+ 10 *xf2 (D)
10...a4
116 The Art of Attack in Chess
The situation now becomes critical; White must get his rook to h3 before Black's pawn promotes to a queen. If 10...Sa6, there is insufficient time for 11 Be2 because of ...Sb6-b3, nor is
11 Ef3 Sb6 12 Kf4 strong enough owing to 12...g5! 13 Sf5 Sc8, and the black
king escapes to d7. Strongest, after 10...Sa6, is 11 g4 Axg4 12 Bh3!, etc. Il&e2 White can also win by 11 g4 Jtxg4 12 Bh3. After the text move Black cannot reply 11 ...a3 because of 12 g4 a2 13 Sxh7, so he tries to prolong the game by a desperate rook sacrifice. ll...Sa5 12 g4 Sxe5 13 Nxe5 Nc4 14 Sdh3 Nxe2 15 Nf6 Se6 16 e5 Nxg4
17 Sxh7 Sxf6+ 18 exf6 1-0
The rook has no difficulty in controlling the pawns, e.g. 18...jLxh3 19 Sxh3 Pilnik - Najdorf Mar del Plata, 1942 Caro- Kann Defence
1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 Nc3 dxe4 4 £}xe4 f6
Sounder is 4...Bf5 or 4... d7 followed by ...£kgf6. 5 xf6+ exf6 The doubling of the pawns on the f-file represents a slight weakness in Black's position whichever pawn he recaptures with.
6 c3 Nd6 7 Nd3 O-O 8 iFh5
Black could answer this with 8...f5 (9 Bxf5? g6) and so ward off White's at- tack without weakening his castled position. Indeed, 8...f5 not only avoids weak- ening Black's position, it also falls in with his correct positional plan, i.e. the front f-pawn is used to control squares on the e-file, while the back one (at f7) stays at home and guards any weaknesses which the front one leaves behind it. If the front pawn is exchanged in some tussle over a square, Black has got rid of the doubled pawns and the fear of an inferior ending.
8 c2 was sounder.
8...g6
Though less precise than 8...f5 this is still not a mistake.
9 Rh4 (D )
9...C5?
Fundamentally inappropriate, since White is stronger on the queenside and in particular has a firm hold on d4. Black should have left any operations on the queen's wing to White and instead prepared for ...f5 and ... d7-f6, but without Focal-points 117 exchanging queens and without relinquishing the d8-h4 diagonal to White. Cor- rect, therefore, was 9...Nd7 10 Ne2 Jte71 11 O-O f5 12 Rg3 £}f6, etc.
10 Ne2 2>c6 11 Jth6 f5?
Black should have played 1 l...fie8. At this point ...f5 is weak.
12 Ng5!
By exchanging queens White could have obtained the better endgame pros- pects. However, why should he play for an endgame when he has the opportunity to gain control of the diagonal h4-d8, thereby obtaining the necessary conditions for an attack on the castled king based on a network of weak dark squares?
12...Rb6
The diagonal cannot be defended: if 12 Le7, then 13 Nxe7 Bxe7 14 dxc5 Rxd3 15 Rxe7 while 12...f6 13 ,Nc4+ h8 14 Bh6 is equally unacceptable1.
13 O-O cxd4 14 cxd4 (D)
14...Se8
Some commentators have marked this move out as the decisive mistake and have suggested 14...jS.e6 (preventing Bc4), but this would make the win easier, e.g. 15 ±f6 Sfe8 (or 15. ..h5 16 Rg5 Nh7 17 d5 Nxd5 18 Nxf5) 16 Nf4! Nxd4 (precluding 17 d5; if 16...Bxf4 17 Rxf4, Black will find himself unable to de- fend the focal-point g7, having given up his dark-squared bishop) 17 Nh5 Nc6

Nh7 22 and White decides the game by Bxh5. In this analysis, as in other phases of this game, it should be noted that a method has been used which we have already seen in the variations arising from
1 It is hard to see why this latter line is unacceptable. Black may continue with

dark squares are not especially weak.
118 The Art of Attack in Chess
the diagram on page 109; namely, in creating threats against a dark-square net- work, White repeatedly makes use of sacrifices on squares of the other colour. These sacrifices fulfil the task of breaking up clusters of pawns which otherwise impede the attacker's access to the weak squares on the network itself. The link- age between the operations on the networks of different colours should be noted; on one network the intention is to keep the attacking pieces in the strongest and most permanent positions possible, while on the other they are sacrificed when the situation demands. It should finally be pointed out that, instead of the move played, 14...Qxb2? would have been bad because of 15 fifbl Ra3 16 Sb3 Ra5 17 -Nf6 fie8 18 jlc4, when White's prospects for an attack are greatly improved. 15 -*.c4 h5 (D) There was a threat of 16 Bxf7+ Nxf7 17 Rxh7+ Ne6 18 d5+ ?xd5 19 Sadl+. If 15 e6, then 16 d5 would naturally follow. Focal-points 119
16 Eael?
After this move Black gains drawing chances. In such an attractive position one would expect to find a safe and clear way to victory. White here has all the necessary ingredients for success: control over a dark-square network; advantage in development; two pieces to break up the cluster on the light squares (bishop at c4 and knight at e2); and as well as all this, a pawn in the centre that prevents Black from using his e5 square as a post for his pieces! Stronger and simpler would have been 16 Nf6!, as the following lines show: 1) 16... .e7 17 Rg5 Bxf6 18 Rxg6+.

3) 16...Se4 17 Rg5 Nf8 18 £k3 !, and the black rook has no good square to go to: 18...fixd4 is inadequate because of 19 Efel, while 18...Sg4 is answered by

and mate is unavoidable.
16...Se4 17 Nf4 Rxd4 18 Bxe4 fxe4?
This pawn blocks the fourth rank to White's advantage. Black should have played 18...Rxc4, when 19 Nxg6 Rxh4 20 xh4 leads to an ending in which White is the better placed, but Black can still salvage a draw by 20... jLe6 21 Bd3 (or 21 Ng7! when 22 Bxh5 fails against 22...f6 and 23...Sh8) 21...f4 threat- ening both the a-pawn and 22... g7 followed by 23...f6.

The only reply. If 21...Be6 then 22 Sd5! Rxc4 (or 22... .xd5 23 Rxh5) 23 g5+ Nf8 24 Sxd6 and mates, while 21... jle7 22 Ed5 Bxf6 loses to 23 Rg3+. 22 b4!

This move is refuted by 2O...Rxf2+!! and Black forces mate himself. However, Vukovic's attacking plan is basically correct, except that White has to exercise a little more care: 20 Rh6+ eS 21 Rg7 Nd8 22 Eael and now 22...Rxf2+ 23 Exf2 Exel+ 24 Efl Jlc5+ fails, because after 25 .d4 the bishop is defended.

6 The classic bishop sacrifice1
This sacrifice deserves a chapter to itself, because it is the oldest and most ex- plored of all the sacrifices involved in the attack on the castled king and also be- cause it provides particularly good illustrations of the role of h7 and f7 as mating and secondary focal-points. The earliest instance of the sacrifice of the bishop on h7 followed by £}g5+ oc- curs in Gioacchino Greco's handbook of 1619, but the first systematic review of it was made by E. Vbellmy in his article 'On attacking the castled king' in the Schweizerischen Schachzeitung in 1911. Some writers give it the name of Greco's sacrifice, for which there are some grounds, while others call it Colle's sacrifice, for which there is in fact no justification, as Colle never played a good game which contained the sacrifice in spite of the fact that he often used it. I think the term 'classic bishop sacrifice' more appropriate, since this indicates both its early origins and also the basic simplicity of the idea underlying it. Greco reaches the position below in his handbook after making six not partic- ularly intelligent moves. Now comes the blow: 1 Jtxh7+! Nxh7 2 Ng5+ Ng8 (if 2...Bxg5, then 3 hxg5+ Ng6 4 Rh5+ Nf5 5 Rh3+ g6 6 Rh7#; 2... <Nh6 3 xe6+ costs Black his queen; thirdly, after 2...<Ng6 3 h5+ there is a choice between 3...Nh6 4
1 More commonly called the Greek Gift sacrifice, although the reason for apply-

1 Nxh7+ Nxh7 2 g5+
Here, as in other examples of the classic bishop sacrifice, there are three main variations arising from the sacrifice, i.e. those beginning with ...Ng8, ...Nh6, and These three variations must be carefully examined on every occa- sion, for if any one of them contains a loophole, the whole combination falls to the ground. 1) variation with ... g8
2.. .6g8 3 Rh5 Se8 4 Rxf7+ Nh8 5 Rh5+ #g8 6 Rh7+ Nf8 7 Rh8+ Ne7 8
Rxg7#. This variation contains, as its main feature, a typical example of an attack us- ing h7 and f7 as secondary focal-points with the queen finally mating on g7, a common enough pattern after this sacrifice. 2) variation with ...Nh6
2... h6 3 xe6+ and 4 Nxd8, etc.
This naturally succeeds because Black's queen is on d8, but even with the queen on a5 the move 2...Nh6 would have no prospects. In that case White would win by, e.g. 3 Rg4 Sh8 (otherwise Rh4+ and Rh7#) 4 Nxe6+ and 5 Qxg7#. 3) variation with ... g6
2...6g6 3 h4
This is the strongest move here; in other cases ... gb may be best met by g4. Black's reply is forced. The classic bishop sacrifice 123

Rxh5 and White wins. One could now produce a series of examples, pursuing different variations ac- cording to the various elements in each position, but it is more to the point at once to pose the question as to how to judge the correctness of the sacrifice, first with reference to White's position and then to Black's. Necessary conditions for the classic bishop sacrifice White must firstly have a queen, a bishop and a knight. The light-squared bishop must be able to reach h7 in order to force the tempo of the attack, though it is not essential that it should put Black in check or take a pawn in so doing. The knight should be within easy and safe reach of the square g5, and the queen within reach of h5, though in some cases it is enough for it to be able to get to some other square on the h-file. As far as Black 's position is concerned, there should be two pawns standing intact at f7 and g7 (g7 may on rare occasions be occupied by a bishop instead of a pawn); the h-pawn should be on h7 (on h5 in exceptional cases), but it may be that there is no h-pawn at all. The position of Black's queen on d8 and a rook on f8 points to, but does not absolutely guarantee, the correctness of the sacrifice. What is more important is that Black's knight should not be able to reach f6 and that neither his queen nor bishop should be able to occupy the h7-bl diagonal un- harmed. These are the basic conditions which need to be taken into account. In the ex- amples which follow we shall examine to what extent each of these conditions is fulfilled; the positions are chosen in such a way as to show which is the critical continuation in each example, i.e. the one that is in doubt because a certain condi- tion is apparently unfulfilled. The variation with ...<Ng8 is critical In the following position the sacrifice is correct: 1 ,Nxh7+ Nxh7 2 Ng5+ Ng8 The continuation 2...Nh6 obviously fails; while if 2...Ng6, then 3 Rd3+ f6 (3...f5 4 Rg3! wins, for Black cannot play 4...Nf6 because of 5 Sxe6#) 4 Re4 threatens both 5 Nh7+ and 5 Nxe6, and 4... ?e7 does not work because of 5 Rxe6+ fxe6 6 Sxe6#.
3 Rh5 f6
An example of the defence of the focal-point h7 by the knight, but in this case

White's position is strong enough (thanks to the activity of his bishop on f4 and rook on el) to withstand the loss of time.

If 5...'Nf8, then 6 Rh8+ and 7 Rxg7 is decisive. 6 fie3 Bd8 7 Hh3 and White mates. In the position in the next diagram an important condition regarding the ...Ng8 variation has apparently not been fulfilled, since the diagonal from c8 to f5 is open to Black's bishop. However, White has the possibility of Re4+ as well as other active factors in his favour, and therefore the sacrifice still succeeds.

3...f5 4 1 114 Sf7 5 UftiS+l 1 Nxh8 6 Nxf7+ Ng8 7 <Nxd8 and White wins.
Here the boxed-in position of Black's rook and the possibility of Re4+ fol- lowed by Rh4 fully compensate for the absence of one of the basic conditions. In this position Black has an extra tempo in which to defend himself after ...Ng8 because his rook is already on e8, but White's position is so strong in other respects that his sacrifice still leads to a successful breakthrough.
1 Nxh7+ Nxh7 2 Ng5+ <3?g8 3 Rh5 £rf8
A difficulty for Black is that he cannot defend the f7-square; if, for example,
3...Re7, then 4 Rh7+and5 Rh8# while if 3...f6, then4 Rf7+ < r'h8 5 Se3, etc.
4 Rxf7+ 'i'hS 5 fie3 and White wins.
These three examples represent only a small section of a large number of pos- sible cases in which the crucial continuation is ... g8. How large the variety of these positions is and how sensitive they are to minute changes can be illustrated by the following observation: if, in any of the previous three diagrams, White's h-pawn is moved to h4, the bishop sacrifice is no longer correct. In the first two diagrams (on page 124) this is because the queen is prevented from getting to h4, while in the diagram above it is because White's rook can no longer create threats along the h-file. Having the pawn on h4 rather than h2 is an obstacle in the varia- tion with ...Ng8; on the other hand, we shall see how it assists White in the varia- tion with ,.. g6. 1 5 e6 is even stronger, when 5...Rxg5 is forced to avoid mate.

The variation with ... g6 is critical Here the critical continuation is ... gb, while that with ...Ng8 involves less diffi- culty.

5...Sh8 6 xe6+ *f7 7 xg7+ <Nxe6 8 Rf6+ <Nd7 9 Rd6#.
This is a characteristic outcome of the continuation ... g6; with the king on g6, the pawn on h4 is an assistance to White, as it usually is when Black adopts this defence. In the next case White has no pawn on e5, but the presence of his rook on the open e-file ensures success against ...Ng8. In the variation with ...Ng6 White is made to work for victory.

This position differs fundamentally from those considered so far and touches on some new aspects of the sacrificial combination.
1 Bxh7+ Nxh7 2 Ng5+ <±>g6
If 2...Nh6, both 3 Nxf7+ and 3 Rg4 4 Nce4 lead to victory. Instead of the dark-squared bishop White has the knight on c3 as an active supporting piece, which proves its value in numerous variations. Consider, for example, 2...( )g8 3 h5 Rd3, where the fact that White has the move 4 ce4 is decisive.

The variation with ...< h6 is critical This continuation is usually difficult for the attacker if he does not have a second bishop and has his h-pawn at h4, and is consequently without the possibility of g4 and h4+. The classic bishop sacrifice 129 Here is an example: 1 i.xh7+ <Nxh7 2 Ng5+ Nh6 Against either of the other continuations White wins easily, but against the text move he has to work hard; victory cannot be forced here, though he has a promising attack. 3f4! This is probably White's strongest move. After 3 Rd2 Re7! White can re- establish material equality by 4 £jxe6+ and 5 Nxf8, but Black is then the better placed.
3...Ne7 4 h5 g6 5 hxg6 Nxg6 6 Rg4 *g7 7 f5! exf5 8 fixfS
White's threats include 9 Hxf7+ and 9 e6, as well as 9 Rh5, so he should win. If 8.. Bc8, then 9 Rh5 is decisive. Declining the sacrifice One of the necessary conditions for the success of the classic bishop sacrifice, as of any sacrifice at all, is the opponent's inability to obtain an advantage by reject- ing the sacrifice altogether. The attacker must therefore consider what will hap- pen if his opponent plays ...Nh8 and does not take the bishop. The following diagram shows an example of this.
1 Bxh7+?
Instead of trying to sacrifice his bishop (which is incorrect in this position, since Black can successfully decline it) White should have played 1 Be2 with the intention of making use of his pair of bishops and centralizing his knight by l... h8! 2 Ng5
130 The Art of Attack in Chess
The bishop has nowhere to retreat to, while if 2 Re2, then 2... ,xf3 3 Rxf3 < 'xh7, i.e. Black accepts the sacrifice as soon as he has eliminated White's knight, for without that White's attack is worth nothing.
2...Wxdl 3 flfxdl g6!
White now has no satisfactory defence against the threat of ...Ng7 and ...Hh8, and this gives Black the better prospects. A practical criterion for the sacrifice We shall now attempt to establish a practical rule for positions of the type given on pages 122-129, a means by which players can orientate themselves quickly and fairly accurately. Positions similar to that on page 121, i.e. with a rook on hl and pawn on h4, will be left aside for the time being and will be dealt with in chapter 7. It should also be remarked that in the positions on pages 122-129 the basic condition that the defender should not be able to reject the sacrifice un- scathed was fulfilled. It should further be added that the arrangement of Black's pieces in those positions did not depart greatly from the normal, while White, in addition to the essential light-squared bishop, the queen, and the knight on f3, had at his disposal a number of other supporting pieces to sustain his attack. Listed in categories, these were: Pawn at e5 and bishop at cl on pages 122, 124 (bottom) and 125; Pawn at e5 and bishop at f4 on page 126; Pawn at e5 and knight at d2 on page 127 (bottom); Pawn at e5 and knight at c3 on page 128; Pawns at e5 and h4 on page 129; Rook at el and bishop at f4 on page 124 (top); and Rook at el and bishop at cl on page 127 (top). The classic bishop sacrifice 131 As can be seen, the principal supporting pieces are the pawn at e5 and the bishop on the diagonal cl-f4, followed by the knight on d2 or c3 and the rook on the open e-file. There may be a few other such supporting pieces (e.g. a rook on fl, if the f-file is open) which have not been provided with examples, but the reader will already have seen the basic idea - as a rule at least two active support- ing pieces are necessary, if the classic bishop sacrifice is to bring the attacker success. This is a simple practical criterion and should help the player to get his ap- proximate bearings. To make this survey of the sacrifice and the structure of its necessary conditions as clear as possible, White has been made the attacker in all the examples; if Black carries out a sacrificial attack on h2, naturally all that has been said applies analogously. To provide further material on the classic bishop sacrifice three master games will now be examined. The first belongs to the post-war era and provides an ex- ample where the sacrifice is quite correct. In the second the young Capablanca sacrifices on h7, but the analysis shows the existence of a loophole in the varia- tion with ... g6 which his opponent failed to notice. In the third, Colle sacrifices and wins both the game and the Brilliancy Prize, even though in fact two of the variations are unsound!

132 The Art of Attack in Chess
16 Bxh7+!
Here is an example of the classic bishop sacrifice on h7 in a position which differs from those examined hitherto. First of all, a bishop, and not a pawn, is on g7, while Black's queen is on b6 and not on d8. Let us now look at the conditions for success in each of the variations. Clearly, ... h8 does not come into consider- ation at all, nor does moving the king to h6, but the variation with ... gS gives rise to a few doubts, since the bishop's presence on g7 prevents the well-known harrying of the king by Rh8+. We shall see later on how really critical this varia- tion is and that White's success hangs on a thread. The ...Ng6 variation presents an even harder prospect, for White has only one of the supporting pieces men- tioned above (bishop at cl) at his disposal and still needs an extra tempo to make up the necessary pair with Sei. Furthermore, Black's queen is not imperilled on b6 by the battery of queen on g4 and knight on g5, as is the case when it is on d8; moreover, Black's considerable strength in the centre and on the queenside opens up the possibility of defending by returning the material and exploiting the posi- tional compensation obtained for it. According to our scheme, then, the continu- ation ...<Ng6 represents a danger to White, and we should have to doubt the success of the attack if it were not for one more factor which helps White: the fact that a bishop, and not a pawn, stands at g7 means that an attack on that square en- tails the loss of a piece and not of a pawn. While the bishop on g7 helps Black in the ... g8 variation, with ... g6 it acts as a drawback which compensates for the deficiencies in White's position already referred to. These points will be best il- luminated by further analysis.

Let us now consider the alternative continuation, 17. After 18 Rh5 Sd8 19 xf7+ Nh8 all the commentators (including the author in his Modern Open- ing Theory) have given a win for White by 20 f4 Rb7 21 5f3?. However, there is The classic bishop sacrifice 133 a flaw in this, in that Black can embark upon 21... xf7 22 £}xf7+ gS 23 £}xd8, obtaining excellent compensation for the exchange, e.g. 23... .d7 24 b4 Na4 25 4}b7 .c6 26 £k5 (or 26 Na5) 26...Bxf3 27 gxf3 d3 28 Sbl £te3 and Black wins the cl-bishop at the very least. This scotches the idea of 21 2f3?; a better move therefore, is 21 Rg6, though after 21...Ng8 22 Sf3 Re7 23 Sh3 24 fih8+!)

18 Rg4 f5 19 Rg3 (D)
A critical stage of the game. It is now evident that the position of his bishop at g7 is an embarrassment to Black, since there is an immediate threat of <2}xe6+ with a double attack on g7 and f8.
134 The Art of Attack in Chess
In the actual game Black played 19... f6, but that move, like 19...Bf6, does not cause White as much difficulty as 19...Sf7!, as the following variations show: 1) 19..Bf6 20 £jxe6+ sfcf7 21 xf8 xf8 22 Rg6 £te4!

27 Rh7+ Ne6 2 28 Rg8+ Ne5 29 Re8+ Nd4 30 Rc6, with advantage to White.
2) 19...2f7! (this move was suggested by Kovaliev, who considered that it saved Black's game, but his analysis did not take into account the important in- termediate move 20 b4!) 20 b4! and now: 2a) 20...Nd7 21 £}xe6+ h7 (or 21...Nf6 22 £"c7! and White wins) 22 Sei f6 23 Ng5+ Ng8 24 Nxf7 Nxf7 25 Se7+ <Nxe7 26 Rxg7+ Ne6 27 Ng5 and White's attack cannot be withstood. 2b) 20... a4 21 h4! e5 22 h5+ *f6 23 Sei Se7 24 i.f4 exf4 25 Nh7+ t'7

of his h-pawn must be decisive. This analysis does not exhaust the position en- tirely but it does illustrate White's excellent chances.
19...Nf6 20 i.f4! (D)
Keres had already analysed 16 Bxh7+ and its consequences before this game took place. At this point he gave the continuation 20 Rh4? on which Black plays

After 28 JiLf8+ e6 29 Rg8+ sS?e5 White is deprived of the check on e8 and so the position remains unclear. The classic bishop sacrifice 135 2O...Sh8 and White gets no more than perpetual check. Kotov knew of this anal- ysis, which explains why he went in for 15...Nc5?. Now Kottnauer shows that White has a stronger move than 20 Rh4? and in doing so demonstrates that not even the analysis of great masters is always reliable.

Black is correct to choose the ...<4'g6 variation and the reader - armed with the guidance given a few pages back - will notice that White's chances of success in this case are dubious, since he does not have the two necessary supporting pieces, but only one, and a fairly weak one at that (the knight on c3).
14 Rg4 f5
As a lover of fine combinations from his earliest youth, Capablanca here quotes the following continuation: 14...e5? 15 ?f6 16 f4! e4 (or 16...Nc6 17 g5+ Nxe6 18 f5+ Nd7 19 Sfdl+ Nd4 20 Rxg7 when White will get one piece back and have three pawns for his knight plus a winning attack against Black's exposed king) 17 Rg5+ 18 Re5+ <4>d7 19 Sfdl+ 4hd3 20 £}xe4 'i'cb 21 Sxd3 Rxd3 22 Scl+ and mate in a few moves.
15 Rg3 < h6?
This game has entered the anthologies as one of Capablanca's famous feats because commentators have passed this obviously incorrect move by in silence. By 15...sS?f6! Black could have shown that the bishop sacrifice was unsound. White can then still exert some pressure (after 16 Sadi jkd7 or 16 b4 Na6), but he has not got the time to strengthen his attack decisively, since Black threatens to consolidate his position (e.g. 16 e4 g6 or 16 f4 Sh8). White must therefore take the exchange by 16 £}h7+ with the result that his attack comes to a halt, leaving him without sufficient compensation for Black's material advantage . In addition to 15...Sfelf6!, another move which is better than the one played is
15...f4, which would force White to play for a draw, i.e. 16 exf4 f5 17 Rg4

This game, here given a proper critical commentary for the first time, provides yet another blow against the legend of 'the infallible Cuban'. Another interesting point is that Capablanca often undertook attacks against the castled king in his earlier years, but extremely rarely as he became older. This was to a certain extent the result of the progressively greater ability of his
1 The strongest defence is 23...Nd8!, which prevents 24 Nb5 owing to 24...€Be2+.
In this case White would have a draw at best. The classic bishop sacrifice 139 opponents and a general rise in standards, but it was perhaps even more because of a gradual waning of enthusiasm under the weight of increasing self-criticism. Unlike Capablanca, Alekhine played in his own style from his youth right till the end, accepting the risk of difficult attacks against the castled king even against strong opponents.

7 Ranks, files and diagonals in
the attack on the castled king An action in the vicinity of the castled king can be carried out by any of the pieces, but the long-range ones, the queen, rook, and bishop, are the most effec- tive. They can attack from a distance along the ranks, files, and diagonals. The line concerned has to be 'captured,' i.e. one's own long-range piece has to be placed on it, confrontation by the opponent's corresponding piece has to be over- come, and the line has to be 'cleared' of all enemy influence. Outposts lie on such lines; batteries and pins take place along them. In a mating attack the line may fi- nally witness the execution, i.e. checkmate. In this chapter we shall consider in turn the part played in the attack on the castled king by the ranks, files, and diago- nals and reveal some typical operations involving them. The weakness of the back rank Of operations on the ranks, the first class to be considered is that aimed at a weakness on the back rank. A few practical examples will help. This position is from Bemstein-Capablanca, Exhibition Game, Moscow 1914. It is White's move, and he ought to have realized that because of his weakness on the back rank Black's pawn on c3 was 'taboo' . He should therefore have played 1 <Nd4, but he decided not to, and the result was a disaster on his back rank. Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 143

But not 3... bl+V 4 Wfl, in which case 4...fidl is impossible because of Black's weakness on his own back rank. However, the move 3...1iifb2, typical of Capablanca, solves the problem completely: White resigned, for he is unable to take the queen and his own rook and queen are threatened; if 4 Rd3 or 4 fid3, then 4...Wal+ wins. This position is from Mikenas-Maroczy, Folkestone 1933. White, to move, advanced his e-pawn to exploit Black's weakness on the back rank.

In this position, which occurred in the game Najdorf-Julio Bolbochan, Mar del Plata 1948, White exploited Black's back-row weakness by an operation in which his passed pawn played a typically prominent part. 1 2xd8! Sxd8

3 d7 Sfl+ 4 Wgl! 1-0
Since after 4...Stxgl+ 5 't'xgl Black cannot halt the d-pawn. This position is from the game Alekhine-E. Cohn, Stockholm 1912. White, to move, must try to retain his extra pawn. A 'realistic' tournament player would quietly play 1 Hfel c5 24klf3 and Bf2...jLxc2, then3Scl,orif2...f6, then3exf6 Sxel+ 4 £}xel, etc. However, this seemed too limp a solution to the young Alekhine, who wanted to keep Black's knight in its corner at h6 a little longer; in a typically 'incisive' way he defended the pawn on e5 indirectly, or rather 'sold it for the back rank' , and this is in fact as good a method as that given above.

He could have put up more resistance by 2...Sf6, for 3 Nf5 does not achieve much because of 3...Nf8. Correct would be 3 £}gf3!, against which Black must play 3...Se8, but not 3...Sxc5? on account of 4 £}f5 !, when White wins the ex- change at the very least1. 3 de6? This only leads to a small material advantage, whereas he could have won con- vincingly by 3 £}b5!2, which is equally effective in stopping Black's rook from returning to the back rank (with the help of Nxc7) but at the same time does not Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 145 leave the knight en prise at e6. This point is demonstrated by the following varia- tions: 1) 3...Nh8 4 Ed8+ Ng8 5 Nxf7+ $Lxf7 6 Exf7, and Black loses his knight while White's on b5 remains intact. 2) 3...f6 4 Nxc7 Exa2 5 Sd8+ Be8 6 Nxe8 Nf8 7 Nxc7+ e7 8 Se8#.
3...Nh8

4 Ed8+ <Ng8 (D)
5 xc7 White cannot play 5 Sxf7 because of 5...Eaxe6, while if 5 <£jxf7+ Bxf7 6 Sxf7 fiaxe6 7 fiff8 White merely regains the piece he has lost - that is the differ- ence between the knight's position on b5 and e6. Even more instructive is the fact that 5 Sfdl? will not work because of 5...Saxe6! 6 Nxe6 fxe6, and there is no mate (by Exg8+ and Ed8+) since Black has freed the square f7.
1 An interesting moment. After 2...Ef6 3 Ngf3 He8, as Vukovic gives, it is hard
to see what White has gained in return for surrendering his extra pawn. Of course, White retains a positional advantage, but this is far from conclusive. Cu- riously, in the English edition of his best games collection, Alekhine does not mention 2...Ef6, but in his Deux Cents Parties d'Echecs he gives "On 2...Ef6, White wins by 3 Nf5 !, etc.". Probably both 3 Ngf3 and 3 f5 are wrong; the strongest line is 3 £k:6 ! He8 (3...flxfl+ 4 < ?xfl Ee8 5 Ed7 is also very bad) 4 £}e7+ 5 Efel !, threatening 6 Nxg6+, and Black's position is hopeless (5...i.f5 6 g4 or 5...±c2 6 Ed2).

by Alekhine.

One might now say 'and White won after another twenty moves', for this posi- tion no longer has anything to do with the difficulties on the back rank, but it is worth remarking that the task is a difficult one, so difficult indeed that Alekhine went astray and after 14...£al+ 15 4*12 4d5 16 4f3 a5 played 17 4e2? (17 £k?d2 was correct). This was answered by 17...a4! (not 17...4xe4? on account of 18 c6!), after which White, objectively speaking, should not have got more than a draw. Alekhine, however, did not submit to 18 £jc3+ <4x05 19 < xa4+ 4d4 but went on to risk 18 £ted2? a3 19 b4 Sell and so reached a losing position. Play continued 20 4d3 a2 21 Nb3 Sdl+ 22 4>c2 alV 23 xal Sxal 24 Nc3+, at which stage Black could have won by 24,..<4c4! 25 c6 Sa7 ! 26 b5 Sc7. Instead, he spoilt his position by playing 24...'4c6? The finish ran: 25 4>d3 Sfl 26 g3! h5 27 4>c4 h4 28 b5+ <4d7 29 gxh4 Sf4+ 30 4>d5 Sxh4 31 c6+ Nc7 32 <4c5! 2xh3 33 b6+ <4b8 34 <Nb5 1-0 Combinations based on the weakness of the back rank are usually of short du- ration and matters come quickly to a head. This has been shown by the examples given above, and others, equally short-lived, could easily be added to them. How- ever, just as success may come quickly, so too failure can suddenly occur as a result of a lightning counter-stroke which removes the weakness from the oppo- nent's back rank. As an example of such a turning-point let us examine the next position. Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 147 Flohr, when he was White in this position from a simultaneous display played in Leningrad during 1933, continued: 1 fixe 5 and left his opponent to think it over.
1...W12+
Both Flohr and the commentators thought that Black, in making this move, had fallen into a trap, but in fact he has nothing better. For example, if l...Be6, then 2 Wei Sae8 (or 2.. Bf5 3 Ee7) 3 Bb5 Bd7 4 h6! (not 4 Sf3 because of

2 Nh2 Wxfl?!
This is a comparative mistake only, since Black's game is now lost in any case.
2...Rf4 would have offered more resistance.
3 Rxd5+ < h8
If 3...Rf7, White wins by 4 Se7!. 4Ef3? This was intended to be the decisive stroke, but in fact it is a mistake. White would easily have won by 4 h6, and if 4...g6, then 5 Ef 3; alternatively, if 4...gxh6 then 5 Ee8, after which mate is unavoidable. This variation shows the correct way to exploit the weakness on the back rank, while 4 Ef3? was inadequate as Black had the reply 4.. Be6!, when by returning the extra piece he could have got rid of the weakness on his back rank with tempo and reached a drawn position. As it was, however, he played 4...Exf3?, and everything was immediately put

148 The Art of Attack in Chess
right: White replied 5 Rxf3, and Black with good reason resigned (1-0). This example shows what vigilant care needs to be taken with combinations aimed at a weakness on the back rank. In connection with this back-row weakness, something should also be said about the so-called 'escape hole', i.e. the gap made by moving a pawn with the sole purpose of eliminating the danger of mate on the back rank or at least of freeing the rook guarding the rank. On the other hand, such a move, like any pawn move in front of the castled king, represents a weakening of the position, and it is a question here of correctly assessing whether the advantages involved outweigh the weaknesses or vice versa. This is one of the numerous double- edged features of chess. As an example of the sensitivity of the connection between the weakness of the back rank and that of the 'escape hole' the above position is instructive. It is Black's move, and if it were not for his weakness on the back rank, the problem would be an extremely straightforward one: White's pawns on the queenside would fall one by one. Thus it is a question of first averting the danger on the back rank and only then making the time to 'pick off' the pawns. Let us create an 'escape hole' for the king. I...h6? A mistake? Yes, and a bad one, for Black is now faced with a new weakness on g6. The other 'hole', l...g6, is no good either, since White can get an easy draw by 2 £}g4 (with the threat of €Bf6 and mate on h7) 2...Sf8 (or 2...Bf8 3 h6) 3 h6 Sf5 (the only move; for if 3...b5, 4 Sd5 is a strong reply, while 3... g8? is not good on account of 4 2g7+ and 5 £}e5) 4 Sd8+ Sf8 (4...Bf8? 5 £te3 and 6

and Black must lose. As we have seen, the 'escape holes' did not work; in this position they repre- sent too great a weakness, so the only correct continuation is 1... g8!, which re- moves the danger on the back rank without weakening the pawn position. What is more, Black must also avoid moving his pawns if White continues with his sharpest reply, 2 h6 ! (since if 2...gxh6, White can draw by 3 £}g4). He should in- stead play the solid 2...Bf8, after which he can reap his pawn harvest with ...Exa2, etc. Another typical variation is 2 Ng4 (instead of 2 h6) 2...Exa2 3 Ne5 Exb2 4 Ed8+ Bf8 5 #ki7 Exc2+ 6 f3 Nf7. Now one can appreciate the signifi- cance of White's lack of an outpost for his knight - he wins the bishop by 7 Nxf8 but Black, with 7...b3, wins the game1. The sensitivity of 'escape holes' of this kind can best be seen if White's pawn on h5 is moved to h4. Then, as well as l.-.'&gS, Black may also play l...h6, a fact of which the reader may convince himself by his own analysis. The weakness of the second rank The second rank, on which the pawns stand at the start of the game, is generally as weak as the back rank; the pawns stand on it but do not protect it. There is, however, a difference, in that the second rank is harder to 'clear' prior to its being used by a rook or queen because the pawns tend to get in the way, just as trees in a forest tend to obstruct a clear view. Consequently, weaknesses on the second rank most frequently appear on individual squares or focal-points, and it is rarer to find a general weakness affecting the whole rank. The latter phenomenon, This is all rather confusing. After what Vukovic considers to be Black's best continuation, l.-. gS 2 Ng4 Exa2, White can play 3 h6 forcing 3...Bf8 (or else perpetual check), but after l...Bf8 2 Ng4 Exa2, which Vukovic condemns on account of 3 h6, Black can reach exactly the same position by playing 3... ?g8!. The truth of the matter is that l... ?g8 and l... .f8 work equally well, because neither weakens the kingside pawn structure.
150 The Art of Attack in Chess
which concerns us here, is generally described as 'a rook on the seventh rank', but it would be more accurate to speak of a strongly-placed queen or rook on the opponent's second rank. This kind of situation is on the whole exploited for positional purposes (to put pressure on the pawns and capture them or else to prevent the opponent from moving his king into the centre), but the position of a queen or rook on the sev- enth rank can also be useful in an attack on the castled king, where a 'clearing up' operation is often of decisive importance. A weakness on the second rank often goes hand in hand with a weakness on the back rank. The following combination of Rubinstein's makes effective use of both ranks . This position occurred in the game Rubinstein-Maroczy, Gothenburg 1920. White's first act was to advance his pawn to h6 and so create the necessary condi- tions for an attack on the seventh rank.
1 h5 f8 2 h6!
White now threatens 3 Bh4, which would also be decisive in the event of
2...gxh6.
2.. .£"g6 3 Re6!
Now White takes advantage of the weakness of the back rank to penetrate with his queen; 3...2xe6 is met by 4 Sd8+, while if 3,..Hce7, then 4 hxg7+.
3...5.8 4 Sd7
The position is ripe for the rooks to take possession of the seventh rank. Black is now forced to play 4...gxh6, after which the 'clearing' of the rank is complete.
4...gxh6 5 ±h4! 1-0
The threat of .xf6+ compels 5...<Nxh4, but then White achieves total domina- tion of the seventh rank (by 6 Re7 followed by mate on h7). Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 151 The reader should note the methodical character of this combination and espe- cially the part played by the 'clearing-up' operation. In this position from the game Nimzowitsch-Capablanca, New York 1927, Black's rook is already on the seventh rank, but its bite is not yet fully felt be- cause of the pawn in the way at f2. To obtain complete control over the rank, Black sacrifices a pawn, which enables him to double rooks. I...e5! 2 i.xe5 Zdd2 3 Rb7 (D) If 3 Wfl, Black's strongest line is 3...Rd5 4 Jlf4 (or 4 Bd4) 4...Rf3 5 Rg2 Rxg2+ 6 xg2 Zxf2+ 7 Nh3 (or7 gl 2g2+8 hl Hxh2+ 9 igl f6)7...h5! 8 Shi jLe7 9 Bad g5 and White loses his bishop owing to the threat of ...g4#. If 3 Zfl, then 3...Rxe3! is decisive (4 Bf4 Hxf2), since White cannot take the queen for fear of being mated by the rooks. These two alternatives are instructive illustrations of the use of rooks on the seventh rank.

3.. .5xf2 4 g 4 Re6 5 Ng3 Sxh2! 6 Rf3

6.. JXg2+ 7 Rxg2 Hxg2+ 8 <Nxg2 Rxg4 and Black won as a result of his mate-
rial superiority. The last example in this group is meant to take the reader away from the usual pattern. In this position from the game Flohr-Stoltz, Warsaw 1935, White has some pressure on the seventh rank but lacks reinforcements. Thus after 1 Bc4 f8 2 Ba6 Black has the reply 2...Jtb8! , and the position resolves itself into an ending with bishops of opposite colours. This is not enough for White, and he sees that a successful invasion is possible on the sixth, rather than the seventh, rank. Otherwise Black cannot stop the mating attack starting with Rxg6+. If
2...Rg8, then 3 Rd7+ mates, while 2...Jtb6 is weaker than the text move on ac-
count of 3 Rxb6 Rxb6 4 cxb6 Sb8 5 Sxa5 and White goes on to win Black's e- pawn.

The role of the files in the attack on the castled king Of all the long-range actions, the most important in attacking the castled king is the vertical one on the open file. It is important because it is easier to 'clear' a file Although 2 Rb7, and only then 3 £ft a6, wins a piece for nothing. Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 153 than a rank, and it is useful because being placed on an open file is 'the best way for a rook to be employed'. There are four ways of establishing a rook (or queen) on an open (or half- open) file: 1 ) the file is already open from one end to the other or to an opposing piece and all that is needed is for the rook to be brought on to it. 2) the rook is posted in front of one of its own pawns (e.g. the king's rook is manoeuvred via el and e3 to h3 in front of the pawn on h2). 3) the pawn in front of the rook advances and is sacrificed to open up the file. 4) the pawn in front of the rook leaves the file by making a capture. The further operations of the rooks on the file are similar to those which take place when control is assumed of any line (constructing outposts, clearing, cap- turing pieces, squares, and focal-points, etc.). As a first general example of the part played by the files in an attack on the cas- tled king, let us examine a famous game of Rubinstein's.

Modem theory does not rate this move very highly. White obtains a sound and useful position by exchanging on d5. The normal and objectively best course for White here is to prepare a so-called minority attack, e.g. after castling kingside and playing Habl he advances his pawns to b4 and a4, continuing with b5 and bxc6 in order to weaken Black's pawn formation. Another way is to play on Black's weaknesses at c5 and b6 after exchanging the dark-squared bishops. Johner, a player with an incisive style, does not fancy these positional schemes and chooses a third way: castling on the opposite side and making an attack on the castled king, which is not a bad plan, but allows Black equal chances.
9..Bxf6 10 Rc2
After eliminating Black's knight at f6, White induces a weakening of Black's castled position.
10...h6 11 O-O-O
First 11 h3 would have been better, and only then O-O-O, with the further plan of Sdgl, g4, h4 etc. The text move permits Black to divert White's g-pawn from
154 The Art of Attack in Chess
its file by playing ,.. .g4 and ...Bxf3, after which the danger of the thrust g5 is averted.
12 h3 jLxf3 13 gxf3 (D)
Admittedly, White now has an open g-file, but Black is not weak on this file, since the g7-square is excellently covered. Here the g-file is of less value than the possibility of g4-g5, which White enjoyed before the exchange on f3. If Black's pieces had been differently arranged, the opening of the g-file might have been a good thing, but as it is Black's weakness is at h6, not g7; the result is that the opening of the file has considerably blunted White's potential attack on the kingside. This instructive point should be remembered, since similar positions often occur in practice.
13...a5?
The great Akiba is dozing at this point, and is not far from falling into an infe- rior position. The move 13...a5? did not appeal to Griinfeld or Becker, the consci- entious authors of the tournament book, though they missed the essential point of the situation and recommended 13...£ki7, which is equally weak. The position can be briefly summed up as follows: gxf3 has undoubtedly blunted the direct attack on the castled king, but it has given an added sharpness to the central position, where White threatens e4-e5 (naturally, after strengthen- ing d4 by means of £}e2 and perhaps ,Nf5). If White manages to play e5, a turn- ing-point in the situation is reached and White, on the basis of his power in the centre and his expulsion of the bishop from f6, obtains a strong attack, in which the open g-file also comes in very useful. Turning-points of this kind can be very instructive. There still remains the question what Black ought to have played in order to prevent or hinder White's central advance. The answer is given by the following Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 155 analysis: 13...b6! 14 £jc2 Sa7 15 ?bl (after 15 e4 dxe4 White could not con- tinue with 16 fxe4 because of 16...Bxd4 while after 16 Bxe4 White would not be able to drive the enemy bishop away from f6; note also that since there was a threat of 15...c5, there is no time for further preparations, e.g. by 15 Bf5)
15...Hc7 16 jLf'5 c5! and Black has the better prospects; on 17 dxc5 he naturally
plays 17...bxc5, while if 17 Rd2, he makes the consistent reply 17...£}c6!, with- out having anything to fear from 18 dxc5 bxc5 19 Rxd5?, since by 19...Rb8 he can build up a powerful attack against White's king position. The essence of this analysis lies in Black opening up files by ...b6 and ...c5. We shall see how Black returns to this motif later on in the game and by opening up these files finally set- tles the issue. 14&bl More precise would be 14 £te2 immediately, but even against the move played it is too late for Black to play ...b6, etc., because he has lost a tempo by playing

If White attempts to prepare e4 by 18 2d3, etc., Black has ...Sad8 to exert suf- ficient pressure on White's pawn at d4. For this reason White decides on an at- tack against the castled king with pieces alone, unaided by an aggressive central pawn formation, and as a result his prospects of success are not so great.

156 The Art of Attack in Chess
After a series of necessary defensive moves Black has begun preparing ...b6 and ...c5, and White realizes that he cannot endanger Black's position by opera- tions with his pieces down the flank without the support of his central pawns. Thus if 22 Nh5 b6 23 Rf5, which the commentators in the tournament book rec- ommended, Black simply plays 23...Re7 and finally carries out his threat with
24...c5. Thus White was correct to decide to centralize his knight on e5.
22...b6 23 f4 c5! (D)
Black gives up a pawn with the aim of opening up the b- and c-files and so pro- moting an attack on the castled king. The sacrifice is absolutely correct; White should have declined the poisonous gift and instead of 24 dxc5? played 24 £te5 !, in which case the position would have been approximately level. The official commentators showed that against the continuation 24...c4 White then has 25 Ra4 with the idea of playing 26 1ifb5; against this 25... b5 26 Rxb5 Eb6 (or
26...fib8) is of no avail because White thwarts all Black's designs with 27
£}xf7+. After 24 Be5 it would perhaps be best for Black to play 24...Sb8! 25 b3 Sc8, in which case White would have to defend himself with 26 Scl. At this point 26 b5 is no good because of 26...cxd4, while in the event of an attack by 26 Rc2 g8 27 Rf5 Black has an interesting counterattack based on a 'heavy barrage' along the c-file: 27...cxd4! 28 Nxf7!?

26...Bc8!
Black has two files on which to attack and he decides on the c-file, since then things move even more quickly than after 26...Eb8. Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 157

In this game and its notes we can see the various degrees of significance which open files can have. Firstly, there was White's open g-file, which was shown to be ineffective without support from another quarter; nevertheless, the notes pointed out its value as soon as White's pawn was advanced to e5. Then followed Black's manoeuvres to open up the b- and c-files, described firstly in the commentary and later actually put into practice at a critical stage of the game. Once the c-file had been opened by means of a sacrifice, the formidable power of the rooks on the file eventually brought the attacker victory. The attack along the h-file Using a rook to control an open h-file is one of the classic methods of attack after castling kingside, and so a number of examples will be devoted to it. Firstly, we have an instance of a rook exercising control from h3, in front of the h2-pawn.
158 The Art of Attack in Chess
This diagram comes from Rodl-Samisch, Swinemiinde 1931. White plays:
1 Jtxh7+
A sacrifice of the bishop which might be termed 'semi-classic', this draws the king out to h7 so that the rook can get to h3 with gain of tempo; at the same time defence by ...h6 is excluded. It could also be put like this: the temporal factor here requires that the operation of 'clearing' h7 be carried out before posting the rook on the h-file.

White removes the bishop from f6 to allow his queen to move immediately to h4.

Next we have an example of a complex sacrificial combination based on an explosive opening of the h-file. White (P. Schmidt) mated Black (K. Richter) in spectacular style:

Drawing the king into the fire of the battery of rook and h-pawn. If 1 hxg6, Black would relieve his position by exchanging queens.

9Sxf7# This is also an instructive example with reference to weaving the mating net: White is the master of the h-file, but he still needs to deprive the black king of squares on the g-file. The most difficult to deal with is g5, but White solves that problem with his third and fourth moves. This example, from the game Toth-Szigeti, Budapest 1946, shows us an exe- cution of Anastasia's mate on the h-file.
1 Nxh7+ Nxh7 2 Sh3+ Ng8 3 Rh5 'h6
To all appearances Black has parried the attack on the h-file, but now comes the unexpected point. 4 2>f5! Rxh5 5 Ne7+ Nh7 6 Sxh5# One of the most important types of attack along the h-file is that which in- volves the doubling of the heavy pieces on the file, threatening mate at h8. If the enemy king's flight squares on the second rank are occupied by its own pawns, then the attacker must concentrate his effort on doubling his heavy pieces as rap- idly as possible and mate his opponent at the focal-point h8. However, if the king has a square to escape to or there is a threat to get one by moving the g-pawn or f- pawn, attention must be turned to this possible means of defence. The most eco- nomical formation against this, as far as the use of attacking material is con- cerned, is one with an assault pawn at g6 and a defending one at g7. The continuations from the following diagram are devoted to this typical formation (with colours reversed).
160 The Art of Attack in Chess
B
In this example Black is the attacker. He has already sacrificed his queen in or- der to reach this position, his intention being to mate White's king with a rook on hl. Doubling rooks is not a problem for Black in this position, but he is involved in a struggle for f2, which is important as a flight square for the white king. There are two methods of handling this: the king can be allowed to get out and a mating net then woven round it, or the formation with the pawn at g3 and doubled rooks can be set up. Both courses lead to success in this position, and both do so in two ways, so that in all Black has four lines which lead to victory. Here they are: A) l...Sah8 2 f4 The only reply; if 2 g3, White is mated by the rooks; if 2 f3, then 2...g3.
2...5M+
This is the 'mating net' method; 2...g3 allows White to reply 3 Rxh5. 3 sfcfZ Nxe4+ 4 el Sxfl+ 5 xfl Shl+ 6 jlgl Sxgl+ 7 &xgl Nf3+ 8 &fl 2"g3#. In this variation the doubled rooks have disappeared, but the 'doubled knights' are not to be overlooked. B) l...£"e2+ 2 Rxe2 Sah8 3 f4 g3 4 Rxh5 Nxe3+ 5 Sf2 Some players are more hurt by forced moves of this kind than by mate itself.
5... xh5 6 gxf2 7 Ne2 flW+ 8 xfl 2>g3+ 9 el Shi#
Let us now look at the two continuations which use the method based on the ...g3 formation. C) l...Ne2+ 2 Rxe2 Sah8 3 f4 Bxe3+ 4 Rxe3 xe4! This controls f2 and draws the queen away from the defence of g3.
5 Rxe4 g3
By means of a series of diversions Black has now established the necessary conditions for the success of the pure formation of doubled rooks plus pawn on g3 against pawn on g2. To avoid mate White would now have to give up nearly all Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 161 his material: 6 Re7+ <Nxe7 7 fiel+ *d?d7 8 &fl fihl+ 9 <Ne2 fie8+, after which
10...fiexel leads to a further harvest on the back rank.
D) l...fih7(D) Finally, there is also the possibility of the rook retiring from h5 so that the queen cannot take it after ...g3. 2f4 If 2 g3, we get the following entertaining variation: 2...Nf3+ 3 Rxf3 gxf3 4 Bg5 Nxe4 5 Jlh4 xg3! 6 .xg3 fiah8 mating. An example of 'clearing up' on the h-file .
2...g3 3 Sf3
Or 3 Wei Ne2+ 4 Rxe2 Sah8, etc.
3...fiah8 4 Sxg3 Shl+ 5 <Nf2 xe4#
In the above diagram doubling rooks was an easy task, but the crux lay in con- trolling the squares which the king might use for its escape. However, there are cases where the problem lies in actually doubling the rooks on the intended file. As a rule a necessary condition for this is that the attacker's back rank should be clear of other pieces so that the rooks can be moved at will. When the rooks on a given rank cover each other, they are said to be 'united'. Naturally, being 'united' can also apply to a queen and rook. The continuation from the following diagram is instructive in this context. There is no argument about Vuko vic's first three lines, but in variation 'D' White can play 2 .xd4 fiah8 (after 2 xd4 3 fie 1 fiah8 4 l4?f1 the king slips out) 3 Rxg4+! Nc7 4 Rh3 fixh3 5 gxh3 Nxd4 6 Nc3, escaping into an ending in which he is only slightly worse.
162 The Art of Attack in Chess
The diagram represents a critical stage in the game Krogius-Niemela, Lovisa 1934. White is in a precarious position, even though his pawn formation is sound and he has an open h-file. If he withdraws his bishop to c2, Black has the strong reply l...d4, while l...jLxg5 is also worth considering. If 1 Rg4 cxd3 2 Rh4 (2 Rh3 h5 3 gxh6 {3 g4 Bc8! } 3...d4! is in Black's favour) 2...h5 3 g4, Black plays
3...Ng7! 4 gxh5 Sh8 5 h6+ 7, and White's attack is beaten back. Black's de-
fensive plan against the idea of using the white g-pawn to break open the h-file is worth remembering, since there are often opportunities for such play in practice. Taking into account all the difficulties described, White decided to strike im- mediately with his rook at h7; Black failed to discover the correct reply.
1 Sxh7! cxd3?
It is true that Black could not take the rook because of 2 Rh5+ g8 3 Rh6 cxd3 4 ?f2, after which he has no satisfactory defence against Shi. However, it was also not a good idea to take the bishop; the precious tempo should have been expended on breaking up White's pawn formation, which is in fact the decisive factor in White's success on the h-file. Thus l...jtxg5! would have been correct. In that case two of White's pieces are threatened and if 2 f2, then Black can play 2...Nxh7; 2 Sh3 can be met by 2... .c8 and then ...Bh4+, while if 2 fxg5, then either 2...Rxg5 or 2...Nxh7. By sacrificing on g5 Black eliminates White's control of h6, and in some variations he captures with his queen on e5, thereby covering the square h8 in the manner of a fianchettoed bishop. 2 < f2! (D) Uniting the rooks on the back rank above all else! In fact, the chief value of this kind of move derives from the characteristic dual control which it provides. That is, by playing 2 Nf2! White opens up the square hl both for the queen and the al -rook, whereas after, for example, 2 Rg4? only the queen would be brought Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 163 into action and the al-rook would be left behind. The inadequacy of 2 Rg4? is shown by the following continuation: 2...'Nxh7 3 Rh4+ 'ifc'gS 4 sfcfZ f6! 5 e6 (if 5 exf6, Black plays 5... .xf6, enabling his king to wriggle out via f7) 5...fxg5 6 Rh6 Juf6 and Black has defended himself; e.g. if 7 Rxg6+ Ji.g 7 8 Shi, then
8...Bf6, while if 7 Shi, then 7 ...Re7 8 xg6+ Rg7, etc.
B
2...F6
If 2... xh7, then 3 hlH- Ng8 4 Rh6 leaves Black without a defence against
5 Shi (for 4...f6 is no good on account of 5 xg6+). The white queen must be
brought to h6, and it makes no difference whether it goes via hl or h4 (as both g4-h4-h6 and <Nf2, Whl-h6 take three tempi), but in the case of the al-rook, the continuation 2 f? ! is better than 2 Rg4?, which does nothing to bring it into action. Finally, it should be mentioned that a delayed sacrifice at g5 is also of no avail, e.g. 2...Nxg5 3 Whl Nf6 (or 3...f5 4 e6! ±f6 5 Rh6 Re8 6 Bhl and 7 Sh8+) 4 Rh6! followed by 5 Shi and 6 Eh8+.
3 Whl 1-0
For if 3...Re8 or 3...fxe5, then 4 h6 is decisive. The formation with rook on hi and pawn on h4 Of the various formations on the h-file the most important in practice is undoubt- edly that with a rook on hl and pawn on h4. It is a good representative example of battery attacks with rook and pawn which are created when the pawn captures an opposing piece and thereby opens up the file for the rook. This situation is often engineered by placing another attacking piece on the square covered by the pawn, creating threats which induce or oblige the opponent to take it. There are
164 The Art of Attack in Chess
two other methods of exploiting the formation of rook and pawn - one is to sim- ply advance the pawn, the other involves switching the rook on to another file (e.g. with rook on hl and pawns at h4 and g2, moving the rook to h3 and then to g3). Here are a few examples of these ideas. In this position we see a formation in which preparations have already been made for the opening of the h-file after the capture of the knight at g5. It is true that White, to move, currently has no very sharp threats, but he reckons correctly that he can quickly strengthen his position; in the meantime, he puts his trust in the efficacy of hxg5 if Black takes the knight.
1 c3 hxg5?
We shall examine this weak move in order to get to know the various typical combinations which occur when the h-file is opened in such circumstances. Cor- rect was 1...a5 !, stopping b4. White would then probably play 2 g4 to exclude the possibility of ... f6-h5-g3. Thus, the game could go on for a few more moves with the knight on g5 en prise, until the critical moment came to decide on the ex- act significance of the knight's position: either White's attack would break through, or Black would take the knight without any ill-effects to himself, or thirdly White might simply withdraw the knight from g5. 2 hxg5 £}xd5 3 Bxd5 Le6 If 3...g6, then 4 <Ne2!

This seems to provide the most resistance. If 4...g6, then 5 f5 Bxd5 6 f6 jle6 7 Rf3 and White can easily organize a mating attack. Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 165

Black takes the bishop, even though there is no danger at the moment. He could have played, for example, 1...a6 2 Ncd5 b5 3 h5, after which there is a real threat of Ng6+. This can be parried by 3...h6, and if 4 Ng6+, then 4... h7 . 2 g6+! A typical method of 'clearing' the file before the battery opens fire with hxg5.

the g-file. In this case the rook is potentially active on two files at the same time and develops great power as a result. The above position arose in the game Vukovic-Dr Vajda, Debrecen 1925. Black had just threatened White's bishop by ...h6, and White replied: 1 114! If Black accepts the sacrifice, then after l...hxg5 2 hxg5 g6 3 gxf6 <?W6 4 White obtains an attacking position without having to surrender any material.
1...fie8 2 Nb7
Consistently refusing the gift offered him on g5, Black hopes to persuade the bishop eventually to retreat. However, he is in any case in a poor position, as a re- sult of his premature advance ...c4 earlier in the game. With his pawn on c5 Black would still have some say in the centre, and a central action is usually a valuable antidote against an attack on the castled king. With the pawn on c4, Black is only able to undertake slow operations on the queenside, and they are not sufficient to counterbalance White's attack. 3Sh3! A manoeuvre designed to bring the rook into the game as quickly as possible; it is characteristic of the formation with rook on hl and pawn on h4.

Black gives up a second pawn, but he can do nothing to save his position. After 8 hxg6 Nxe5 9 gxf7+ s xf7 10 dxe5 Ra5 White played 11 e4 and won in ten more moves, but the finish might have been even more abrupt with 11 Bxg7 xg7 12 g5 followed by h5. The h-file in connection with the classic bishop sacrifice The analysis of the classic bishop sacrifice, to which we devoted particular atten- tion in an earlier chapter, must now be supplemented by cases where such a sacri- fice is combined with an attack along the h-file. This arises when White has a rook on hl and pawn on h4, the pawn acting as a support for the knight on g5. We shall examine two examples from master chess in which the h-file is opened up. The following position comes from the game Steinitz-Golmayo, Havana 1888, and arose after the moves:
1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 c3 Nf6 4 e5 fd7 5 f4 c5 6 dxc5 JLxcS 7 f3 O-O 8 Bd3
£k6? (D) Steinitz at this point played: 9h4 White could have played immediately 9 Bxh7+ < 'xh7 10 £}g5+ S gb 11 Rd3+ f5 and then 12 Rg3 Re8 (against other queen moves, 13 Rh4 is decisive) 13 xe6+ <6'f7 14 c7 Rd8 15 <?3xa8 when White has the upper hand.
1 In this line 14 xg7! Itg8 15 £}xe8 Hxg3 16 e6+ is decisive.
168 The Art of Attack in Chess
Steinitz rejected the idea of the sacrifice because on the twelfth move he had reckoned only on 12 Nxe6? Ra5 13 Nxf8+ Nxf8 14 Rxd5 Be6, which would indeed have been favourable for Black.
9...f6
White would have had a harder task after 9...h6, although even then he could have gained the advantage by 10 £}g5 . Given that this is a typical continuation, let us examine a few variations: 1) 10...hxg5 11 Bh7+! *xh7 12 Rh5+ <Ng8 13 hxg5 f5 14 g6 and mate. 2) 10...&dxe5 11 fxe5 Nxe5 12 Nh7+ <$h8 13 Nf4 Ng6 14 Nd2 and White is the better placed1. 3) 10...£fo4 1 1 Nh7+ *h8 12 Rh5 Re7 13 Nd2 f5 (if 13...Se8 then 14 i.g6 while against 13...£}c6 or other such moves White plays 14 O-O-O) 14 g6 Nxc2+ (also in White's favouris 14...Re8 15 £}xe6, etc.) 15 &dl Nxal 16 Bg8 ! followed by mate with the queen on h72.
1 This contention seems highly dubious. After 13...£k4, attacking b2 and threat-
ening 14...e5, White is clearly worse. Black has two central pawns for the piece, White's king is trapped in the centre and his pieces are hopelessly tangled up on the kingside. Therefore White should prefer 12 Nf3, with a double-edged posi- tion.
2 There is also a fair degree of wishful thinking in this line, for example after
14,..Re8 15&xe6 2>xc2+ 16 4?dl (16 Rxe6!) 16...Rxg6 17Nxg6 Nxal the queens are exchanged and White is a whole rook down. He can regain the exchange easily enough, but rounding up the al -knight is far from easy - the as- sessment must be that Black is better. All these lines illustrate the point that Vukovic himself makes: launching an attack without first completing your de- velopment is a risky business.

It is the formation with pawn on g6 against pawn on g7 (which has already been discussed) that is finally decisive. The part played by the knight on b5 is evi- dent in several variations, as well as in the final position, e.g. if 19... f8, then 20 Rh8+ and 21 Rxg7+, etc. Alekhine - Asgeirsson Reykjavik Simultaneous Display, 1931 French Defence

9...c5 does nothing to stop it. Relatively best was 9...f5! 10 exf6 (after 10 e2 c5
1 1 c3 White is the better placed, but his attack is delayed and Black is not without counterplay) 10..Bxf6. The situation is then easier for Black, for as a result of the exchange on f6 an extremely important attacking unit has disappeared, namely White's pawn on e5. Sacrifices in this position are therefore not worth- while; after 1 1 Jtxh7+ xh7 12 Ng5+ Ng8 13 Rh5 Black has an adequate de- fence in 13...Rd7, while if 1 1 Ng5, he can play ll...Bxg5 12 hxg5 Rxg5! 13 Xxh7+ and White's attack is not worth much owing to his weakness in the centre and the activity of Black's queen, especially on the dark squares1. The last continuation can also be brought about by a different series of moves: 1 1 Ng5 Bxg5 12 Bxh7+, when Black should not play 12...Nxh7 (in which case 13 hxg5+ and 14 Rh5 is extremely strong) but 12... f8! 13 hxg5 Rxg5, ending with the position described above. These possibilities are worth getting to know well, since we are dealing with a typical position. Particularly important is the significance of Black's ...f5 in this kind of position: if White does not take the pawn at once en passant, the sacrifice on h7 is prevented directly; while if he takes it, then it is indirectly thwarted or at any rate made weaker, since White's pawn has disappeared from e5. It is also worth noting that to avert the sacrifice entirely by ...h6 or ...g6 is not a good thing in this position. If 9...h6, White plays 10 Ne2 followed by c3 and

attacks in a different way (e.g. by means of JLbl and Rd3 he forces a weakening of the square g6 or, alternatively, he plays g4, etc.); in this connection it is impor- tant to note that ...f5, if played later on, would create a new weakness on g6. If

An example of the inadequacy of passive defence. 17 Nb5, which is what Black was afraid of, is by no means White's principal threat and is only effective in conjunction with a strong initiative. Alekhine is also at fault in his commen- tary when he claims that Nb5 represented a threat after 16 O-O-O. Instead of 16...a6? Black should have played 16...cxd4! and thus exploited the extra tempo in the centre, e.g.: 1) 17 Nb5 Nc6 and now: la) 18 f4 Sxf7 19 £}d6 and now Black has a satisfactory defence in l .WfS!1.

falls. Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 175 'fulfils the ardent desires' of the attacker, as is done in this case by the good- natured matador from Ultima Thule...? Diagonals in the attack on the castled king Tartakower thought it suitable to bestow epithets of the following kind on the files: a-file - positional; b - covetous; c - far-sighted; d - prosaic; e - dangerous; f - tempting; g - sacrificial; and h - contentious. He might also have invented something similar (even if he in fact did not) to apply to the ranks. But the diago- nals? Well, they are all somehow equally 'elegant, subtle, far-sighted', etc. On the long diagonals (al-h8 and a8-hl) more kings have already died than in the whole of the world's history; more tragedies have been played out on the classic diagonals (bl -h7 for White and b8-h2 for Black) than in all the world's theatres, and on the developing diagonals (a2-g8 and a7-gl respectively) there have been more mistakes made than in a large library full of books. Now that we have started on nicknames and epithets, let us bestow on the diagonals a4-e8 and h4- d8 (from White's point of view; a5-el and h5-dl from Black's) the name of pin- ning diagonals. The reader can think over for himself how much material he has already lost on them. Just as the rook is the piece suited for play on open files and ranks, so the bishop is the master of the diagonals, indeed they are his raison d'etre. At all stages of the game, and especially in an attack on the castled king, marshalling bishops on the diagonals demands great skill. A player's skill, in fact, is often demonstrated by his play on the diagonals, and the impression is then given that 'the slender bishop is subtler than the stout rook'. Putting facetiousness aside, let us now look at the relationship between the lines commanded by the rook and the bishop's diagonals. In the first place, it should be stressed that the fundamental difference does not lie in the number or importance of the squares on the files or diagonals, nor in the weight of operations on them. The differences arise only from the different val- ues of rook and bishop and also from the part played by pawn moves in opening up or blocking a line. It is harder to sacrifice the more valuable rook than the bishop, and the order of value is even more relevant when it comes to pinning: exchanging a bishop for a pinned rook wins the exchange, while bishop for knight is tit-for-tat, but a rook can only gain from pinning a piece when it takes the queen. The other difference is still more explicit: it is comparatively easy to open up or close a diagonal by the normal advance of one's pawns, but achieving the same object on a file means that the pawn has to make a capture, and this naturally depends on the disposition
176 The Art of Attack in Chess
of one's opponent's pieces; hence, there may be considerable difficulty in open- ing up a file. If, on the other hand, it has to be closed, an outpost as a rule has to be established; on the diagonals, however, outposts are the exception, since the 'open-shut' game is easily carried out by the pawns. It is in this, ultimately, that the whole 'subtlety and far-sightedness' of the diagonal lies. We shall open a se- ries of examples with a case of pinning on a diagonal. The pinning here is in fact a temporary episode within the whole operation of 'clearing up' on the diagonal, and the end comes with the line being completely breached when the pinned piece is captured. This position comes from the game Tolush-Renter, Estonian Championship
1945. It is White to move.

This draws Black's king out to g7 and at the same time opens up the diagonal of the white bishop on b2. I...Nxg7 2 Sdl Re7 If2...Re6, then 3 f5. 3 g4+ #h8 4 fid7 In this way White wins the enemy bishop, but the correct method of exploiting the position would have been to aim consistently for a breakthrough on the square f6, e.g. 4 WgS Nc6 5 f5 Sg8 (or 5...Sd8 6 fiel and if 6...Sdd6, then 7 Rh6 followed by Sf4 wins; otherwise the manoeuvre Sf4-g4 is at once decisive1) 6 W16 Bc8 7 h4 b5 (Black has no better move; for example, ...Hg7 and ...£te8 will not save him because of f6) 8 h5 a5 9 Sfd2 b4 (the combination which White has
1 Black might defend by 6...2dd6 7 Rh6 Rd8, and if 8 fif4 then 8...Hd1. In view
of the uncertainties of this approach, Tolush's method appears sounder. Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 177 prepared by advancing his h-pawn to h5 is also decisive against other moves) 10 Sd6 Sxd6 11 Sxd6 Rxd6 12 Bxf6+ Rxf6 13 Rxf6+ Sg7 14 h6 and White mates. 4,..Re6 5 Rg5 Sc6 6 Sxb7 and White won in due course. An important point is that, in addition to 'clearing' one's opponent's pieces from a diagonal, cases also occur where one's own pieces prevent it being opened. It is extremely difficult to resuscitate a diagonal on which one has a blocked pawn of one's own. Structurally, it is a similar problem to that of opening a file where a pawn blocks the path of a rook, and it is usually solved in the same way, i.e. by sacrificing a piece on a square controlled by the pawn. Here is an ex- ample. This position occurred in the game Alexander-Szabo, Hil versum 1947. White pitched his knight into f6 with check so as to bring the long diagonal back to life. 1 2tf6+! gxf6 If l... ?h8, then 2 Rh4 is very strong1.
2 Rg3+ s£?h8 3 exf6 jlxf6 4 Ne5!

4..Jtxe5 5 Nxe5+ f6 6 Sxf6 1-0
Since if 6...fixf6, 7 Sfl is decisive. The 'clearing' of the long diagonal was a victory for the bishop. 1 2 Rh4 allows the defence 2...Rxd3. Instead, 2 Re4 is correct, when 2...gxf6 3 exf6 followed by <$3g5 forces mate.
178 The Art of Attack in Chess
As far as play on the diagonals is concerned, the strength of the central squares on the given diagonals is particularly important. These squares can assist the at- tacker in setting up outposts, in transferring pieces, and in other operations. Thus one should, as a rule, aim to have such squares protected or even over-protected. This is one of the maxims of positional play, and we shall see in the next example how Black pays for ignoring this maxim and how the attack on the castled king suddenly erupts. This position arose in Stoltz-Guimard, Groningen 1946. White played: 1 dxc5 £}xc5? A mistake, since it surrenders to White control over the important central squares d4 and e5, which means that the long diagonal occupied by his bishop on b2 is already as good as opened up (considering the gain of tempo by £}b5, which White always has in hand). Black should have played either l...bxc5 or 1 xc5. 2 <Nb5 Rd8
2...Rb8 is not good here because of White's grip on e5, e.g. 3 .e5 Ra8 4
<2k7, and Black loses the exchange. 3 xa7 Black will, it is true, win back the a-pawn, but White will have succeeded, without loss of time, in strengthening the position of his knight at b5 (...a6 is no longer possible).
3...2a8 4 Nb5 Exa2 5 Wbl Sa8 6 Ng5
Suddenly the course of the game turns against Black's castled position; White threatens Jtxf6 followed by mate on h7.

Black should have consented to a further weakening of the diagonal by 6...g6, for that would have meant less trouble for him than the text move . Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 179

By threatening $Lcl, White installs his bishop with gain of tempo at e5, a square that is now firmly under his control. His next intention is to play Rb2, af- ter which the bishop's whole manoeuvre takes on the purpose of clearing the di- agonal.
8... c8 9 Rb2 dxc4
If 9...f6, which the tournament book (by Euwe and Kmoch) considers correct, White wins a pawn: 10 .d6 Se8 (or 10...Rd7 11 $Lcl 2a6 12 Bf3, etc.) 11 Jtxe7 Sxe7 12 £ki6 Rc6 13 Nxb7 Sxb7 14 cxd5 exd5 15 2xd5, and Black is in difficulties on a fresh diagonal (a2-g8).

The various operations on the diagonal are concluded by a bishop sacrifice, the aim of which is to lure the king into the line of fire. Black did not submit to 1 6...#tee4 is perhaps the most sensible. Black blocks the bl-h7 diagonal without creating a further weakness on the kingside.

The plan also works with 15 £}f5+, in which case mate is achieved by 17 g4#. The next example is devoted to the problem of recognizing strong diagonals and combining their 'clearing' with an effective use of the bishop. Here we have a position from the game Lundin -Tartakower, Groningen 1946. It is clear that White is the better placed, and that Black is weak on the a2-g8 di- agonal, but it is less obvious that the white bishop will put in such a quick appear- ance on that diagonal and that the game will be decided on the bl-h7 diagonal. White won as follows: 1 e4! fxe4 Otherwise e5 is too strong.
2 Ng5 Sxfl+ 3 JLxfl!
The bishop is on its way to c4, the knight on g5 is already casting glances in the direction of f7, and the threats on the e-file see to it that the initiative remains in White's hands.

White offers a pawn in order to open up the long diagonal for his b2-bishop. 1 d5! d7 Black does not accept the sacrifice. After l...exd5 2 Sxe8 Rxe8 3 Ng5 both

8 Pieces and pawns in the attack
on the castled king Our examination of the attack on the castled king has so far (in chapters 4-7) been mainly directed towards the spatial aspect of the attack, and it is now time to ex- amine the parts played by particular pieces and the significance of material sacri- fices. Some of these points have already been touched on, so in this chapter we shall concern ourselves only with certain themes where the material aspect is paramount and which have not yet been fully dealt with. The queen in the attack on the castled king The queen is undoubtedly the most important piece in the attack on the castled king, and indeed without it such an attack rarely comes into consideration. Ad- mittedly, it is not impossible to undertake a direct attack without the queen, but the necessary conditions for it cannot easily be created. The queen's great mobility, its main characteristic, is a useful factor in the at- tack on the castled king, but its effectiveness at short range is even more striking. If it is in occupation of the focal-point g7, the enemy king on g8 has every square taken from it; moreover, if it is protected on that focal-point and the focal-point itself has been cleared of the influence of the opposing pieces, then the king is mated. The queen is, as it were, 'made for focal-points', and particularly for play on compound focal-points. Therefore, the queen's chief strategy in an attack on the castled king consists in playing on the focal-points and discovering ways in which to attack as effectively as possible at close range. Thus the queen, which in an endgame on an open board feels such an aversion towards the opponent's king that it will not allow it nearer than two paces away, is filled in attack with some kind of dark desire and dreams only of how it can steal into the castled dwelling and there fold the king in a close and deadly embrace. The reverse side of the queen's positive characteristics is its great material value; this means that the queen is not lightly sacrificed and is not as a rule given up for smaller gains, such as preventing castling or clearing a focal-point. How- ever, there are a number of different kinds of queen sacrifice which occur in the attack on the castled king; these can be reduced in the main to two fairly sharply differentiated types: the case where the sacrifice forces mate, 'check upon
184 The Art of Attack in Chess
check' , as it were, and the case where it produces a great positional weakness on the opposing side. There are also unusual and curious queen sacrifices; we shall give three exam- ples as variations on this theme, ranging over a period of 40 years. In this position, from the game Fox-Bauer, Washington 1901, White, to move, set his opponent a trap.

Black in his greed accepted the sacrifice, which he should have refused. 2 xg6! A correct sacrifice of the queen, which forces the opening of either the h-file or the a2-g8 diagonal.

Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 185 A position from the game Lewitzky-Marshall, Breslau 1912. Marshall won re- nown in the following way:
1...5h6 2 Rg5 Hxh3 3 Sc5
White saw that 3 gxh3 would not do because of 3...£rf3+ and intended, on
3...Ra3, to play 4 Sc7, etc1.
However, Black took him by surprise with:
3...Rg3I! 0-1
4 hxg3 Ne2# and 4 fxg3 £te2+ 5 ?h1 Sxfl# fail at once, while after 4 Rxg3 £te2+ 5 s£?h1 Nxg3+ 6 <&gl Nxfl 7 gxh3 £k!2 White is left a knight down. This position is from a blindfold game of Alekhine's at Tenerife in 1945 (Alekhine-Supico) and acts as a counterpart to Marshall's combination above. Alekhine, in playing lWg6! forced Black to resign (1-0).

Lovers of curiosities will have noticed the common square (g6 or g3) on which the queen is sacrificed on all three occasions. The curious side of these examples should not distract one from noticing what is typical in them: in all these cases the attacker has a number of other pieces at his disposal, all in the strongest ag- gressive positions, while only his queen is somehow 'underemployed'. As a re- sult, it is given the task of breaking up the position by sacrificing itself. The situation is that although the pieces are in very aggressive positions, they cannot

186 The Art of Attack in Chess
settle the issue by themselves since, if they are sacrificed, their aggressive forma- tion also disappears. It is therefore left to a less committed piece to carry out the work of destruction, and in these cases this is none other than the queen. Usually, however, the reverse applies: the other pieces are sacrificed, while the queen reaps the harvest. The heavy pieces in the attack The examples in chapters 4-7 have shown us various kinds of operations on the part of the rook, the bishop, and the knight on lines and focal-points, and no fur- ther illustrations of the use of these pieces in an attack on the castled king need be given. Only one special case remains to be dealt with, and that is the attack on the castled king carried out by the heavy pieces (queen and rooks) alone. The main feature of this kind of attack can be summed up as the task of overcoming the clumsiness of the rooks. The attacker must aim to make his own rooks active and force his opponent's into passivity. A rook's mobility depends essentially on its ability to switch its control suddenly from one file to another and, in particular, from a file to a rank. Or, in the terminology used in my Introduction to chess (2nd ed., p. 171), the rook must have corresponding strong squares at its disposal. Here are a few examples: This position is from the game Winter-Capablanca, Ramsgate 1929. Black, to move, played: l...Bh8 Black threatens 2...g5, which would not have been good at once because of 2 Sg2. White is now obliged to weaken his pawn position by moving his h-pawn.

Black threatens ...Sh6, ...Exh3+ and ...Wgl#. If White plays 12 Efl, the plan of 12...Eh6 followed by sacrificing at h3 is again in order, for the rook on fl is unprotected; moreover, if it is moved (e.g. to al) then 13...Exh3+ still succeeds because the queen can follow up with a decisive check at f3. In his book, My Best Games of Chess 1924-1937, Alekhine mentions another reply, 12 Wdl, and claims that 12...Eh6 leads to an original zugzwang position; this is not correct (because Black has the strong threat of 13...Rg7 14 Rd4 Exh3+, etc.), but it is true inasmuch as White's rooks cannot move; they provide a perfect illustration of 'the rook's clumsiness'. After 12 Wdl Sh6 White would have to play 13 Wai (not 13 c4 because of
13...d4!), in which case the strongest reply is 13...a6! (creating another threat, i.e.
...b5-b4 followed by ...d4; if 13...Rg7, then 14 c4 is possible). Now White's front e-pawn is lost, but he can still offer some resistance by 14 Sfl. Black, however, must not take the e-pawn while White's queen is on al; he does better with
14...b5 15 axb5 axb5, after which one can speak of a type of zugzwang position,
since White cannot prevent the situation of his pawn on e5 from deteriorating still further. If 16 b4 (or 16 Wdl or 16 Wei), Black takes the pawn on e5, after which he should win. In the actual game White gave up a pawn in a different way and lost as follows:

The black queen retires and at the same time creates the threat of ...Sg6, a typical case of a tripled formation with a rook Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 189 in front of the queen. The reader should note the mobility of Black's heavy pieces, which allows such rapid and useful regroupings to be made. In the course of the game and its variations up to this point two pairs of corresponding strong squares for Black stand out, namely, g6 and h6 for the rook, and g3 and g7 for the queen.

It is the finish of the game Bernstein- Kotov, Groningen 1946. Black, having greedily and needlessly snapped up a pawn (he had just played ...Se4xb4 instead of the correct ...Sc4) lost as follows:

The sacrifice in the attack on the castled king Before we turn to the role of the pawns in the attack on the castled king, a few general remarks must be made about sacrifices in the castling area. Certain combinative elements are present in the case of every sacrifice, though these sac- rifices may be of widely diverging types. However, the typical sacrifice in the castling area is the one which is closely influenced by the special characteristics of that area, namely the castled king and the pawns in front of it. The typical sac- rifice either changes the structure of the pawns, or aims to draw the king on to a square where it can be attacked, or else helps to create a focal-point. We have al- ready met examples of the last two types in the course of discussing focal-points, particularly in the case of the classic bishop sacrifice. Here our principal interest is the pawn structure and the possibility of altering it by means of a sacrifice. A sacrifice can either simply annihilate one of the pawns in front of the king, or it can deflect the pawn on to another file, or finally it can cause it to be blocked. The main use of the sacrifice in the attack on the castled king is to eliminate the pawns in the castling area, and a number of examples will be devoted to this. But first of all, let us examine two examples where the emphasis is on spoiling the pawn structure by deflecting or blocking the pawns. This position comes from an analysis of the game Capablanca-Nimzowitsch, Bad Kissingen, 1928. White mates as follows: Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 191
1 Nfg5! fxg5
Deflecting the pawn from f6. 2 f6! Blocking the f7-pawn.
2...J.xf6 3 .e4
and Black has no way of stopping mate on h7. White here overcame the resistance of Black's f-pawn on the diagonal bl-h7 by making sacrifices which deflected one pawn and blocked the other. This position arose in the game Steinitz-L. Paulsen, Baden-Baden 1870. It is White's move, and he is faced with the task of finding the most effective attack- ing plan against Black's castled position. To this end he played: 1 b6! White gives up a pawn in order to weaken Black's castled position and open up the a- and b-files. This kind of pawn sacrifice is instructive and typical. Its ad- vantage lies in the fact that Black has no way of blocking the pawn structure but is forced to capture in order to avoid getting into worse difficulties. I...axb6 2 2xf6! The castled position has been effectively weakened and the situation is ripe for the further thrust a5, that being the logical method of following up 1 b6 !, but Steinitz sees that, before playing a5, he can strengthen his attack still further by sacrificing the exchange.

One further remark must be made before passing on to the destructive sacri- fice: a sacrifice and the operations following it must have the aim of creating a fo- cal-point, especially if the opponent has some active counterplay at his disposal. The next diagram shows an example where the attacker wrecks his opponent's castled position and regains the material he has sacrificed, but is still unsuccess- ful because he cannot create a focal-point. This position is from the game Colle-Tartakower, Niendorf 1927. White is ex- cellently placed here and ought to continue with 1 Nh3, but Colle, the lover of sacrifices, cannot resist the temptation and offers material in a position which is still insufficiently prepared. 1 exf7? Sxf7 2 £sxe6 Rc8 3 Ng6 8 4 i.xf7+ Nxf7 5 Nxg7 All these captures have been made on different squares, none of which quali- fies as a candidate for a focal-point. No wonder that Black develops a counterat- tack that ensures sufficient counterplay.

The position is balanced and the game ended in a draw after a further 17 moves. Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 193 The destructive sacrifice We have already referred to the annihilation of the pawns in front of the castled king as the most important or at any rate predominant result of sacrificial opera- tions. It would be more exact to say that the destruction of these pawns is the most common combinative element of sacrifices in the castling area. Most play- ers tend to pay more attention to the material aspect than to the temporal one, but the most decisive consequence of the destruction of pawns is that the departed pawns can no longer affect the game. This is a permanent positional factor by means of which many combinations are sustained, even when all may not have been in order on the temporal side. It is very important to spot the opportunities for making a destructive sacrifice, and in many positions the attacker is shown the way by simply calculating what would happen if his opponent were not to have a certain pawn. We shall look at a number of examples which illustrate typical destructive sac- rifices. This position arose in a match game between Loyd and Delmar in 1879. It is Black's move, and he must act quickly if White is not to break through by b6 or Sxa7. Various attempts like ...Hg5+ or ...Sh5 meet with resistance, and only the immediate capture of the pawn at h2 ensures mate. 1 xh2+! 2 <Nxh2 Sg5+ 3 <Ng4 Eh5 4 2Bh2 Rxh2+ 5 £fl Se5 and mate by ...Whl# is unavoidable. The destructive sacrifice on g7 (or g2) is particularly dangerous, and we shall examine one out of the rich collection of this type.
194 The Art of Attack in Chess
This position arose in the game Shumov-Jaenisch, St. Petersburg 1849. Black, to move, concluded the game as follows: l...Nxg2+ 2 xg2 Rg6+ 3 &hl Jtd5+ 4 f3 Bxf3+ 5 Sxf3 Wgl# We shall now go on to look at cases of successive sacrifices, whereby two of the pawns in front of the castled king are eliminated. It is often easy to spot sacri- fices of this kind if the position is looked at in the light of our thematic criterion: what would the situation be if the pawns were not there? Let us take the next dia- gram, for example. In this position, from the game Keller-Rohaczek, Vienna 1937, it is White's move, and he has an easy task if he imagines Black's position without the pawns on h7 and g7 and realizes that White then mates with his queen on h5 and rook on gl. The operation is then extremely simple.

Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 195 This position is from a correspondence game between Luprecht and Schulz played in the United States in 1946. Here it is a question of removing Black's pawns on a7 and b7 from in front of the king. If these pawns did not exist, a build-up with a rook on bl and a queen on e3 would give White an irresistible mating attack. The solution is therefore simple. 1 ±xa7+ Nxa7 2 Re3+ First, the queen is brought nearer with gain of tempo and then the second pawn is annihilated.

Prize at the Saltsjbbaden Interzonal tournament in 1948. In the above position, White continued: 1 fxg7! This eliminates the pawn on g7 (in this case the sacrifice does not take place on that square but indirectly at f4). Black accepts the sacrifice in order not to be left a pawn down.

Black has three minor pieces for a rook and two pawns, but his knights are badly placed, whereas the position is just right for White's rooks. With 5...Rf6, Black attempts to lessen the force of the attack by returning some material, but he is unsuccessful because his knights continue to find them- selves on awkward squares. Other lines were no better, e.g.: 1) 5...Nd4 6 cxd4 cxd4 7 Sfel ! Nf6 8 Re5 ?f7 9 Sxd4 and White wins. 2) 5...Nd6 6 Rg4+ f7 7 Sfel Bc8 8 Rxf4+ also wins. 3) 5...Rc8 (if 5...Re7, then 6 Sfel, while if 5...Rc7, then 6 Rg4+ and 7 Sd7)

Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 197 Of the various sacrificial devices to eliminate two pawns in front of the castled king, the sacrifice of both bishops on h7 and g7 is particularly worth noting. One of the oldest examples of this occurred in the game Lasker-Bauer, Amsterdam
1889. The opening moves were:
1 f4 d5 2 e3 Nf6 3 b3 e6 4 Nb2 Ae7 5 Nd3 b6 6 Nc3 Nb7 7 f3 bd7 8 O-O
O-O 9 Ne2 c5 10 Ng3 Rc7 11 Ne5 Nxe5 12 Axe5 Rc6 13 Re2 a6? (D) In this position, after Black's mistaken last move, Lasker worked out a combi- nation which involved the sacrifice of both bishops; to this end he first of all forced the deflection of Black's knight.

14...c4 also results in a quick finish, e.g. 15 Nxf6+ Jlxf6 (or 15...gxf6 16

The pawns in the attack on the castled king These examples of destructive sacrifices have shown us a procedure for dealing with the opponent's pawns, and now we shall examine the part played by the at- tacker's pawns in the attack on the castled king. The part is a very varied one, re- flecting, as it does, the rich possibilities inherent in the pawn's movements. The pawns are, above all, the pieces which cost one the least to sacrifice in one's ef- forts to weaken the enemy position; they are also excellent at harrying one's op- ponent's pieces as well as helping to support one's own on focal-points or strong
200 The Art of Attack in Chess
squares. In all these cases the positive characteristics of the pawn are to the fore. The other side to the use of pawns in an attack on the castled king is a logical con- sequence of their negative characteristics, namely their limited mobility and the impossibility of reversing their moves. The attacker's pawn needs, on average, three moves before it can have a direct effect on the opposing castling area itself; also, the attacker cannot transfer it from one file to another at will, but only when opposing units are so placed as to come into its line of fire. Equally inconvenient is the other aspect of the pawn's negative characteristics: in advancing, it weak- ens the squares which it leaves behind it, and if the attack does not succeed, seri- ous positional weaknesses may become evident in the attacker's position. The irreversibility of pawn moves may also lead to a general blockade, which in turn produces a rigid position and complicates the attack. However, the pawn still has one more positive characteristic which can on some occasions help the attacker: the promotion of the pawn into a piece on the opponent's back rank may be the attacker's last trump at the critical stage of an attack. Thus all the different aspects of the pawn's special characteristics find their expression in an attack on the castled king, and the picture becomes still more varied when we fill in the spatial side of pawn operations in this kind of attack. Here is a brief summary of a pawn's role in the attack on the castled king. 1) The attacker's pawn (with or without a sacrifice) forces the opponent to weaken his castled position. 2) It serves to create combinative elements in attack (e.g. by deflecting or at- tracting the opponent's pieces or opening up files). 3) It forms part of an attacking formation (e.g. in the formation with a rook on hl and a pawn on h4 or as a support to a piece on a focal -point). 4) A particular example of such an attacking formation which should be men- tioned is the pawn centre; as a rule, this serves either generally to confine the op- ponent or to provide the basis for an attack on the castled king. 5) The pawn advances independently on the flank in order to drive an enemy piece away or to take control of a square. An advance of this kind is usually called a bayonet attack. 6) Two or three attacking wing pawns advance against the opponent's castled position in a frontal formation (a pawn avalanche or roller). 7) The pawn moves up into the castling area as a straightforward attacking unit against the enemy king. 8) The pawn advances into the castling area (with or without an attack on the king) in order to be promoted, after which it can carry on the attack in its new role. These various types of action are usually interrelated in practical play, and sin- gle moves often combine two or more such functions. Indeed, when the process Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 201 is observed as a whole over the space of a few moves, the continuous transition from one type to another is virtually the rule, except in the case of point 4 (centre pawns). As an example of the kind of progressive changes which can take place in the role of a pawn attack let us look schematically at 'the career of an h-pawn*, move by move. h3: the pawn advances and drives an opposing piece from g4. This could be termed a Tittle bayonet' (cf. point 5); h4: it makes up a set formation in conjunction with a rook on hl (point 3); this is followed by g4, and we have a frontal formation (point 6); h5: it threatens to open up the h-file by capturing an enemy pawn at g6 (poten- tially under point 2); Black therefore counters by blocking the position with ...g5, but as a result weakens the pawn structure in front of his king (point 1); h6: it acts as a support for an attack against the focal-point g7 (point 3); h7+: Black has warded off the threats on g7, but now the pawn turns to direct attack (point 7); h8Q: the pawn promotes to a queen and carries on the attack (point 8). Every chess player will admit that such a career on the part of an h-pawn is in no way exceptional but is, on the contrary, a typical illustration of the many- sidedness of a pawn's role in an attack on the castled king. Examples have already been given of the aspects of a pawn's activity listed un- der points 1-3 and 7-8, so we shall restrict ourselves in this chapter to a survey of those under points 4-6. The role of the pawn centre The centre pawns have the task of controlling important squares and preventing the opposing forces from using them. As a result the pawn centre is the main weapon in the struggle for an advantage in development and space. However, in addition to the general positional function of restricting the opponent, the pawn centre also acts as a basis for an attack on the castled king. Firstly, the overall re- striction imposed on the opponent makes it difficult for him to deploy his pieces and so indirectly assists the attacker's plans; in addition, each of the centre pawns directly controls the outer squares of the castled position. Thus, on e5, the e- pawn controls the important square f6, and on e6, the square f7; a similar control is exercised against the queenside castling position by the d-pawn (the squares c6 and c7). We have already seen a number of fine examples of the influence of a centre pawn in an attack on the castled king, and especially the part played by the pawn on e5 in the classic bishop sacrifice. In this section we shall examine the more
202 The Art of Attack in Chess
general situation, where a central formation has the functions both of a restricting agent and also of a direct controller of squares in the castling area. From the pro- fusion of practical examples of this kind we shall take one in which the attacker' s centre is particularly dynamic. Tarrasch - Alekhine Bad Pistyan, 1922 Blumenfeld Counter-Gambit

It is an irony of fate that the person to experience the might of the centre in this game should have been Tarrasch, a great devotee of the centre and a noted expo- nent of central pawn strategy. Such drastic examples of an action by the whole central mass in the attack on the castled king will not be found in contemporary master practice. The technique of playing against the centre has been so per- fected that one can no longer succeed by the single expedient of following the pattern of the game above. Masters no longer accept gambits like the Blumen- feld; on all occasions they examine the extent of the compensation or the possi- bility of play against the centre, either by counterattacking it with pawns, or by
204 The Art of Attack in Chess
exerting a restraining pressure on it with their pieces. The central formations which occur nowadays in master chess are not as a rule so uncompromisingly le- thal as this one, but instead tend to be critical and sensitive formations, which de- mand an extremely precise use of the pieces if they are not to become weak and collapse. As a result of this characteristic sensitivity of central formations in the games of present-day masters, the temporal aspect of such actions has also al- tered, and nowadays one rarely sees a full pawn centre being maintained for many moves; it usually appears as a transitory feature, a phase of the game which is immediately followed either by an attack on the castled king or some other ac- tion. The following game provides an illustration of this kind of temporary, flexi- ble centre and of a rapidly developed attack on the castled king.

Black's dark-squared bishop is exchanged in order to simplify the position further. Each exchange, as a rule, helps to diminish the power of the pawn centre and increases the significance of a queenside majority, which Black has here. Be- cause of this, theory regards this position as approximately equal. 9 id 2 Bxd2+ 10 Rxd2 O-O 11 Bc4 <Nd7? This move is considered weak by present-day theory.

An attempt to put pressure on the centre and induce e5, after which Black can play ...£ki5. However, White can leave his pawn on e4 for the time being and first strengthen his position in readiness for an attack on the castled king. The weak side of 15... f6 stems precisely from the possibility of gaining a tempo by at- tacking the knight with e5; without this White would have no advantage. In the very line Black used here to simplify the position (moves 6-9) the exchange of the f6-knight, the piece exposed to attack by e4-e5, is an essential part of Black's whole system; now, however, a knight appears again on f6 and with it the attack- ing motif e5. Even so, 15...Nf6 is not a mistake, for other moves are no better; the bad move has already been made - ll...Nd7?. It is true that the commentator Reinfeld Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 205 mentions 15...Rf6 in his book on Keres, continuing with 16 e5 Rh6? 17 Rxh6 gxh6, according to the pattern of the game Reshevsky-Fine, Hastings 1937; in that game, however, Black's knight was on c6 and his queen's rook on d8, so that his simplifying manoeuvre was in order. In this position, though, White would continue 18 d5 exd5 19 Jlxd5 Bxd5 20 Sxd5 <Nc5 21 Sd6, and the pawn on h6 begins to totter, since 21... ?g7 or 21...#te6 is answered by 22 Nh4 followed by

White's pawn centre, which has now been standing on the board for a number of moves, provides a typical illustration of the sensitivity of such formations. The crisis has been mounting from move to move, and the question now is whether the time is ripe for e5 or whether the position still needs reinforcing. White can- not wait much longer, since Black has a strong card to play on the queenside, namely ...b5 and ...a5, etc. Keres decides on reinforcement and in doing so makes a mistake. Correct was 18 e5 immediately; reinforcement would perhaps also have worked, but in the shape of 18 2d 3. After 18 e5 there are two main ways open to Black (lines 3 and 4 below): 1) 18...Bxf3?isbaddueto 19exf6, when the threat of20Wg5 wins a piece. 2) 18...£te8 is not good, e.g. 19 £}g5 h6 20 Nxe6 fxe6 21 Bxe6+ h7 22 d5 with a large advantage for White. 3) 18...£kl5 19 Ng5 h6 20 £te4 Nc3 (otherwise 21 Nd6) 21 Nxc3 (21 4£}f6-l- is probably insufficient in view of 21...sfchS) 21...Rxc3 22 2e3 Rb4 (if 22. ..Rc6, then 23 2g3) 23 2g3 <Nh8 24 Rg4 (24 Bc2 is also good) 24...Rf8 25 h4 2c7 26 f4 2cd7 (alternatives are 26...g6 27 h5 and 26...uLd5 27 f5) 27 f5 exf5 28 Rxf5 Zxd4 29 Sxd4 Sxd4 30 e6 with advantage to White.

4) 18...Nd7 19 4bf8 20 Se3 h6 21 £±3 and White has a promising at- tack.
18 Sd3 may be even stronger than the move which we have just examined, for
with his rook on d3 White threatens e5 immediately. Thus 18...b5 is answered by
19 e5 and if 19...Nd7, then 20 Ng5 21 Nxh7 Nxh7 22 Sh3', while if
19.. .Nd5, then 20 £}g5 h6 21 Ne4 followed by £}d6. After 18 2d3 Black would
have to play 18...h6, in which case 19 e5 £kl5 20 £k!2 gives White the advantage. All these continuations serve to illustrate my thesis on the critical nature of the full pawn centre; objectively, White's success was quite possible, but one impre- cise move (18 Se3?) and everything has evaporated, as we shall see.
18...b5!
Now e5 is no longer a threat (because of the double attack after 19 e5 £}d5 20 £}g5 h6) and so Black is able to make progress on the queenside.
19 Sdel a5 20 a4 b4? (D)
While this is positionally attractive, it allows the initiative to slip out of Black's hands, with the result that White comes back into the game with pros- pects which are worth a draw at least. Black should have played 2O...bxa4 21 .xa4 h6 when White's attack would have petered out: 22 e5? (22 g4 does not work because of 22,..Rf4 while if 22 h3, Black plays 22. ..Rc4 23 -Nb3 Rb4)

The immediate 21 e5 was not good, but it becomes favourable when pre- ceded by d5, for then the black knight's access to the d5-square is blocked, while Black can defend by 22 Le4! 23 Rxe4 Ng5 winning the exchange. Thus 21 fig3 is a better attacking attempt, with an unclear position. Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 207 the e-file and the a2-g8 diagonal are opened up.

If, instead of 25..." hS, Black plays 25... f8?, the situation turns in White's favour, e.g. 26 Rxh7!

Keres in his commentary continues 22...<Ne4! 23 e6 fxe6 24 2xe4 dxe4, but instead of going on with 25 jLxe6+!, he gives 25 Ng5?, which is weaker, since strangely enough the knight is better placed on f3 than g5 when Black's king Rf7+ < ?d6 29 Rf4+, whereupon Black need not settle for a draw by perpetual check with 29... e7, for he has instead 29... c5! 30 Scl <Nb6 31 Bxc8 e3! 32 Rxe3+ Rxe3 33 fxe3 Sxc8 34 Sxc8 .xc8 and his b-pawn costs the knight its head. An interesting reversal, with Black's king being saved by White's weak- ness on the back rank!

208 The Art of Attack in Chess
Keres did not notice the stronger move 23 £}d4! either during the game or in his commentary. Moving the knight to g5 keeps up the tempo of the attack but leads to no more than a skirmish on the focal-points h7 and f7, whereas moving it to d4, although less immediately forceful, opens up the more productive prospect of play against the focal-point g7, which is quite clearly the weakest point in Black's castled position. After 23 Nd4! Black is virtually obliged to continue 23...Nf8 24 Bc2 Ng6 25 .xg6 fxg6 when 26 £te6 wins the exchange, leaving him with insufficient com- pensation in return. Black's other continuations are weaker, e.g. 23...£jc5 (23...Nxe5? 24 Hxe5 Rxe5 does not work because of 25 xd8+) 24 f5 £te4 (if
24...Nxb3, White wins by 25 Rg5) 25 Hxe4 dxe4 26 Rg5 f8 (or 26...g6 27 e6

23... f8?
The move which loses the game. Correct was 23...h6 after which there is some doubt whether White can win. Keres carries on from 23...h6 with, among other continuations, 24 e6 hxg5 25 exf7+ ?xf7 26 Se7+ Ng8 27 h5 (if 27 Rxg5 or
27 Rd4, Black plays 27...Rc3, while 27 Sxg7+ Nxg7 28 xg5+ is insufficient
on account of 28...Nh8 when White has not got the time to play Se7) 27...Qc3? after which White obtains the advantage by 28 W7+ and 29 S7e3. However, in- stead of 27...Rc3?, Black can play 27...W4!, and after 28 fixd7 (alternatives are
28 g3 Rf5 and 28 Rg6 Rf6) 28...Sxd7 29 He8+ Rf8! 30 Sxf8+ <Nxf8 White not
only cannot win but even has the worst of it. The analysis can admittedly be
1 Black can unexpectedly turn the tables by 27...Rc3! 28 exf7+ &118, but White
can improve just before: 27 Ne7+ 'i'fS 28 Rf6 wins. Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 209 improved at the beginning, for 24 e6 can be replaced by 24 Nxf7 followed by 25 e6+, but it is no longer clear that White has the advantage. Finally, one might consider trying 24 f4 hxg5 25 Rxg5, but this loses its power after 25...Rb6 26 f5 Nf8, since Black can meet 27 f6 with 27...£je6, threatening, in addition to the queen, 28...2c3. All these variations arising from the position on the twenty-third move pro- vide instructive illustrations of how to spot the correct focal-point. The analysis of 23 £k!4! showed a typical attack on g7 ending in success for White, whereas in the continuation after 23 £}g5 ?! h6! a consistent attack could not be built up against any focal-point; White's operations instead took on the character of an at- tempt to destroy the black king's pawn cover, and as a result Black obtained open lines for his pieces as well as the time in which to organize his defences.

A desperate move, but Black no longer has an adequate defence. White could also have played 26 Rxd8+ now and won by virtue of being the exchange ahead, but he prefers to seek a mating attack, which brings even quicker success.

210 The Art of Attack in Chess
which the pawn drives off one of the opponent's pieces or creates a sharp threat of some kind. A typical example of the bayonet attack is the move g4, whereby White prepares the advance g5 and an attack on Black's knight at f6. The follow- ing examples show us some typical cases of the bayonet attack. The following position arose in Keres-Petrov, Estonia-Latvia Match, 1939 af- ter the moves 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 Nd2 dxe4 4 Nxe4 Nd7 5 Nf3 Be7 6 Bd3 £jgf6

14...h6, White would continue 15 h4, threatening g5 with even greater effect;
against 14. ..g6 he would not play 15 g5 immediately (since Black would reply
15.. .Nh5), but 15 h4 followed by h5. Finally, if 14...Bd6 then 15 f4 is very
strong. 15 g5! White does not worry about his rook, since if 15...JLxhl, he can dictate mat- ters with 16 gxf6 Bxf6 (or 16...gxf6 17 Rg4+ h8 18 Sgl Sg8 19 Nxf7#) 17 £}d7 Rc6 18 Nxf6+ gxf6 19 g4+ Nh8 20 Rh4 f5 21 Rf6+ Ng8 22 2g 1+ jLg2 23 .h6 and mates.

Keres does not carry his attack to its logical conclusion, i.e. by the sacrifice 17 .xh7+ xh7 18 Rh5+ g8 19 f4 threatening Sg4-h4. This attacking position is strong enough to guarantee victory, although it still demands precise play. In- stead of 19 f4, Horowitz gives the weaker continuation 19 Hg3 Rxe5 20 Sh3 and shows that 20...f6 then parries White's attack.

White now played 26 d6 and won in a few moves. By 26 £jh8 he could have forced Black to resign at once. This position is from the game Alekhine-Weenink, Prague 1931. In this case too White produces the bayonet in the form of: 1 g4! Alekhine, in My Best Games of Chess 1924-1937, says of this move: 'This lit- tle pawn threatens by its further advance to set on fire the black king's residence - and cannot possibly be stopped from that dark design.'

Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 213 The pawn avalanche The formation composed of two or three neighbouring pawns on the same rank is often called a 'phalanx' in chess literature, but when such a phalanx attacks it can also be suitably described as an 'avalanche' or 'roller'. An attack based on a pawn avalanche generally entails even more positional commitments than the bayonet attack, as it involves advancing two pawns instead of only one. On the other hand, the avalanche's power is also greater than that of the bayonet, for an avalanche drives all the enemy pieces before it and offers more attacking possi- bilities. When attacking by means of a pawn avalanche, it is usually important that one's opponent should be unable to retaliate in the centre or on the other wing. This is, admittedly, a general condition for any kind of attack on the castled king, but in the case of an attack using pawns it applies even more strictly, since one is more restricted positionally and the actual process of advancing pawns is slower than play with pieces, with the result that one's opponent has greater opportuni- ties for counterplay. The next example will show us a case where the conditions for an attack using the avalanche are favourable. This position is from the game Schlechter-Tarrasch, Monte Carlo 1903. It is White's move. 1 g4 The use of the avalanche attack is well justified in this position. Black has no counterplay worth speaking of either on the queenside or in the centre, so that the risk White accepts in being committed to deciding the game on the kingside is not great. Moreover, White already has a pawn at f5, which is in fact in his way at the moment. When the g-pawn moves up to its aid within just two moves, there is
214 The Art of Attack in Chess
considerable prospect of the position's being loosened up a little and that the f- pawn will acquire a dynamic potential, l... c5 2 Ji.bl a5 3 Nhl -£fd7 4 g5 f6?I would probably have been better. Moves which weaken the position, such as ...f6, should not be resorted to unless absolutely necessary. After 4...W8

5 h4 Bf8?
Certainly weaker than 5...Nf8; on his next move Black puts the bishop back on e7 and so loses two tempi. However, even after 5... f8 White's attack would be overwhelming.
6 Sgl i.e7 (D)
Tarrasch was not a master who would lightly agree to the loss of a tempo, but in this case he was clearly convinced that his original plan had no prospects. This is evident from White's threat (Black's bishop is still on f8) 7 Rg4 (not 7 Rh5 followed by 8 g6? because of 8...h6, and Black would be saved by the blocked position ) 7... h8 8 .xc5 dxc5 9 Ne4, when Black's defences give way under the pressure against the squares f6 and d6.
7 Rh5 8 Sg3 2a8
There are no useful moves that Black can make in his cramped position. After, for example, 8.., cd7 9 Scgl Sc8 10 Ne4 he finds himself in a sad state, with- out a satisfactory defence against the threat of 11 gxf6 Bxf6 12 Rh6.

The first is the creation of the advancing pawn avalanche, the second consists of the deployment of White's pieces, and the third is the actual execution or breakthrough. The avalanche alone cannot, as a rule, be decisive, and its greatest enemy is the danger of blockade. Combating this danger depends for the most part on piece play, and this takes two main forms: allowing the position to be blocked and then breaking it up by sacrificing a piece; or first sacrificing the piece and then pushing forward with the pawn avalanche without any fear of its being blocked. In the following games we shall see these methods being applied; de- stroying the enemy pawn cover is essentially the main combinative element.

8 cxd5 exd5 9 Bd3 Bb7 10 O-O-O c5 11 h4 c4? (D) Logically, Black must attack on the queenside, but his plan is too slow. Before he can set up the avalanche formation with pawns on c4 and b4, White will have a flourishing attack since his pieces are more active than Black's. Correct was 1 l...cxd4 in preparation for ...a6, ...b5 and ...Sc8; that would have constituted a more powerful threat.
216 The Art of Attack in Chess
12 Nf5 Se8
Kmoch, in his fine book on Rubinstein, thinks that even here ...a6 and ...b5 would have been better, but the black pawn can hardly reach b4, since after
12...a6 13 g4 there is an immediate threat of Bxf6 followed by g5, picking up the
booty on h7. If, for example, Black plays 13...g6 then 14 Bxd7 followed at once by Bh6 gives White a strong initiative. The text move prepares the way for ...£tf8, so White immediately takes the knight on f6 to prevent this.
13 Jlxf6 Nxf6 14 g4!
Thus a 'small avalanche' is formed on the fourth rank. Soon it will become 'great' on the fifth, and finally 'terrible' when it reaches the sixth en masse.
14...Nd6 15 g5 Ne4 16 h5
The fifth rank has been reached without Black having moved an inch on the queenside. If Black now plays 16...Nxg5, there follows 17 Nxg5 Rxg5 18 Bxh7+ <Nf8 19 h6! gxh6 20 Sdgl, etc.
16...Re7 17 Sdgl a6 (D)
Black reckons that nothing is threatened and devotes a tempo to his slow coun- terattack on the queenside. Admittedly, White would get nowhere by moving his pawns at this point: if 18 h6, the position is blocked by 18...g6; while if 18 g6, then 18...fxg6 followed by ...h6. However, White has another device, namely the sacrifice of his bishop, which enables the pawns to go ahead happily and without any fear of being blocked.

21 h6 (D)
The avalanche has come down on Black's pawns, which can no longer offer any help by blocking the position. Carried away by the spectacle on the board, Kmoch adds two exclamation marks, which I am unable to do, since I can see an- other continuation which is simpler, stronger, and even more 'Rubinstein-like' than h6, in that it links the combination with a positional breakthrough in the cen- tre: 21 £}g5 ! Bd5 (the f-pawn must not be moved because of 22 Rxc4+) 22 gxf7+ jlxf7 23 f3! Bd5 (otherwise fxe4 and e5) 24 h6 5ac8 (or 24...g6 25 Sh4) 25 fxe4 Bxe4 26 h7+ >h8 27 Rxe4! xg5 28 Rxe8+ and White wins1.

This makes White's task easier, though the game would not have been saved by the more stubborn move 21...fxg6. 21...exf3 would have been even weaker, e.g. 22 gxf7+ Rxf7 23 hxg7 with threats against h8 and h7. After 21...fxg6 Kmoch shows that 22 2xg6? is weak (because of 22...exf3, and Black gains too much material in return for his queen). He gives the follow- ing line as good for White: 22 Nh4 g5 23 £}g6 Rf6 24 h7+ <Nf7 25 h8W Sxh8 26 Nxh8+. However, the situation is somewhat doubtful after 26...<Ne7, for while

confusion by 23...c3, when White's plan of fxe4 followed by e5 starts to look too slow.

Here it is Black who is playing the Queen's Gambit, while White is building up his position according to the pattern which Black uses in the Semi-Slav De- fence, to which the move Bf4 is a useful addition. This is an example of a so- called inverted opening, in which White plays Black's system with a tempo in hand. 5 i.d3 2>c6 6 Nd2 Jle7?! Black has obviously lost his bearings and is not aware that he is 'really White'; passive moves of this type do not fit in with the active position of his central pawns.

He even surrenders control of the important e4 and e5 squares to White, and as a result suddenly comes up against the storm of an at- tack on his castled king. The correct course was 8...cxd4 9 exd4 xe5 10 dxe5 Nd7 11 Qh5 f5 ! when Black can meet 12 f3 by 12.,.Rc7 and 12 g4 by 12...#te5

9 g4! (D) Throughout the opening stage of the game the conditions required to justify a 'bayonet attack' have been gradually accumulating. One group of these condi- tions has already been noted in the shape of Black's inferior moves and his lack of concern to control at least one of the important squares e5 and e4. The other group can be revealed by an analysis of the structure of White's position. This is clearly distinguished by good piece play together with a modest but sound pawn formation in the centre. Indeed, its essence lies in the very soundness of the for- mation c3, d4, and e3, with the strong protection which it gives to the square d4. If this solidity in the centre did not exist, Black would be able at the last moment to organize a counterattack in the centre as an answer to White's attack on his castled king. His security against such a central counterattack - generally the main weapon in an active defence against an attack on the castled king - gives White great free- dom in his attack on the castled position and is basically the main justification for the move 9 g4 !.

Concluding remarks Before we conclude this discussion of the role of the pawns in the attack on the castled king, we must warn the reader of the immense diversity of practical cases which resist all attempts to embrace them within a set of rules. Our acquaintance with certain rules should not lead us to handle the game in a routine fashion; the particular characteristics of every position must always be thoroughly examined from one move to the next. In connection with pawn attacks, there are two cases worth mentioning which often arise in practice. In one case the position requires a rigid, positional use of the pawns in attack, and in the other the position is not at all suitable for the co- operation of the pawns and consequently the attack is better carried out by the pieces alone. For these two cases some suitable examples will now be given. This position is from the game Steinitz-Marco, Nuremberg 1896. White is the more aggressively placed but Black's position is fairly solid, especially in the centre, where White lacks a pawn base. The diagonal a2-g8 may become danger- ous for Black, but it is not so yet, for if jtc4+, Black can play ..Be6. Nor are the conditions favourable for an attack with the 'bayonet' or 'avalanche' here; there- fore, another way has to be found to strengthen White's position, one which is es- sentially of a purely positional nature. Steinitz finds it: he advances his f-pawn to
224 The Art of Attack in Chess
f5, where it restricts Black; the fact that this leads to a blocked position is a good thing, since Black's f-pawn can then be fixed at f6 and subsequently 'rolled up' by g4 and g5. This is a clear positional plan, which leads to the destruction of Black's pawn chain and thence to a real attack on his castled king. There is no bayonet or avalanche here, though pawn moves are still the decisive means of at- tack. 1 f4! Nd7 Black wants to get his bishop to c6, since it cannot settle on the diagonal a2-g8 because of f5. If 1...Bg4, then 2 Sd2 followed by h3 is strong, while 1...g6 would be a voluntary weakening of the castled position.

2xh7 13 Rxf6+ Sg7 14 Sxe5 1-0 As our second concluding remark we cited the case where the player has a choice between attacking with his pawns and attacking with his pieces. Every practical player will have experienced the difficulty of such a choice, and an im- mense amount of time has been consumed in master chess on such decisions. The trouble is that it is difficult to set up any general rule, since everything de- pends on the particular characteristics of the situation concerned. Before discuss- ing this question any further, let us take an example, and then, by varying the pawn structure, try to penetrate to the heart of the problem. Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 225 It will be easy for the reader to see that this position has arisen as the direct re- sult of a classic bishop sacrifice. It is clear that White must aim to get a rook on to the h-file, and the only question is how to do it. One way would be f4 and then Sf3-h3, and the other Sel-e3-h3. The first is faulty and allows Black to draw, while the second is correct and leads to a win for White. The position is such that only the pieces can cope with the task; the pawns should stay at home to avoid getting in the way. The following variations prove this assertion. 1) 1 f4?Rd7 Of course, Black must on no account play l...Se7?, since 2 Sf3 would result in the loss of his rook.
2 Rh5+ Ng8 3 Sf3
White has nothing better. After 3 g4 g6 4 Rh3 4jh7 5 <£jf3 £k6 6 £}h4 £te7 White is still unable to play f5 as planned, while Black obtains counterplay by ...c5, etc. Also good for Black is 3 f5 exf5 4 Sxf5 Rxf5 5 Rxe8 £jc6.

This forces a draw. It is of no importance to our thesis whether Black can now play for a win, e.g. by 4...Rg7 followed by ...£k6 and ... e7 or ...£k!8, etc. 5Sh3 White cannot avoid the exchange of knights; if 5 <Nh3, Black gets time to bring out his queen's knight and set up a complete defence.

Black is tied up on the kingside, and White's best plan consists of trebling on the h-file. White carries out the necessary regrouping in such a way that not only is Black's bishop prevented from penetrating but also his rook's invasion along

thesis is basically correct, because the stronger move 4...Rg7 casts doubt on White's attack.

18...Sec8 19 Sh6 Nd3 20 Rh4 SC1+ 21 *f2 Sfl+ 22 <Ng3 and Black cannot
prevent mate by Sh8+. In comparing these two variations, the reader cannot but recognize the essen- tial feature of the position that condemns 1 f4? to failure but brings victory to the attack carried out by the pieces. The move f4 obstructs both the diagonal for the bishop on cl and the f-file for the rooks, and so limits the possibilities of action along the very two lines on which Black is weak. His weakness on the f-file can be seen at a glance, and it is not difficult to deduce (on examining the diagrammed position) that he will also be weak on the dark squares, since he will be unable to postpone ...g6 for long. After f4 White is left with only his domination of the h- file, whereas if he does not play it, he also has the f-file and a line of action for his bishop, and it is the combination of all these factors that gives him victory. We shall now vary the position of the pawns in front of White's king in the above diagram, so as to train our eyes to be keener in spotting the various finesses contained in this kind of position. First let us suppose that White's f-pawn is already on f4 (instead of f2) and that it is White to move. Now, of course, 1 Sf3 will win at once, but if this possi- bility is excluded, e.g. by White's having his h-pawn on h3, what then? Even so, White wins - by 1 f5! exf5 (otherwise f6 is decisive) 2 Sxf5, and Black has no answer to the two threats of 3 Sf4 and 3 h5+ gS followed by either 4 £}f7 or
228 The Art of Attack in Chess
4 Sxf8+ Nxf8 5 Rh8+ and the queen mates on g7. If, for example, 2...Rd7, then
3 Rxf8+, while if 2...g6, then 3 Sf4 Rxg5 4 Rxe8.
The pawn on f4 wins in this case precisely because it disappears and in doing so immediately opens up the f-file with disastrous consequences for Black. Let us now try a variation with the h-pawn at h4 (rather than h2) (D). This position is fairly promising; White has his f-file and the bishop's diago- nal is free as in variation '2', but the h-file has to be opened up by advancing the h-pawn. All White has to do is induce ...g6, after which the task of line opening is made easier and a blocked position averted. White's best is 1 2el Rd7 2 Rh5+ g8 3 Se3 (forcing ...g6, since it threatens Sf3 and Sxf8+; thus if 3...Nc6 4 Sf3 £ki8, then 5 2xf8+ xfS 6 Rh8+ 7 Rxg7+ f7 8 xf7 Sg8 9 h7 and White wins) 3...g6 4 Bg4 Nh7 5 h3, when he has good prospects. If White's h-pawn is on h3, 1 h4 comes into consideration, with the idea of reaching a similar system to the one above, but with a tempo less. With White's g-pawn on g3 (rather than g2) the problem is more difficult, since the pawn is only in the way there. Perhaps White ought to give perpetual check at once. If 1 Sei, Black plays l...£k:6, after which 2Se3 does not work be- cause of 2...Rxg5, while after 2 g4 Rd7 3 Rh5+ sfcgS 4 Se3 g6 5 Rh4 Rg7 Black's defences are already in quite good shape. Things are different with the g-pawn at g4 (which is, admittedly, impossible after the classic bishop sacrifice, but that does not matter here) (D). In this case the third rank is clear for the rook, and in addition the pawn at g4 also lends force to the thrust f5. As well as the method starting with 1 Sei (on the pattern of variation '2'), still more successful here is 1 f4 (threatening Sf3) l...Rd7 2 Rh5+ g8 3 f5 and White must win. Here, finally, we have a case Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 229 where an attack using the pawns is correct. One tiny change in the position and already the choice between attacking with pieces or with pawns has swung in fa- vour of the pawns. Such is the sensitivity of the attack on the castled king, and it is now clear how difficult it is to create any more definite rule on this point! Still, I shall attempt to conclude the chapter with a series of tips - which will naturally apply only generally. Ten Practical Tips 1) It is an essential condition for any attack on the castled king that the oppo- nent should not be able to counterattack in the centre or on the other side of the board, or rather that his counterattack should not be dangerous and not develop fully before the attack on the castled king. An attack using pawns usually pro- gresses more slowly than one with pieces, since it often contains moves without any immediate threat. So, before embarking on a pawn attack, one should beware particularly of the possibility of a counterattack by one's opponent. 2) A central pawn blockade prevents or limits counterattacks and so makes a pawn attack on the castled king easier. 3) One should always examine whether a promising attack can be made by the pieces alone, and if it can, the pawns should be left 'at home'. 4) As a rule, it is difficult for pawn assaults to succeed against unweakened castled positions, since the possibilities of blockade are very great. A prelimi- nary action by the pieces is necessary to produce a weakening of the castled posi- tion or to remove the possibility of a later blockade when the pawns advance. 5) Every blockade in the castling area radically changes the character of the position, for it affects the activity of individual pieces and the whole nature of the play which follows.
230 The Art of Attack in Chess
6) One's own pawns usually constitute a great obstacle to one's rooks; if a po- sition is characterized by the opponent's weakness on the files, the rooks are im- portant pieces and pawns have no business on these files, except when their advance actually helps to clear a file. Rooks can be particularly usefully de- ployed on the third rank, if it is clear of pawns (an example of this was provided by the variations arising from the diagram on p.224). 7) A pawn storm generally increases the risk of an inferior endgame. If other elements in the position are also weighted against an endgame, the added risk en- tailed in an attack on the castled king is acceptable. However, if the player has the necessary conditions for a good endgame, he must make certain that his assault with the pawns will be successful, for otherwise it represents a real risk. 8) A player who already has an advanced pawn facing his opponent's castled position but which somehow gets in his way (e.g. a pawn on f5) must contem- plate advancing the adjacent pawn, so that the lone pawn can be made an active component of an avalanche. Every advanced pawn presents a pretext for an ava- lanche and draws its neighbour towards it. This is least so in the case of an ad- vanced h-pawn and most so if the pawn is on f5 . 9) Attacks on the castled king in general, and those using pawns in particular, should always be judged on the basis of an assessment of the position as a whole. The placing of the pieces, the situation in the centre and on the other side of the board, positional strengths and weaknesses, how far the position is blocked, the prospects for the endgame - all these come into the reckoning which an experi- enced player must make before deciding to use his pawns in an attack on the cas- tled king. 10) Cautious before opening his attack, the player must be incisive, consis- tent, and merciless once he has set out on his attacking course. For an insufficiently justified attack is not helped by belated doubts, but only by resourcefulness in the struggle to provide one's opponent with the most difficult task possible.
9 The attack on the fianchettoed
and queenside castling positions Up till now we have, on the whole, based our examination of the various aspects of attacking play on the ordinary kingside castling position. The fianchettoed and queenside castling positions present certain special characteristics, which affect the particular forms of attack used against these types of position. The attack on the fianchettoed king position The term 'fianchetto' (from the Italian, meaning Tittle flank') denotes a bishop being developed on the flank (on g2, b2, g7 or b7), and if a player castles behind such a fianchetto formation, we talk of a fianchettoed king position. Castled positions of this kind have their own particular good and bad sides; these will be examined on the basis of Black's kingside fianchetto position, which occurs in the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian, and the King's Indian and Griinfeld defences. The good aspect of the position is, above all, its considerable capacity to resist attack along the diagonal bl-h7, thanks to the pawn formation, f7, g6, and h7; nor are the squares f6 and h6 too weak, for they are covered by the bishop on g7. The bishop is also well concealed against attacks and possibilities of exchange, while in many cases the defence is assisted by its ability to cover not only the squares f6 and h6 but also the possible mating square h8. Finally, the fianchettoed position is also suited for those operations in which the g-pawn disappears, as in the fol- lowing well-known manoeuvre: Black plays ...f5, and then, on White's reply exf5 he coolly continues ...gxf5, with the aim of strengthening his position in the centre. Without the bishop on g7 such play would be risky because of the open- ing of the g-file, but it often succeeds with the fianchettoed bishop, since the bishop defends Black's king on the g-file about as well as a pawn does. The weak aspect of the fianchettoed position lies in the fact that the position of the g-pawn at g6 simplifies the attacker's task in opening up the h-file by the ad- vance of his h-pawn; there is also a danger that the fianchettoed bishop may be exchanged either for its opposite number or some other enemy unit. Without the
232 The Art of Attack in Chess
bishop the castled position becomes weak and vulnerable and the squares previ- ously covered by the bishop form a typically weak network. Naturally, an attack on the fianchettoed king position is generally directed against these weak spots, and consequently, the assault by the h-pawn and ac- tions aimed at the exchange of the fianchettoed bishop are the principal weapons in the attack against such a position. First, we shall give simple examples of two typical operations: namely, the elimination of the fianchettoed bishop and the breaking up of the pawn structure in front of it. The first position is from the game Richter-Abramavicius, Hamburg 1930. It is White's move, and he sacrifices both his rooks for the fianchettoed bishop in order to be able to conclude the game by an attack on the weakened dark-square network.

The following position occurred in the game Szilagyi-Szabo, Budapest 1946.

For White loses either his rook or his queen. Where there is a fianchettoed king position there is naturally no opportunity to sacrifice the bishop on h7; moreover, many other forms of sacrifice, typical enough in the case of normal castling, are out of the question against the specific structure of the fianchetto. A form of sacrifice which can be designated as char- acteristic in the case of a fianchettoed king position is that of the knight on f5. An example of such a sacrifice is provided by the next diagram. This position arose in the game Alexander-Pachman, Hil versum 1947. Against Black's fianchettoed king position White has a knight aggressively placed at g5, a 'little avalanche' of pawns on g4 and h4, a rook on gl and his queen covering some useful squares. Nevertheless, to 'unlock' Black's solid position a sacrifice is necessary.
234 The Art of Attack in Chess
Given the favourable supporting conditions, this typical 'anti-fianchetto' sac- rifice is absolutely correct. From f5 the knight controls the squares g7 and h6 and has the intention, above all else, of eliminating the fianchettoed bishop. If Black does not accept the sacrifice but plays, for example, l...Sae8, White continues 2 Nxg7 and then 3 f4 with good prospects, while if 1 Bf6, then 2 Nh6. The ac- ceptance of the sacrifice leads at once to a critical situation for Black as the reply gxf5 leads to a very dangerous attack, while the f5-square is well covered, and consequently there is no danger of Black making a counter-sacrifice on it. I...gxf5 2 gxf5 In positions of a similar nature one is often faced with the question whether it is better to take on f5 with the g-pawn or the e-pawn. The answer depends on the various characteristics of the position; one takes with the g-pawn, if the opening of the g-file or the diagonal dl-h5 brings with it a decisive advantage, while in playing exf5 one takes into account other possible advantages, namely, freeing the square e4 (on which a knight, for example, can take up a strong position) or opening the bl-h7 diagonal for the bishop, or perhaps to keep in reserve the con- tinuation g5. In this particular case the g-pawn is obviously indicated, since there is an immediate threat of Rh5.

The importance of removing the fianchettoed bishop at the correct moment in this kind of attack is shown by the next position, one which I reached in an analy- sis of the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian in my book, Contemporary Opening Theory. In my book I examined 1 Rh4, following it up by l...bxc3 2 Rh8+ Bxh8 3 Sxh8+ *g7 4Slh7#. However, fianchettoed king positions of this kind (with the defensive bishop, the knight on f6, and a pawn on e7) offer a great deal of resistance. Consequently, in spite of the thunder on the h-file, Black can answer 1 Rh4 with ! 2 Bxg7 bxa3! 3 Rg5 (if 3 gxh5, then 3...Nxg7, while if 3 iLd4, then 3...axb2+ 4 bl Ra5) 3...axb2+ 4 &bl <£'xg7 l , and now if 5 2xh5, then 5...jLa2+ 6 Nxa2 blW+, while if 5 gxh5, then 5... xc3 is in Black's favour. Because of this I have had to amend my original analysis of the diagrammed position and apply more drastic measures to eliminate the fianchettoed bishop. In this line 4...Rxc3! is immediately decisive, since 5 Bxc3 Jla2+ leads to mate.

The attack on the queenside castled position Before discussing the attack on the queenside castled position, one should first of all examine the differences between this type of castling and kingside castling. Some writers in the past have supposed that the difference is considerable and that castling long 'is much weaker than castling short'; this is a great exaggera- tion. The castled position after long or queenside castling differs from the short castled position only in this respect, that the positions of the king and rook are both a square nearer the centre of the board. This can be useful for the rook, but it usually presents difficulties to the king, which is safer on gl than cl. Reckoning The attack on the fianchettoed and queenside castling positions 237 in terms of tempi, the following picture sums up the differences: the position on the queenside which would correspond symmetrically to the one given by short castling (king on gl and rook on fl) is king on bl and rook on cl, and to reach such a position after castling long would require two tempi. But let us now apply a different method of calculation: the player has castled on the kingside and then spends one tempo on the move Se 1. The corresponding position to this on the queenside would be king on bl and rook on dl, and for this only one move is needed after castling long. The conclusion to be drawn from this is simple - whenever the rook is well placed on the d-file, castling long is fundamentally as good as castling short; if the rook is in fact needed on the c-file it is weaker by two tempi, while if the rook is needed on a third square it is weaker by only one tempo. In practice castling queenside usually occurs when the rook is well placed on the d-file, and indeed the need for it to be placed there is often the prime reason for adopting long castling. When reckoned in these terms, the practical differ- ence between long and short castling disappears or becomes insignificant. There is yet another difference between the two forms of castling, but it is secondary and concerns the activity of the queen. However, here too the advantages and dis- advantages tend to cancel each other out. Thus one can say that castling on the queenside is almost equal in status to castling on the kingside in general terms of tempo and security. If there are still players who doubt the security of castling on the queenside, it might be suggested that their reasons for this are probably of a subjective, rather than an objective, nature. That is to say, many players remem- ber some bad experiences which they have had with castling long and are not aware of a very common mistake, one which is repeated over and over again: they accept the tempo gained on the d-file by castling long as a gift, without wanting to pay the price for it; they neglect the consolidating move bl, and then, when their opponent suddenly sweeps down, it is already too late and there is no time left. The results, of course, are blamed on queenside castling. In master chess castling on the kingside predominates, but this is not the result of some fundamental weakness of castling long; the reasons are of another, struc- tural, kind. Castling on the queenside requires the development of three pieces, while in the case of castling short only two need be moved to clear the back rank. Another important point is that in order to castle on the queenside the queen has to be moved first, and the best moment for doing this in many openings occurs rather later, as moving the queen at an early stage of the game can turn out to be a loss of a tempo. This is an important reason for the comparative rarity of castling on the queenside, and the trend is given further impetus by the structure of mod- ern openings, the majority of which are directed towards a struggle over the
238 The Art of Attack in Chess
central squares. In this the c-pawn plays an important part both in covering the d-pawn and in effecting a lateral attack; this delays the queen' s development on the one hand, and also slightly weakens the queenside on the other, consequently reducing the circumstances which favour castling long. There are quite a few situations in the openings when castling on the queen- side can be usefully applied, and in some cases one can say that it in fact repre- sents the best solution to the basic problem of building up the position. We shall now list the main factors which would usually endorse the choice of long castling in a game: 1 ) The pawn position on the kingside has already been weakened, while that on the queenside is sound; this may incline the player towards castling long. (If castling on the kingside is quite impossible or is obstructed, then naturally there is no choice at all.) 2) The opponent's forces (pieces or pawns, or both) are favourably placed for an attack on the short castled position, but unfavourably for one on the long cas- tled position. 3) The kingside is not sufficiently developed, while on the queenside the back rank is already clear. If this is the case when the situation demands castling as soon as possible, then castling takes place on the queenside. 4) One's opponent has castled on the kingside, and the weaknesses in his cas- tled position can only be properly exploited by means of an assault by one or more pawns. If in such a case castling on the queenside is readily available and there are no other factors militating against it, one castles long rather than short. An assault by the h-pawn with the aim of opening up the h-file for the rook is of- ten the answer to a fianchettoed king position, and in this case too castling on the queenside is indicated. 5) A rapid deployment of the rook on the d-file gains an important tempo or some other advantage, and in such a case castling long can afford an excellent so- lution. The factors listed here are only intended as general hints for the player, and the particular characteristics of the actual position should be surveyed each time one makes a choice between castling moves. Black, particularly, should be careful if he intends to castle on the queenside, since experience has shown that the neces- sary conditions for long castling more often arise for White than for Black. When Black's long castling coincides with short castling by White one gets a case of opposite-side castled positions; this leads to an intensification of the game, which naturally favours the better developed side, and this in the majority of cases is White. The attack on the fianchettoed and queenside castling positions 239 However, caution over deciding to castle on the queenside should not be over- done, since many cases arise where castling long is indicated but where the player does not do so because a prejudice about its risk deters him. Here is an ex- ample of unprejudiced castling on the queenside from the game Keres-Reshev- sky, World Championship Tournament, The Hague/Moscow 1948: Black is to move; his position is apparently inferior, since he is threatened not only by Nxd5 but also Nxb5. Besides this, he has not yet castled, so that he is faced with a double task: to discover a reply to White's threats and also make the time to castle. Here is how Reshevsky solved the problem: L..g5 2 Ng3 Rb7! Black has already shown by 1 ...g5 that he does not intend to castle on the kingside, and now he gives up his pawn on d5 in order to use castling long to ob- tain an important tempo and gain control over the central squares d4 and d5 (2... e7 would be weak because of 3 xb5). 3 xd5 O-O-O! Black's castling on the queenside in the Open Variation of the Ruy Lopez (which was how this game began) qualifies as a curiosity, and many masters shook their heads when they saw what Reshevsky had done. In this case it was correct to overcome the prejudice about the unsuitability of castling long in the Ruy Lopez, for here this very move provides a happy solution to the problem: it gives Black the time he needs and consolidates his king position better than short castling would. It should also be noticed that the weaknesses at a6 and b5 are not particularly marked, since White does not possess the move a4 which would properly probe them. Another point is that castling long has lent power to Black's g-pawn; its advance to g4 is important in the struggle for the square d4.
240 The Art of Attack in Chess
The knight here is 'attacking empty squares,' but 4 would have been no better. The most important point is that White cannot play 4 c4 to support the knight on d5, since it would be answered by 4...g4 5 Nh4 (or 5 £tel £ki4 6 Rd3 .f5) 5...Nd4 6 Rd3, after which either 6...c6 or 6..Bxd5 is in Black's favour.

The rest of the game is not of interest to us here; Black's active piece play serves as sufficient compensation for the pawn, there is no question of his castled position being in danger, and it is really White who is in difficulties. In the end White did in fact lose the game after making some rather weak moves. Our further consideration of the attack on the long castled position will be confined to those features which are specific to queenside castling. This means, in the main, that we need only consider positions where the king is still on cl, since if it has already retired to bl a position has arisen which corresponds sym- metrically to that after castling kingside. This position is taken from the game Rabinovich-Romanovsky, Moscow
1925. Black, to move, has no way of preventing exf6 and in desperation plays for
a counterattack on the enemy king based on the pattern of Boden's Mate (see p.76).
1...1.a3! 2 exf6?
White, who has in fact the better of the game, here takes the wrong path and spends a tempo on 'burying the corpse on f6' instead of using it to consolidate his threatened king position, e.g. 2 Sxd3! Sxd3 3 bl ! and if 3...Rc5, then 4 Na4 and finally 5 exf6, etc.
2...Rc5 3 Bd2?
The attack on the fianchettoed and queenside castling positions 24 1 After this second mistake Black has a winning position. White should have played 3 Sxd3 Hxd3 4 <£bl! and if 4... .xb2, then 5 Na4, or if 4...fixc3, then 5 bxc31, when Black can probably draw but cannot achieve more.
3...Ng6! (D)
The precious bishop retires and thus stops White playing £tel followed by Nc2 with gain of tempo. 4Wa4 While this does not give his opponent much trouble, White's other moves are also of little use. The situation is now typical of attacks on the queenside castling position and a similar arrangement of pieces often arises in practice. So let us look at the whole repertoire of combinations at Black's disposal which lead to mate. First, it is clear that White could not play 4 bxa3, because of 4...Rxa3#, with the typical pattern of Boden's Mate. Next, it can be seen that if 4 Rf4, Black has
4.. .5ac8, threatening 5...Rxc3+ and mate, thanks to the formidable effect of
Black's bishops. It is true that White could meet 4...Sac8 with 5 Re5, but then
5.. .Rb4 would be decisive. There still remain some other defences, which are
worth setting out: 1) 4 Sdel Sxd2! (if 4...Sac8, White would reply 5 dl 1) 5 'Nxd2 (5 Nxd2 is also inadequate, e.g. 5...Rxc3+ 6 &dl Rc2-F2 7 Ne2 Rd3+ 8 dl 2c8 9 Se4 Jlb4 10 Sxb4 Scl+ 11 &xcl Rc2#) 5...Sd8+ 6 <Ne2 Nd3+ 7 <Ndl Ne4+! 8 >e2 (or 8 £kl2 Nxd2+ 9 Nxd2 Rd4+ and mates) 8...Rc4+ 9 <Ne3 Sd3+ and Black mates. 1 4...fiac8 also wins as after 5 S dl Bxb2 White is defenceless.
2 Black can mate in two by 6... .c2+.

has to play very precisely to retain an advantage: 5...b4 6 Rc7 7 Sxd8+ fixd8 8 d4 Eb8 ! 9 bxa3 bxc3 10 Nb5 Rc6 11 a4 a6 12 Rc3 Rxg2 13 fidl axb5 and White's king remains extremely exposed. The attack on the fianchettoed and queenside castling positions 243 The following game serves as a demonstration both of how castling queenside forms part of a plan of development and of how an attack can be carried out against such a position. Lasker - Marshall St. Petersburg Final, 1914 Petroff Defence
1 e4 e5 2 Stf3 3 Nxe5 d6 4 Nf3 Nxe4 5 Re2
Morphy's old move; it is sound enough, though it gives White no more than a microscopic advantage. Correct, of course, is 7... xe2+ 8 .xe2 $Lel or 7... bd7. Avoiding the ex- change of queens favours White, whose position is the better developed. One might say that Lasker knew which opponents it paid to play drawing variations against!
8 c3 &bd7 9 O-O-O
Castling on the queenside is completely justified in this position, where the bishop is hemmed in at fl. Moreover, on the d-file the rook supports the d-pawn in moving to d4 and then threatening to advance to d5.
9...h6 10 Nh4 g5 11 Ng3 2>h5 12 d4 £txg3 13 hxg3 g4 14 Nh4!?
A risky and adventurous move, typical of Lasker's play in the middlegame. The knight clearly has no good way of getting away from the h4-square, a cir- cumstance which could have helped Black to equalize. Better would have been
14 Nd2.
14...d5?
A decisive mistake. Black should have played 14...£}b6! and if 15 d5 then
15..Bd7. Against other attempts by White, the reply ...Rg5 plays an important
part. However, moves like 14...Nb6! were not to Marshall's taste. What he really enjoyed was setting a trap for his opponent!
15 Rb5! O-O-O (D)
Castling is forced, since 15...Rb4 comes to grief after 16 xd5 Rxb5 17 £}xc7+. It was probably because of this trap that Marshall played 14. ,.d5?, but Lasker naturally refuses to be diverted by the d-pawn and calmly plays for an at- tack on the castled position with 16 Ra5 . Vukovic doesn't actually say what the trap is - the point is that after 15...O-O-O,
16 Nxd5 fails to 16...Bxd5 17 Rxd5 Rg5+ 18 Rxg5 hxg5 and the knight is
lost. The Art of Attack in Chess Perhaps Lasker even played 14 Nh4!? exactly because he knew Marshall would be tempted to set a trap and thereby get himself ensnared in the attack on the castled king which now follows.

Clearly, 16... b8 fails against 17 Nb5. 17 jlxa6! A correct bishop sacrifice.
17...bxa6 18 Rxa6+ Nb8 19 Nb5 <?)b6 (D)
Now that the black king has moved from c8 to b8, the distinctive character of the queenside castling position no longer exists and the situation is merely a rep- lica of a type of attack used against the short castled position. An important advantage for the attacker in this position is his ability to bring a rook into action quickly (Sd3-b3), since without this Black could defend himself by ...£k8 and then ...,Nd7. The attack on the fianchettoed and queenside castling positions 245
20 Sd3 Rg5+
This move simplifies White's task somewhat. However, Black could not have saved himself even by 2O...Nc4 which contains the transparent trap 21 Sb3? Rg5+ 22 bl £\12+. At the time Lasker had reckoned on defeating 2O...Nc4 in the following manner (and this has found its way into the commentaries): 21 Sei? (in order to be able to meet 21...Rg5+ with 22 Se3) 21...Sd6 22 Nxd6 Rxd6 23 2b3+ Nb6 24 a4 Nc8 25 Se8 Rd7 26 b5 Rxb5 27 Sxb5 Nb7? 28 a5 Bd7 29 Sxf8 Sxf8 30 Sb4 and White goes on to capture the knight, after which he is a pawn up in the ending. Let us disregard any doubts about this ending, for Black has a stronger continuation than 27. .. b7, namely 27...Jlg7 28 Sxh8 .xh8; then White must play 29 a5 (otherwise the knight remains alive on b6) whereupon the main line runs 29.. Bxd4 30 axb6 c6 31 Sb3 Jlxf2 32 b7 (if White allows ...<Bb7, then the position is still more favourable for Black)
32 c4 35 Sa3 Jtd4, and it is clearly White rather than
Black who has to struggle for a draw. It is interesting to see how the original char- acteristic of the position (the inability of the knight on h4 to move) again emerges as the decisive factor as soon as the attack on the castled position peters out. Not even the best players are immune from such misfortunes! This game, which was the decisive one in Lasker's victory at St. Petersburg, cannot be left to go on sleeping in the archives of chess history with an inaccurate commentary. Good games should not be allowed to go to their rest without good annotations as their lullabies! Therefore, we must show how in fact White does win after 2O...Nc4 (D). So that there will be no doubt about it, we shall supply two winning moves, both of them instructive as far as carrying out an attack in this kind of position is concerned.
246 The Art of Attack in Chess
1) 21 a4! c6(Bf21...Sd6 22Nxd6Wxd6 23Sb3+Nb6, White wins easily by 24 a5) 22 Sb3 ! (not 22 Rxc6? because of 22...Rb7, forcing the exchange of queens and thus bringing the attack to a halt; nor does 22 Na7 work, e.g.
22...Rxa7 23 Sb3+ Nb6! 24 Sxb6+ <Na8, when White has to exchange queens,
leaving Black once again with the better game; obviously the intermediate
23...Nb6! is the key element here) 22...Rg5+ 23 bl Nd2+ 24 Na2. Now Black

10 Defending against the attack
on the castled king In presenting, up to here, the various aspects of the attack on the castled king we have looked at the operation from the attacker's point of view. However, it is also true that the defence against such an attack has its own principles and particular characteristics, and it is therefore fitting that we should also try to discuss this de- fence systematically. Chess literature tends for the most part to talk of active and passive defence as being the two main types of defence. Steinitz also introduced the term 'self- defence', and H. Kmoch (in his work The Art of Defence) speaks of 'automatic defence' . Although it is now fairly well established, this division is not really the happiest one for teaching purposes; moreover, when it is a question of defence against an attack on the castled king, it is an imprecise one. I think it better to talk of direct and indirect defence of the castled position, in which case the direct defence is predominantly 'passive' and the indirect always 'active'. The difference between these kinds of defence is usually clearly marked, since the former involves the defence of the actual castling area or the removal of one's opponent's aggressive pieces, while in the latter case it is a question of actions further away from the castled position, which the defender uses to keep the attacker so busy that he fails to pursue his attack to its conclu- sion. In actual play direct defensive moves usually occur in conjunction with those of an indirect kind, and the main rule is that direct defence should be economical and that indirect should be executed at the right moment. Economy in direct de- fence consists of not making superfluous moves and not employing an unneces- sarily large number of pieces in defence. The right moment for indirect defence is fairly difficult to gauge, since it is normally determined by two interacting fac- tors; on the one hand, when direct defence has reached the limits that necessary economy allows, and on the other, when the attacker has really made a move which commits him fairly strongly, i.e. he has staked his money on the success of the attack. First, we shall set out clearly the various elements which go to make up each type of defence.
248 The Art of Attack in Chess
A. Direct Defence 1) Protecting the squares of the castled position, including so-called over- protection. 2) Transforming the castled position by moving the pawns in front of the king, a particular case being the setting-up of a blocked position. 3) Altering the castled position by moving the king. Here it should be kept in mind that each move by the king changes the situation, changes the conditions necessary for an attack and, above all, changes the possible focal-points. King moves fall into the following graded categories: a) The consolidating move (e.g. bl in the case of queenside castling and hl in the case of kingside castling); b) A more radical alteration of the situation as a result of moving the king (e.g. to f2, thus producing a so-called 'semi-castled' position); c) A king's flight, i.e. when it goes out in front of the castled position. Steinitz called this the king's self-defence, an older and more correct term than that of 'automatic defence' applied by Kmoch. 4) Defence by means of repulsing one's opponent's pieces, through their cap- ture, exchange, or ejection from powerful positions. B. Indirect Defence Before considering the ways of using the indirect method we must first of all ex- amine three aspects of such a defence. The first is purely spatial, i.e. whether the defender carries out his own counterattack in the centre or on the wings; the sec- ond is concerned with the degree of the threat; and the third with the question of whether the indirect action turns at some point into the direct method of defence. In the following review we shall combine these three aspects: 1) The defender carries out a counterattack on the opposite side, where the at- tacker has castled. In such a case his action is usually itself an attack on the cas- tled king, the position being one where the players have castled on opposite sides. 2) An action on the opposite side first of all prepares the ground (files, ranks, etc.), and then turns into an outflanking manoeuvre against the attacker's castled position, i.e. while the attacker is attacking along the files, the defender gains control of the attacker's first or second rank. In this case, as in '1', the critical question is naturally either who will be the first to force mate or which of the two attacks will be brought to a halt through the diversion of pieces to provide a direct defence. Defending against the attack on the castled king 249 3) An action on any part of the board with the aim of gaining material. Such an action obviously only has a point when a forced mate is not part of the attacker's plan. The critical continuation then is that which costs the defender the least. For instance, if he can 'pacify the attacker's wrath' at the price of a knight, then a counterattack which brings him a rook is worthwhile. In practice the most important case is where the attacker sacrifices; the de- fender's repertoire is then greatly increased, since he is given various ways in which to return material in order to counter the attacker's plan. This method of returning material is extremely important; the extent to which it is possible af- fects the type of sacrifice which can be made, and the sacrifice is also a signal to the defender to counter with a sacrifice which would previously have been out of the question. 4) The counterattack results in material equality, but the question of position still remains open. Mate cannot be forced, both attacks are brought to a halt, and eventual simplification leads towards an ending. The resulting position, which is often extremely difficult to assess beforehand, is then decisive. 5) The defender's counterattack does not lead to a mating attack, nor to mate- rial or positional advantages, but instead consists of an eventual transition to the direct method. As a rule, this takes the form of either attacking the enemy pieces 'from the rear' or of gaining control of a file or diagonal so as to cover a certain square in one's king position (e.g. when the white queen has captured the square c7 and from there covers the focal-point h2). 6) A special case of the kind of counterattack mentioned in '3' is provided by the advance of a queenside pawn majority. Its aim is to promote a pawn to a queen, and such an advantage justifies the most generous surrender of material in order to curb the attacker's forces. 7) Retaliation in the centre can have the features of sections '3' to '5' either separately or combined. The following possibilities are particularly worth noting here: a) A central thrust demolishes or weakens the attacker's formation there and prepares the ground for further operations by the defender, or it enables him to transpose to direct defence 'via a turning manoeuvre'; b) The destruction of the pawn centre eliminates its auxiliary function with regard to an attack on the castled king. For example, the disappearance of a pawn on e5 can also mean the end of an attack on the castled king, if the pawn is vital to a certain continuation; c) Because of the danger of a central thrust, many attackers at a suitable mo- ment deliberately create a blocked position in the centre. As a rule such a central
250 The Art of Attack in Chess
formation cannot be rapidly activated except by the sacrifice of a piece. If the at- tacker has already used a sacrifice in attack, the defender is presented with an op- portunity of making a return sacrifice in the centre. For example, the defender's knight on c6 is sacrificed for White's pawns on e5 and d4, thereby creating the necessary conditions for various kinds of defence without loss of material; d) The destruction of the attacker's centre usually gives the defender the pros- pect of better conditions for positional play, as mentioned in section '4'. For it is not only that the opponent's centre pawns disappear, but the actual central squares also come under the defender's control; consequently, if the attack is held, the considerable positional advantage enjoyed by the defender persists, even when the material is equally balanced, until well into the endgame. This outline of defensive methods brings out above all else the richness of their variety and the flexible way in which they can be combined. Because of this, defence as a whole is harder than attack, and its finesses are as a rule more concealed than those of the attacker, a point already noticed long ago by Lasker. The importance of the centre must be particularly emphasized as the critical area where the decisive step is often made. The great variety of possibilities afforded by a defence based on an action against the centre gives such an operation first place in the defender's repertoire, and so every attacker must be able to calculate accurately what is likely to happen in the centre during an attack on the castled king. Defence by over-protection Passing now to some examples of direct defence, let us examine the following position, which can arise in the Closed Defence to the Ruy Lopez. Defending against the attack on the castled king 251 It is Black's move; he has to think how to supplement the direct defence of his king position, especially in view of White's threat of 1 £}h2 followed by 2 f4 and 3 f5. Black plays:
2 h2 f6
Now 3 f4 can be met by 3...<R3f7. Moreover, he can also answer most other moves by 3...Nf7, setting up a distinctive position with a 'double knight fian- chetto'. This position offers very strong resistance against all kinds of attack, and the reason for this lies in the over-protection of the squares f5, g5, and h5, at which points White might have been able to execute a breakthrough. These squares are now covered both by Black's pawns and his knights, an example of 'prophylactic over-protection', to use Nimzowitsch's phrase. The over-protection which Black achieves by transferring his knight to f7 is in this case neither a passive nor an uneconomical means of defence. It is not diffi- cult to establish that Black's knight on b7 has no better position anywhere than on f7 (if ...c4, for example, White plays b4 and does not allow ...£fc5); it is better to use the knight for defence, freeing Black's other pieces for later queenside ac- tivity. In some cases over-protection can mean economical direct defence; on the other hand, depending on the position, it may be superfluous. Defence by blockade A blocked pawn formation means a general reduction in the number of actions possible in any position, and as a result blockade is often the weapon employed by the weaker side. A means of defence which stands out as particularly impor- tant is the blockade of the pawns in front of the king.
252 The Art of Attack in Chess
The continuation from the above position shows us first of all a typical case of defence by blockade, and then the way to overcome this method of defence. Although White has the superior position with all his pieces directed against Black's kingside, he still can not achieve anything by 'normal' methods. If 1 g6, Black plays l...h6, while if 1 h6, then l...g6; in both cases blocking the pawns brings the attack to a halt. Attempts to break through by sacrificing a knight can simply be ignored by Black. Thus after 1 g6 h6 2 4T3 Bd7 3 £}g5 Black does not take the knight but waits; while if 1 h6 g6 2 Nh5, Black again does not need to take, for by playing 2...Nh8 3 <?3f6 Rf7 he can hold the draw. White's only chance in this position is: 1 £hg6 Nd7 Clearly, the knight cannot be taken. 1. .. ?f7 is met by 2 h6 and a breakthrough, since if 2...hxg6, then 3 h7 uke7 4 Rh4 followed by 5 3xg6.
2 Sghl!
White must play with great precision and thoroughly prepare for the break- through by h6 and hxg7. If he tries 2 h6 immediately, then Black replies 2...hxg6; then 3 hxg7 -Nxg7 is not dangerous while after 3 h7+ h8 4 Sh6 gxh6 5 gxh6 White's attack will probably not succeed.
2...c6 3 Rh2 fib7 4 h6 hxg6 5 hxg7 Bxg7 6 JXh8+ and White wins.
Defence by elimination Many examples could be given of defence based on the diversion or elimination of important attacking pieces, since such operations are often undertaken; how- ever, they are limited on the whole to one or two moves and do not normally pro- vide a complete system of defence but only force the attacker to remodel or reorganize his attack. Thus, for example, in the quite normal case where the at- tacker's knight has to retreat from g5 when faced with ...h6, the problem of de- fence has not as a rule been fundamentally solved, but rather the attacker has been obliged to redirect his attack, either by transferring his target from h7 to h6 or g7 or else by strengthening the pressure on h7 along the diagonal bl-h7. Spe- cial examples and analysis are not necessary in the case of such straightforward diversion of opposing pieces. We are interested here in those special cases when the diversion or elimination of the attacker's pieces represents the essence of the defence and is in fact fundamental in driving back the attacking force. The
1 Although after 4 Rh4 followed by h7+ White wins the g6-pawn, when the re-
sulting position appears very unpleasant for Black. However, it is true that White risks nothing by building his position up further before playing h6. Defending against the attack on the castled king 253 simplest example of this is the exchange of queens, which is usually to the ad- vantage of the defender and in many cases altogether eliminates the danger of at- tack. The queen is generally an essential piece in a mating attack and it is therefore useful to the defender if it is removed. However, other pieces too can be essential to an attack and can be the target of a defensive plan based on elimina- tion. One of the most typical instances involves the attacker's bishop which is covering a network of weak squares. Such a visitor should, as soon as circum- stances permit, be dismissed from the castling area or be eliminated by ex- change. The following diagram shows a case of a bishop commanding a network of squares, and we give two possible continuations: the one actually taken, where Black misses the opportunity to defend himself by tackling the bishop; and an al- ternative one, which indicates the correct method of defence. This position comes from the game Blackburne-Schwarz, Berlin 1881, and it is White's move. He is a pawn down and, in addition, he has the inferior pawn structure. On the other hand, he enjoys far greater activity for his pieces and has prospects of controlling the network of weak dark squares around the enemy king. It is exactly with this in mind that he plays: 1 i.f6 2tf4+? Black throws away the chance of defending himself by eliminating the bishop on f6 (with l..Be7!) and falls into a trap.
2 Rxf4! -Nxf4 3 2xh5 gxh5 4 Sxh5 and there is no remedy against mate on
h8.
1 In the original edition, this diagram was incorrectly given without the black
pawn on b5. Vukovic's comments have been modified to take account of this correction.
254 The Art of Attack in Chess
The essential attacking piece here is the bishop on f6 and it should have been eliminated. Therefore the only correct course is l..Jte7! (D). After 2 Be5 (or 2 Jtxe6 fxe6 3 Rg5 .xf6 4 Rxf6 Rd8! and Black is the better placed) 2..Bd6 White has nothing better than 3 and a repetition of moves; on any other move the elimination of White's dark-squared bishop affords Black p. a complete defence and the prospect of victory on the basis of his other advan- tages. Thus after 3 f4 Bxe5 4 dxe5 £}g7 White has nothing, while he is too weak for 3 Exh5? because of 3...gxh5 4 Exh5 Bxe5 5 dxe5 Ed4, whereupon the threat of ... f4+ destroys all his hopes. Before we leave the theme of defence by elimination, the reader must be warned of the mistakes which are often made in applying this method. Many players defend themselves by endeavouring to exchange all the attacker's ag- gressive pieces. Such a formula can easily lead to defeat. As a rule, one should aim to exchange those pieces which are essential to the execution of the at- tacker's mating threats, while on the other hand one should preserve those of one's own pieces which are carrying out an important defensive function. We have already seen how important it is to preserve the fianchettoed bishop, and much the same can be said for a knight at f6 covering the important square h7 . The king's self-defence There is a graded scale which can be applied to the king's self-defence starting from the so-called consolidating move and ending with the full flight of the king to the other side of the board. Examples have already been given of the former type, so we shall begin with cases where the king is already definitely on the move, even though it may only be along the edge of the castling area. The next Defending against the attack on the castled king 255 diagram is a typical example of self-defence by classically simple means: faced with White's pressure on h7, Black defends his pawn by advancing it and is not concerned about the square h7 itself; Black' s king reduces the value of the square by moving, for it no longer comes into consideration as a focal-point. This position is from Bogoljubow-Reti, Carlsbad 1923. Black played:
2 Nxf6 Bxf6 3 Rh7+ 4>f8
The Black king defends itself by flight; if now 4 Rh8+ 4>e7, White's position would only be made worse by his loss of a tempo. In the actual game White's ini- tiative dissolved after 4 Ecdl Eed8 5 4>hl 4?e7 6 £ke2 Sh8 7 Rc2 aS, and, thanks to the good self-defence effected by his king, Black soon obtained rather the better game. Another example of self-defence can be provided by my analysis of one of the critical positions in the game Reshevsky-Botvinnik, World Championship Tour- nament, The Hague/Moscow 1948.
256 The Art of Attack in Chess
Botvinnik (Black) played here l... g8?, which is an absolutely passive method of defence. It means that Black's king is left in the corner, and White is offered the chance to prepare the opening of the e-file by a pawn sacrifice based on Xl'6+. After the moves 2 Sei Rf7 3 c3 Na5 4 Sc6 White made the mis- take of playing 5 Bf6+ too early, without the preparatory 5 Sge3!, and thus did not make correct use of Black's error; we will therefore not concern ourselves with the game's actual course. Correct would have been l...Ng8!, followed perhaps by in which case the black king is only apparently 'courting danger'; in fact, it avoids all the difficulties associated with being in the corner and itself provides assistance in covering the important light squares e6 and g6; moreover, with the dark-square network alone White can clearly achieve nothing. Black is also left with an initia- tive on the queenside, where he is positionally set to win. If the reader tests the different variations after l... ?g8, he will convince himself of the strength of the black king's self-defence in this position.

as far as a8, but in doing so he condemns himself to a passive game with no pros- pect of activity. Counterplay is possible only on the queenside, based on ...b5. That is where Black's chances lie, and consequently his king does not belong on the queen's wing but should stay where it is; the pawns in front of the king should not be touched, in order that he may retain as much chance as possible of defend- ing himself by blocking the position. Correct therefore was 13... .d7 planning ...Na4 followed by ...a6 and ...b5. If White plays 14 a4 then 14...Re8 15 a5 <£jbc8 followed by ...Sb8 and ...b5, etc.

Pawn majority on the wing Passing now to the theme of indirect defence, we first of all examine a counterat- tack by means of a pawn majority on the queenside. An analysis of a classic mas- terpiece will be helpful here. Pillsbury - Tarrasch Hastings, 1895 Queen's Gambit Declined, Orthodox Defence
1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 3f6 4 Ng5 i.e7 5 £tf3 bd7 6 Ecl O-O 7 e3 b6
These days it is considered more accurate to play ...b6 before committing the b8-knight to d7. 8 cxd5 exd5 9 Nd3 Nb7 10 O-O c5 11 Eel?! A move which does not belong to the system and only wastes time. At this point Pillsbury usually played 11 £te5 and his opponents allowed him to strengthen the position of his knight by f4. Marco later showed that after 1 1 £3e5 one should play ll... xe5 12 dxe5 £te8 13 Bf4 g6 14 Jlh6 *?3g7 15 f4 d4! an- swering 16 f5 with 16..Bg5. Defending against the attack on the castled king 259 Today 1 1 Re2 is considered strongest. Il...c4? Thus Black creates a pawn majority on the wing but surrenders his influence in the centre. It is now known that the situation in the centre is the more impor- tant; moreover, against an attack on the castled king it is easier to build up a counterattack using the centre rather than by means of a slow advance of the wing pawns. Instead of 1 l...c4? Black could have played, for example, 1 l...a6, which is in keeping with the system and does not immediately forsake the centre in the pro- cess. The modern answer would be 1 1...<Ne4, with the aim of clarifying the situa- tion. 12 kbl a6 13 2>e5 (D) Because of Black's mistake this move is now extremely strong, since White is able to consolidate the knight on e5 and use it as the basis for a later attack on the king. 13... xe5 will not do now, since 14 dxe5 is extremely awkward for Black.
13.. .b5 14 f4
This formation with a knight on e5 and pawns on d4 and f4 is called the 'Pillsbury attack', and it was in this game that the attack originated. Pillsbury was still experimenting with his idea here, hence his unsystematic move 11 Sei?!.

18 Bxe4
260 The Art of Attack in Chess
Pillsbury's contemporaries were a little surprised by this exchange, which he used to make regularly in this system. In fact, the move is absolutely logical from the positional point of view. White cannot worry Black any more as regards his control of e4, and it is better that the square should be occupied by a blocked pawn than an active knight. In view of Black's complete hold on e4, White's bishop on bl cannot be better employed than in dispatching Black's knight. This is an example of the logic, consistency, and lack of prejudice which runs through Pillsbury's style. 18,..dxe4 19 Rg3! f6 This move has been censured by earlier commentators because 'White's knight retreats with gain of tempo', but closer investigation shows that the move is not a bad one, or rather that Black has nothing better. 19...f5 would be danger- ous (because of White's eventual assault with g4), but otherwise it is difficult to find a natural way of parrying White's threat of 20 f5 followed by £rf4 or f6. It is important to note that 19...Rd6 20 f5 f6 fails because of 21 Ng6! Sd7 22 Ngf4, when White has realized his aim of posting a knight on f4 without having to ex- change queens. On the other hand, 19...Rc7 contains some dangers on account of 20 b3. If Black had recaptured with his queen on the seventeenth move,
19.. .Rd6 would now work, for 20 f5 f6 would force the exchange of queens. A
small and instructive detail! 20 >g4 >h8 21 f5! Rd7 22 Sfl Sd8 Black is planning ...Rd6, but he should have noted that White will be unable to play the fundamentally important move f4 for some time (because of ...Rxf5). He could therefore have devoted the tempo to preparing ...b4, e.g. by
22...5c8.
23 Sf4 (D)
Defending against the attack on the castled king 261 Here we shall stop a moment to describe the course of the game so far and to point out the characteristic features of the position. Black released his pressure on the centre early on and thereby allowed White considerable freedom in arranging his pieces for an attack on the king. Against this attack Black built up a typical, direct defensive position which offers consid- erable, but not absolute, resistance. His principal weapon in the event of a further concentration of White's pieces is, however, an indirect defence in the shape of the advance of the pawn majority on the queenside. Against a whole series of at- tacking plans Black has successful replies in the form of retaliation on the flank; a particular point is that White cannot force the move <£tf4. It was because of this that Pillsbury decided on 23 Sf4, i.e. he now abandons his preparations for Nf4 and regroups with the apparent intention of attacking e4. 23".Rd6 24 Rh4 2de8 25 4k 3? A weak move, for Black could now have played 25... b4 26 4k4 Bd5 27 4k5 4jd7 28 €)xd7 Sxd7, after which there is nothing left of White's attack, while on the queenside Black has moved closer to his goal. 25 4k2 was better, to prepare g4. Admittedly, if 25...'Ng8!, then 26 g4 does not work (because of 26...g5 27 fxg6 £jxg6 28 Rxf6 4}xf4 ! 29 Rxd6 £ xe2+ and 3O...4 xc 1, with a whole fistful of pieces for the queen); however, White can play 26 Rh3, to be followed by Sh4, g4, and £tf4, etc.
25... .d5? (D)
Not only does this throw away the chance of playing ...b4, it also allows White the following opportunity to simplify the position: 26 a4 b4 27 4)xd5 Rxd5 28 4W6 gxf6 29 Rxf6+ Sg7 30 Sg4 Rf7 31 Rxg7+ Rxg7 32 Sxg7 <Nxg7 33 Sxc4, when the ending favours White. 26 f2

The move is not a bad one, although it would not inspire commentators nowa- days to pour on it the praise with which it was once honoured. The point is that by

the only difference is that 30 E4f2 sets a trap for 3O... xa2. However, even that trap is not so terrible, for after 31 f4 jLf7 32 £sg6+ Ng8! (Reti only analyses the inferior 32...Jtxg6?) 33 £}xe7+ Exe7 34 Rg3 *f8 35 h3 (otherwise ...h5 wins the knight) 35...Ra5 Black still retains good prospects of counterplay, and it is not certain whether White can use his small material advantage to any real ef- fect.

Correct was 38...fxg5! 39 Rxg5 Nf6 when both 40 <£}e5 Rd6 and 40 Eg2 f8 leave Black the better placed.

52 Rxh7#
This famous game has its place in chess literature as a classic example of an at- tack on the castled king which is stronger than the counterattack on the queen- side. But in the light of my annotations, which differ fundamentally from all annotations hitherto, from Tarrasch to Reti, this game takes on a new appearance. Black's numerous opportunities to strengthen his game at various stages point rather to the equal balance between the attack and the indirect defence, and it was only the decisive mistake on the thirty-eighth move which swung the balance in White's favour. This view of the game also qualifies it as a good example of the importance of indirect defence against an attack on the castled king, and of the part played by operations with wing pawns in particular. Indirect defence by means of advancing a pawn majority on the queenside was at one time held in high esteem and was more often practised than nowadays; the real reason for this is that we have acquired a better understanding of the centre and the technique of centralization, thanks to the hypermodern school. It is clear that the player who has a majority on the wing, when the material is equally bal- anced, will usually not have the greater influence or pressure in the centre, nor will he have the necessary conditions for a central action. A majority on the wing is created at the expense of the centre and means giving up lateral pressure on the centre, and that is the sort of strategy which the masters of today are reluctant to adopt. The struggle for the centre is a characteristic feature of all present-day openings, and the centralization of the pieces is an important theme of modern positional play; as a result, a majority on the wing appears nowadays more as a by-product of a particular strategy than its primary aim (for example, in the Ex- change Variation of the Griinfeld Defence). Thus, concern for the centre is driving majority actions out of use, and it should be added that an indirect defence against an attack on the castled king is more effective and holds better prospects of success in the form of a central ac- tion than one using wing pawns. This is shown by the following general consid- erations. 1) Advancing pawns on the opposite wing is a slow process, since, as a rule, the whole pawn chain must move forward for a passed pawn to be created. 2) The attacker knows which pawn is going to be dangerous and so can ar- range to contain it economically, either by preparing to block the pawn with a Defending against the attack on the castled king 265 piece or by planning ahead to sacrifice a piece for the passed pawn, which in fact means surrendering the piece in return for a considerable number of tempi. 3) Advancing pawns on the opposite wing is an action which is furthest in distance from the threatened castled position and which is the hardest to combine with, or transform into, direct defence. These are the general deficiencies of indirect defence using the wing pawns, and they limit its use mainly to the following cases: a) The attack on the castled king develops slowly, demanding a regrouping or perhaps a series of pawn moves; it does not lead to a forced mate, for a defence can be bought at the price of material; b) Direct defence is on the whole sufficient but it may be usefully combined with something else; in other words, the defender has some tempi left over which he can devote to alternative actions, including those using the wing pawns. These, then, are the general factors which speak for, or against, indirect de- fence by means of the wing pawns, but in this case too the reader must overcome any inclination to think merely in terms of formulae, since the essence of a for- mula often consists of 'exceptions which prove the rule'. Defence by counterattack Venturing further into the broad field of indirect defence, we next concern our- selves with a series of cases in which methods other than a pawn thrust in the cen- tre are used. We shall examine five examples from the point of view of the following factors: 1 ) The area of the counterattack and the conditions underlying it. 2) The part played by the material situation in relation to positional consider- ations. 3) The interweaving of indirect defence with direct and the switching from one to the other. 4) The dependence of timing and the form of defence on the state of the at- tacker's commitments. The following position is from the game K.Treybal-H.Wolf, Teplitz-Schonau
1922. Black, to move, has the task of organizing a defence against an attack on
his king position. A single glance is enough to show that he has no move to make in the way of direct defence. The only move in keeping with that would be l... h7, but that would simply make White's attack easier. For example, White will in any case play Sf4-h4 and then (with the king on h7) the square g5 will be available for his queen, besides which there is a threat of JLcl followed by Sxh6

266 The Art of Attack in Chess
with check. Therefore, indirect defence must be used to obstruct White's plan to gain control of h6. With that aim, only an action on the queenside can be consid- ered, for Black cannot achieve anything in the centre.
1...a5 2 Sf4 a4 3 Safi axb3 4 axb3 JXa2!
Very well played! Black first of all makes it difficult for White to redeploy his queen and bishop, a course which is necessary for an attack on h6; moreover, there is an eventual threat of ...2xb2 followed by ...Nd3.
5 Sh4 Sb8
Suddenly Black threatens 6...#}xc4; he has worked up a definite counterat- tack, and White is still quite a long way from having any serious threats on the kingside. 6 c3 Black has succeeded in persuading White's queen to leave the attacking diag- onal. 6 fixh6 would not have worked because of 6...Hxb2 7 Rg5 Rg4 and White has nothing. An interesting possibility was 6 Nf5, which probably leads to a draw; objectively, this would not have been at all bad, for Black could have gained some advantage after White's actual move. The analysis runs 6 £rf5 gxf5 (6...Sxb2 fails against 7 £}xh6+ .xh6 8 Rxh6) 7 Sxh6 Exb2 8 Rg5+ 4£Ag6 9 Sxg6+ fxg6 10 Rxg6+ <£118 11 Sf4 (this attempt does not give more than perpet- ual check, which White would also obtain by 11 Rh5+) 1 l...fibl+ 12 £?f2 Sb2+ 13 <£el Sbl+ (if 13...Rxe4+ 14 Uxe4 fxe4, White wins by 15 f7!) 14 Nd2 Sb2+ 15 <£cl Sbl+! 16 £*xbl Sxb3+ 17 <£*a2 262+' 18 <Na3 (or 18 <Nxb2 Re5+ and
19...'Nxf4) 18...Sa2+, and White's king cannot escape from perpetual check.
6...6xc4?
1 Black can play for a win by 17...fih3! since after 18 gxh3 xc4+ he can win the
rook on f4 with a series of checks. Defending against the attack on the castled king 261 The wrong turning, since White now plays JLcl with gain of tempo, placing the bishop on the diagonal where it really belongs. The correct continuation of the defence consisted in giving, not taking, material, e.g. 6,..Sxb2! 7 Rxb2 <2)xc4 8 Rc3 (or 8 Wcl Ne5 9 Sxh6 Sxb3 after which both 10 Rg5 Rg4 and 10 Sf5 <2)g4 are in Black's favour) 8...£te5 9 Sbl c4 10 b4 Rxf6 11 Sh3 -&.g7 and Black has the better prospects. Wolf, of course, was not the master to decide on 'giving' when he could 'take'. His saying was: 'Why should I sacrifice when no- body sacrifices for me!?' But the consistent implementation of a plan with a sound positional basis often demands sacrificial conceptions, as in the analysis above, which is both typical and instructive. We can see here how an element of direct defence is also involved - the elimination of White's bishop, which plays an essential part in his mating plans. White's attack then flags, whereupon Black takes some pawns, centralizes his position, and brands White's rook on h4 as misplaced; the defence welds the various elements of the position into a single whole. 7 &cl (D)
7...Ne5
In sharp positions like this everything should be considered, including moves like 7...g5. The latter represents a simultaneous combination of direct and indi- rect defence: Black drives back the rook, blocks the diagonal of the enemy bishop, and frees the square g6 for the knight - all direct elements - while the in- direct appears in certain continuations where Black's g-pawn takes part in a counterattack. Let us look at some ways in which White can go astray after
7...g5. First of all, the 'natural' move 8 Sh5? is unsatisfactory because of 8...€ e5
9 Jlxg5 (after 9 £}f5 Ng4! the attack on the e-pawn gains a tempo) 9...2xb3 10
Wcl Sxg3 11 hxg3 Rg4.
268 The Art of Attack in Chess
Nor is 8 Nf5? gxh4 9 Rf3 <Ne5 10 Rh5 good, e.g. 10...Sxb3 11 <?3xh6+ (or 11 Jlxh6 Sbb2!) 1 l...Bxh6 12 xh6 Rg4 when the clearing of the g-file enables Black to cover the focal-point at g7. The g-pawn takes an active role in the con- tinuation 8 Sh3 g4 9 bxc4 gxh3 when the threat of ...Sxg2+ costs White a deci- sive tempo. The correct response to 7...g5 is 8 Sh3 ! g4 (if 8...£te5 then 9 £jf5 after which the b-pawn is protected) and now 9 Sh5 ! (instead of 9 bxc4 as above) 9... e5 10 .xh6 Bxh6 (if 10...Sxb3 then 11 Wcl wins) 11 Hxh6 2xb3 12 Wcl Ng6 13 Sh8+ xhS 14 Rh6 and White wins. Here White's play against the focal-point g7 is unhindered, since g4 is blocked by Black's own pawn.
8 J".xh6 Bxh6?
At the very least, this is a tactical mistake; for, by 8...Sxb3 Black could have presented White with an exceptionally difficult problem and involved him in considerable risk if he persisted in playing for a win. The text move, however, gives White no difficulties and allows him to win easily. Griinfeld and Becker, the authors of the tournament book - one of the best in the literature of the game - rightly censure Black's move, but their analysis of the continuation 8...Sxb3! is not correct. In the variation which they conclude with a drawn ending Black can eventually win, while in that which they consider won for Black the position can be resolved in White's favour. These lines together with my analysis will interest the reader as general studies of the middlegame. Here is a diagram after the alternative 8...Sxb3! (D). Griinfeld and Becker reach a draw as follows: 9 jlxf8 g5 ! (otherwise J&.g7 and mate) 10 Sh5 Sxc3 1 1 -Ng7 £}g6 12 £}f5. In their opinion Black now has no de- fence against perpetual check by i?Jh6+. In fact, Black still has something to say and can play 12...Sxg2+! 13 ?hl (if 13 xg2 then 13...Rxe4+ and Black has no Defending against the attack on the castled king 269 trouble picking up the rook on h5) 13...Sxh2+ 14 Nxh2 (or 14 Sxh2 Rxe4+ fol- lowed by ...Nh4) 14...Re5+ 15 &gl Sg3+ 16 h2 (16 Nxg3 Rxg3+ 17 hl Rg4 followed by ...Rxe4+, ...c4, etc.) 16...Sf3+ 17 *gl (or 17 Ng2 Sxf5 18 exf5 Re2+ 19 Sf2 Nf4+) 17...Sxfl+ 18 xfl Rf4+ and White loses either his rook or his knight. The second line given by the same commentators aims to show that 8...Sxb3! cannot be answered by 9 Wcl because of 9... g4 10 Bxf8 Sbb2 11 Jkg7 Sxg2+ 12 &hl Sxh2+ 13 2xh2 Sxh2+ 14 ?gl Ra2 and Black wins. But if White, in- stead of 11 .g7?, plays 1 1 xb2! Sxb2 12 .g7 then Black loses. Correct after 9 Rc1 is at once 9...Sbb2 whereupon 10 Jtxf8 does not work because of 10...fixg2+ 11 &hl 4£"g4!. Now here is my analysis. First of all, let me explain why 9 Bxf8? g5 ! 10 Wcl, not mentioned by the commentators, does not work. Black replies 10...gxh4 and then 11 Rh6 is useless on account of ll...Rg4 while 11 Rg5+ fails against 1 l...<Nxf8 12 £}f5 Sbb2! when White's attack is halted - he cannot get any fur- ther than Rh6+ and £}g7+ because of the threat of mate that faces him on g2 and h2. A third possibility is 11 Nf5 Sbb2! 12 e7+ Rxe7 13 Rg5+ (if 13 Rxb2 then 13...Re6) 13... ?xf8 14 fxe7+ e8 when it can be seen that White has achieved nothing. In return for his rooks Black will win the queen and the pawns on g2 and e7, thus obtaining an advantage in the ending. The above diagram is a hard nut to crack, and the way to attempt it is as fol- lows: 9 Wcl! Sbb2! 10 Rxb2! 2xb2 11 .xf8 g5 12 Hh5 Ng6 13 Jlg7. Now White has the same position as in the first line above but with a tempo less and a rook more. He wins in the following variations: 1) 13...c4 14 f5 Sxg2+ (otherwise Ne7+ wins) 15 <Nxg21 Rxe4+ 16 g3 Re5+ 17 hS g4+ (if 17...Rc3+ the king escapes from the checks on gl) 18 <Ng2 Rb2+ 19 #gl Rb6+ 20 Sf2! Wbl+ 21 Ng2 Re4+ 22 <Ng3 Rd3+ 23 Nxg4 Wdl+ (or 23...£te5+ 24 Ng5 Nf3+ 25 Nh6) 24 Sf3! e5+ 25 Ng5 Nxf3+ 26 >f4 Rd2+ 27 <5)e3 Rd4+ 28 *xf3 and White wins. 2) 13...Rg4 14 Sh6 2b8 (parrying the threat of Sxg6) 15 Sei Se8 16 £}f5 Sxe4 (otherwise Sxg6) 17 *S)e7-l- Sxe7 18 fxe7 Nxe7 19 Bf6 and White wins. 3) 13...Sb8 14 Nf5 Se8 (if 14...Rxe4, then around of checks by the knight - £}h6+, Nxf7+, Nh6+, £}f5+ - and finally f7+ leads to the win of the queen) 15 Nh6+ Nh7 16 xf7+ Ng8 17 Nxg5 Re5 18 h4 Sa8 (or 18...Sf8 19 f7+ Nxg7
20 Sh7#) 19 Sh6 Sal 20 f7+ xg7 21 Sxg6+ xg6 22 f8W and again White
wins. 1 15 111' wins straight away.
270 The Art of Attack in Chess
Of Black's other moves the most difficult to deal with is 13...Rc4, threatening
14...Rc2. White is then able to draw by 14 Sal Sa2 15 Sbl Sb2 ! 16 Sal etc., but
can he also win? This may be left to the reader to examine; we shall return to the game, where Black played 8...jtxh6? (D).
9 Sxh6 Rxb3
Black also loses after 9...Sxb3 10 Wcl £}g4 11 Rg5! Sbb2 12 Sxg6+.
10 Wcl
Now the main defect in Black's eighth move can be seen: White is at once threatening 11 Bh8+.
10...Ng4 11 2>f5! Se8 12 Sh4 Sxe4 13 Ne7+ Sxe7 14 fxe7 Se2 15 Sxg4
Re3+ 16 Rxe3 Sxe3 17 Sxg6+! <Nh7 18 Sgf6 1-0
1 In this line 15... d4+ 16 &hl Sal wins for Black - indeed, White seems to be
struggling after 13...Rc4. Defending against the attack on the castled king 271 This position, from the game Yates-Marco, The Hague 1921, arose after the moves 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 d6 3 d4 S)d7 4 M4 c6 5 Sk3 M7 6 O-O h6 7 M3 £}gf<5 8 M3 c7 9 Nd2 g5 10 a4 Nf8 11 a5 2>g6 12 Sei 2>f4 13 f3 Sg8 14 2ifl M6
15 Ng3 (D), Black has played his favourite Hanham Variation of the Philidor,
obtaining the advantage and an attack on the white king; this is the natural result of White's extravagant treatment of the opening (unmotivated moves an earlier stage of the game). Marco (Black), to move, spoils his position by pro- voking d5 which he does in order to continue with a sacrifice in the old 'paprika style'.
15...Rd7?
Black had excellent prospects of carrying out an attack using his pawns (15...g4 or 15.. .h5) without any material risk, but he has seen the chance of a bishop sacrifice on h3 with play against the focal-point g2 and cannot resist it. 16 d5 White rightly falls in with Black's intentions and forces him to continue with
...M3.
16...M3 (D)
A
and f3 at 17 gxh3? White decides to accept the sacrifice and to employ direct defence against the attack on his king. With good play he could certainly have come through by this method, but the right way to refute the offer is not by accepting it but by applying indirect defence in the shape of a counterattack on the queenside. After d5 there is also some point to the earlier advance a5, since an attack can now be made on Black's pawn chain at b7 and c6, as a result of which White obtains the better pawn structure and an advantage in space on the queenside and also frees the square d5 for a centralized piece. The analysis runs 17 a6! Nxg2 (if 17... Jlxg2
272 The Art of Attack in Chess
then 18 axb7 Rxb7 19 Ba4 when White wins the exchange and gains space, while if Black advances his b-pawn, then 18 dxc6 Rc8 represents a strengthen- ing of White's position, after which the conditions for accepting the sacrifice are extremely good) 18 axb7 Rxb7 19 dxc6 (if 19 Ba4 as mentioned by Tartakower in The Hypermodern Game, Black would reply 19... xe3 20 Sxe3 .d7)
19...Rc8 20 Nd5! (a typical example of play on the principle that the most im-
portant feature of the position, in this case White's pressure on the queenside, takes priority; it should be observed that in pursuing this policy White must also be prepared to lose the exchange) 2O...Nxel (it might seem more consistent for Black not to make this capture but to press on with his assault; in fact, the chief attacking moves do not work, e.g. 20...h5 21 £jxf6+ and 22 Nxh5, 20...g4 21 Nxe7 Nxe7 22 and White stands better and finally 2O...Nxd5 21 jlxd5 af- ter which 21...Rc7, to prevent the advance of the c-pawn, is strongly answered by 22 b4) 21 Wxel A.e6 (Black must abandon his attack on the king and defend himself in the centre and on the queenside; the decisive factor is that 21. ..g4 is useless because of 22 f4) 22 a5 Bxd5 23 Jtxd5 #)xd5 24 Rxd5 Re6 (other- wise c7!) 25 b4! and White has an overwhelming game. The chief feature of this line is the complete absence of direct defence. White gives up the pawn on g2 and the exchange, which effectively blunts Black's at- tack, while his excellently-founded action on the queenside gains in power with every move. 17".Rxh3 (D)
18 Rd2?
After this excessively passive move Black has the better chances. In such posi- tions it is often important to oppose the attacker's queen with one's own - in this case on fl. It was with this aim that Maroczy proposed 18 Se2! g4 19 Wfl. Defending against the attack on the castled king 273 Naturally, White gladly offers the exchange in order to weaken the attack by giv- ing back some material while at the same time still retaining some material ad- vantage. Thus after 19...gxf3 20 Rxf3 <Nxe2+ 21 £}xe2 Black's only move to prevent White from consolidating completely is 21...l$3g4, but then White imme- diately gets the chance to counterattack, i.e. 22 dxc6! Rxh2+ 23 ?fl Nxe3+ 24 Rxe3. The further sharpening of the attack by 24... .h4 would be dangerous be- cause of 25 cxb7. We shall examine two more variations arising out of 19...gxf3 20 Rxf3 (D): 1) 20...£}6h5 21 Bxf4! exf4 22 dxc6. Black cannot win a piece now, since
22.. .fxg3? permits the white queen to capture on f7, while 22... xg3 can be met
by 23 2g2. Black must be modestand play 22...bxc6, allowing White to consoli- date by 23 Hg2. The risk involved in 22...O-O-O is illustrated by the continuation 23 £k!5 ! xg3 (23...fxg3 24 Rf5+ Rxf5 25 xe7+ b8 26 exf5 favours White) 24 2xe7+ Nb8 25 Sg2 Ne2+ 26 Rxe2 f3 27 c7+ Nxc7 28 £ki5+ <Nb8 29 Nf4!, with a characteristic switch from indirect to direct defence; after 29...Sxg2+ 30 Rxg2 White captures the pawn on f3 and remains the better placed 1!. 2) 2O...2g4 (covering the square f4, lessening the danger on f7, and preparing ...h5-h4) 21 a6! (logically switching to the positional motif on the queenside and thus exploiting the slower tempo of Black's attack betrayed by the move ...Sg4)
21...b6 (after 21...O-O-O? 22 axb7+ bS 23 dxc6 Black would be in great difficul-
ties) 22 dxc6 h5 23 hl !

at the further expense of his e-pawn) 24 Bxf4 exf4 (the alternative 24...fixf4 25 Rg2 is equally in White's favour) 25 Wfl Sxg3 26 Rxh3 2xh3 27 g2 f3+ 28 ?xh3 fxe2 29 Sei with a clear advantage to White. Now we return to the game after 18 Rd2 (D).
18...&6h5?
Commentators have praised this move, which, however, could have allowed White to escape. Correct was 18...h5! which excludes the possibility of simplifi- 2 cation and wins back the piece without giving up the attack . 19Wf2? White misses the chance to liquidate the position which Maroczy pointed out: 19 £}xh5! Rxf3 20 dLxf4 (forced) 2O...gxf4+ 21 Bg3 fxg3 22 h3! and Black's attack loses its power. He must be satisfied with winning the exchange by

prove earlier by 25 < g 1! Sxg3 26 Rxg3 with an instant win.
2 I do not see how this wins back the piece. White can play (amongst other prom-
ising ideas) 19 Jlc4 h4 20 Bf1 Rd7 21 dxc6 bxc6 22 Nf5, and Black has noth- ing to show for his sacrifice. Defending against the attack on the castled king 275 Or 26 Exa8 Ng3 27 h3 Nxf4.
26.. .Nf8 27 Exf7+ Nxf7 28 dxc6+ Ng7 29 Ne6+ h8 30 <Nd5 bxc6 0-1
This game won the Second Brilliancy Prize. In this position Black is to move and must discover a defence against White's two threats of 4jh5 and 33f5. It is fairly easy to reach the conclusion that there is not a large choice; only two moves are worth considering - l...f5 and l... h8. The first appears more natural than the second, but in fact only the second pro- vides an adequate defence. If l...f5?, White replies 2 Bxf5!, after which 2...Sxf5 does not work because of 3 Nxf5 gxf5 4 Rg5+ <Nf7 5 Rf6+ e8 (or 6 Sf3) 6 e6, and Black loses; nor is 2...gxf5 satisfactory, e.g. 3 <2hh5 Ed7 4 e6, when the rook is lost, since if 4...Ee7. then 5 Sf3 is decisive; the one course re- maining, therefore, is to decline the sacrifice by 2... e7, but then White plays 3 Bd3, threatening f5 as well as Nh5.
1...f5? is weak because it 'opens up the position', with the result that White's
queen becomes even more effective and is always creating new threats. On the other hand, l...'Nh8, which is also primarily a form of direct defence, should en- able Black, provided he can survive the immediate pressure, to make good his material advantage and territorial superiority on the queenside. Let us now exam- ine this second move.
1... h8! 2 Nf5
After 2 £}h5 Sg8 3 (otherwise 3...Bf8!) 3...Sg7 4 Sf3 Black can just de- fend himself in time by 4...Rc3 5 Sdl .e7 and if 6 Hh3, then 6... .xf6.

276 The Art of Attack in Chess
Now White threatens 6 Bxh7 and 7 Ag6+ followed by mate with the queen at h8, but Black is a knight up at this stage, so the possibility of defence by giving back material arises. As a result of this increase in his resources, Black's defence turns suddenly from direct to indirect, only in the end to return again, after the 'detour', to direct defence. 5,..Rd2! 6 g3 If 6 Eg3, then 6...Sdg8; anything else is answered by the same manoeuvre as now follows.

8.. Bh6 9 £jxe5 10 Rxh6+ Rxh6 11 Exh6+ <Ng8 and Black has a win-
ning advantage1. In this example too we observe how a successful defence is flexible and unites a diversity of elements. Direct and indirect defence alternate, the attacker's Although Vukovic is correct with his general principles, the above example is hardly a convincing demonstration; whatever Black plays, he cannot hope to defend the position with most of his pieces stuck far away on the queenside. Af- ter l.-. hS White can play 2 f5! Nxe5 3 Nh5 Hg8 4 fxg6 fxg6 5 Rg5! Nd7 6 fif7 with a decisive attack, for example 6...Rc3 7 Sdl £df8 8 fixd7 xd3 9 Re5+ and mates. Moreover, even one of Vukovic's own lines favours White: after 2 Nh5 Sg8 3 Hg7 4 Sf3 Rc3 5 Ed 1 jLe7 White need not allow the capture on f6 but can simply play 6 Rh4! threatening 7 Eh3. Black has nothing better than 6...h5 7 Rg5 Jtxf6 8 exf6 Eh7 9 f5 Re5, but after 10 h4! he is clearly in serious trouble as his rook on h7 is totally out of play. Defending against the attack on the castled king 277 sacrifice provokes a counter-sacrifice from the defender, and in the end the basic soundness of Black's position proves itself. This position is from the game Rossolimo-Pachman, Hilversum 1947. It is Black's move; he has a promising game and ought really to continue along posi- tional lines, e.g. I...a5 2 a4 e4 3 We 2 b6, etc. Instead, he decides to 'invest his ad- vantage in an attack on the king', though the conditions for this are not particularly suitable.
1...f41? 2 exf4 exf4 3 c5!
Black opened his attack at the cost of his advantage in the centre. Now White, by ridding himself of his doubled pawns, eliminates the last element of Black's positional superiority, with the result that the latter has only his kingside attack left.
3...Rf7 4 Be4
As a general rule, the fianchettoed bishop protecting the castled position should not be touched, but here it is a question of gaining a tempo in order to play cxd6 before £M2. If at once 4 cxd6, Black replies 4...f3, attacking the bishop on g2.
4...Rh5
If 4...f3, White is not obliged to go in for the double-edged 5 .xh7+. He also has 5 cxd6 cxd6 6 £ki2 Bg4 7 Rc4, forcing the exchange of queens. 5 cxd6 cxd6 Black's position is not strong enough for the uncompromising 5...f3 6 £k!2 J&.g4. White would continue 7 Sabi, not allowing his opponent to escape from his material commitments; at the same time, he has a direct defence at hand in the shape of an attack on Black's queen by Sb5. After, for instance, 7...Sf6 8 Sxb7 Black's obligations are too great in proportion to the force of his attack.
278 The Art of Attack in Chess
Consequently, if 8...Sh6, White can permit himself 9 h4, a weakening which does not entail danger, since 9...g5 can be countered by 10 Eb5. If instead
8...Rh3, then 9 *53x1'3 Bxf3 (otherwise *53h4 and Jkg2) 10 Bxf3 Eh6 11 Eel
leads to a win for White. 6 *53d2 Now ...1'3 is no longer possible.

This exchange involves the loss of a tempo. White should have switched at once to a counterattack on the queenside, where he is the better placed, for exam- ple 8 Sabi! Eh6 9 h4. Then, as we saw above, 9...g5 does not work, nor does
9...a6 because of 10 Exb7 g5 11 Rc4+. Lastly, there is 9...d5 10 Exb7, and again
10. ,.g5 is insufficient since after 11 Bxd5+ h8 12 Bf7 .e2 13 Rf5 White
wins. This is an example of how indirect defence, by clearing the ground on the queenside, makes it easier to revert to direct defence at the critical moment.

Defending against the attack on the castled king 279 Admittedly, this forces f3, which shuts the long diagonal to White's queen, but on the other hand, it undertakes an attacking obligation for which there is insuffi- cient justification. The point is that Black is obliged to obtain some concrete ad- vantage before his pawn at h5 becomes an anxiety and he is forced to strengthen White's position by exchanging it on g4. After this mistake White is the better placed and should in the end make his presence felt on the queenside.

Though this does not mar White's position much, it would have been stronger to have played 16 Sb5! 4)c4 17 W2!, when Black's discomfort over the h-pawn is revealed in various ways. Thus, 17...Rxf2+ 18 Bxf2 hxg4 19 fxg4 leaves two pawns en prise, one of which will obviously fall, while if 17...Rxh3, then 18 Ng5 Rg3+ (or 18...Sxg5 19 Sxg5 hxg4 20 Rh2 Rxh2+ 21 Nxh2 22 Sbl gxf3 23 < ?gl is good for White) 19 Rxg3 fxg3 20 gxh5 a6 21 hxg6 axb5 22 Sei and White is the better placed. This line, wherein the union of direct and indirect defence is especially close, would have been a much better way of handling the position than the passive one actually chosen.

1 21...£k!2! leads to a rook and pawn ending which is winning for Black. White can improve earlier in this variation, but only to the extent of holding the bal- ance. It is therefore doubtful if 16 Sb5 was any stronger than the move played.

Moves of this type belong on the whole to a rather more advanced stage of the game, when all the other pieces have been developed; they are also good in closed positions, where the opponent has no chance of counterattacking on an open file. However, even here this sortie on the part of the rook does not en- tail a very serious commitment for White, since the rook can turn back if it does not succeed in its mission.

Black is still applying prophylactic direct defence, since the conditions are not yet favourable for a counterattack; the exchange of light-squared bishops ought to lessen the force of the attack and at the same time clear the squares on the c-file for an eventual counterattack.

Up to here Black has correctly carried through a direct defence without weak- ening his pawn position, at the same time keeping his trumps in reserve (the c-file and control of the central post at d5). All this has been entirely appropriate to the fairly modest commitments taken on by White. Now he mistakenly supposes that the moment for a counterattack has arrived and makes a careless move, which White could have punished. The situation required direct defence to be contin- ued for one more move, namely, by a renewed consolidation of the king's posi- tion by 6... ?g8. The reason is that Black may eventually be forced (by $Lg5) to play ...g6, after which Jlh6 would threaten the rook protecting f7. This point can be covered by the king after ...'i&gS; consequently, Black may then use both his rooks on the c-file, while retaining a sufficient direct defence of the castled posi- tion by ...g6, if necessary. 6...h6 would be weaker on account of 7 g4, while
6...fic7 is also incorrect, e.g. 7 h6 8 .f4 followed by g4.
7&f4? This throws away the chance of victory which was afforded by 7 £}d7!. Owing to the threat of Nxf6, Black loses the exchange. He is not helped by 7...Nxh2+ 8 Sxh2! (not 8 xh2? Rxd7 9 Bg5, since Black defends himself by 9...Rc7+ and

Rxh4# If one leaves aside Black's unpunished mistake on the sixth move, then the whole course of the game is a good illustration of the relationship between the scale of the attacker's commitment and the method of defence employed. In the first phase White is not heavily committed by his rook's excursion and Black car- ries out a cautious direct defence without compromising his king position. He also maintains his hold on the c-file and the centre and eliminates one enemy unit - the light-squared bishop. With f3 and g4 White has already taken on greater ob- ligations and so the time is ripe for indirect defence by means of an action along the c-file. As soon as another unit is eliminated (the knight on e5) it is all over with White's attack, whereas the counterattack grows from move to move, with White has an even simpler win by 7 JLgS!, after which Black must surrender a piece to avoid being mated on h7. Defending against the attack on the castled king 283 the lack of communication between the white rooks as the main cause of White's misfortune. Defence by a central thrust Attacks on the castled king in which the situation in the centre does not play a greater or lesser part are extremely rare, and as a rule it is precisely the soundness of the attacker's central formation which provides the basis for his attack. If this formation is not sound enough, the defender may use indirect defence against it in the first instance, aimed against the central formation's most vulnerable point. Why is it that the centre is quite so important and sensitive in the particular case of an attack on the castled king? Because this kind of attack is one of the most complex and many-sided operations in chess, demanding the maximum collaboration of the pieces and a control over all possible consequences right up to the endgame. The centre is the most versatile area on the chessboard; it pro- vides the best conditions for the full co-operation of the pieces - the basis on which positional play is founded and a prerequisite for a favourable endgame. Many-sidedness is the common property belonging to a sound attack on the cas- tled king and to the centre, and this accounts for their mutual interdependence. Correct defence must also be many-sided - this we have seen in the last series of examples - and so each Tittle crack in the centre' is more important to the de- fence than a variety of other weaknesses on the attacker's side. In some of the examples so far we have seen the centre acting as the basis of an attack, while in others the defender has employed indirect defence based on de- stroying the attacker's centre by sacrificing a piece. We have noticed particularly the case where the defender strives to centralize his pieces - giving a position which as a rule makes possible a combination of direct defence and the indirect form on the other flank. It still remains for us to look at the case of defence by means of a pawn thrust against the attacker's central formation. Before we pass on to examples, we must be clear that we are concerned here with a central thrust of a particular kind. For why should such a thrust be signifi- cant just at the critical phase of the attack? Why did the player not employ it ear- lier? The point is precisely that we are dealing here with cases where in fact the central thrust is not useful before the crisis, because the attacker has good replies to it. Only when he has increased his commitments and deployed his pieces for the attack does the moment for a thrust in the centre arise; and very often this oc- curs at a precise, given moment, not a move earlier or later. The following famous game provides a good example of a defensive thrust in the centre.
284 The Art of Attack in Chess
Alekhine - Botvinnik Nottingham, 1936 Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation Nb3 i.e6 9 f4 O-O 10 g4 (D ) In choosing the pawn avalanche as a means of attacking the castled king at an early stage of the game, White has undertaken a considerable obligation to carry out his attack incisively to the end. For if Black has his say, his counterattack will find a mass of weak points, files, and diagonals in White's territory; if an end- game is reached, White's advanced pawns may easily become 'cannon-fodder'. The moment of undertaking an obligation is also the moment of crisis, the mo- ment for the thrust in the centre, which in the Sicilian as a whole, and in this posi- tion particularly, is unstable. Botvinnik perceived the correct moment and struck with 10...d5!.
10...d5!
Let us first see why ...d5 is correct at the precise moment when White plays g4. Let us suppose he has played 10 O-O and examine the difference. 1) 10 O-O d5? 11 e5 Ne8 (11...d4 does not work, since White can simply take the pawn) 12 .f3 Nc7 13 Nc5, when Black must accept the weakening of his position by Nxe6 fxe6, since 13...d4 is defeated by 14 .xc6. 2) 10 g4 d5! 11 e5 d4! (now this move is good) 12 £}xd4 (or 12 exf6 Bxf6, when Black wins the piece back with the better game) 12...4bxd4 13 Jtxd4 Nxg4! 14 .xg4 Jlxg4, and Black preserves the material balance while gaining the advantage with regard to space, position, and time. There is undoubtedly a great difference between the first and second instances of ...d5. Defending against the attack on the castled king 285 Now the question arises why ...d5! is necessary in answer to 10 g4 and what happens if Black does not employ the defensive central thrust. This can be an- swered by citing the continuation of the game Foltys-Eliskases, Podebrad 1936, where in the same position Black met 10 g4 with 10...Na5 aiming at the square c4. The continuation was 11 g5 12 Bd4 (in the game Kan-Botvinnik, Mos- cow, 1936, 12 Rd2 was played, but Foltys' move is better) 12...Sc8 13 h4 Nc4
14 Nxc4 Sxc4 15 Rd3 Sc8 16 O-O-O Rd7 17 Sd2 Ng4 (to combat h5, but it sur-
renders d5 to the enemy knight) 18 £ki5 b6 19 f5 ! (the avalanche begins to move; Black cannot take the pawn, since the eventual Nxe7+ is decisive) 19...e6 20 Nxg7 >xg7 21 f6+ <Nh8 22 2te7 Sd8 23 Nd4 Ra4 24 £bl Nc7 25 h5 gxh5 26 Sdh2 Sd7 27 e5 (threatening 28 Rxh7+ xh7 29 Sxh5+ mating) 27...Sxe7 28 Sxh5 Bxh5 29 Sxh5 1-0 Now to return to the Nottingham game, in which Botvinnik did not allow him- self to be smothered in this way. 11 f5 Clearly, this is the only alternative to 11 e5 which has already been analysed. If 11 exd5 €jxd5 12 Nxd5, Black would gladly exchange queens by 12...Rxd5, thus winning the b-pawn, to say nothing of the ending. Il...Nc8 Though the bishop has to withdraw, it is still aggressively placed as far as White's weak pawns at f5 and g4 are concerned. 12 exd5 £}b4 There is to be no more talk of an attack on the king; the players are now con- cerned with a struggle for the centre pawn and the d5-square. If White holds out, he can expect success, but if Black overcomes the advancing pawn, the first player's prospects are poor. 13 d6? (D) Whenever Alekhine made an unexpected move the world of commentators dutifully gave it one or two exclamation marks. This happened in the case of this move too, which abandons the struggle for the square d5 and, in fact, also risks losing the game. A better line here is 13 ji.f3! gxf5 14 a3 fxg4 15 .g2. Suggested long ago by Dr Euwe, this was tried in the 2nd match game between Fischer and Reshevsky, New York 1961 when White secured an advantage after 15...Na6 16 Rd3 e6 17 O-O-O Nxd5 18 h3 g3 19 Hhgl Rd6 20 Nxd5 exd5 21 Nxd5 <Nh8 22 Nf4 Rg6. Now Fischer played 23 Rd2 but 23 Rf3! seems to me to be even stronger.
13...Rxd6?
Alekhine's original assertion that 13...exd6! was impossible because of 14 a3 £te6 15 g5 £}e8? 16 f6 etc., has remained unchallenged in chess literature. It is
286 The Art of Attack in Chess
clear, however, that in this kind of situation it is worth looking to see whether the sacrifice of a piece will work or not. Indeed, sound logic argues that it must work, for the whole variation quoted by Alekhine so strengthens Black's position that it is worth his giving up a knight for two pawns. Above all, White's position is exposed as a result of his pawn advances: the thrust d6 leaves him without a 'backbone' in the centre; the reply ...exd6 opens up the e-file and the diagonal d8-h4, while g5 relinquishes control of the c8-h3 diagonal to Black's c8-bishop. The sacrifice can take a number of forms, but I shall give the one which seems best to me. It runs 13...exd6! 14 a3 <Nc6 15 g5 Se8! with the following possibili- ties: 1) 16 gxf6 Sxe3 17 fxg7 (or 17 Nd5 Se5 18 fxg7 Rh4+ 19 sS?f1 Nxf5! and Blackhas a strong attack) 17... h4+ 18 d2 (or 18 <&fl Bxf5) 18...Rh6 19 el and Black has excellent chances. He has no need to consent to a draw by
19...Rh4+ 20 Nd2 Rh6, but can play for a win with 19...Bxf5.
2) 16 Bd4 Nxd4 17 xd4 Ng4 18 f6 Nxf6 19 gxf6 Rxf6 20 Sfl Rh4+ 21 Nd2 <Ne3 22 f3 Rh6 and Black wins. 3) 16 Xf2 e4 17 4jxe4 (or 17 f6 Nxc3 18 bxc3 .g4 19 cl Ra5 20 .d4 Nxd4 21 Rxd4 Rxg5 22 fxg7 Nxe2 23 Nxe2 Rg2 and Black wins) 17...2xe4

Rb5+ 24 Ne2 (alternatives are 24 d3 Rd5 and 24 Rd3 Rxg5) 24...Se4 25 fxg7 Sxe2 26 Rxe2 Wbl+ with advantage to Black. Botvinnik must certainly have prepared the move 10...d5 ! in his private analy- sis and so should have known all the important continuations. He had probably not reckoned with 13 d6?, and when Alekhine confronted him with it, did not venture on 13...exd6 but was bluffed into playing the drawing move 13...Rxd6?. All great masters, from Homer onwards, have engaged in a little bluff at times.

This position is from the game Kotov-Keres, Budapest Ct 1950. White's at- tack is extremely dangerous, his main threat being jlbl followed by c2. It is Black's move, and the moment is clearly suitable for a thrust in the centre, where Black has not yet engaged his opponent. Keres decided on 1...d5?, but the correct choice was l...d6!, as we shall see later. Let us first follow the course the game actually took. I...d5? 2 .bl!

288 The Art of Attack in Chess
After l...d5?, what is the outstanding feature of the play? Thanks to this move Black won the pawn on c4, but he neither obtained a proper counterattack nor did he harass White's 'captain in the centre', his pawn on e5. White's attack flowed on unchecked. So the move l...d5? had only the form of a central thrust and, in essence, did not greatly alter the situation. The true central thrust here, which does in fact parry the attack, is l...d6! - this has White's e-pawn as its target. Let us look at the variations that arise from this. I...d6! (D)
2 Jcbl
White could, admittedly, maintain his wedge in the centre by 2 f4, but Black would profit from this in two ways: f4 is closed to White's knight, while the con- tinuation 2...Re8 3 Wdl Bxc4 4 JLbl £3f5 5 Rc2 Rc6 shows that Black also has a tempo more here, since the white queen has needed two moves to reach c2; the combination of these factors turns things in Black's favour.
2.. .dxe5 3 dxe5
Now 3 Rc2 can of course be answered by 3...f5.
3...Re8 4 Rc2 g6 5 Jf4
Or 5 O-O Jtxc4 6 fiel Nb3 7 2a2 Nd4 ! 8 cxd4 Bxa2 9 .xa2 xh4, when White is left with neither an attack nor any compensation for the exchange.
5... 3xc4
The counterattack in the centre by ...d6 has attained its object: now White can- not sustain both his attack and his pawn on e5. He cannot achieve anything by 6 Nh5 <2texe5 7 Bf6 because of 7...£}d3+ 8 dl .b5 9 a4 J"Lxa4 10 Sxa4 Rxa4 and Black wins. If 6 £}xg6 fxg6 7 Jlg3, Black plays 7...Sd8, after which the threats of ...Sd2 and ...£}e3 guarantee him a material advantage. Should White take the g-pawn, then the exchange of queens leads to a won ending for Black. Defending against the attack on the castled king 289 The various continuations which result from the thrust l...d6! provide good examples of the following themes: 1) the destruction of the centre when this centre is essential to the attack; in this case Black also gained space for a counterattack via the centre; 2) liquidating the position to bring about a favourable ending on the basis of the defender's strength in the centre. Particular attention should be paid to those cases where the central thrust does not lead immediately to a decision but merely serves to maintain the tension in the centre. The next example illustrates the significance of this method of de- fence. The diagram below is taken from the game Marshall-Burn, Paris 1900. The opening ran as follows: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 £k3 Nf6 4 Bg5 Be7 5 e3 O-O 6 £T3 b6 (nowadays this is usually preceded by ...h6) 7 Bd3 .b7 8 cxd5 exd5 9 Bxf6 (the so-called Albin-Marshall Attack in the Queen's Gambit) 9...Bxf6 10 h4 (D) Here Burn timidly played 10...g6?; this was followed by 11 h5 He8 12 hxg6 hxg6 13 Rc2 -g7? (he should have played 13... g7 and if 14 O-O-O then
14...Sh8) 14 i.xg6 fxg6 15 Rxg6 2)d7 16 Ng5 Rf6 17 Sh8+ Nxh8 18 Rh7#.
In playing 10...g6? Burn probably wished to exclude the possibility of the classic bishop sacrifice; 10...h6? would not have been correct on account of 11 g4. But is the sacrifice really threatened? And has Black no better move to pre- vent it than one which weakens his king position? It is an interesting fact here that there is no threat of a sacrifice at all in the original position, yet, if Black plays 10...Se8 or 10...< d7, it is already, in practice anyway, rather dangerous, al- though it would still really be incorrect. Let us now play Black's most natural move, 10...c5!, and see why the sacrifice is incorrect: 11 -&.xh7+ xh7 12 Ng5+
290 The Art of Attack in Chess
<Nh6! (not 12... g6 because of 13 Rd3+ nor 12...*Ng8 on account of 13 Rh5) 13 £}e2 (White's most incisive move) 13...g6 14 Nf4 .xg5! (otherwise 15 h5 is strong; 14... g7 fails against 15 Nge6+) 15 hxg5+ 3?g7 (if IS.-. xgS then 16 Sh5+ affords good attacking prospects) 16 Sh6 (had Black played ... d7 rather than ...c5 on his tenth move, White would now have a chance with 16 Rg4)
16...SH8!1 (16...Rxg5 allows White to get some material back by 17 5xg6+) 17
Sxg6+ (or 17 Rg4 2xh6 18 gxh6+ h7) 17...fxg6 18 £}e6+ g8 19 4bxd8 Shl+20&d2Sxdl+21 Sxdl Bc8 22 dxc5 23 c6 e8 24 c7 Na6 with ad- vantage to Black. Accordingly, there was no threat of a sacrifice and Burn's 10...g6? simply weakened the position without any necessity; this is always a much more danger- ous thing than a forced weakening, as Tartakower so finely expressed in his Hypermodem. (For compulsion creates antitheses and hence the possibility of counterplay or compensation, while in the case of a voluntary weakening there is only a naked weak spot without compensation!) We shall now examine an example of play from the above diagram, where Black correctly maintains the tension in the centre as a means of defence, while avoiding as much as possible any weakening of his king position.
10...C5 11 g4
White sees that 11 Rc2 g6 12 h5 can be answered by 12...Re8 protecting g6 and threatening ...cxd4. If he then continues with 13 O-O-O Black resolves the central tension and starts an attack on the castled king (by 13. ..c4 14 Be2 b5, etc.) which is stronger than White's. 1 1 Wbl meets a similar response - and White can no longer castle queenside.
11...5.8
Putting pressure on White's d-pawn; now 12 g5 fails against 12...Jlxd4. 12 &fl The pressure in the centre has made White resort to artificial castling.
12...g6 (D)
This weakening is necessary and well-founded here, and therefore not an er- ror. Black perceives the prospects that his light-squared bishop has on the long diagonal, and to open this up he needs to maintain the pressure against d4; to achieve this his dark-squared bishop must also remain on its long diagonal, and accordingly the square g7 must be vacated to provide against g5. Black is natu- rally not afraid of the 'hanging pawns' arising from dxc5; indeed he actually 1 16...Jkc8 may be even stronger. By covering e6, Black eliminates the Sxg6+ trick and can safely take on g5 next move. Defending against the attack on the castled king 291 wants to induce them. In the presence of the two bishops such pawns are not usu- ally considered a weakness in any case; here there is the additional matter of forcing open the light-squared diagonal. The move 12...£te6 is worth mentioning too; this also increases the pressure on the square d4, but it allows 13 g5 after which 13...cxd4 is insufficient on ac- count of 14 gxf6 dxc3 15 Bxh7+!. The classic bishop sacrifice, incorrect on the eleventh move and replaced by g4, has appeared in a correct form in an altered

Black gives up the pressure on the centre temporarily in order to drive White's bishop back to bl, thus making it more difficult for the rook on al to go into ac- tion; this is important, since without both the rooks it is hard to carry out an attack on Black's 'artificially-fianchettoed' king position. 17 &bl If 17 Bb5 Black would be able to play 17...Se4! aiming to eliminate the en- emy rook, which is very annoying for him at h4.

11 The phases of the attack on
the castled king The exposition up to this point may have appeared to some readers to have been a series of fragments, in which the various aspects of the attack on the castled king have been closely looked at but which still need to be combined into a whole. However, it was essential first to collect together as much knowledge as possible about the various elements of the attack on the castled king, then to get to know the main principles of defence against this attack, and only after that to begin to bring everything together in this chapter, which is devoted to the temporal aspect or phases of the attack on the castled king. The temporal aspect here is naturally a framework for the points we wish to make, which rest on the following basic the- ses, already fairly well elaborated in earlier chapters. 1 ) An attack on the castled king cannot be successfully carried out on the ba- sis of the attacker's wishes or 'brilliance'alone, but the essential conditions for it must also be present. 2 ) These preconditions may be fulfilled to a greater or lesser degree, and the attacker's game must adapt itself accordingly. 3) The degree and type of these preconditions accurately determines the extent of the commitments which the attacker can undertake without harm; thus there is a logical and reciprocal relationship between preconditions and commitments, and by this the actual phase which the attack has reached can be recognized. The proposition of these theses, which will be illustrated in later examples, leads us first of all to a brief discussion of preconditions and commitments. Types of preconditions Preconditions are naturally contained in the position itself, whether in the at- tacker's territory or his opponent's. The attacker, for instance, may have his pieces strongly deployed in the vicin- ity of the enemy king position or aimed in that direction, and it may also be that the general mobility of his pieces or his advantage in space assists him in attacking. At the same time, there must be some deficiencies in the defender's camp; the chief of these is the vulnerability of the king position, either through weaknesses in the pawn structure or because pieces are misplaced in relation to the castled
294 The Art of Attack in Chess
position, being overburdened by obligations to cover squares on other parts of the board. These and similar preconditions should generally be fulfilled at the first or ini- tial phase of the attack, but it may also be that they can be created by force at this stage, e.g. by the provocation of weaknesses. The second phase of an attack can follow a wide variety of courses. It may be a question of a quick attack leading to mate, usually by means of a sacrifice, and in this case it is naturally unimportant to talk of further preconditions. However, if the attack is slower or does not have an uncompromising character, the second phase is usually concerned with the creation of further conditions as guarantees of success. The following are among the most important operations at this stage: the provocation of further weaknesses; the exclusion of one's opponent's coun- terattack or its suppression; control of the centre; restraint against a central coun- ter-thrust by one's opponent, and so on. The third phase of an attack is of course characterized by the execution, either in the form of mate, of obtaining a decisive material advantage, or of being able to call off the actual attack on the king and obtain a positional advantage or fa- vourable ending. Types of commitment To the above-mentioned types of preconditions necessary for an attack there also correspond various types of commitment which the attacker can, and indeed must, enter on, if he is going to attack. The commitments which correspond to the first phase are, of course, minor ones, usually a question of tempi. A player, for instance, spends a tempo improv- ing his prospects for an eventual attack, transferring a piece from one side of the board to the other or the like; admittedly, the degree of commitment involved is not great, but it can become significant if the attack on the king is never carried out. It is natural that contemporary masters, in an era of precise opening play, aim first of all at sound moves, which give nothing away to their opponents and con- stantly strengthen their general positional build-up; the result of play according to this recipe on both sides is that a drawn position is reached. It should also be said that Alekhine1 knew how to instil a little aggressiveness into his moves even in the opening and create some conditions for attack with a minimum of commit- ments. This is precisely where his skill lay, and it is this which is lacking in many masters. 1 and Kasparov! The phases of the attack on the castled king 295 A somewhat greater degree of commitment is entailed in the second phase. It may be a question here of a sacrifice accompanied by considerable compensa- tion, of the dislocation of a number of pieces, or, in particular, of the advance of the wing pawns, which as a rule represents a fairly far-reaching positional com- mitment. Still, in this phase too the sensible player aims to conduct his game with a minimum of commitments, unless he is undertaking an uncompromising mat- ing attack that is certain to succeed. It is especially important that the attacker should avoid a pattern of thinking whereby an unclear attack is reckoned as part of his compensation. For instance, he may sacrifice a knight for two pawns and an 'attack'; when that 'attack' peters out, his reckoning naturally falls to the ground. Assessment of preconditions and commitments One of the attacker's most important tasks is assessing the extent to which the preconditions for an attack are present and the degree of commitment which may be incurred. The following positions provide examples of this task. This position is from the game Botvinnik-Chekhover, Moscow 1935. It is White's move, and he has to decide on how to pursue what is already a promising initiative. He has the upper hand in the centre, a strong knight on e5, and well- placed bishops; all these factors together mean that he has some of the precondi- tions for an attack on the king, without yet having entered on any commitments. He can therefore be said to be on the threshold of the first phase and must conse- quently look for further moves which will prepare an attack, while committing himself as little as possible. Thus, it would clearly be out of the question to make a pawn advance with h3 and g4, since Black would then find it easy to parry the
296 The Art of Attack in Chess
main threat, after which White would be left only with pawn weaknesses, to say nothing of the dangers which would arise on the diagonal a8-hl. A slightly lesser degree of commitment would be entailed by White's ma- noeuvring his al -rook to h3 via el and e3, but it can be shown that such a dis- placement of the rook would in fact be premature; Black could easily parry the threats involved and then himself prepare for the counter-thrust ...b5 (e.g. by ...£}f8 and ...Sac8) thereby opening up the c-file, over which the white rook on h3 no longer has any influence. Because of this Botvinnik decided on a third plan, which involved the least degree of commitment; this consisted of transfer- ring the c3-knight via dl and f2 to h3 and thence on to g5. Admittedly, there is a definite commitment here too - in the shape of the number of tempi used; how- ever, Black cannot really take advantage of this, and there is the additional point that the threat posed by the position of the knight on g5 is quite genuine and can- not be easily parried. Now here is the course that the game took:
1 Re2!
First White thoroughly eliminates the possibility of Black's playing ...b5.
1...£tf8 2 Ndl Sa7
2.. .#te8 would probably have been better.
3 Rb8 4 2>h3 h6
Now there is a weakness in the black king position as well. White still presses on. 5 £}g5! hxg5 6 fxg5 This is of course already the second phase, since White is committed materi- ally; at the same time, his attack breaks through. If now 6... 6h7 7 Nxf7 £}xg5 (or 7...Axg5 8 Nxh7+ Nxh7 9 Rxe6') 8 Rh5 Ngh7, then 9 d5 exd5 10 h6+ Nh8 11 Rf7 f6 12 Rg8+ and 13 Nf7#. 1 6... 8d7 7 Nxf7 2 In fact, it would have been simpler and quicker to play 7 Nxd7 5xd7 8 gxf6 Nxf6 9 Sxf6 gxf6 10 Rg4+ *f8 11 Na3+ Sd6 12 Rf4 <Ne7 13 c5.

2 Recent analysis has shown that this further sacrifice is quite wrong, in that
Black could later play S.-.'i'fS! with fair defensive chances. Therefore White should have chosen 7 xd7, as given by Vukovic. The phases of the attack on the castled king 297 This position arose in the game Alekhine-Gilg, Semmering 1926. It is White's move, and he decided on an attack, although the preconditions were only par- tially fulfilled. Black's king position is weakened and some of White's pieces are well placed, but there is as yet no communication between his rooks. Meanwhile, it is of decisive importance that Black is able to launch a counterattack based on his control of d4 and the exposed position of the white king; the general instabil- ity in the centre is also to Black's advantage. We shall see how Alekhine's attack came to grief in this position. Ig4? Seeing that the preconditions for an attack have not been fulfilled, this addi- tional commitment by White turns against him. The correct move, objectively speaking, was 1 jLe3, which would have led to approximate equality but not to an attack on the king. 2 2Bxf6+ Rxf6 3 f5 d4 4 g5 Nxf3+ 5 Rxf3 hxg5 6 h4 Se8! 7 £dl

Since the exchange of queens is now forced (if 20 Wei, then 20...W6 would be decisive) the danger on the h-file disappears and Black's superiority in the endgame is decisive. White lost the game in due course. The game is also, of course, a good example of indirect defence. This position is from the game Gligoric-Kostic, Zagreb 1947. White was afraid that, if he allowed ...cxd4 cxd4, he would not be able to maintain his back- ward pawn at d4, so he played 1 d5 exd5 2 .xd5, intending to support the cen- tralized bishop on d5, if necessary, by c4. However, this is not a good plan, since it leaves White with an inflexible posi- tion as well as the danger of an inferior endgame. On the other hand, the back- ward d-pawn is not a great drawback, as long as White strives to obtain compensation in an attack on the king. The preconditions are in fact there, for Black's position has been weakened by ...h6, and White can rapidly post his queen and bishop on the bl-h7 diagonal and so force a further weakness in the shape of ...g6. It should also be noted that Black has no minor pieces on the kingside, while his knight and bishop on the queen's wing are obviously not suit- ably placed for defence. In the centre Black can only exchange pawns on d4, while a pawn advance on the queen side is too slow. The preconditions for an at- tack on the castled king are therefore fulfilled to a considerable measure; White The phases of the attack on the castled king 299 can play for an attack - indeed he must, for otherwise he may well find himself in difficulty over the backward pawn.

The creation of preconditions The preconditions for a successful attack on the castled king can arise in a num- ber of different ways. Some arise out of the normal process of building up a posi- tion; some are created by the player's own moves, which are specifically aimed at such an attack; some occur unnoticed, as it were, in the course of the game; and others are the result of risky or even faulty play by the opponent. Let us leave aside those cases where the preconditions are created 'unnoticed' or through faulty play and turn our attention to those whose origin is conscious and calcu- lated. In this connection we are already acquainted with a rule which has few ex- ceptions. Of all the diff 'erent preconditions for an attack on the king, one should create first those which entail the lesser degree of commitment, i.e. those which are of use not only in the event of an attack on the king, but also go to strengthen one's position in general. Good posts for one's pieces, spatial advantage, strength in the centre, the secu- rity of one's own king - all these are factors of use in an attack on the castled king but which do not commit one to it. Commitment occurs gradually as weaknesses in the castled position are induced and as a flexible central formation is trans- formed into a fixed one (e.g. when, with pawns at e4 and d4, one plays e5). In other words, weaknesses in a castled position can be full of point if it comes to an attack, but otherwise they may be without significance or even useful to the side which has incurred them, e.g. ...h6 may provide a flight square for the king; or ...g6 may prepare the advance ...f5. Equally, a premature advance in the centre
300 The Art of Attack in Chess
can entail a general positional commitment and so profit the opponent in various ways. More gradual commitments also arise from a regrouping of minor pieces outside the castling area but with the sole aim of attacking the castled king. It is already more difficult when it comes to transferring a rook to the third rank, since this rook will need some time to return and reopen communication with the other one, should the attack not succeed. The engagement of minor pieces in the vicin- ity of the castling area (e.g. as a result of moving a knight to g5) also involves a heavier commitment in terms of tempi. However, the heaviest commitments are those incurred in an attack carried out with the aid of pawns. Of these the heavi- est is usually incurred by advancing the g-pawn, next comes the advance of the h-pawn, while advancing the f-pawn entails the least commitment. Now we have a small graduated scale for the degree of commitment incurred by the various op- erations which are necessary to create the preconditions for an attack on the cas- tled king; it need not be emphasized, perhaps, that this scale has only a general and approximate validity. Let us now examine the following example from prac- tical play. This position is from the opening stages of the game Alekhine-Weenink, Prague 1931. It is White to move. INd3! The textbooks gave .c4; Alekhine's move takes into account the fact that Black is about to castle kingside and threatens e4 and e5 followed by Bxh7 Iw- (whether Black castles or not). As a result, Black has no better move than ...h6, which means that a weakness in his castled position has already been brought about, and without any special expenditure in time by White, since Bd3 is a natu- ral developing move in this position. Inducing weaknesses like this is naturally correct in any circumstances. The phases of the attack on the castled king 301
1...h6 2 e4 Rd8 3 O-O 2>bd7 4 b4
With his second move White occupied the centre, with his third he made his king secure, and now he safeguards his central position against the counter-thrust ...c5. Apart from this, b4 prepares the ground for piece regrouping on the queenside.
4...O-O 5 Re2
This contains the threat of 6 e5 followed by 7 Re4 but, at the same time, does not yet commit White in the centre. It would be a mistake to play 5 e5 Nd5 6 Sb3 Se8 7 Re2 £}f8, since Black would then have managed to centralize his knight at d5 and invalidate the attack based on Re4. The move e5 must clearly be reserved for a later moment when ev- erything else is ready.
5...2e8 6 Zb3!
Primarily, this frees the square bl for the bishop so that the queen may be placed in front of it on the diagonal bl-h7. It also makes it possible to transfer the rook to g3 or h3 as part of the attack later on, but it does not otherwise commit White to an attack on the castled king, since the rook can also be used for play, for instance, on the c-file.
6...Rc7 7 &bl h7 (D)
Black is too weak to fight back in the centre by 7...e5. After 8 dxe5 £}xe5 9 £}xe5 Rxe5 10 jLb2 White obtains a strong attacking position. If 7...Nf8 (in or- der to meet 8 e5 with 8... d5) then 8 followed by Sg3, etc. 8e5 This central pawn thrust commits White more than any other move hitherto. Clearly, he is now no longer thinking of the endgame but is intent on forcing home an attack on the castled king. It is of decisive importance that Black does
302 The Art of Attack in Chess
not have ... d5 available; if he plays, for example, 8... b6, White's threats take effect even more quickly, e.g. 9 Re4 10 Rg4 <Nh8 11 Rh5, etc. So Black must resort to defence and not play for ...£k!5.

White's heaviest positional commitment in the game, the move g4, occurs exactly at the moment when the attack on the castled king has come to a head. The reader should observe the time sequence of each operation in this game, particularly with reference to the degree of commitment. The mild commitment incurred by Sb3!, the greater one by e5, and the heaviest one by g4, correspond exactly to the phases of the attack and to the strength of the threats which White has at his disposal. After this example, in which we have seen the temporal relationship between the various operations designed to create the preconditions for an attack, let us turn to a separate examination of each of these operations. First, the inducement of weaknesses in the castled position. This is an impor- tant operation, although it usually forms part of another operation and tends to be limited to one or two moves. It can take the form either of the unprovoked or faulty weakening of the castled position or of the correct advance of a pawn or pawns in front of the king which, because of faulty play later on, results in an ap- preciable weakness (e.g. when a flight square for the king, originally advanta- geous, becomes a weakness); then there is the case of the weakness which is enforced early on without any loss of tempo, while on the other hand, there are weak points which arise in the sacrificial whirlpool of the attack's final phase. All these cases show our theme in its wider sense. In the narrower sense, the inducement of weaknesses implies an operation on which the attacker spends one or more tempi with the sole aim of weakening his opponent's castled posi- tion in a definite way. An operation of this kind which entails an expenditure of several tempi represents a very real commitment, and so it usually belongs to a stage when most of the conditions necessary for an attack have already been ful- filled. There have already been many examples of the inducement of weaknesses, so two will be sufficient here. The phases of the attack on the castled king 303 w This position is from the game Lilienthal-Bondarevsky, USSR Absolute Championship, Leningrad/Moscow 1941. Black had come to grief through play- ing an incorrect version of the Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez; a pawn up, White does not have a hard task ahead.

White wins after both 13...Rxg5 14 fig4 and 13...fxg5 14 Qxc6. 1-0 Black did not wait for the unanswerable 14 Jlxd5. The continuation from this diagram shows the correct enforcing of a weakness on g6 followed up by consistent play against the focal-point g7; an alternative line illustrates how provocation can be exaggerated with the result that it turns against the attacker. l dl The queen, on its way to d3, gains a tempo by attacking the knight. The alter- native iWbl h6 2Wdl b5 3 Rd3 g6 is inferior. Here, besides the essential weak- ness at g6, White has also extracted a 'secondary' one at h6, but in fact this is not a weakness at all, since it simplifies Black's defence of the focal-point g7. For ex- ample, after 4 Jkf6 Bd8 5 Rh3 Bxf6 6 exf6 <Nh7 7 Sfl Bh8! 8 2f3 g8 Black has defended himself against White's main threat of Rxh6+, and consequently the situation is no longer clear.

The next three examples are concerned with cases where the creation of the preconditions for the attack on the king demands the removal of the opponent's pieces from defensive positions or their displacement in some way. This position is taken from the game O'Kelly-Castaldi, Hilversum 1947. Here Black's king position has already been weakened, White's pieces are all well posted, and there is no danger of counterplay in the centre or, indeed, anywhere; the only real obstacle is Black's queen, which is defending the kingside well at the moment, e.g. if 1 Rh6, then 1...Rg7. So the action White takes has the aim of inveigling Black's queen to as far away as b8!

In the following diagram, some of the preconditions for an attack on Black's king position are already present. White's pieces are fairly well placed, and the blocked centre makes it difficult for Black to counterattack. A breakthrough by ...b5-b4 would require rather lengthy preparation, while the other possibility -
306 The Art of Attack in Chess
capturing White's a-pawn - would bring him too little in return for the tempi spent on it. On the other hand, there are Black's un weakened king position and White's weakness on the light squares. The latter makes itself felt if the position is opened up. But how is White to progress, if he is not to play f5, i.e. if he does not loosen up the situation on the light squares a little? Surely not by 1 Ng5, which clearly involves a doubtful sacrifice. Nor by 1 g4 £k6 2 Nh4, on which Black plays 2...f5; for while, logically, the blocked position should then be over- come by 3 exf6, in fact the reply 3...gxf6 opens up the prospect of counterplay for Black by ...e5. There is no doubt about it: the position is not yet ripe for an attack on the king; it needs to be strengthened still further, or more exactly, the black pieces need to be driven further away. This can be done by playing the dark-squared bishop, with gain of tempo, on to the diagonal a3-f8, where it will settle. 1 i.cl Se8 2 Jla3 Rd7 The defence is even more difficult after 2...Rc7.

The precondi- tions for an attack on Black's king position have been only partially fulfilled; White is hindered particularly by the possibility of a counterattack by Black in the centre or down the c-file. White's prospects would be better if he could suc- ceed in driving away the f6- knight by e5 and then play <?3e4. To manage this he must first repulse the black knight from c4, which means sacrificing a pawn. That was just the sort of thing Yates was in the mood for. 1 b3! Nxa3 Black falls in with White's plan and imperils his knight on a3. In taking on this commitment he enables White to acquire additional preconditions for an attack on the king. If Black had played l...£jb6, which would have been better, White would have had to build up more slowly with 2 .b2. 2 e5! Ne8?

Now the preconditions for an attack on the king are suddenly fulfilled. One black knight has been driven back to e8 and the other deflected to a3; while White's pawn on e5, supported by two good knights, provides a wedge in the centre. All this has cost only one pawn.

Of the cases where the opponent himself creates a precondition for an attack on the castled king the most important is that which involves the release of ten- sion in the centre. The next diagram provides a good example. This position is from the game Euwe-Maroczy, Zandvoort 1936. It is Black's move.
1...C4?
This releases the tension in the centre and so creates the one precondition which White still lacked before he could embark on an attack against the enemy king. Maroczy, a great expert on defence, is playing here under the influence of the thinking of the old school, which paid insufficient attention to the problems of the centre. In the Orthodox Defence to the Queen's Gambit, resolving the central tension by ...c4 generally gives White a powerful attack on the king, for a coun- terattack based on a pawn majority on the wing is much slower than that which takes place in the centre. The thematic move for Black here would be l...Rb6, but that entails the dan- ger of his knight being diverted from the defence of the square h7; e.g., 2 <Nxd7 Nxd7 3 dxc5 £}xc5 4 JLbl, threatening c2.

Old and modern styles in building up an attack on the king The following three games reflect the differences of two periods and three indi- vidual styles in preparing and conducting attacks on the king. The first is a sam- ple of old-time brilliance, showing the unfolding of an overwhelming attack The phases of the attack on the castled king 311 resulting from feeble opening play by the opponent. In the second Black makes a risky experiment, and one of his pawns, wandering lonely among the white pieces on the kingside, remains as a consolation and the germ of the subsequent attack. In the third game the underlying conception of the attack is quite differ- ent, its main feature being Capablanca's rational and cautious method of ensur- ing that every possible means of counterplay on the part of his opponent is first suppressed.

If Black were then to take the d-pawn, the material balance would be restored but at the cost of allowing White to assume the initiative. For example, after
25...Nxd5 (not 25...Rxd5 because of 26 Se8+) 26 Qb3 Black is suddenly in dif-
ficulties owing to the threat of Scdl which is decisive even against ...*Nh8; con- sequently, he is forced to play 26... b5 27 Scdl Rxb3 28 cxb3 Sxdl 29 Sxdl and go into an unfavourable ending with the white rook on the seventh rank.

Up to here White has built up a series of preconditions for an attack on the en- emy king without making any moves which commit him to it. Now, without any real need, he goes in for such a move. Black's position is not yet ready to be taken by storm, so h4 is still premature. According to the scheme which we have worked out, now would be the time to complete the preconditions for the attack without incurring any positional commitments. White's queen is not yet secure in its possession of the long dark diagonal in view of the possibility of ...Sad8 followed later by ...4Ba4, and accordingly, priority should have been given to re- straining such counterplay, e.g. by 19 b3 Sad8 20 Rc3. Then after 20...£ac8, in- tending ...c5, Black's plan would be frustrated by 21 Ra5. Moreover, h4 is unsuitable in that it makes it more difficult to carry out the the- matic move f4 (because of the hole left on g4). However, White's position is strong enough to stand even h4 though it entails the expenditure of greater effort than otherwise would have been necessary.

318 The Art of Attack in Chess
23 a3 Starting with 21 Kfel, this is already White's third consolidating move. Be- fore storming the castled position White first of all excludes every prospect of counterplay by Black; a3 is intended particularly to deprive Black's queen of the square b4. This type of preparation for an attack on the king characterizes many of Capablanca's games. Alekhine preferred a different way of restraining counterplay, namely indirectly by means of dynamic blows. Hence the impres- sion of Alekhine's excessive eagerness and Capablanca's exaggerated caution as the characteristics of their styles. In fact everything depends on the specific posi- tion; in some cases Alekhine's method is correct, in others Capablanca's.

Fluctuations in the phases of attack To conclude the chapter some observations should be added, with examples, to dissuade the reader from accepting the principles and maxims expounded as a rigid pattern. The game of chess is too complex and rich for it to be possible to re- veal its finer points fully on the basis of a few formulae. The practical player comes up against exceptions at every turn. Consequently, Lasker is right when he recommends in his book Common Sense in Chess that players should follow the principles of chess with a dash of humour... So if we have already seen how the preconditions for an attack on the castled king are created and how the attacker's commitments grow in proportion to the force and form of his attack, it still remains to point out some cases where things develop rather differently: cases where the attack appears to slacken off and, in- stead of a vigorous assault, suddenly requires quiet moves; where the player only toys with his attack and is in fact aiming at other goals; or where great masters grope in the dark and fail to see something right in front of their noses. Quiet moves that kindle the attack So-called quiet moves are often only apparently quiet, and may in fact spark off a fire just as violent ones do. Moves of this type usually occur in positions where the attack appears to be flagging but has in fact reached a point at which a belated addition has to be made to the preconditions in the form of a quiet move, if the at- tacker is to get any further. Here are a few examples of this kind of quiet move, il- lustrating the fluctuations that occur in the phases of attack. The following position is from the game Teichmann-Schlechter, Carlsbad
1911. It is White's move, and he begins with a sacrifice on f7.
1 Nxf7+ Nxf7 2 Ng5+ Ng8 3 Rh5 2>xf5 4 Rxh7+ Nf8 5 Rxf5+ <Ng8
After 5...<Ne7 6 Re6+ Nd8 7 Nf7+ Black would lose his queen. 6Wg6! After a series of checks we suddenly get this quiet move, which does not pro- vide any additional threat but merely blocks the g-pawn. This is precisely to the
320 The Art of Attack in Chess
point in this position, since if, for example, 6 Se3, Black plays 6...g6 7 Rxg6+ Rg7, when White is still a long way from his goal. The fact that it is both possible and good to devote a whole tempo to blocking the g-pawn is a result of Black's inability to organize an effective defence. He cannot move his queen or rook to e7 on account of Rh7+ and Rh8#, while 6...Ne7 is answered by 7 Rf7+ fol- lowed by 8 Se3. The game ended 6...Rd7 7 Se3 1-0, Black having no reply to 8 Sf3 and 9 Rh7#. to This position is from the game Steinitz-Lasker, London 1899. Black began with a double sacrifice.

1...Nc3!, after which 2 £}f6+ gxf6 3 exf6 does not work on account of 3...£te2+

Just as soon as the attacking formation is completely developed, this precau- tionary waiting move follows with full force. Black is now powerless against the threat of Rf6+ followed by £je4-d6+. If 4... ?e8, then 5 <2)h7 Re7 6 <Nxf8 Rxf8

The solution is simple when it is demonstrated, but for psychological reasons it is difficult to find; first, because we would rather believe in 'finessing and strengthening the position by indirect moves' than in a banal pursuit of the king; and secondly, because the move Sxdl needs to be inserted at exactly the right moment. Toying with an attack An attack on the king as an alternative which never materializes but which acts solely as a subsidiary threat in the context of play with other objectives is a phe- nomenon which is abundantly represented in the games of the masters. The player merely toys with the plan of an attack on the king while, in fact, he is pre- paring and carrying out some other operation - a procedure which has a point if the threat to attack brings the player some advantage in tempi or helps the de- ployment of his pieces for the other operation. The advantage may take the form of the opponent's withdrawing a piece to the defence, as a result of which its ef- fectiveness elsewhere is lost or diminished. Or it may be that the move by which the player has built up the threat of an attack at the same time gains a tempo for the other operation. These are the simple ingredients of an objective 'toying' with the attack on the castled king. The subjective or psychological exploitation of the threat to the castled position can also involve various other motives. The threat can, for example, produce a feeling of insecurity in the opponent, oblige him to spend too much time in thinking, or even induce him to make some precaution- ary move merely to relieve his anxiety by the easiest means available. This last case can often be seen in the games of weaker players, when they play ...h6 'for safety's sake', but in a subtler and less perceptible way it also happens that mas- ters weaken their king positions in order to parry imaginary threats. We need only recall Burn's move ...g6 (page 289) as a defence against an incorrect classic bishop sacrifice! Questions like this fall outside the range of an objective treat- ment of the theme; the various forms of camouflage, the use of imaginary threats, speculation on an opponent's shortcomings, all these are features of practical play which have resulted from the dictates of that 'cruel, heavy-handed tourna- ment machine' - the clock. We are interested here only in the objective (i.e. cor- rect) threat and the objective (i.e. properly justified) reaction to it.
324 The Art of Attack in Chess
White is the better placed; he owes his superiority to the advanced position of his e-pawn, which secures him an advantage in space and cramps Black. The ac- tive placing of his pieces, the blocked centre, and the weakened enemy king posi- tion are all preconditions for an attack on the castled king. However, White has yet another advantage, namely, his rooks are united and he is a tempo ahead as re- gards control of the c-file; this would incline him towards a positional treatment of the game rather than an attack. One asks oneself whether the best plan is to attack or play on the c-file? The answer is that one should threaten an attack and continue to promote the precon- ditions for it; then, if Black defends correctly, the prospects of successful play on the c-file will be enhanced. Two moves which threaten the enemy king position are worth considering, i.e.
1 JLbl, threatening Rc2, and 1 Re3, which threatens a sacrificial assault on h6. If
1 JLbl, Black plays l...Se8 and parries 2 Rc2 with 2...£tf8. It would appear that
the time is then ripe for play on the c-file, but after the continuation 3 Rc7 Rxc7
4 Sxc7 Sab 8 5 Sfc 1 it is clear that this particular bolt has been shot; Black plays
5...jLd8 followed by ...Bb6, and White has nothing left on the c-file. The other
method is better.
1 Re3! Se8
This is forced; Black cannot defend himself without ...Nf8, as the following variations show: Bg5, when Black has no defence against Rh6+ followed by Jth7+, Af5+ and Nxe6+) 5 Rh7+ <Nf8 6 Rh8+ <Nf7 7 Ng5#. 2) l...Rb6 2 Bxh6 gxh6 3 Rxh6 f5 4 exf6 <Nxf6 (for 4...Sxf6 see above) 5 Rg6+ followed by mate. The phases of the attack on the castled king 325 3) 1... b6 2 JLbl ! \ and now, besides Jlxh6, there is also a threat of Rd3, etc.
2 Bc3 Nf8
Black has to withdraw his knight to the defence, since there is once again a threat of Bxh6. If, for example, 2...Rb6 (2...b4 3 axb4 Bxb4 4 Hb3 allows White to gain an important tempo for his attack) then 3 Bxh6 gxh6 4 Rxh6 W8 5 £}g5 Bxg5 6 Rxg5+ Nh8 7 Jtbl.
3 Bfcl (D)
One might well consider strengthening the attack even further by 3 h4. How- ever, that is a commitment, and its consequences are not clear. With 3 Bfc 1 White goes for play on the c-file, for which the conditions now are fundamentally better than in the position with which we started. On the one hand, White has gained the time to double rooks, and on the other, he has driven Black's knight back to f8, where it is now one tempo further away from the critical square c4, on which it clearly belongs. White owes his advantage here to his 'toying' with an attack on the castled king. The rest of the game is a matter of positional technique, and it could run as follows: 3,..Bc8 (if Black allows Ec7, then the threat of a sacrifice on h6 is renewed!) 4 Bxc8 Bxc8 5 Wei Bb7 6 d2! (if a good ending is White's objective, the dark-squared bishops should be exchanged as soon as possible)
6...Rd7 7 Nb4 Bc8 (or 7...Nd8 8 Aa5, when 8...i.e7 fails against 9 Bc7) 8
Bxe7 Excl 9 Wxcl Rxe7 10 Rc3 Rd7 (if 10...Nd7 , then 11 Rc7 is decisive) 11 £ki2, and White has a considerable advantage by virtue of his better bishop and more active knight. Black cannot avoid exchanging queens, after which an ex- change of knights or of the white bishop for the black knight would eventually leave White with a very favourable ending.
1 In this line White can still play 2 Bxh6.
326 The Art of Attack in Chess
'Not seeing in front of one's nose' It is a good thing to co-ordinate one's moves in an 'integrated action', but one should always try to see what is 'in front of one's nose' ; that is, if one can mate at once, one should do so and not philosophize about pawns. This somehow hap- pened once to Dr Vidmar, who (as White) reached the following position against Yates at London, 1922. This position is one in which White can win easily, but in a misguided moment he hit on the idea of 'combining everything into an integral whole' , i.e. he wanted both to attack and, at the same time, to 'cash in' on Black's e-pawn. As a result of this faulty desire to achieve two ends a drawn position was reached, which Black, however, proceeded to spoil and eventually to lose. Let us look first at the course the game took. 1 d5?I i.a8 2 Rh3 h6 3 Sfg4 st?h7 4 2>xe4? Rf8 5 xf6+ In his book A Half-Century at the Chessboard the great Yugoslav master re- cords that he spent three-quarters of an hour thinking at this point and then de- cided on the sacrifice. After his incorrect capture of the e-pawn there was no other choice left.
5...Rxf6 6 Sg6 Rf8?
This is a mistake; Black now lost after 7 Rg4! Rf7 8 Rg5 Nh8 (otherwise Rxh6+ wins) 9 f6 Rxd5 10 5hxh6+ 1-0. Black could have drawn by playing the natural move 6...Rxb2, e.g. 7 Shxh6+ g8 8 Hh8+ and if 9 fixg7+, then 9...Rxg7 10 Sh7 Bxd5, when White has nothing better than perpetual check. In the book mentioned above Dr Vidmar emphasizes how in this game the at- tack on the black king and the pressure on his e-pawn 'combined together to form The phases of the attack on the castled king 327 a greater whole' . But it is precisely this false union of ideas which was the reason for White's failure to discover the correct path to victory as, after 4,,.Rf8, he lis- tened to Big Ben chime quarter after quarter while his knight remained sus- pended in mid-air at e4. It is true that in the diagrammed position there are two factors making up White's advantage: a powerful kingside attack and a favour- able knight versus bishop ending (once all the heavy pieces are exchanged). These two elements could only be combined if the attack led to the exchange of the queens and rooks, but the attack can break through without exchanges, and consequently it is beside the point how good the ending is. In fact, taking the pawn on e4 promotes neither White's attack nor his endgame prospects, but sim- ply gives Black an opportunity of counterattacking along the e-file. Victory for White is an altogether easy matter, as long as he concerns himself entirely with the attack and forgets the pawn on e4 :
1 Rh3 h6 2 Sfg4 Nh7
This is all forced. 3 4te2! (D) White simply transfers the knight to h5 and carefully avoids the poisonous pawn on e4 !
3...a5
White also wins after both 3...Sh8 4 4bf4 Jld7 5 Sg6 Ng8 6 hS1 and 3...Rf8 (or 3...Bd5 4 £rf4) 4 £tf4 followed by Sg6 and 4bh5.
4 Sg6 Rf8 5 Nf4 b4 6 Nh5 If 7
Otherwise White wins even more quickly by <Nxf6+.
1 Unfortunately this runs into 6...Rxg6, but White could have won earlier by 5

The quickest and most precise.
9...XLxg6 10 Eh8+ Nf7 11 Sh7+ Rg7 12 Rxg6+ with a quick mate.
This shows how play should have proceeded from the original position, but things would have gone much the same way if, instead of 4 £}xe4?, White had played 4 4be2!, a point of which the reader can easily convince himself. 1 d5?! was only the first step along the wrong path, but 4 Nxe4? was a mistake which could have cost half a point. So it turned out that Dr Vidmar failed to see something 'in front of his nose' in London in 1922, nor did he see it thirty years later when he was writing his book. In this there is without doubt a touch of humour, the humour which Lasker rec- ommended as an addition to every sizeable dose of chess principles. From attack to endgame A host of examples could be given to illustrate the transition from an attack on the king into the endgame. It may be a question of heading for a drawn position as a lesser evil to the failure which would result from continuing the attack; it may also be that one variation of the attacker's combination leads to an ending. However, cases such as these do not really belong here. We are only interested at this point in cases where the attacker deliberately calls off the attack because his success is better assured by a favourable endgame. The classic exponent of the liquidation of an attack and the transition into the endgame was Pillsbury, so we shall open a series of examples with one of his games. The phases of the attack on the castled king 329 This position is from Pillsbury-Maroczy, Paris 1900. Although the situation is still far removed from the endgame, White is thinking about it all the same. Ifia5 He prepares for the exchange of the dark-squared bishops by means of Bc5, after which there is both an eventual threat of a bishop sacrifice on h7 and the prospect of an ending with White having a good knight against a bad bishop. 2 <±>hl Ece8 Avoiding the possibility of 3 Bc5 Bxc5 4 Hxc5 Rb6? 5 Hxc8.
3 Bc5 Rc7 4 Nxe7 Hxe7 5 g4
The positional obligation entailed by such a move is balanced by the fact that in this position White has no need to fear the endgame. If his opponent's dark- squared bishop were still there, the move would be risky.
5...Nc6 6 Saal fxg4 7 Rh4 g6 8 Rxg4 Hg7 9 h4 2te7?!
Black defends himself against an attack which is not dangerous and neglects something much more important, namely, the central point d4, which is of deci- sive significance in many types of ending. Precisely the opposite course was cor- rect, that is, to increase his influence over d4 and at the same time, by 9...Rb6, to question White with regard to what his plans were for the dark-square network. In view of the threat of 10...Re3 White would have to play 10 Hael, after which

15...6h8 16 <Nh2 fif8 17 h5
Pillsbury intends to establish his knight on the outpost at g5 and so gives up the line of play leading to an ending which he has followed up to here. The end of the game, which is no longer germane to our theme, runs as fol- lows: 17...fig4 18 £}g5 Sxf4 19 f7+ Rxf7 20 Rxf4 Rxh5+ 21 g3 Re2 22 Nh4 Sc8 23 Sael Rxb2 24 <Nh3 5xc3+ 25 5g3 2c2 26 fill 1 Sc8 27 Rh6 1-0' If 27...Rxe5, then 28 Rxh7+ and 29 g2#. In this position from Bogoljubow-Przepiorka, Pistyan 1922 the liquidation leading to an ending comes as the direct consequence of White's combination.

If 6...h6, then 7 £te7+? Nh7 8 £}f5? would be incorrect on account of 8...W1+ and 9...Sg8+; however, White can play 7 Qxh6 f5 8 Rg6+ h8 (or 8...Rg7 9 <2Be7+ Nh8 10 Rxh5+ Rh7 11 £}g6+, when White wins easily) 9 Nf6 Sxf6 10 xf6+, and the ending is won for White.

4.. >c8 1 5 Sxd7 Rxd7 6 Sdl Qc7 7 i.g5!
White breaks off his attack and steers the game towards an ending in which there are two factors which ensure him a clear advantage: control of the d-file and play against Black's weak c-pawn.
7.. .1,xg5 8 Rxg5 h6
White now continued with the thematic 9 Rd2 allowing the reply 9...i.e4; the result was that after 10 Rd7 fic8 11 f3 i.c2 12 2d2 i.bl Black's bishop got in among the small fry on the queenside, and it needed further incorrect play by Rabinovich before he eventually lost. Instead of 9 Rd2, White should have played 9 Re3, which indirectly maintains his control of the d-file and also pre- pares for Sd3 and Qd2. The next example will serve as an excellent conclusion to our discussion of the transition to the endgame. White's attack has got to the point where it exerts

332 The Art of Attack in Chess
strong pressure on the focal-point h7, and it seems that the end must come quickly. However, appearances are deceptive, for there is no mate and Black can escape into an ending in which he can continue to resist. Thus, after 1 Bh7+ *Nh8 2 Bg6+ < ?g8 3 jtxf7+ Rxf7 4 3xf7 xf7, White runs out of checks and is unable to prevent Black from posting his rook on d7, af- ter which it is not at all clear how White can win. Another possibility is 1 Nh7, and this leads to even greater material gains; Black is obliged to play 1... 3e4!, but after 2 Bxe4 dxe4 3 3f6+ Rxf6 4 Rxf6 e3 the black pawn forces White's queen to retire, e.g. 5 Wfl (or 5 Rg5+ <Nf8) 5...e2 6 el f8, and White can hardly count on victory. Here we have, as a start, two ways in which the position resolves itself into an ending; the further analysis of the position should soon convince the reader that at every move there is a variety of possible simplifying lines, most of which lead to different types of endings. The winning process for White is based on the gradual preparation of the pawn structure on the queenside in readiness for the transition into an ending. In this two factors are decisive: the first is that, besides his knight on f6, Black's queen is also immobilized since it cannot move from e7 because of the need to cover the squares f7 and f6; the second is that Black's pawns are also condemned to stay where they are. Any move on their part leads to Black's losing in the end- game after the manoeuvre .h7+, 4Lg6+ and ,xf7+. Accordingly, Black may only move his rook up and down, and even then he is denied the use of the square f8 because of Nh7. Now for the analysis: 1 c4! Sd8 Forced; White threatened 2 cxd5 cxd5 3 <Nh7+ hS 4 Ae4+ g8 5 Bxd5 Sf8
6 Rg6+ * h8 7 Bxf7. If l...dxc4, then 2 "Nh7+ followed by 3 Bd3+ and 4 Bxc4
wins in the same way. The phases of the attack on the castled king 333 2 c5! A step further towards a favourable ending. If 2 cxd5, then Black's best reply is 2...Exd5!. Also possible here is 2 Jth7+ h8 3 -fi.g6+ Ng8 4 .xf7+ Rxf7 5 Rh8+ ?xh8 6 Nxf7+ gS 7 Nxd8, but after 7...dxc4 8 bxc4 b5, Black's pros- pects of a draw are more than good. Now 2...Ee8 does not work because of 3 Nh7 <5be4 4 cl !, when Black is left without the possibility of ...Rd6 (which would have been an effective answer prior to c5) and at the same time there is a threat of 5 .xe4, etc., now that the white king can hold the enemy e-pawn. If 4...f6, then 5 uLxc4 dxe4 6 Rg6+ Nh8
7 Nxf6 and White wins.
3 <Na3 Eb8 It is easy to see that after 3...a5 White will win an ending with queen versus rook and knight because the pawn on plifies into an ending, and this time Black loses the pawns on a6 and c6, e.g. 4 Nh7+ Nh8 5 xf7+ Rxf7 6 Ng6+ Ng8 7 Nxf7+ <Nxf7 8 Rf4 Ec8 9 >b4 Ne7

If 4...b5+, then 5 cxb6 Exb6 6 Bh7+ followed by capturing the queen at f7 and winning the ending of queen versus rook and knight, much as above. 5 c4! Eb8 6 cxd5 cxd5 7 <Na3!

The reader may care to investigate this rather studied example further, all the secrets of which lie in the moves made by the pawns on the queenside; the final outcome of the ending rests with them, for without them White is unable to win.
12 The attack on the king as an
integral part of the game We have examined the various aspects of the attack on the castled king and have covered each topic on the basis of present-day knowledge of the art of chess. This material has been presented with all the difficulties and deficiencies of a pioneer, but with the joy of a discoverer who has seen in new knowledge a confirmation of his faith in the values of chess and his own general theory of the game. The atten- tive reader who has battled his way with the writer from chapter to chapter will have observed the steady widening of the problem of the attack on the king; we began with the basic techniques of combination and have progressed to the kind of understanding which characterizes mastery of the game. The logical path we have taken has justified its call for a high degree of effort in return for new knowl- edge; its purpose is to show us the significance of the attack on the castled king in the full context of a game of chess. From our examination of the defence against a kingside attack and of the phases of such an attack, it has become clear that a correct attack is conditioned by the situation on all parts of the board and also by all that has happened in the earlier course of the game. An attack on the king is not some strange, exceptional, and daring operation like a grand slam in bridge. It is an action which is both logical and necessary; an action on which a player decides at a certain stage of the game; sometimes, indeed, he must decide on it, if his opponent is not to obtain an advantage or if the position is not to fizzle out into a draw. Lasker observed long ago that every action is essentially a diversion, a transi- tion from equality to some spatial or temporal commitment. An attack on the king demands a very large diversion both in terms of the number of pieces in- volved and of the degree of commitment arising out of any pawn moves it entails. A considerable diversion of this kind also logically needs a considerable number of preconditions, as well as a knowledge of how these conditions are interrelated. It follows, therefore, that the attack on the castled king is an extremely difficult operation, which is based on a perfect mastery of all the forms of chess tech- nique. Even in the early stages of the opening the first seeds of the preconditions for an attack on the king are already being sown, and the tense struggle for the central squares is tightly bound up with the successful outcome of the attack or defence. The characteristic features of a position, the weaknesses on both sides, The attack on the king as an integral part of the game 335 and the elements that affect the endgame - all these accumulate and become in- tertwined in such a way that at a certain moment they impel the player to decide on the final objective of his play. This is the moment of crisis in the drama of the games of great masters, when it has to be decided whether it is best to continue promoting the preconditions for an attack on the king or to seek a favourable end- ing. The decision is not easy, for both courses demand not only technique but the ability to weld all the elements involved into a whole; moreover, we are still in the dark about many of the laws governing this process. Chess skill at the present time comprises a mastery of combinative techniques and the possession of ma- ture positional judgement, while the science of the game has cleared up the prob- lem of the centre in the majority of openings. However, we are still a long, long way from a thorough knowledge of the laws governing the methods of integrat- ing all the elements into a strategic whole. And where there is insufficient knowl- edge one proceeds 'by feel', or in other words, one takes risks. The endgame and the attack on the king are two areas about which our knowledge is incomplete, but they are also two directions in which chess can be further explored and through which the ancient game can be raised to a still higher level. We have said that there still exist areas in the art of chess where our knowledge is incomplete, and many of our readers may ask whether there are not at least some signposts pointing to where new knowledge might be found. The very at- tentive reader may also recall that mention was made in the Introduction of Alekhine's and Capablanca's understanding of the attack on the king and that a discussion on this subject was promised at the end of the book. Indeed, this is the right place for such a discussion, since the most difficult and arcane matters should be dealt with at the end, after everything else has been elucidated. The discoveries of Alekhine and Capablanca It is a slightly strange thesis that one should go back to the period before the Sec- ond World War and look for the culmination of the art of the attack on the king in the play of Alekhine and Capablanca. For have not Botvinnik and Smyslov, Keres and Bronstein, Reshevsky and Gligoric in their rich creativity in the field of chess discovered all that Alekhine and Capablanca knew and also gone on to add something else? It is indeed true that they have proceeded further in many re- spects, and perhaps even in their knowledge about the attack on the king they are the equals of the great masters of the past; in their actual games, however, they have not so far put it into practice to the full. If we delve into the whole of chess literature looking for games which serve to illuminate the logical integration of the attack on the castled king and the game in its entirety, then those of Alekhine
336 The Art of Attack in Chess
and Capablanca remain the unsurpassed models; side by side with them may be placed a few of the games of Rubinstein, Keres, and Bronstein, though we shall find scarcely any new discoveries in them; the whole period from Alekhine's death to the present day has not been particularly fruitful in the sphere of the at- tack on the king. So one is justified in going back to Alekhine and Capablanca as the first to discover knowledge which to this day has been neither refuted nor su- perseded. As far as these actual discoveries by Alekhine and Capablanca are concerned, it can be said that they did not take the form of some new principle but rather de- pended on a new way of thinking, which proceeded subjectively and therefore in a manner which cannot be expressed or comprehended on a theoretical basis; by these methods they discovered moves which fulfil the chief principle of the at- tack on the castled king, namely, obtaining the maximum preconditions for an at- tack with the minimum of commitment. This principle in itself is a simple one and can be easily remembered, but play- ing in accordance with it is extremely difficult. Here two grades of values must be clearly distinguished: the one based on the value of the individual precondi- tions and the other on that of the successive commitments undertaken. This must then be resolved into a precisely ordered series of moves, while one must also be ready at any moment to convert the attack into some other thematic course of ac- tion - all of which requires considerable mastery. From a close study of the games of Alekhine and Capablanca one can con- clude that they did indeed use a perfected method of thinking in the sense men- tioned above; only, in the case of Alekhine this thinking was more analytical and logical, while with Capablanca it was more artistically intuitive. However, the re- sults of this thinking, that is, the actual moves, do not appear to differ greatly to the outside observer. However, Alekhine's discoveries can be somewhat more precisely defined than Capablanca's; Alekhine's output was more abundant, he 'lived chess' more deeply, and he was a more passionate analyser of his own games. A particular characteristic of his commentaries is the frequent use of the idea of commitment (just as with Lasker we get the idea of compensation, with Steinitz that of the balance of the position, and with Nimzowitsch that of central- ization). One could say that of all masters Alekhine had the most refined sense of the degree of commitment, even though his temperament sometimes led him to be too eager. When Alekhine, with apparent nonchalance, played, for instance, h4 against the French Defence, this appeared to his contemporaries to be 'the pretentiousness of genius', but a closer analysis today reveals that behind such moves there lay a great deal of mental calculation and hard logic, and that this move h4 belongs The attack on the king as an integral part of the game 337 exactly when it was played; a move earlier it would have been weak and on the next it would be too late! Further illustration of all these points will be better obtained by the reader from the actual games which follow. Alekhine - Asztalos Kecskemet, 1927 Queen's Gambit Declined

A series of preconditions for an attack on the king has been created: the weak- ness represented by the black pawn at h6; the aggressive placing of White's pieces; his control of the centre; and Black's limited resources on the queenside. White, however, is not in a hurry to attack, for he sees that he can use his pressure on c6 to improve the deployment of his own pieces and, at the same time, to con- strict his opponent's.
20...Rc7 21 Rc3 Ne8 22 e2!
White is thinking of the square b4.
22...5a6 23 Nd7
Against the threatening line-up of white knight at b4 and queen at f3 Black has only two expedients, namely, the direct weakening of his king position by ...f6 or an indirect weakening in the form of the exchange of his knight, which defends the square h7. Black decided on the latter course. 24 jxd7 Sxd7 25 d3 Sd8 26 e5 i.f8 Black is sure that the enduring pressure on the diagonal against h7 will oblige him to play ...g6. Logically, therefore, he decides upon a delayed fianchetto as the best means of putting up some resistance. The attack on the king as an integral part of the game 339 27 h4! The first move which really commits the attacker; the situation is also ready for it. It is directed against the future weakness on g6. 27,..Saa8 28 £bl h5 He does not like the idea of 29 Rc2 g6 30 h5.

1-0 Having played so excellently and - as regards the method of preparing the at- tack on the king - so instructively, Alekhine concludes the game with a sacrifice that is not fully correct! I say 'concludes', because Asztalos took fright and re- signed when he could well have played on. The continuation which Alekhine had in mind and which he expounded in the tournament book contained a loophole giving a draw, and even against White's best play Black would have had drawing chances. Let us first look at Alekhine's line.
340 The Art of Attack in Chess
42...Rxf7 43 .d3+ Rg6 44 Nxg6+
If 44 Rg3, Black replies 44,..Sg7, while 44 Rf3 can be met by 44...Sd5. Thirdly, 44 Rg5 xd3 45 Rg8+ Nh6 46 Rh8+ Rh7 47 Rf8+ Rg7! 48 Sxg7 Sxg7 49 Rf6+ Bg6 50 Rxd8 Be4+ probably results in a draw.
44.. .Bxg6 45 Sxg6?
So far this is Alekhine's analysis. However, 45 Rf6! Sg8 46 Rxe6 is stronger and does indeed win, though White still has a hard task ahead1.
45...6xg6 46 Re4+ <Ng7 47 e5+
Here Alekhine concludes his analysis with the remark that Black 'after a few further checks, would inevitably lose one of his rooks.' In fact, he loses after all moves except 47... g6 followed by keeping the king on g6 or g7. After 48 Rxe6+ < >g7 49 Rxc6 Sbl+! 50 Ng2 Sxd4 51 07+ Ng6 the checks cease, whereupon Black's rooks begin to deploy themselves for play against the king or the c-pawn. One cannot see how White can win; the position is very likely drawn. Alekhine unintentionally bluffed the unfortunate Asztalos and the jury, who on the basis of his analysis awarded him the Brilliancy Prize. We must now point out what is objectively the strongest move and the continu- ation by which White wins. Thus (instead of 42 £}xf7!?) he should have pro- ceeded as follows:
42 Rg3 Wf 8 (D )
Forced; if 42...f5, then 43 Rg8+ followed by Rh8+ and Rf6+ is decisive, while if 42...Rf6, then 43 .d3+ wins.
1 A distinct exaggeration. White has queen and pawn against rook and bishop,
Black's remaining pawns are all weak and White has a passed f-pawn - I wouldn't expect many technical problems here! The attack on the king as an integral part of the game 341

This is better than either 8 c5 or 8 a3, which Capablanca played in a number of games of his 1928 match against Alekhine, but best of all is 8 cxd5.

At this point Black cannot spare the time to continue preparing ...c5; he should have played it at once. 12 a4! (D) In order to entice the b-pawn to b4, which is useful for further play against the square c5.

12...b4 13 Nxf6
This exchange is advantageous in two respects; first, for its 'clearance' of the square c5 and secondly, because it eliminates the possibility of a defence later on by ...Nf8.
13... xf6 14 £je4 Nxe4 15 Bxe4 Bxe4 16 Rxe4 c5
Sink or swim, Black must play this, for otherwise c6 follows, fixing the backward c-pawn. 17 dxc5 Ra5 18 b3 Nxc5 19 Ng5! (D) Can it be that White is justified in switching to an attack on the king after prep- arations which were clearly directed at the c-file? How does this fit in with our thesis on the need to fulfil a series of preconditions before opening an attack on the king? In fact, there is no contradiction; the preconditions are present, but they have arisen in a different way from those in the Alekhine-Asztalos game. It is true that the preconditions for the attack on the castled king in this game have come about suddenly and somewhat incidentally; at the same time, this has occurred quite legitimately. The main point is that White's play, starting with 12 a4, serves two purposes: it maintains the pressure on the c-file and simulta- neously improves the preconditions for an attack on the king. As a result of 12 a4 b4 and 18 b3 the position on the queenside became blocked, and this has reduced Black's prospects of counterplay, while 17 dxc5 resolved the tension in the cen- tre. Furthermore, 13 Bxf6, 15 Bxe4, and 16 Rxe4 represent, in effect, a far- reaching elimination of Black's defending pieces; in the same way, the struggle revolving around the pawns on the c-file has forced Black (in 17...Ra5 and
18... .xc5) to displace two pieces which are important for the defence of his king
position. This is without doubt a full set of preconditions, built up with true The attack on the king as an integral part of the game 343 Capablanca virtuosity and elan. Now White's knight, a sort of 'equus ex ma- china', stirs up a whirlwind attack on the king, against which there is hardly an adequate defence.
19...h6?
Although Black has no really sound reply at his disposal, 19...f5 was the lesser evil. Then White does not gain much by 20 Re5 Bb6 while if 20 Rb7, Black plays 2O...Rb6, and after 21 Rf7+ <Nh8 22 Rh5 h6 White's attack stops, for ex- ample, 23 h4? Nxe3! 24 Rg6 is not sound, since after 24...hxg5 25 hxg5+ Ng8 White cannot give perpetual check, while 26 Bh7 is weak on account of
26...Rd4. The best line is 20 Rc4 Sac8 ! 21 Nxe6 Nb6 22 Rxc8 Sxc8 23 Sxc8+
Nf7 24 £}g5+ Ng6 25 £tf3 Qd5 26 O-O .d8 followed by ...Bf6 with some chances of a draw . This continuation would have been relatively the best way out for Black. Better than the text move but worse perhaps than 19...f5 is 19...g6. An analysis of this move, which, though it may emanate from Capablanca, needs to be cor- rected, runs as follows: 19...g6 20 WS Sf8 (everything else is weaker; 20...Sa7 in particular, does not work on account of 21 Rc6) 21 Rh3 h5 22 Nxe6? fxe6 23 Rxe6+ Nh7 24 Rd7+ Nh8 25 Rc6; now the analysis continues with 25...Sac8?, ** missing the fact that Black can win by 25 Jtxe3! 26 fxe3 Rf52 27 Rf3 (forced)
27... dS 28 Re2 xb3, obtaining an attack and, before long, a material advan-
tage as well. This analysis can be improved by playing, instead of 21 Rh3, 21 W6 (threatening either 22 fic4 and 23 £}xh7 or at once 22 Nxh7) 21...Sae8 (if
21...h6 then 22 Nxe6 wins, while 21...Sac8 is not good because of 22 Sc4 ) 22
Re5 .b6 23 Rxa5 .xa5 24 Ne2 Sc8 25 Ne4, when White has much the better ending, for example if 25...Bfd8, then 26 £k:5 Sc6 27 #)b7 Sxcl 28 Excl Ed5 29 e4.
20 Rh7+ #f8 21 Rh8+ Ne7 22 Rxg7 hxg5 23 xg5+ Nd6 24 Ne2 (D)
Two pawns, the exposed position of the black king, Black's commitments at c5, and White's rooks on the c- and d-files - all this is obviously more than suffi- cient compensation for the sacrificed knight. Capablanca also particularly
1 After 27 Ec6+ Nf6 28 d4 I see no real chances for a draw; White has two
2 3 rooks and a pawn for the queen, and Black's king is exposed. One line is
28...'4'h5 29 Ec4 Jkxd4 30 Edl, followed by Edxd4.
O
This allows a defence by 27 Rc2, but Black can improve by 26...Rg5!, which does indeed win for Black. After 21...Eac8 22 Ec4 Black can defend by 22...Ec7!, for example 23 £sxh7 .e7 or 23 Eh4 Jke7. Thus it is hard to demonstrate an advantage for White after
19...g6.
The Art of Attack in Chess stresses Black's inability to stop the advance of the h-pawn while White is tying him down on the queenside.
24...Eac8 25 Ec4 Sc 6 26 Shcl Nb6 27 h4 f5
Capablanca had reckoned on the following transition into a won ending:

This loses at once, but 29...Eec7 has no future either in view of 30 h5.

For, if 3O...Sxc5 then 31 Rd6+ is decisive. Capablanca's virtuosity in integrating all the features of the position into a co- herent whole is worthy of close attention. Alekhine - Kmoch San Remo, 1930 Nimzo- Indian Defence I d4 f6 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 Nb4 4 Nd2 One of the most harmless continuations.

White has proceeded cautiously and prepared the ground for Rd3, with the aim of provoking a weakening of the enemy king position in the shape of ...g6. For this reason Kmoch prefers to go in for ...h6, which weakens him less. White can only obtain results by attacking the king, for Black is the better placed for the endgame. 21£tf3 If 21 e4 Black can reply 21...Rh4.

White has managed to weaken the enemy king position, but he still lacks the preconditions for a real attack. A little regrouping is therefore needed, and above all the square d4 must be safeguarded. If 24 Ef3 then 24.. Bc6 25 £}xc6 bxc6 is quite good for Black. Of the minor pieces the knights are more valuable than the bishops, from the point of view of both the attacker and his opponent.

Up to this point the author of The Art of Defence has defended correctly and preserved equality. Now, however, he goes astray in playing to exchange off his important knight, which is the main defender of his king position. Correct was

Apparently, Black has manoeuvred himself into a new defensive position, one which also affords the possibility of his inconveniencing White's queen further by ...a5. The only weak side of his manoeuvre is that it does not give sufficient at- tention to centralization. As a result, the alleged pawn weakling on d4 is trans- formed - ironically - into an aggressor, punishing Black for his neglect of the central squares.

The formation with pawns on c3, d4, and e3, bishop on d3, and knights on d2 and f3 characterizes the Colle System. White's plan is to force through e3-e4 and then exchange his d2-knight for Black's f6-knight on this same square; he thereby creates some of the preconditions for an attack on the king without The attack on the king as an integral part of the game 347 entailing any commitments. The Colle System, however, lacks positional depth and, consequently, Black does not have any great anxiety as regards the centre. Capablanca's treatment of the opening, adopting a Queen's Indian set-up, is both sound and also suitable for avoiding lines which equalize out to a draw. White's strong point in the centre is now eliminated, for he must recapture the pawn with his knight, otherwise 9 cxd4 Nb4 10 JLbl -*.a6 leaves Black with the better game.

Obviously not 13..Jlxfl? on account of 14 fxe5. Moving the bishop to a6 had other points: on the one hand, to drive the white queen back and, on the other, to induce White to play Sf3, whereby he undertakes a commitment to attack before the preconditions for a successful attack have matured. Against 14 e5 Black has 14...£kl5 after which 15 Bxh7+ does not work (be- cause of 15... xh7 16 Rh5+ g8 17 Sf3 f5 18 fih3 3xf4) while, given a free move, Black can consolidate his defences by playing 15...f5. In the event of other, slower methods of attack Black has a sound defensive plan based on the effective use of the diagonals for his bishops and a centralized knight on d5. This will be seen in the further course of the game.
14...g6!
In view of the restricted range of activity of White's dark-squared bishop, this weakness is negligible. It is important for Black to exclude short-term dangers on the kingside, since he needs time to increase his pressure on the central squares.

20Wf2?! Up to this point Colle's play has been a little pretentious but not really incor- rect, for his commitments have not been decisive ones. Still, he should now have admitted that it was pointless to continue playing for an attack and striven, by paying careful attention to the central squares, to keep the game within the well- known 'margin of a draw'; for example, 20 jLe3 jtxd4 21 cxd4 Sac8 22 Bb3!
348 The Art of Attack in Chess
when Black, after 22...Nxe3 23 Sxe3 clearly has nothing either in the centre or on the c-file; nor does 22...b5 or the like offer anything very much. (In Golom- bek's book Capablanca's Hundred Best Games of Chess, instead of 22 .b3 1, the erroneous 22 2c 1? is given; then Black does indeed get the upper hand by
22...Nxe3 23 2xe3 Rc4.)
2O...jkxd4?I Satisfied with the centralization he has achieved, Black too now becomes rather presumptuous and opens up the c-file prematurely. 20...f5 followed by a quiet positional plan based on ...b5-b4 was probably best. In that event simplifi- cation by 21 Nxc6 Bxf2+ 22 Nxf2 Jlxc6 would give Black the better ending, while if 21 Be3, then 21...Jtxd4 22 cxd4 £3b4 would be perfectly agreeable. The move suggested, 20...f5, signifies that Black is satisfied with a small ad- vantage, whereas Capablanca's idea aspires to dynamic play on the c- and f-files. However, the preconditions for this are insufficient, for counterattacks too de- mand preconditions and entail commitments just as attacks on the king do. The laws which determine the connection between the two types of action dictate the form, timing, and tempo of the counterattack in accordance with the state of the attack. Thus, the degree to which the attacking units have been diverted condi- tions the extent and force of the counterattack. In this case, therefore, direct de- fence by 20...f5 would have been better than 2O...Bxd4. 21 cxd4 5ac8 The immediate 21...f6 did not work on account of 22 Rh4 2f7 23 jkxg6. 22 i.dl! Other moves by the bishop are defeated by 22...Wxcl+. 22 Rh4 is also inade- quate; for example, 22...£}f6! 23 2g3 xc2 24 Be3 (to prevent ...Wdl+) 24... e4
25 Sh3 h5 and Black wins.
22...f6! (D)
The attack on the king as an integral part of the game 349 This much-praised move of Capablanca's is very economical in that it both at- tacks and defends in equal measure; it is probably Black's best, now that he has embarked on 2O... .xd4. It is also true that an attack generally collapses when the pawns in front of the king begin to 'bite' , but in this case the question is no longer one of attack but of the overall state of the position. Black has in fact awoken pos- sibilities for White on the c-file, and in the event of the game being opened up White's two bishops could come into their own.
23 Rh4?
This gains a tempo for Bf3 but neglects the development of his cl -bishop and al -rook. The correct move was 23 Jld2!. Capablanca's intention in that case was
23... 3xf4!? 24 Jlxf4 fxe5 25 Bf3 e4 but the combination has a flaw: White does
not play 26 .e2? (when 26. ..e3! wins) but 26 Rh4!, and Black finds himself in difficulties. Moreover, 23 Jtd2! cannot be met by 23...fxe5, e.g. 24 Scl Rb5 (24,..Wxcl would not succeed against correct play by White) 25 Sxc8 .xc8 26 Rh4, whereupon 26...Sf7 27 Rd8+ leads to a draw, 26...h5 is not good due to 27 Rg5, while the complications following 26...Nf6 27 fxe5 ,Na6 28 Sf3 seem full of uncertainty. Against 23 Bd2! Black would probably have to play 23...d6 24 Scl 3 Rd7, when 25 Sxc8 ,Nxc8 26 Sf3 results in a complex struggle in which White's dark- squared bishop derives pleasure from every exchange on e5. This repre- sents an analytical proof of the assertions made in the note to the twentieth move.

Since 25 Rf2 does not work (because of 25...Wxcl+) White is now lost.

They felt that he had not touched upon much that was important and essential for a player who was aspiring to reach the top in chess. Thus there originated the idea of this book Play like a Grandmaster which the author has been working on for some years. It is a continuation volume to Think like a Grandmaster, and deals with the most important aspect of chess wisdom, those laws and rules which have been developed by theoreticians of this ancient game of skill which includes elements of science, art and competitive sport. The book also contains the author's personal observations and the results of his study of the achievements of his fellow grandmasters. In order to make the book a real textbook for players who have already mastered the elements and have some experience of play under com- petitive conditions, it contains several unusual but very important and recurring sections. The sections headed 'Learn from the World Champions'" show how various problems are solved by the kings of chess. Then we penetrate the depths of a grandmaster's thought processes in the sections 'The Mind of a Grandmaster', in order to understand how he thinks and solves problems at the board, how his mind works. Finally, 'How to Train' and 'Exercises' contain a description of methods of private study and training adopted by leading players in their time, as well as collections of relevant examples on various topics which will provide the reader with test material to work on by himself. Will the reader of this book play like a grandmaster after he has worked through it carefully? It is hard to say; naturally this will depend partly on his natural gifts and his persistence in trying to achieve his objectives, as Index 219

well as upon his personal qualities as a competitor. In any event the reader will certainly take a big step forward in his assimilation of chess theory, and will come to understand many fine points involved in thinking about his moves and in chess problem-solving. These are the factors which in the final analysis bring success in competitive play.

The Three Fishes of Chess Mastery In order to become a grandmaster class player whose understanding of chess is superior to the thousands of ordinary players, you have to develop within yourself a large number of qualities, the qualities of an artistic creator, a calculating practitioner, a cold calm competitor. We shall try to tell you about what a player needs in order to improve and perfect himself, and give advice on how to carry out regular training so that both your playing strength and style get better. Of all the qualities of chess mastery three stand out, just as in the old myth the world stands on three fishes. The three fishes of chess mastery are positional judgement, an eye for combinations and the ability to analyse variations. Only when he has a perfect grasp of these three things can a player understand the position on the board in front of him, examine hidden combinative possibilities and work out all the necessary variations; We consider it essential to start with the question of positional play. This is the basis of everything else. It is possible that because of your character you do not often play pretty combinative blows. There arc players of even the highest standard in whose games the sparkle of combinative play is quite rare. On the other hand in every game you play, in every position you study, you have no choice but to analyse and assess the current situation and form the appropriate plans. In order to provide the reader with a framework within which the fundamentals of positional play may be studied, we will first consider an important question which hitherto has not received the attention it deserves; namely, what are the basic types of struggle which arise in practical play?
10 Positional Judgement
A General Theory of the Middlegame If a chess statistician were to try and satisfy his curiosity over which stage of the game prosed decisive in the majority of cases, he would certainly come to the conclusion that it is the middlegame that provides the mose decisive stage. This is quite understandable, since the opening is the stage when your forces are mobilized, and the endgame is the time when advantages achieved earlier are realized, while the middlegame is the time when we have the basic clash of the forces, when the basic question, who is to win, is settled. That is why it would seem that chess theoreticians should devote the maximum attention to the general laws of the middlegame. Alas, this is far from being the case. There are very many books devoted to the huge mass of possible opening variations, and a fair number of books on the endgame, but far less attention is paid to the systematic study of the basic part of the game. Why is this? One reason is that experienced grandmasters do not have the time to devote to the difficult task ofdescribing typical middlegame methods and considerations, and this work tends to fall to people who have not played in top class events and who therefore lack the requisite deep study of this question. Apart from collections of combinative examples there are few books extant on the middlegame which can be wholeheartedly recommended. What we now undertake is an attempt to fill this gap in chess literature, to describe the rules and considerations which a grandmaster bears in mind during a tournament game. First of all we have to distinguish the different sorts of struggles which can arise. Let us consider two contrasting examples from grandmaster play. A General Theory oj the Middlegame 11

What happened in this game? We did not see any deep strategic plans or long range manoeuvring. From the very start the opposing forces flung themselves into a close order conflict and rained threats on the opponent's bastions. The whole game consists of sharp variations in which sacrifice A General Theory oj the Middlegame 13 followed sacrifice, and each tactical stroke met with a counter blow from the other side. Quite a different type of game now follows.

Taimanov-Geller, Candidates Tournament, Zurich 1953 Here the opposing pieces arc a certain distance from each other, and there is no question of getting the sort of hand to hand tactical battle such as we saw in the previous game, at least for the moment.

corresponding to this twofold division we get a marked difference in the working of the grandmaster's mind in each case. In the first case the player is always tensed up as he constantly examines complicated variations, takes account of tactical blows and tries to foresee and forestall deeply hidden, unexpected moves and traps. Little attention is given to general considerations since the player can hardly spare time for these in view of the time limit, and it is hardly necessary to bear them in mind in such positions. Sometimes he might just make some such general comment to himself as 'it would be nice to get a battery against 12 by 'c5 and Ab6', or 'watch out all the time for that open h-file', or 'try and get rid of that powerful bishop of his at e4'. However these are just short verbal orders to oneself, a formulation of the general ideas resulting from analysis. Obviously there are no such things as deep general plans, regroupings, manoeuvres. Concrete analysis, working out tactical strokes, spotting traps, anticipating cunning or surprising 'explosions'-that is what is called for in positions of the first type. So in the first case the mind is kept on tenterhooks, and works in accordance with the slogan 'keep a close watch'; whereas in the second case the work of the mind is marked by calm, comparative slowness and the absence of nervousness. What is there to get excited about, when there can be no violent explosions, no unforeseen tactical strokes or tricky traps? The mind is occupied with formulating plans for regrouping and moving about with the pieces with the almost total absence of variations. Only at certain specific moments do tactics come to the surface, causing the grandmaster to work out a few variations before reverting again to general considerations. We shall revert later to the question of the mind of a grandmaster, but I ask the reader to read carefully through these lines and grasp firmly the difference in thought patterns. This point is very important in clarifying the rules for thinking about moves and handling your clock properly. If you make plans in sharp tactical positions, you can easily fall into a trap that figures in the calculations you failed to make. Vice versa, if you are going to calculate variations in positions where you should be thinking about general planning, you will waste precious time and will not get the right orientation. So let us commit firmly to memory the fact that the mind of a grandmaster is principally occupied, in combinative-tactical positions, with the calculation of variations; in manoeuvring-strategical positions, with the formulation of general plans and considerations. 27 -Nc3 a4 Black has been successful at defending himself on the Q-side so Taimanov now transfers his attention to the K-side.

What strikes you when working through this game? The answer must be the absence of a tactical clash. For a very long time there were just strategical manoeuvres and re-forming ranks. Moreover there were practically no variations to consider as you can see from the notes to the game. When playing such a game an experienced grandmaster would never start working out variations. He would weigh up one or two short lines and that's it! In such positions general considerations prevail:- where should a certain piece be transferred to, how to stop some particular action by the opponent. Finally which piece to exchange, which one to keep on the board. Hence we can draw a simple and clear conclusion. There are two main types of position, and resulting from that, two different kinds of struggle. In the one case we get a constant clash of pieces mixing it in tricky patterns, with tactical blows, traps, sometimes unexpected and shattering moves. In the other case it is quite different. The respective armies stand at a distance from each other, the battles are restricted to reconnaissance and minor sorties into the enemy position. The thrust of the attacking side is prepared slowly with the aid of piece regrouping and 'insignificant' pawn advances. We may call positions of the first type combinative-tactical, of the second type manoeuvring-strategical. W e have distinguished two types of position according to the presence or absence of sharp contact, critical moments and threats of 'explosions': The two games we have just looked at are extreme examples of the types of struggle which can arise. To bring out the difference between them even

more graphically, we shall try to indicate their course by a schematic diagram. On the diagram below we have the depiction of the Euwe-Alekhine game, a wavy line full of zig-zags (No. 1).

The position is most complex, and naturally no general considerations can help a player to find his way in such great complications. You simply must work out variations, and both sides have to make the great effort to seek the best line for each side by means of analysis of the many possibilities. 18 . . . ' x!7 19 gh3 a6

However in tournament play there are other types of game which have a mixed content. One such may start in the sharp combinative manner but then settle down into a calm course. Such a 'calm after the storm' is seen in the next game and we depict it in No. 3.

We wish to illustrate the nature of a grandmaster's thinking process during a game, and how the rhythm of this thinking changes in accordance with the nature of the position which lies in front of him. So we have established one of the major features that guides a grandmaster. If he faces a combinative-tactical position, he deals with it by working out variations, using general considerations only at certain rare moments. In manoeuvring-strategical positions he restricts himself to general considerations, though here too he has recourse at times to short analysis of variations. Finally he has the flexibility to change from one approach to another as appropriate. Now what do general considerations consist ol? We now devote a great deal of attention to this vital question which lies at the bottom of all positional play. The Basic Postulates of Positional Play The level of development of positional sense depends on many factors. Most of all it is shown in the ability of a player by dint of natuial ability to determine swiftly, at one swoop, the main characteristics of a position. Chess history knows many examples of the ability to sniff out the essence of a position without the player having to trouble himself with wearisome analytical effort. Such cases reveal a real natural gift. Yet the main thing that develops positional judgement, that perfects it and makes it many-sided, is detailed analytical work, sensible tournament practice, a self-critical attitude to your games an a rooting out of all the defects in your play. This is the only way to learn to analyse chess positions and to assess them properly. Mastery only comes after you have a wide ex-

perience of studying a mass of chess positions, when all the laws and devices employed by the grandmasters have become your favoured weapons too. Positional sense is like the thread that leads you through the labyrinth in your tense struggle at the board from the first opening move to the final stroke in the endgame. When people come to say about you that you have a good positional sense, you will be able to consider yourself a well-rounded and promising player. We shall now try to state in a systematic way all the postulates and rules of middlegame play that have been worked out by theoreticians over the long history of chess. They might appear elementary to the discriminating reader. Whv bother to repeat what has long been known? Believe me, for all my long practical experience of play and writing, I have found it far from easy to reduce to a common denominator all that has been expressed so far in chess history. Moreover what is elementary? When I pose this question 1 call to mind Mikhail Tai. The ex-world champion has often commented that he regularly watches the chess lessons on TV meant for lower rated players. His idea is that the repetition of the elements can never do any harm, but rather polishes up the grandmaster's thoughts. For greater clarity we shall try to express the concepts of middlegame theory in short exactly formulated points. /. hi chess only the attacker wins. Of course there arc cases where it is the defender who has the point marked up for him in the tournament table, but this is only when his opponent exceeds the time limit or makes a bad mistake--overlooks mate, or loses a lot of material. Moreover, if one follows strict logic, even after this loss of material the game could be played out to mate and in this case the final victory goes to the former defender who in the later stages, after his opponent's mistake, is transformed into the attacker. The question then arises, which of the two players has the right to attack. Before the time of the first world champion Wilhelm Steinitz, who is the creator of modern chess theory, it was held that the more talented player attacked. Steinitz put it quite differently. The talent and playing strength of a chess player was a secondary consideration.
2. The right to attack is enjoyed by that player who has the better position.
Ifvour position is inferior, even though you are a genius, you do better not to think of attacking, since such an attempt can only worsen your position.
3. The side with the advantage has not only the right but also the duly Io attack,
otherwise he runs the risk oj losing his advantage. This is another postulate of Steinitz, and practice knows very many The Basic Postulates oj Positional Play 23 examples confirming it. How often has temporising, missing the appropriate moment to press, losing a few tempi, led to the loss of advantage, often of great advantage? Attack is the effective means in chess, it is the way to victory. Where does this leave the defender? Here too Steinitz has wise advice to give.
4. The defender must be prepared to defend, and to make concessions.
That means that the defender must try to repulse the attacker's blows, anticipate his intentions. Later theoreticians have added the rider to Steinitz that the defender must not leave out of his calculations the possibility of a counter strike, the chance to go over to counter-attack at the appropriate time. Defence thus means subjecting yourself for a time to the will of your opponent. From that comes the well-known fact that it is a lot harder to defend than to attack. Then the question arises, what means of attack are at the disposal of a player, and what should be chosen as the object of attack?
5. The means oj attack in chess are twofold, combinative and strategical.
As we have seen, attacks may develop with or without immediate contact between the forces. Which method is appropriate? The answer is best indicated by the nature of the position you are dealing with. Often it depends on the nature of the opening you have chosen, on the style of the players, but the decisive say lies with the position. No temperament no matter how passionate can produce an 'explosion' in a stabilized position, and attempts to do this can only rebound upon the instigator. Finally the question arises, where should the attack be made, and the answer is clear:
6. The attack must be directed at the opponent's weakest spot.
This almost goes without saying. Who would be foolish enough to attack a position at its strongest point? 'Why attack a lion when there is a lamb in the field?' The grandmaster seeks to direct his attack against the weakest, most sensitive, spot in the enemy fortifications. So we see how many difficult problems pose themselves to the grandmaster in the middlegame. Should he attack or defend? To answer this he has to establish whether he or the opponent has the advantage, but that is not ail. Even when you have settled the first question and established who has the right land correspondingly i the duty to attack, vou have to seek out the opponent's most \ ulnerable spot. The procedure to determine these questions is termed positional assessment, and we shall now consider this important topic in depth.

The player who wishes to improve, who wants to win in competitive play, must develop his ability to assess positions, and on that basis to work out plans for what comes next. This work of analysis can be compared to that of a chemist who is trying to determine the nature of a substance. Once upon a time the process was carried out in rough and ready fashion by visual inspection. Then Mendeleyev discovered the periodic table of elements and after that the chemist merely had to break down the substance into its constituent elements in order to determine the exact nature of the substance before him. That is the way chess players work now. About a century and a half ago the best players of the time solved their problems by visual inspection on the basis of their experience. There was no scientific method about this, but then came Stcinitz's theory. Thereby the player gained a basis for rational analysis suitable for solving whatever problems were posed, no matter how intricate the position. Steinitz taught players most of all to split the position into its elements. Naturally they do not all play the same role in a given position, they do not have the same importance. Once he has worked out the relationship of the elements to each other, the player moves on to the process of synthesis which is known in chess as the general assessment. When he has carried out the synthesis, has assessed the position, the grandmaster proceeds to the next step, when he draws up his plan for what follows. We shall deal with this later, and restrict ourselves to he statement that every plan is intimately linked with assessment. The analysis and assessment enables the player to find the wrcak point in the enemy camp, after which his thoughts will naturally be directed towards exploiting this weakness with the aid of a deeply thought out plan of campaign which takes account of the slightest nuances of the given position. In defining the elements there is no. perfect agreement amongst chess theorists. Each writer has his own list. It seems to us that the following 'Mendeleyev' table of chess elements will be sufficient to cover all those smaller parts out of which the analysis of a position is made up. Table of Elements Permarun / Advanluges
1 Material advantage.
2 Poor opponent's king position.
3 Passed pawns.
We have already spoken of Stcinitz's view that a win should not be played for if there is no confidence that the position contains some advantage or other. The question then arises, what does this advantage consist oP Steinitz gives the detailed and concrete reply, 'An advantage can consist ol one large advantage, or a number of small advantages.' He then adds the important guide to further action: 'The task of the positional player is systematically to accumulate slight advantages and try to convert temporary advantages into permanent ones, otherwise the player with the better position runs the risk of losing it.' 4 his is a valuable piece of advice, stressing that elements vary not just in their importance but in the length of their lifetime. Some are long term or permanent, others are temporary and either change (becoming greater or smaller) or disappear altogether. Il we arc a sound pawn up, or if the opponent's K-side is seriously weakened, then we enjoy a long term advantage. If, however, we have a lead in development or there is a badly placed piece in the enemy camp, then this is a short term advantage and can easily be dissipated in the subsequent play. Of course it is not possible to draw a fixed line between the twelve elements which we Jtave defined as permanent and the five we give as temporary. For example an open file or diagonal can be closed by means of an exchange of pawns and material inequality can be restored to equality, but the division we have made1 is a sufficiently good guide in our judgement and decision taking processes. This is the appropriate place to sum up Stcinitz's positional rules in the
26 Positional Judgement
form of short laconic summaries such as we encounter in mathematics, physics and other exact sciences. It is a matter of some surprise that no-one has done this before. We suggest the following form of words for them. Sleinilz's Pour Rules. 1 .The right to attack belongs only to that side which has a positional advantage, and this not just a right, but also a duty, otherwise there is the risk of losing the advantage. The attack is to be directed against the weakest spot in the enemy position.
2. The defending side must be prepared to defend and to make
concessions.
3. In level positions the two sides manoeuvre, trying to tilt the balance of
the position, each in his own favour. With correct play by both sides, level positions keep on leading to further level positions.
4. The advantage may consist of a large advantage in one form or
element only, or of a number of small advantages. The task of the positional player is to accumulate small advantages and to try to turn these small advantages into permanent ones. These four rules of Steinitz can be of great help and serve as a guiding thread for every player in his positional battles. However we should point out straight away the harm that arises if these rules are turned into strict dogmas: The Russian school, while recognizing the importance of Steinitz's teachings and the usefulness of his rules, always favours a concrete approach to assessment of a position with due regard for dynamic features. One other practical point. We have enumerated seventeen elements of a chess position, but during actual play a player would not find it too easy to consider each of the seventeen at every point. The grandmaster is helped out of this dilemma by the fact that usually not all the elements apply to a given position. There might well be only five to seven of them relevant. We recommend the following approach; as a rule consider a.restricted number of grouped elements. The following is a grouping of elements that has been proved most useful in practice:-
1. Weak squares and pawns.
2. Open lines.
3. 1 he centre and space.
4. Piece position.
The last named consists of such factors as king position, development, harmony of position, and the bad placing of one piece. The Elements in Practice 27 So in practice we need consider these four only, with the proviso that if we discern some other element, say the two bishops, then we add this to our assessment. The Elements in Practice Let us now take practical examples from actual play in which analysis and assessment were carried out. Normally there is a mixture of factors involved, an advantage in one element may be compensated for by the opponent enjoying an advantage in another element. All this has to be weighed up, comparing the significance of each element. However it may also be the case that one of the elements suddenly assumes decisive significance and confers a clear advantage. We shall start with such positions. Weak Squares Weak squares can be defined in essence as those squares which cannot be protected by pawns. Of course from a practical point of view we have a wider concept depending a great deal on the actual position: thus a square can sometimes be considered weak even when it can be protected by a pawn, but only with a serious weakening of position. In assessing any position a grandmaster is bound to take account of weak squares, both his own and those in the enemy camp. Moreover it is often the case that he starts his assessments from here: a number of weak squares, or even a single weak square, can be the outstanding feature of the position. A piece that gets established on this weak point spreads confusion in the defence and decides the issue. Botvinnik-Flohr, Moscow, 1936. Even a first glance at diagram 6 will show that all other weak squares
28 Positional Judgement The Elements in Practice 29
and other positional factors recede into the background by comparison with the gaping 'hole' at d6. Obviously a knight established there will play a decisive role, and Botvinnik plays to get his knight to the square he has prepared for it. X pawn can be proved to be weak, however, only when it can be attacked. The reader should take particular note of the following comments by Bronstein when talking about the position of diagram 7, which arises in a well-known variation of the King's Indian Defence. 34 £bl f8

44 ge3 <S>17 45 c4 'It seems it is time to reveal here the secret of the pawn at d6 in the King's Indian Defence. Although this pawn is on an open Hie and is apparently subject to attack, yet it is still a tough nut to crack. It is hard to get at. What w'ould seem easier than moving the knight at d4 away, but the point is that the knight is badly needed at d4. Its task there is to observe the squares b5, c6, e6, and 15 as well as neutralizing the bishop at g7. The knight can only move away from the centre after White has prepared to meet Black's various threats (a4-a3. JL<8-c6, f7 -15) but during the time taken bv these preparations Black will be able to reform his ranks. Hence the weakness of the d6 pawn turns out to be imaginary. Modern methods of playing the opening know of many such imaginary weaknesses, yet it was the supposed "permanent" weakness at d6 that long condemned the King's Indian Defence as "dubious".' Hence we urge you to attack weak pawns, but at the same time you have to have a critical and creative attitude to even the most obvious pawn weaknesses! White misses a tactical stroke and thus makes his win more difficult. By playing his king first to gl he could follow his plan without allowing any tactical tricks. 45 . . . b5!

Weak Pawns Th ere are many types of weak pawns: backward pawns, isolated pawns, doubled pawns, pawns far advanced and as a result cut off from contact with 'base'. All are spoken of as weak pawns, even though for the moment there is adequate protection from the pieces. After all the pieces might go away, leaving the pawn to its fate. Diagram 8 shows a critical moment in Gligoric-Szabo, Candidates Tournament, Zurich, 1953. Bronstein comments thus: -'Black has the advantage since the a5 paw n is weak, and the pawns at e5 and 14 limit the scope of the bishop.' There now came:

Pawn Islands There should be no need to stress that a comradely united pawn mass is the best sort of pawn configuration. Then every foot soldier senses the presence of his mate by his shoulder and receives the appropriate support and reinforcement when needed. It is a different state of affairs when the pawns are ripped into fragments. Then there is no hope of help since the other pawns cannot jump the ditch separating them. That is why the presence of a number of pawn islands is a serious drawback that can lead to defeat. In assessing diagram 10 (Gligoric-Kcres, 1953 Candidates Tournament) Bronstein wrote in the tournament book: 'White is well dug in, but Black's advantage is of a permanent nature and is expressed not so much in the active nature of this or that piece, but in his better pawn configuration. Concretely this consists of: - a. All Black's pawns are linked in a single branch, while White's are weakened.

If Black can win the pawn at a4 then his own passed a- pawn will play through to queen unhindered. White already has a passed pawn at h3, but this cannot advance since White's pieces are not in a position to support it. These principal features of the position are sufficient explanation of the fact that Black attacks all the time while White must merely repel threats.

The rooks and queen use them to attack weak pawns and to get into the heart of the enemy position. The control of an open file is a big positional plus. Bronstein comments on the position of diagram 1 1, 'An open file is worth something when there are objects of attack on it, or when the line serves as an avenue of communication for transferring pieces, normally the rooks, to the main point of battle. In this case the f-file fits both criteria. The main point is that it is close to the king which is a cause of alarm for Stahlberg. In the diagram position Black has the choice of using his rooks on either the c- or d-filcs, while White operates on the f-file. We get a sharp struggle and it gradually becomes clear that the f-filc carries more weight than the two files open for Black's use. 16 . . . c5 17 el Ac4 18 gf4 Ag6

Open Ranks The importance of ranks is usually smaller than that of files and diagonals. 5 ct occasionally it is a rank which turns out to be the highway along which decisive manoeuvres are carried out. Open Diagonals What has been said about open files applies by and large to open diagonals. Thev arc weighty factors in assessing the chances in complex positions, and there arc cases where a single diagonal proves decisive.
W
Karpov-Hort, Moscow, 1971 Not only a superficial analysis but even a very attentive study of the position of diagram 13 might find it hard to spot the decisive positional element which guarantees the advantage for White. The point is that here White can make good use of the ranks. Medina-Botvinnik, Palma, 1967. Botvinnik assessed the chances in diagram 12 thus, 'It is clear that despite the exchanges and material equality White is positionally lost, as he has no counter to Black's pressure along the al /h8 diagonal. Black's main idea was based on a tactical finesse, namely that after 21 gd7 gad8 22 ghdl (or 22 gxf7 gxf7 23 xe6 22 . . . gxd7 23 gxd7 gl + 24 gdl? ,.Q xb2+ Black gets a material advantage.

Passed Pawns A passed pawn is one of the most important factors in the endgame, while its role in the middlegame can also be very significant.

30 gael and White duly won. The Two Bishops Supporters of a concrete approach to the assessment of chess positions often deny the advantage of two bishops over bishop and knight or two knights. However this is not quite correct. It is certainly impossible to allege that the bishops arc always an advantage in every position, but in the great majority it is better to have the two bishops: then when the position opens up, the bishops will get favourable diagonals and their significance can decide matters. Diagram 15 may be considered a classical example of 'prelate power.' Smyslov -Keres, Zurich, 1953 In diagram 14, White's advantage is undeniable, principally because of his lead in development. Almost all his pieces arc in play while the enemy king is stuck in the centre. To exploit this there came: 14 d5! The pawn cannot be taken and there is a threat of 15 de.

Space This factor needs little stressing, and is a positional element that a grandmaster is bound to take into account when assessing the position. If one side occupies the greater part of the board, his men cramp the enemy forces and drive them to the edge of the board. Of course one has to take into account the possibilities of counter play, but if this advantage in space is consolidated it may lead to victory. 4 #xe5 Alb

26 - 12 Ac4 0-1 The Elements in Practice 41 example (diagram 17) shows how the position of just one piece can affect the course of the game. This is how Capablanca assesses the position; 'Black's queen, rook and knight are aggressively placed, and compared to White's pieces have greater freedom. All White's pieces arc defensively placed, and his c and e pawns arc subject to attack. The only way to defend both pawns would be 4>d2, but then Black would reply ' 'b4 and then he could advance his a pawn with no difficulty. So far everything has been in Black's favour, and if there were no other factors in this position White's position would be lost. However there is a feature which is very much in White's favour, namely the position of the bishop at h7. This bishop is not only completely cut off from play, but, even worse, there is no way of bringing it into play. Hence White is playing, as it

Of course this is a serious disadvantage, often a losing one. We shall come across a numbej of such cases later on, but let us consider Poor Position oj a Piece An active position for the pieces is one of the most important elements of the positional struggle, possibly the decisive one. That is why in assessing any position it is vital to assess the position of the pieces, and not just the overall placing of them, but each one considered separately. The following Capablanca-Bogoljubow, London, 1922

the play from diagram 18, a particularly instructive example. The Centre 43 side and the future course of events. Right from the start the beginner has it dinned into him that he should seize the centre and try to hold it with all his forces. This applies, he is taught, right from the opening, through the middlegame, down to the endgame. Later on we learn that only with a firm grip on the centre do we have the right to start active play on the wing, otherwise we run the risk that the oppo- nent might be able to produce an unexpected counter-strike in the centre, after which our attack will become pointless. We are told by theoreticians about the various problems involving the centre, how the old masters con- sidered every pawn centre good, whereas the hypermoderns of early this century declared that piece pressure on the centre could be more effective than occupying it with pawns which might become weak and need defending. We shall soon deal with this problem, but first let us note the axiom that the reader must understand and assimilate: the pawn formation in the centre determines the general nature of the whole struggle. Theory recognises five sorts of centre:-
1 A Pawn Centre, 2 A Fixed Centre, 3 An Open Centre, 4 A Closed
Centre, 5 A Centre under Tension. Let us examine these in turn. The Pawn Centre When we have two or more pawns in the centre and the opponent does not have any, we are naturally justified in seeking to advance these pawns and sweep away the opponent's fortifications. He in his turn will put obstacles in our way, possibly attacking the pawns with his pieces so that our pawns may become weak or be removed from the board altogether. Hence we get the problem of piece pressure on the centre-the chief hobby horse in the teachings of the chess Hypermodernists. The resolution of this problem depends on concrete assessment: if the central pawns are strong and well supported then the pawn centre gives us a positional advantage, but if the pawns are weak then they are a serious drawback. From diagram 19, White got his centre pawns moving.

Botvinnik-Yudovich, USSR Ch. 1933 Clearly Black has placed his pieces badly. His bishop at c8 has not yet moved, and the knights hinder his own development. Only the other bishop is well placed, firing along an open diagonal, but what can it do on its own? At the same time White's pieces can boast of their excellent placing and his pawns arc particularly proud, ready to advance and cramp Black even more. It takes only a few moves for Botvinnik to demonstrate the advantage of his forces by carrying out a nice concluding attack. 11 • •c7

In diagram 20, the pawns are jammed up against each other at e4 /e5. If we examine in turn the role of each piece we come to the conclusion that of Black's pieces only the queen is active.

In view of the open terrain the whole emphasis is on piece play. Bear in mind that in such cases flank attacks with pawns are ruled out. With an open centre, the likelihood of an enemy central strike is so great that a flank pawm advance is equivalent to suicide.

As the centre cannot be broken open the players prepare to by-pass it, manoeuvring and pressing on the flank. With the centre closed and no risk of a quick counter there, the bold advance of wing pawns is quite safe. Diagram 22 is an instructive example: If' Reti-Carls, Baden-Baden, 1925 Reti-Capablanca, New York, 1924 Having earlier foreseen the coming of a closed centre position, White is first to get in with an advance on the K-side.

A decisive irruption, and once again on the flank, though this time it is the other side. The Centre under Tension This is sometimes called a fluid centre: the tension may be resolved at any moment. If the two sides remove all the centre pawns then we get an open centre; if the pawns get jammed then we have a closed centre. Sometimes we may get a fixed centre, rarely a mobile one. The policy of the players in a fluid situation is to manoeuvre and wait for a suitable opportunity to turn the centre into one of the other four forms in the hope that this will turn to their own advantage.

I n practice it is more often the case that we have to deal with positions in which there is no clearly marked plus in any one element: each player stands better than his opponent in one respect, but worse in another. So we get a clash of elements with plusses in some elements being compensated for by minuses in others, and there is a tense struggle to accumulate small advantages. The practical player thus needs not only attentiveness and the ability to Bolcslavsky Kcres, Candidates Tournament 1953 Diagram 23 shows a fluid centre.

analyse a position, but must also show considerable objectivity in assessing the elements of the position. If you are going to consider your plusscs as a real treasure house and denigrate those of the opponent, you are heading for catastrophe. Objectivity in your approach to the position is a most important quality so that you can properly orientate yourself in the tasks of analysis, assessment, and finding the. right plan. A grandmaster pays attention to every slight detail and tries not to miss the slightest nuance, the least factor which might affect the assessment. Here arc examples of such scrupulous care: Smyslov-Botvinnik, USSR Absolute Ch. 1941 Botvinnik assesses diagram 25 'A quick glance is sufficient to note the weak side of White's position. His bishops are not very active, Black has a good base for operations at 15. Moreover one should not omit to note an organic defect of White's pawn formation-his Q-sidc can communicate with the K-side only via the cl square.' We may comment that it is no simple thing to spot such a 'trifle' which turns out not to be a trifle! Euwc-Kcres, Candidates Tournament 1953 Bronstein wrote this about the position of diagram 24: 'Every positional achievement, in this case the pawn at d6 which engages the attention of the black pieces, is important not in itself but in its link with other combinational factors. In this position the factors for White are:-
1 The unguarded pawn at c5,
2 The weakened cover of the black king.
3 The constant possibility of advancing the pawn to d7.
4 Control over c7 and e7, combined with the attempt to control the c-
or c-filc. For Black the factors are:~
1 The chance to surround the d6 pawn from three sides.
2 The attack on the Q-side by a majority of pawns.
3 The possibility 4dh5 to drive the queen from her strong post.
B\ comparing and weighing the chances lor each side the masters normally reach more or less objective conclusions which arc called the assessment of the position.' Euwv now played 22 a3 which Bronstein criticized as not corresponding to the demands of the position. He recommends instead 22 b3 to put a Lasker-Capablanca, St. Petersburg, 1914 Let us assess diagram 26, a position from a famous game.

weaknesses in Black's position. White has weak squares too, at c4, f4 and h4, but these have little influence on the play since the enemy pieces cannot get at them. Black has gaping weaknesses at e6 and g6, while a5 and h5 are also weak. The weak pawn at 16 may become an object of attack, and this would soon prove telling. Another significant factor is White's advantage on the open files. His rooks are well established on the h-filc and can be transferred quickly to the a-file. Another minus in Black's position is the passive position of the bishop at b7, and there is no active diagonal to which it could be transferred. The active position of the white rooks means that they can at any moment get on to the poorly defended 7th rank. Also White has an undoubted advantage in space due to the advanced pawn at 15, and the knight at e6 is firmly stuck in the heart of the enemy position. All White's pieces are actively placed, whereas the black men laze about on the back two rows. Although White has some weak points, White's plusses in various respects give us the right to make the assessment that White has a won position. By the laws of strategy, White is here under an obligation to attack, otherwise he risks losing his advantage. If White were to do nothing here then Black would go 4T c4-e5, then ge7 and Q c8 to drive out or exchange the intrusive knight and the position would become quite defensible. The great strategist Lasker uses the advantages of his position to start the decisive thrust. 1 e5! I he idea is clear. He activates his knight at c3 and starts an attack on the weak pawn at 16. After the capture on e5 the knights get access to c5 from where they become dominating. The pawn sacrifice is temporary, as White can visualize that Black will soon have to lose material. 1 . . . de Capture by the other pawn would lead to the early loss of the g5 pawn and the formation of united passed pawns for White at 15 and g4. 2 £je4 Nd5

A method of assessing positions is frequently found in Capablanca's notes both to his own games and to others. Bogoljubow-Wahltuch, London 1922 Capablanca wrote of diagram 27, 'It is not hard to assess this position. Force is equal, but Black has three weak pawns- the a, c, and e. The a7 pawn would be strong and a source of worry to White if there was the time to advance it far down the board safely, but this is not the case, so it is merely a weakness. The only positive feature of Black's position is the fact that his rook occupies an open file. If the bishop could be transferred from e8 to d5 via c6 it would defend two weak pawns and exert pressure on the long diagonal. Then Black's position would not be too bad. However this is not feasible as White will play, Ba4 as his first move. W'hitc has no weak points. His wcdgelike pawn formation is very aggressive, and he has adequate space for piece manoeuvres. So it is clear that White must have the advantazge. As we have already said, his first move will be Jia 4 to exchange the enemy bishop and prevent it moving to d5, so that it could defend the weak pawns at c4 and e6. Moreover this first Learn from the World Champions 55 you have to fix it.

In his notes to games Robert Fischer normally gives more interesting variations than verbal reasoning, but this certainly does not mean that in thinking about his moves during actual play he avoids general considerations and overall assessments. Possibly these are simply less necessary for him in view of his intuition and the immense analytical effort which he put in at the time of his passionate enthusiasm for the game. However in his notes too you can find valuable general assessments. The eleventh world champion wrote of diagram 29 thus; 'Petrosian and Tai both happened to stroll by the board at this instant. Petrosian made a wry face which looked to me like "Can Black do this and live?". Black's ugly defence is based on sound positional considerations; once he can consolidate there is a strong potential in the two bishops coupled with his beautifully posted knight and compact pawn mass. These assets in the long run, hopefully, should outweigh the temporary weakness of his king and the immobile target on e6.' 14 £ce2! Qh8

move makes way for the queen, which will penetrate into Black's position via a2.' The reader will note some features of the Cuban champion's method of assessment. He does not go through the elements we had in our table, but only deals with the main ones which determine the nature of the position and the development of subsequent events. Nor does he restrict himself to a static statement, as is shown by his inclusion of the move Qa4, and he puts the final touch to White's stated advantage by indicating the possible lines for both sides-Black's advance of the a-pawn and White's penetration with his queen via a2. Here is an exact and clear verbal assessment of diagram 28 by Smyslov. Smyslov-Golombek USSR-GB match, 1954 'White's advantage is minimal, and consists of the strong king position in the centre, while his bishop is more active than Black's which is rather shut in at b8. The slight separation of the pawns at e6, g6, h7 makes Black's task more difficult.' White played 33 £dl and Smyslov makes a more exact assessment by linking it with White's plan. 'The c3 square is freed to let the bishop take the important diagonal al /h8, while the knight sets off to g4 to attack the enemy pawns. White does not fear e5 since he would answer f5 and then find it easier to create a passed pawn on the flank. Moreover Black's central position would thereby be weakened - the d5 square.' 33 . . . ,d6

the game I found out that this move had surprised the audience. Indeed its drawback is obvious- the square d4 becomes White's domain. But I hasten to add that this is only so in words. After all White will not be able to derive any benefit from having a queen, or say, rook on d4. As for the knight which it is normally advantageous to place on such blockading squares, its main care here is to guard the e5 pawn. Hence Black has his hands untied so that he can now operate on the g-file.' The subsequent play confirmed the correctness of this concrete assessment.

When we considered Steinitz's rules we noted that the Soviet school, while recognizing his teaching, also puts a high price on a concrete approach to each position. Diagram 30 is one example that could be quoted from very many. Spassky-Petrosian, World Ch. match 1966 Karpov-Spassky, USSR Spartakiad, 1975 Petrosian played 17 . . . c4 here and later wrote abou.t it: "Right after The Mind of a Grandmaster 59 The reader will see that the world champion not only works out his assessments on the basis of the elements which we enumerated, but links them organically w'ith the concrete features of the actual position. The Mind of a Grandmaster The time has come to deal with the question of when a grandmaster carries out his analysis and assessment of the position, and how this process takes place in his mind. The first crucial moment is normally when we come to the end of the opening and start the middle game. After a theoretical variation has been plaved, or when the pieces have been mobilized in accordance with our own ideas, the time is ripe for the first overall assessment. 11 is al this point that a grandmaster spends a great deal of time, since it is from here that the whole future course of the game may be mapped out. We recommend that at this point the whole position is considered from the point of view of the elements and their influence on the play. The main question to answer is, who stands better. Obviously, as laid down in Stcinitz's rules, the player with the better position will have to attack and the inferior side will have to defend. Then must be established where the weakest enemy point is, since this is the place where we will direct our attack. Next it is time to form a plan for the next few moves, a point we shall deal with later. With his general problems settled the grandmaster then normally begins the analysis of concrete variations, their depth depending on the nature of the position. A sort of interior dialogue takes place each move, a dialogue of the following sort:- 'I go knight to c5, he retreats the queen. I advance the pawn to d5. He can't take it since then the centre is opened. He has to reply c6-c5. Then I play c.2-c4. What a fine knight I have in the centre, and a protected passed pawn into the bargain.' Thus it goes every move, with each new problem to be solved. Examine the notes of the best grandmasters to their games and you will find both deep general assessments, and routine small assessments at nearly every move. There arc other times too when a general assessment will be needed - at the transition from the middle game to the endgame, or when combinational storms end. At such times the position has to be looked at afresh and a new assessment formed. We recommend you to try and divide the playing time into 'my time' and 'his time' and follow the golden rule that when your clock is going you restrict yourself to the analysis of variations, while when the opponent's

After this, attention should be concentrated on the link between overall assessment and the lesser assessments made each move. Once again grandmasters' notes to games wall be a guide. Notice how at a critical point the annotator will enumerate all the elements of a given position and describe their interaction, working out the relative worth of each. Then you will see that he goes on by giving short variations at each move accompanied by verbal assessments. These short comments are a result of the overall assessment and of the analysis of the factors brought about by the opponent's last move. While seeking improvement along these lines, be aiming to cultivate the knack of seeing at a glance which of the elements are crucial to a given position, which arc irrelevant and play no part. Training is also possible during actual play. Observe yourself from the side, as it were, and check whether you are able to discipline yourself to useful work at the board. This applies particularly to our recommendation about the different nature of thought according to whether it is our clock or that of the opponent that is going. Avoid the criminal waste of time that arises from the confusion of these two types of thought and that can easily lead to time trouble. Observe too how the stronger players behave at the board, how they suddenly fall into deep thought as they carry out a general assessment, how they still sit at the board thinking when it is not their turn to move. We know what they are doing- they are solving general problems, formulating verbal summaries of the position and planning ahead.
EXERCISES
clock is going you consider general questions to do with the position- overall assessment and planning. Of course there are exceptions, if it is a question of a tactical struggle with one main line that must be probed deeply. Then there are those grandmasters who like to walk around when it is not their turn to move. However there is the example of Botvinnik (and Fischer) who rarely get up from the board, but sit there all the playing time. I tried to follow Botvinnik's example, and found it hard since I am not that sort of character. However when I managed it my results greatly improved. Of course there is the complication that 'my time' is controlled by me, whereas I have no control over how long or short a time the opponent thinks with his clock running. Thus it may be that general considerations may have to be thought about during 'my time', especially if you are up against a quick player. Nevertheless try and follow the rule given above. Go through detailed variations in your own time, think in a general way about the position in the opponent's time and you will soon find that you get into time trouble less often, that your games have more content to them, and that their general standard rises. How to Train In striving to train, to improve in positional judgement, you should bear in mind the two sides of it:- training at home, and training during an actual competition game. As regards the former, you have to analyse many games and positions and try to divide them into types according to the different elements mentioned in our 'Mendeleyev' table. You should be aiming for a thorough understanding of each element and its link with the others. It would be useful if the results of this home training were w ritten dowm in special notebooks, with each element being allotted an appropriate amount of space. In studying the interaction of the elements, there are few better ways than going through notes to games by theoreticians who do not give just a list of variations, but provide a systematic explanation of the ideas of each game and how they arc linked with the concrete variations. The author can recommend a few' books of this sort, notably the three volume collection of Botvinnik's games and Bronstein's book 'The International Grandmasters Tournament' on the 1953 Candidates Tournament.* * fr. Note. The best of Botvinnik's notes to his games have been translated into English, notably in "One Hundred Selected Games" (MacGibbon and Kee) and Botvinniks Best Games 1947-1970", Batsford, 1972. Unfortunately the 1953 Candidates book is not yet available in any language other than Russian. Analyse and assess the position. Find Black's most vulnerable point.

Does W hite have the advantage here? Indicate Black's weak point. Show in a concrete fashion how to exploit this. Analyse and assess. Who has the advantage and what does it consist of? W'hat plan would you form for Black? Types of Plan Once assessment has been carried out the aims of each side become clearer. The player will work out what he must undertake in the next few moves, which manoeuvres he must make and where, which regrouping is called for. In short, we are now in the phase of planning. The nature of the position will suggest the sort of thought processes that will be necessary. If there is a combinational-tactical position, then we will normally make some such formulation as, 'I must attack on the K-sidc.', or 'I must undermine the enemy pawn chain at all costs.' Then this is backed up by more detailed analysis of concrete variations. If we have a manoeuvring-strategical position, then concrete variations arc reduced to a minimum and the main emphasis is put on as detailed a plan as possible. One absolute rule may already be stated:- it is impossible to play chess without a plan. One chess sage put it thus, 'A sound plan makes us all heroes, the absence of a plan -idiots.' Another commented, 'Better a bad plan than no plan at all.' Yet another, 'The player who will lose is the one without a plan. It is better to have a shallow or even faulty plan than just make moves not knowing what you are doing.' Planless play is thus fatal, as we can prose by a host of examples. Here is just one (44). Bronstein commented here, 'The opening is o\ er and both sides have to form a concrete plan. Yet instead of doing something active, White starts running on the spot and tries for "pressure'' on the backward pawn by not letting it advance to c5. Yet the real point is that Black does not intend to advance this far since on c6 the pawn will be guarded by just one bishop, while White will be putting it under pressure all the time with two rooks. As a result Black gets superiority of force at those parts of the board where the real battle is to be decided.' Analyse and assess. What docs White's advantage consist of? What plan would you choose for White? Indicate the next few moves. Types of Plan 67 Here is a definition which correctly reflects the course of thought and action of a grandmaster:- 'The plan in a game of chess is the sum total of successive strategical operations which are each carried out according to separate ideas arising from the demands of the position.' Does a plan depend on our will, is it the fruit of our burning fantasy? Can I do as I like with my pieces on my board (or on my half of it)? No, that is a quite mistaken concept. As Steinitz pointed out almost a century ago every plan must have its justification, and this justification lies not in the personality of the player, but in the position lying before him. This is a very valuable definition which indicates to the player the way he has to go. 'The plan is based on assessment.' Hence it is not fantasy, but creative work that creates the plan. There seem to be two sorts of plan in practical play. To make this clearer we start with elementary endings ( 45).

Even a queen up you can't win unless you proceed according to plan. Here it runs thus, 'White with the aid of both pieces drives the king into a coi ner, or to the edge (but be careful not to give stalemate!) and then mates with the queen either guarded by the king or checking along the last line of the board.' Winning the endgame with bishop and knight against lone king is more complicated and ii is no accident that there are cases where a master has not found the right way (46) The win can only be forced by playing to a strict plan consisting of three stages:
1. All three pieces co-operate to drive the king to a corner opposite to the
colour of the bishop.
2. All three pieces again drive the king to the corner of the same colour as
the bishop, taking care that the king docs not slip out en route. Black has a formidable position and soon got ccisivc advantage. Despite inventive defence the Swedish master was forced to resign. What is a plan? Even nowadays you can read in some books that a plan in chess is something that the grandmaster thinks up almost from the first few moves (certainly immediately after the 'book' moves arc finished) and realizes right up to the last few moves. This is quite mistaken. We shall sec later that in exceptional circumstances it is possible to create and carry out such a plan 'from first to last', but in the majority of cases the grandmaster docs not do this, in fact he simply cannot. One-Stage Plans 69 be achieved by assessing the position correctly and forming a plan that arises from it. 6'8 Planning
3. While preventing the king from getting out of the corner, the three
attacking pieces are re-arranged to create one of several mating positions. In the first case the plan has only one stage. In the second there are three stages. It is best to speak of two sorts of plan generally--the single-stage plan and the multi-stage plan. This distinction is confirmed as a useful one by the examples wc shall consider. First, though, another theoretical distinction. In the end-game mates, the player knows not only what will happen in the first stage but in all subsequent stages? Of course he may not be able to say on which square mate will be given, but the general outline is clear all the way. It is useful to divide multi-stage plans into three types. The first is when the maker of the plan can state the tasks and aims of each stage. This is called the plan when 'everything is clear to the end.' Then there is the plan when the future is glimpsed but dimly as if through a smoke haze. This we call the plan when 'something can be seen;' and finally there is the plan when only the first stage is at all clear, when it is not known what will happen at the second and subsequent stages. This third type is named 'subsequent darkness'. Wc feel that this division will help the reader to follow more easily our account of planning in chess. Botvinnik-Tai, world title return match 1961. Consider diagram 47. White is a pawn up, but it is hard to make it tell. How many endgames with opposite coloured bishops have ended in a draw! The win can be achieved here only by a deeply thought out logical plan based not only on the exploitation of material advantage but also positional plusses. Botvinnik wrote as follows about his plan. 'White intends to open the K- side hoping that he will either penetrate with his rooks into the opponent's rear, or create another passed pawn.'

In more complicated examples, victory can only Now the pawn gets to a7 which makes Black's position hopeless. After other moves White would double rooks on the h-filc, and play Jlc3 which

Realizing Positional advantage A one-stage plan is often called for in order to make a positional advantage count. As in the previous example, the player with the initiative envisages a favourable regrouping and carries out the necessary manoeuvres. Karpov-Polugayevsky, Candidates Match 1974 Karpov-Andersson, Madrid, 1973 In this apparently simple position Karpov spotted the strategically correct plan which is as follows:- exploit the weakness of the enemy Q-side by placing his bishop on a6 and the queen on b5. Black is then tied down so that White can advance his pawns to create a passed pawn on the wing. With better placed pieces the threat to advance this pawn proves decisive.

No less important than forming a plan is sticking to it. After all the opponent will try to anticipate your intentions, foresee what your next moves will be. Naturally he will seek the earliest possible opportunity to branch off into something you have not expected in the hope of gaining from this unexpected turn. Kotov-Eliskases, Stockholm, 1952 White envisaged an effective plan from diagram 50 along these lines:- To strengthen my position I have to provoke weakness on the K-side in the enemy pawn formation, since only then will a pawn advance by me find something to 'latch on to'. So the rook has to slip back to the K-side, force one or two pawns to advance, then play back to the a-file and follow up with a K-side pawn advance. 25 g7a5! ghd8 26 gg5 16 27 gga5 4V8!

The great master of defence, Lasker, commented thus on diagram 52:- 'White has difficulties. The centre is closed and so here the knights are stronger than the bishops.1 Alekhine played 15 <£jh4, which Lasker assessed as follows:- 'When Alekhine recognizes the weaknesses in his position he has a tendency to become very aggressive. Patient defence is not for him if he can see the slightest chance of creating an attack. Yet sound strategy often demands that you submit to the opponent's will so as to strengthen your weaknesses and get rid of defects in your game. The right plan here was Rhl, 4bgl so as to defend h3; then g3, 13 and gf2. In that way all the K- sidc squares would be defended, including the fourth rank. If Black prepared an attack by 17-15 then White in his turn could play f3-f4 or take on 15. White should be reconciled to the fact that Black had the initiative. Strix ing to take this initiative from Black is the least appropriate way to play.'

There arc many games which have been saved, or even won, by clever defence.

It is no easy matter to have to fall in with the opponent's intentions, and that is why the defender's plan, just like his tactical operations, have to be very exact. Tarrasch-Alekhine, Pistyan, 1922 Black has given up a pawn in the Blumenfeld Counter Gambit to get a strong centre and attacking chances on the K-sidc. White has to consider the pressure along the f-filc, especially against 12. There are also nasty threats along the h2/b8 diagonal. Alekhinc-Bogoljubow, World Ch. Match 1934 Tarrasch thought up an excellent defensive plan to guard 12 and h2. The

0-1 In some games a sound defensive plan leads to positions in which the defender can go over to the counter attack. This possibility may form part of the plan from the start, in other cases it is a long-term prospect. White has carried out his plan, but even the finest play cannot save a bad position, especially against such a fine attacker as Alekhine. Black's next move indicates that not all the points in White's camp are defended and that there is the irreparable drawback for White'in that he cannot hold back the opponent's central pawn mass. 18 . . . g5!

White resigned here, since great material loss will follow Black's central breakthrough, especially in view of the fact that the king has not yet managed to hide' in the corner. Multi-Stage Plans We have already defined three sorts of multi-stage plan: when all the features are apparent to the planner; when only some details can be seen; and when nothing is clear after the first stage. Now we will consider each type in detail. Everything is clear to the end There are rare examples when a player can envisage all stages of his plan to the very end. The stages dovetail into each other, the aims are clear and the means also-which pieces are to be exchanged, which regrouped, which pawns to be advanced. on a7, where it will not interfere with or be endangered by his counter attack. 15 . . . 16 a4 Qd8 a5! 17 ga2 <$>c7 18 gh6 Sa6!

(56) Alekhine-Chajes, Carlsbad, 1923 Alekhine outlined his plan from diagram 57 as follows:- The first stage is to bring the king to the centre, so that in the event of the exchange of major pieces it can threaten a quick penetration at a5. This will inevitably induce Black to bring his king over, especially since it is needed to defend e6 and c6. The second stage is to force Black's pieces one by one to leave the K-side by tactical threats to the king and to the enemy pawns (see the 39th and 41st moves). The threat of Ne5 will tie the enemy knight to d7, which will hinder still further the mobility of Black's pieces which are already lacking in space.
80 Planning Multi-Stage Plans 81
The third stage is to double rooks on the h-file at a time when Black's forces are farthest away from the K-side.

From the position of diagram 59, Smyslov carried out a multi-stage plan to exploit his extra pawn, which is doubled, but central. Black's advantage consists of his control over the central squares d4, d5, c5, f4 and f5. White has control of the Q-file and a paw n majority on the Q-side which provide him with counter chances. Smyslov's plan consisted of these stages:-
1. Exchange one pair or rooks at once, and leave the other on, ready to
counter White's Q-side pawns and to attack the pawns at c4 and e4.
2. Use the threat of creating a distant passed pawn to divert the enemy
rook to the h-file, and use his rook on the d-file.
3. Undermine the support of the e4 pawn by g7-g5-g4.
4. Tie down White's pieces by attacking the e4 pawn.
White has carried out the first two stages. Black's pieces have been diverted to the Q-side by the need to defend against various threats there. This has left the K-side without adequate defence. 47 . . . Nd7

Karpov finds a curious way of achieving this by a knight retreat, though the idea is not new. The retreat 45b 1 enables c3 to be played and then 45b1 d2-f3 will eject the bishop, though care must be taken to play >h2 as well so as not to let it settle at g.3. The first stage then is clear. Did Karpov look into the details of the subsequent play? Hardly. He probably envisaged the outlines of pressure on the f-lilc after he had doubled rooks there. 45g5 might be possible to Multi-Stage Plans 85

Neither side has any marked weakness; control of open lines is also about level. Flohr formed a long plan whose main aim was to get his knight to e4. Then he envisaged co-ordinating his pieces for an attack on the K-side.

The great Capablanca probably only saw the vague outlines of subsequent events when he made his plan to regroup his pieces in diagram 64, a position from a famous game. The plan was as follows:- Withdraw the bishop to d7 to support the advance b5. This pawn will provide excellent back-up to the knight which will play to c4. This square will be seen to be very important for Black. If White tries b3 to eject the knight he will have a hole at a3 and a backward pawn at a2. However White will probably not be able to stand the knight for long and will play _xc4. Then Black gets rid of his doubled pawn and can make a general pawn advance on the Q-side. Did Capablanca examine the position further, and is it necessary to do this? Hardly. His experience and intuition will have suggested to him that victory is to be forced in such situations by further measures such as play on both sides of the board so as to stretch the defender's resources, but the details of these further measures have to be left till later, all depending on how the opponent reacts. What a fine position for Black! Black's sound position in the centre now lets him attack by the advance of the K-sidc pawns. 23 gacl c6 24 _&el gae8 25 g3 d7 26 fl g5! 28 gd3 f4 29 ef gf 30 <Nh4 Qh8

The reader might be sceptical about the value of this game, objecting that by simple moves White could have spoiled Black's whole concept. However chess is many-sided and at any point (except for cases of forced lines in a combination) the opponent can diverge, can choose from several different lines. What is important, however, is to form a correct plan arising from the demands, the features, of the position. If our plan is good then we can feel confident that any divergence will not be to our disadvantage.

Admittedly White has a weakness at c4, but this is a traditional weakness in the Nimzoindian Defence and White has often been successful with this pawn formation. If White is playing to win he will have to work hard to find a point of entry in the black formation. There are two possibilities-along the g-file, or via the transfer point h5. But it is not clear where the knight should go to from h5, or how the bishop and queen will be employed. VX ithout looking too far ahead White formed this multi-stage plan.
1. Exchange a pair of rooks to help ease operations on the K-side.
White has taken the g-file and so carried out all three stages of his plan. What next? White has to find a way of penetrating deeper, and formed this plan.
1. Free the knight from the defence of c4 by playing the king to d3.
2. Then play the knight back to h5. Then with the rook on g7 there
would be the grave threat of >g6 winning the pawn on 16.

However, the reader should prepare himself for some amusing turns yet in this game. It was played out over a number of morning adjournment sessions, and it is a convention that a team member who fias morning play in the Olympiad should not normally have to begin a fresh game in the afternoon.

1. Play the queen to h8 to limit the mobility of the enemy pieces as much
as possible.
2. By a5, to open lines on the Q;side even at the cost of a pawn.
3. Combining threats by the queen on the h-file and on the queen side,
White will finally force the bishop to quit c8 and then the while king will enter via h5. Here is the conclusion of this epic game which is so instructive from the point of view of planning.

As for the sceptical reader who doubts whether such detailed planning was feasible, I must remind him that the game was adjourned several times and I had perfect freedom to examine all this at leisure, though I feel the planning would not be too much to expect at the board too. As we stressed at the outset, a plan for a whole game is very rare. It can happen in one of two cases; either when the opponent fails to put up much resistance and all the play is 'at one end'; and when certain factors give a fixed form to the position that cannot be changed in the normal course of play. queens. 14 . . . gab8 15 £}d5 -Nxd2 16 gxd2 b4 Forced in view of the threatened 17 cb ab 18 d4! with advantageous complications in the centre. 17 d4 Karpov considers this position strategically won for White, pointing to his grip on d5.

A striking example, despite the apparently routine nature of the Learn From The World Champions 99 Lasker-Pillsbury, Paris, 1900 position f 73). Believe it or not the one-stage plan leads almost by force to the win of the b7 pawn!

Reshevsky Petrosian, Candidates T. Zurich, 1953 Black has a difficult position. White's centre pawns look ready to advance and sweep everything from their path, supported as they are by well posted pieces. Black's pieces are cramped on the back three rows. His main strength lies in the Q-side pawns. For the moment the enemy centre pawns have a black square orientation which suggests that it would be well to blockade them by a knight on d5. But this post cannot be reached since the square e7 is occupied by a rook. Well then, give up the rook so that the knight can reach d5 and be supported by a pawn at e6.

some advice and warn the reader against typical mistakes in planning. The first piece of advice is, 'Don't lose contact with the actual position!' As we shall see, even strong grandmasters can go badly wrong in this respect. Your plan must be subordinated to the demands of the position, must arise from it. When you are looking for the best move you take into account many factors:-does it correspond to your aim, will it produce any drawback in your position, will the opponent be able to exploit the weak side of it? Only when you feel confident that you have weighed all these factors will you actually make the move. In particular you have to take account of the fact that every plan produces a change in the position of the pieces and pawns, so you have to consider the fresh position arising after the plan has been carried out. Does this new position offer chances to the opponent that he did not have before? The next example (83) shows a faulty plan. So Szabo planned to undermine the support of the knight by '"iya2 and Ab3 with pressure on the a2 /g8 diagonal. Then double rooks on the c-file after which there is a threat of -a5xb7, and if 'S'd7xb7 then gxc6and the strong point at d5 falls, and with it the whole enemy K-side is in danger. Unfortunately, though this plan seemed sound -the knight sacrifice for two pawns would only be made when all preparations had been completed-there is a flaw. The white pieces leave the king unprotected and Black can storm that side. If Szabo had weighed this up he would probably have chosen another plan. The idea of undermining d5 is right, but was carried out wrongly. There were much better chances in a pawn advance by gbl, a4 and b5 striving to create a weak pawn on c6 and then operating on both the b- and c-files. 1 #a2 a6

Szabo Botvinnik, Amsterdam Olympiad, 1954 White has to take account of the weaknesses in Black's position, most of all the square c5 and the weakened K-side. The half-open c-file on which White has already begun operations also has significance. There is the possibility of Black's K-side pawns becoming active. Considering the position of the pieces, one concludes that both sides have positioned them well, especially the knight at d5 which has influence on both sides of the board. White came to the conclusion that the position was about level and then considered his plan. The plan involving f3 was soon rejected-don't make pawn moves in the area where you are weaker. It is more logical to play on the Q-side. It would be nice to get rid of the knight at d5, but how? It would not be advantageous to give up the good bishop at e2.

study of the play of the grandmasters of the past. When you examine these games you notice that many plans repeat themselves, and you will naturally hope to apply these recurring plans in your own games. The study of typical plans is something that the leading grandmasters devote a great deal of time to. I would say that the most far-seeing of them devote as much time to this as to the study of openings. Lasker Capablanca, Moscow, 1935 28 hg hg

Botvinnik-Ragozin, Training game, 1947 The weakness of the black squares on the Black king side in diagram 84 is immediately apparent. Black's possesion of the d- and c-files is no compensation in view of the fact that White's active pieces do not let him use these files. White's plan is simple. He will increase the pressure on the weakened black squares aiming for a bishop sacrifice on g6 so that his queen and rooks can get a mating attack. There are also knights on the board, but they will soon be exchanged since White's knight will be too strongly posted at lb. When you follow how precisely Botvinnik carries out the plan of exploiting the black squares, you are full of praise, but . . .

where we reckon wc shall have reached our objective. In other words the plan starts with our laying down our objective and ends with its achievement. In which cases should we aim for a one-stage plait, in which many- staged? It all depends on the concrete position we are dealing with, on the aim which we set ourselves. If the aim can be achieved in a few' moves, if it is achieved without a number of steps then our plan is of the one-stage sort. If the distance to the aim consists of many moves, if we need several 'jumps' to reach it then it is a question of a many-staged plan with intermediate, subsidiary aims. In whose clock time does the grandmaster think out his plan? As we have stressed already, everything that is expressed in words rather than variations should be thought out when the opponent's clock is ticking, as far as is possible. How does the idea of a plan arise in the mind of a grandmaster? The process is a creative one, but it is inextricably linked with the assessment. One of the tasks of the assessment is to establish where the weak points lie in each camp, and the plan must be linked with these weaknesses. Do not forget to devote some time to considering what plan the opponent has formed, or will form. The example of the Szabo-Botvinnik game showed us the consequences of ignoring the opponent. Moreover, know your own capacity and do not try to overburden your mind with plans you cannot cope with. There arc some players who, tojudge by what they say after a game, arc bubbling over with all sorts of ideas and plans. When you look into them you End that many of these ideas are not linked with the position, are superficial, unreal. You have to have realistic aims that you can cope with and that you can fit into a plausible plan. Work hard at your planning, and always bear in mind Lasker's aphorism, 'To find the right plan is just as hard as looking for its sound justification.' This stresses what cannot be repeated too often, that assessment and planning are inextricably linked. How to Train Once again we divide this into two parts. Training at home, and training during a game. For home training, the best thing is the study of well-annotated games. Once again we have to say that although there are many books on chess, there are few with the sort of thing the student needs. The modern grandmaster prefers to restrict himself to variations on the whole, but the Exercises 119 student should look for games with verbal statements as well as variations. If such 'prose' is missing, don't despair, but try and find out on the basis of just the moves at what point the assessment and planning took place. The effort to work this out will repay you. Training during a game should begin with simple plans. The most useful and necessary things are such as, which piece to exchange and which to leave on. This is a key question in many positions, and can form a plan in itself. Another basis can be the regrouping of pieces, or of just one piece. Achieving harmony in your position may be very necessary when it is not clear what else you should be undertaking. Always remember the value of analogies. The player who has 'collected' in his memory a number of sound plans will often find the opportunity to apply them, so easing the burden on himself: that is why the reader has been offered a large number of examples in this section. One final point. Be sure that you formulate your plan in words (of course to yourself in internal monologue-you will be able to share them with others later when you write notes or demonstrate the game). A schoolteacher of mine used this method to establish whether we knew the meaning of a word. If we could give a succinct definition then we knew the word. If we floundered about, we didn't know it. It is the same with plans. Consider that you have a plan only when you can formulate it in words in your mind. Otherwise there is no plan. Formulate a plan for realizing the extra pawn. State which positional factors help this plan. realizing White's material advan- tage.

They carry out quiet positional plans, and if they attack then they try to do it without sacrifices. However, this point of view is not quite correct. Even if our positional master does not carry out startling sacrifices, he has to be aware of combinational ideas and foresee short simple combinations if only to circumvent them on the part of the opponent. Elementary combinations are the basis of the whole chess struggle, and are the inevitable accompaniment of both strategical plans and tactical battles, such as one finds in pretty- well every game.

Then by forming on the Q;sidc a second passed pawn and combining this with an attack on the weakened refuge of the king Black would have excellent winning chances.

If we leave on one side the excessive modesty of a player who had been world champion for ten years at that time, we must note that even a player of Botvinnik's strength had to take account of combinational vision and try to improve it. How does one improve in this respect? By analysing at home complicated positions. Just as a pianist practises the most com- plicated pieces to improve the technique of his fingers, so too a grandmaster must keep his vision in trim by daily analysis of positions with sharp possibilities, and this applies whether he prefers such positions in his play or not. So we conclude that whatever your inclinations you must have combinational vision and keep it in regular trim by practising analysis of positions which have sharp or forcing possibilities. If you don't do this you will regress. However there arc compensa-
3 Combinational Vision
Training Combinational Vision The audience at an international tournament is like a theatre audience. Their gaze is fixed on the stage, but not so much at the 'actors', as at the demonstration boards. The comparative quietness of the audience is normally disturbed only when a surprising move is played, say when a piece is placed en prise. Sometimes someofie will wave to the game demonstrators to indicate that he thinks they have put up the wrong move. But no! This time there is no error. The opponent replies, accepts the sacrifice, and a series of moves follow. Only then does the audience come to realize what is going on. A combination-has been played, a sacrifice made, and admiration is the order of the day. Why was the grandmaster confident he saw the future whereas the audience thought it a mistake? The simple answer is that the grandmaster has a well developed combinational vision, the audience is less well qualified. Is this a natural gift? Not really, otherwise the great players would have seen such combinations when they were very young. We know that child prodigies have played good chess, but rarely produced outstanding combinations. The marvellous productions of such combinational experts as Morphy, Alekhine and Tai came in their more mature period as a result of hard work and study. Of course a genius will master the subject better and quicker than one less well gifted, but we conclude that study and hard work will enable anyone interested in the subject to develop his eye for combinations. The question might be posed whether a player cannot get by without a thorough mastery of this art. After all there are grandmasters in whose play you will not find complicated combinations and sacrifices. Their games do not figure in the anthologies of brilliancies, they play without putting anything en prise, not minor pieces, not even Botvinnik commented on the position of diagram 98, 'Here White offered a draw, and after White's last move 16 dl-bS it was accepted - but wrongly!

'like a hawk'. It was Alekhine too who when asked what were the qualities which made for success at chess stressed the need to know your own strong points and defects as well as those of the opponent and then added, 'Thirdly a player must have a higher aim than passing satisfaction. I see this aim in scientific and creative achieve ments which put chess on a par with a number of other arts.' tions in this task. Great pleasure can be had in discovering combina- tions, or in working through the combinations of others. Some are real works of art which will give pleasure throughout the ages. We all know how worked up a player can get when going through such combinations.

The triumph of inferior forces, of the little man, as in Charlie Chaplin films, is a powerful device favoured by drama writers. It also produces a strong effect on the chess fan. The dramatic effect of many combina- tions and studies is based on this. Who can fail to admire the follow- ing piece when he sees it for the first time?

132 Combinational Vision The Theory oj Combinations 133
to include many fine combinations in which there were no sacrifices, but it is a handy definition for the purpose of instruction. In order to clarify the constituent parts of a combination and what they consist of, it is best to examine a simple concrete example ( 124). combination is very limited. The presence of such circumstances is the reason for the genesis of the idea in the master's brain'. The next vital element of a combination is the final position which we are striving to reach. This position is called the theme of the combination. In our example, the theme position was the position when the king was mated and the name smothered matt* is the name of this particular theme. In order to reach the final position from the initial one. we have to make a series of moves which carry out the desired transformation. This series of moves that turn the initial position into the thematic one are called the means of the combination. In our example the means are the check on 17, the double check on h6, the queen sacrifice on g8 and finally the mating move to f7. One important further condition has to be mentioned. In addition to the main features or reasons making a combination feasible, there are always subsidiary features. In our example the combination would not have existed if the queen was not at c4 (or e6) since Black could then meet £}f7+ by taking the knight, and would be twro pawns up. These subsidiary features have always to be taken into account w'hen seeking a combination. They can be appropriately named the particular features of the position. 42)g4+ and so on from the start. The conclusion for the reader to draw from these fine examples is that chess combinations are a sort of dramatic work of art, full of tension and aesthetic content. It is for this facet of the game more than any other that millions of people throughout the world love chess. Now that we have seen the romanticism of combinations we £}b8+ b5 8 Na7+ Nb4 9 4>6+ <Nc3 10 £}b5+ <Nd3 11 £}b4+ Ne2 12 Nc3+ <£12 13 Nd3+ <Ng3 14 Ne4+ <Ng4 15 4>5+ <£15 16 £jg3+ £16 17 can settle down to their mechanism, and try to develop our eye for combinations by trying the exercises. A love for this is necessary- in order to improve. The Theory of Combinations It is useful to master some concepts of the constituent parts of combinations. After a great deal of discussion in Soviet chess literature about the correct definition of a combination, it was decided that from the point of view of a methodical approach it was best to settle on this definition:-A combination is a forced variation with a sacrifice. This definition fits in well with earlier ideas. Thus Lasker wrote that 'By positional play a master tries to prove and exploit true values, whereas by combinations he seeks to refute false values ... A combination produces an un- expected re-assessment of values.' Clearly what he has in mind here is the sacrifice which leads to the White delivers the well-known smothered mate by the following forced variation involving a sacrifice. 1 £jf7+ Ng8 2 Nh6++ Nh8 3 ' g8+ H x g8 4 4 17 mate. First of all what features of the position made the combination possible? The presence of two pawns blocking flight squares, the lack of space for the king that gives the mate its name. Such factors are called in chess theory the motif of the com- bination, the reason for it arising, the special features which enable the sacrifice to be made s6 that a specified aim can be achieved. As Lasker put it, 'The range of circumstances in which it is possible to presuppose the presence of a triumph in given circumstances of lesser forces over greater. Or take this quotation from Botvinnik, 'What is the essence of a combination? From his first steps a player is taught the normal materia] values of the pieces. It is known that a rook is stronger than a knight, that a bishop is about equal to three pawns, and a bishop and two pawns is about worth a rook, and a queen is stronger than a rook and so on. However there are positions where these relationships cease to apply, where, for example, a queen turns out to be weaker than a pawn. The path to such positions lies through the sacrifice'. I must point out that the defi- nition which we have adopted fails

White has given up a piece for the attack, the defender's knights are far away from the king. 34 17+ Qh8 35 gdl #c8

The Double Attack The double attack or fork is learned by the beginner quite early on. It is based on some geometrical motif linking certain pieces which lets them be attacked simultaneously so that at least one of them must fall. Such combinations are very common, since the fork can be carried out by every unit from pawm to king (138). 1 c5+! Forking king and bishop. If 1 . . .

Diversion If often happens that a piece is firmly posted on a square where it blocks our approach to the king or hinders the execution of our intentions. Then it may be worth a great deal of material to divert it from its post ( 144): Kotov-Kalmanok, Tula, 1931 This is a possibility in the game which did not actually occur. 1 #g7 gf8 2 gxd5 ed 3 4W Axfb 4 4dg6+ Ae7 5 #xf8 mate. Always bear in mind that a pin is not necessarily a permanent feature: there may also arise some possibility of forcibly breaking a pin by a combinative stroke. Line Closing This feature occurs frequently, and is sometimes banal, but here is a spectacular example ( 142):- White has a clear win, and such Johansson-Rey, Postal, 1935 42) x e4! 42)cxe4 gxe4 £}xe4 gxe4 #xe4 Ng5!

the positioning of a long ranging piece behind its own or an enemy piece, whose movement opens up the action of the ambushing piece on to a certain square or along a certain line.

This is just one example of an The Mind of a Grandmaster Now we have to deal with the difficult process of the origin and realization of combinations.

After all it's a question of a forced win, so time trouble won't matter too much. That is the way it went in the actual game*. What can we say about the method of finding the combination? White stated the motifs-the bad king position, the open files. Nor did he fail to notice the special features of the position -the bishop at e8 that made #d6 mate possible in some lines. The thematic position was quite unknown to White at the *Tr. Note. Although the author does not state it, the game is Kotov- Yudovich, USSR Ch. 1939 the idea for an episode or a whole scene in their plays strikes them as a sudden flash of inspiration which can come to them in the most unexpected places, at the most unexpected time. Something similar can happen to a grandmaster at the board, but it is not an accident, it has been prepared by the play leading up to that particular position. Even many moves before the actual combination arises he may have had a feeling, or even the certainty that a combination is latent. This thought is suggested by certain motifs in the position. For example if he sees a weakened long black diagonal, he will feel that it would be nice to find a way of exploiting this. Or if the opponent fails to make a bolt hole for his king, there will arise the desire to achieve a back rank mate. One might say that the appear- ance of combinative motifs in a position provokes an urge in the player to seek a forcing line, a mood to play combinatively. The mood may change if the position becomes simplified, but in tense situations this mood is present to the maxi- mum extent. In the majority of cases his search for combinations, even in sharp positions, is not crowned with success-the position turns out not to be 'ripe' for such a solution, but suddenly, in the appropriate circumstances, the player is rewarded for his unremit- ting effort by the 'explosion' of a brilliant combination. Using the terms we have pre- viously defined, we might say that by going through the motifs of a given position we choose a corres- ponding thematic position for them. Or, on the other hand, knowing that a certain theme is possible, say back row mate, we seek the appropriate means, the measures required to reach the desired goal. Through Means to the Theme In many cases, probably the majority of them, a combination arises in the mind in the process of going through various plausible lines of play. When we start the calculations, we do not know the sort of thematic position we are aiming for; it arises in our mind after careful study of the available motifs followed by examining various ways of playing, one of which becomes the means of our combination. Let us imagine White's train of thought in diagram 150. We work on the assumption that he has come fresh to the position and so has to work it all out from the start, though in actual fact he has been sitting at the board for about three hours and his mind is already filled with the possibilities before him. He would be working it out along these lines:-What do I have? His king is badly placed, but I still have files, a strong knight at d4. Must hurry before he can slip away with the king to safety at b8. His last move was rook to e4 attacking the knight. Defend it by 12? He'll go Rd8. No, then I go ' '16+ winning. So he'll go g5 or • 'e5 centraliz- ing, and then what do I have? Wait a minute. What about 15+ ? He has no choice, takes and I go Rxf5. Then he can't take rook-mate on d6 by the queen. But he doesn't have to take. What do I have after ' c6 or c7? A piece gone. What about R15 instead? Well we are playing for mate, so a rook down wouldn't matter if it's sound. If his queen moves then g54- with a powerful attack. Nor can he meet the rook sac by e5, since

to take the rook and I take on 15 with knight, check. Then his king is drawn forward. But what if he doesn't take? Say

Rxf7+ Axf7, N15+ . So he definitely has to take, and

he would be in a bad way with the pawn going to e7 at once, or after 30 . . . @-e8 31 @'c7+ <5>g8 32 Ae7 4yg4 33 @'d7 and Black can resign. Or 30 Ba3 xaS 31 Nh5+ and now refusal by 31 ... <3?h6. Then 32 45x16 @rcl + 33 <g>12 @'d2+ 34 < ?g3 xcST 35 <|?h4 @, xd4+ 36 45g4+! All clear! Here again it was a case of having clearly expressed motifs. White then examined the means and came to the thematic position of the whole combination, which is promoting the pawn on e8. The number of thematic positions in chess is practically unlimited. That is why the mating position cannot be foreseen in most cases from the starting point, and becomes clearer only after the motifs and means have been worked through. calculations, but at the end. The most refined chess genius could hardly hope to tackle it in the reverse order. White has a strong attack, but how to mate? 1 Hg3 should win but a forcing solution is more desirable. What are the motifs? The badly defended king, and as more specific features the concealed battery @ 6 / ffi d3. and the pressure on the g-file. So we have to work through the means. 1 gg3 and 1 45g3 are not forcing enough, but suddenly the idea of the attack on h7 leads to the inspired thought that 1 @"h7+ may work. (Possibly for a combinative player such as Tai this queen sacrifice followed by double check would be the first idea to consider). After 1 ... < xh7 (Forced, otherwise 2 hS mate) the battery opens fire by 2 4516+ . If 2 ... <3?xh6 3 Sh3+ we find to our creative delight that it is mate in every variation, 3 ... <3Pg5 4 Hg3+ and 5 Hg6 or 5 Hg4 to follow. Then we seek other thematic positions of mate if 2 . . . 'S'hS. By hard effort we find these too, though our previous examination of variations and discovery of thematic positions helps us in the search. Thus 2 . . . <3?h8 3 J xg7+ ! <3?xg7 (or 3 ... Qxg7 4 £Nh3+ and mate next move) 4 Hg3+ and once again there are four squares to go to, but in each case the start, yet there were several such positions-every mating position that arose. Thus White went through the means of the combination (or more accurately speaking he sought continuations that became the means) and saw that he could draw out the king into his own position and there give mate, so there were various thematic positions according to the way Black chose. This was a typical example of finding a combination by the sequence motif -means-theme. Here is another example of the same pattern ( 151). motifs? Mainly the passed pawn at e6. Two moves forward and queens. Also my strong queen at e5, the distance of the knight at b3 from the scene of action. Removing the blockading queen would be desirable. The only way is J a3. What other use for the bishop which is otherwise dominated by the knight? Possibly 30 45h5+ gh 31 g5+ <3?f8 and only then
32 Aa3.
In any event the sacrifices at a3 and h5 clearly figure as possibilities. After ' 'g5+ where would the king go? Makes no difference, since after '@, xf6+ the king must go to g8- <3?e8 allows mate in two by '@'17+
[diagram]
'@'17+ and e7 or e7 at once. Clearly we get a new queen and the whole question is whether Black has perpetual check in the interim. So 30 .a3 'g'xaS 31 Nh5+ gh 32 @rg5+ SlphS 33 xlbT <5 8 34 c7.

W'ell Il- Botvinnik-Capablanca, Avro, We shall again try to establish the thought process, and apologize to the ex-world champion if the way we depict it is less deep and quick than his method at the time. At least the device has teaching value. So, White to move. The tension in the position indicates that there might be a forced way to win. What Engels Consultants, Ribeirato Preto, 1949 In diagram 152 we get various fine mating positions, but they are not the starting point of White's
148 Combinational Vision The Mind of a Grandmaster 149
vindictive rook gives mate on g6 or g8. If we work it out we will find that there were nine (!) different thematic positions in this com- bination, Such an abundance could not be coped with unless we started with motifs and means. So 2 a4 fails. What else? 2 c4 is a fine move now attacking the loose queen and closing the line of attack to the rook at e2. Fits in with the plan of diverting the defenders of Q>e8. So 2 . . . d7 is forced. Does that save him? Well, if we can go to c4 with impunity with the queen why not c7 too? Then the same considerations apply and he is forced to b5 again with his queen. We rest a moment and then take up the search again. His queen is at b5, mine at c7. Is 4 xb7 a diversion of the queen? No, he has that 4 . . .
[diagram]
with that rook at e2? If his queen was on a4 we would have 4 Re4! threatening 5 - xc8 and then 6 Rxa4 with a rook up. But we can get the queen to go to a4 by 4 a4! His ' 'Xe2 doesn't work any more-our queen blocks his rook on the c-filc. So 4 . . . xa4 5 ge4 and now back again 5 . . . b5. Now' he isn't threatening ' 'xe2, so we can go 6 ' 'xb7 and finally his queen has no squares from which to guard e8. Check it again. 1 g4 b5 2 c4 ' d7 3 c7 bS 4 a4 ' , xa4 5 gc4 #b5 (Any alternatives? 5 . . . 'S'fB 6 • xd6+ Be7 7 gxe7, or 5 ... g6 6 xc8 xe4 7 ' , xe8+) 6 • xb7. Hooray! This is the process then, by which the mind of a player, step by step, sees a combination, though at first he can only suspect that there is a e8 and d8. Here it isn't the case, given the bishop on d8 and the rook on b8. Then we get the idea of 1 d7 at once, but it fails to 1 . . . 4d*d7 or 1 . . . <3?f8. However the idea of pawn promotion still persists. Then there comes the inspiration that d7 would work if it forked units on e8 and c8. So consider 1 c8 gxc8 2 ge8+ g xe8 3 d7. Wait though, can three enemy pieces not cope with one pawn? Black has 3 . . . 4dd6, but only a few seconds of dismay give way to delight when we continue with 4 dc = £}xc8 5 ab and finally promotion is forced. Here the order was motif- theme-means. We considered the advanced pawns and then recalled the theme of a pawn on the seventh rank threatening a knight on the eighth. So the theme here was clear to us and preceeded the means. (I trust the reader would not have been surprised if such means had not existed. We have already stressed that for a combination to exist we had to have certain special factors as well as the presence of motif, means and theme). Here is another example of the motif and theme becoming clear, with the difficulty lying in the search for the means to link the two (184). At this point, and possibly earlier than this, White must have had the feeling that a back row mate could be 'on'-all three pawns are in Through Theme to the Means Any grandmaster can quote examples in which the road to discovery of a combination was different. Adams -Torre, New' Orleans, 1920 place denying the king a flight square off the back rank, while two pieces attack e8 and two defend it. Clearly a tense position. White can afford to put his queen cn prise to the rook at c8 and to the queen at d7, as long as he does not do it along the a4/c8 diagonal. Where should White's attacked queen go to? Clearly g4 is possible; not c4 as there is no threat and Black would just make a boh hole or go 1 . . . Rxe2. So 1 g4 when Black cannot go 1 ... Rxe2 since he loses his queen and White's remaining rook is guarded. (Don't lose sight of the fact that White too has no flight square and so a potentially weak back rank). Neither black rook can guard the attacked queen, so 1 . . . 'b5 is forced. How then to keep the pressure on. 2 a4 looks fine, but wait, what about 2 . . . • 'Xe2! and you are the one to be mated (3 •Nxc8 is met by the intermediate move 3 . . . xel + ). Good thing that was spotted in time! Ifwccome 'cold' to diagram 153 we would quickly sec its special features. If we had played for hours to reach it in an actual game, the motifs would be engraved in our mind. They are the open files and the presence of two advanced pawns. As a result the thought must arise, is it possible to promote one of them? Remembering standard patterns, you consider 1 ge8+ Nxe8 2 d7 when often the pawn queens be- cause of a double threat to queen on
150 Combinational Vision Learn from the World Champions 151
beautiful possibility in front of him. Sometimes the suspicion cannot be turned into reality as the special features do not 'co-operate'. However fixing on a thematic position, studying the motifs, it is sometimes possible for the player to find the means to link the two. The creative thought of a player on the path motif-theme-means enables him to finally see the whole course of this magical process. The grandmaster in his creative search can be compared to a weary traveller in the forest who is looking for the hut where he will find warmth, comfort and rest. How should he find it? In one case he does not even know if there is such a hut, though his intuition and experience of life tell him that there could be. He tries this path and that. He may find it in the tangle of paths, or his search may finally prove to be in vain. Nevertheless he must seek it high and low! Then there is the case where the traveller knows for sure that there is a hut. He has been in this place before and seen it. This time there are no paths, and he must fight his way through marsh, fallen trees and other obstacles. Yet there must be a path to the desired goal! The position of diagram 155 looks fairly level. If Black can get in h6 then he will soon follow up with the freeing move c5. However the presence of the knight at g5 and the absence of a pawn at 17 always suggests a check on the a2/g8 diagonal. How can this diagonal be opened? Consider 19 d5!. If 19 . . . £}e7 (as was played in the actual game) then 20 de Axe6 21 gdl e5 [21 . . . 45d5? 22 Nxe6 xe6 23 c4 and the pinned knight will be lost) 22 A x b7 and the extra pawn will win. (Back row mate!) The combination comes after 19 ... ed 20 Axd5+! xd5 21 gd 1! and the queen has nowhere to go on the diagonal to prevent 22 •a2+, or 22 b3+ . So the motif was present, and the means were found. However, we must stress that the means depend on a combination of circumstances. It needed only a small change in the position for the combination not to work. Let us imagine that White had an extra pawn at b3. Then Black would have been able to play 21 . . . bS and after 22 a4 'bf would still prevent c4+ . Assessing the position of diagram 156 by the method which he had recently formulated, Steinitz would look for small advantages in White's position. Black has weak points at e6 and g7. White has possession of the c- and c-files, though not total control of them. Stcinitz-von Bardeleben, Hastings, 1895 Black is a pawn up which is in the centre, but the king is subject to attack. The overall assessment gives White the advantage, so he has the obligation to attack upon pain of losing his advantage. In Steinitz's days the theory of middle game play was not so far advanced as now, and Steinitz would not use the words motif, means and theme. From our point of view the bad position of the black king is an important motif for the following combination, which involves play on the back two ranks. Consider 20 #g4 g6 21 £sg5+ <R48. The presence of forced moves -and the tension in the position suggest a combination. Try 22 gxe7+. Then capture by the queen allows 23 H xc8+ . Or 22 . . . <Rxc7 23 gel + with a powerful attack. Thus 23 . . . R418? 24 <£}e6+ and wins the queen by 25 £y5+. Or 23 . . . <Rd6 24 W+ <R>c7 (24 . . . Sc5 25 Se6+) 25 Learn from the World Champions Once again we call upon the help of the world champions, and hope to develop our combinational vision by working through the thought processes behind their best efforts in this field. Our helpers will work through the variations without moving the pieces on the board, and you must try to do the same. This method, which most closely approaches the conditions of competitive play, cannot be recommended too strongly. You should seize every opportunity to solve puzzles, studies, and 'find the continuation' quizzes in newspapers and magazines. Here we will work through themes in the order in which we have already considered them. Our supposition about the way the champions discovered and worked through their combinations is based on their notes, and partly on the author's knowledge of the men and their methods.

Black sees the awkward placing of White's pieces in diagram 160, especially the bishops on the second rank. This suggests the entry c2 either now or after preparation. 20 So White can take on e7 and force a brilliant win. Learn from the World Champions 155 file, but 31 <S>g2, 32 ghl, 33 h4 looks too slow. Three moves is too long since it would let Black organize a defence, and my own king is not too safe. I must strike at his weakest point. He has a good defence built up on f7 and h7. The knight sacrifice on g7 looks right. Then I follow up £}f5+ and the bishop attacks from h6 or IB. That looks logical. (Of course Smyslov in his whole build-up would have seen that he was angling for a knight sacrifice on g7, but we are working on the basis that he has come 'cold' to the position, as the reader had done). Now to work out the variations. 31 4d x g7 <S )xg7 first. Obviously 32 Nf5+ and he can take or move the king. 32 . . .

This was the variation that occurred in the game. It could be said that the combination was not forced from the initial position, but that by threats to enemy pieces Black worked towards a critical point where White went wrong and allowed mate.

Larsen-Spassky, USSR-Rest of World, Belgrade, 1970 In diagram 163, White has just attacked the knight. Should I retreat? Then he would complete his Q-side development. I can sacrifice the knight by 12 ... h4 and after he takes my knight I get a powerful pawn on g3. Nearly all my pieces can back it up, while he has a set of undeveloped pieces on the other side. Moreover his queen is a long way away and cannot get over to the K-side in time. Plenty of motifs here. The pawn at g3 can go forward to promote by g2 and Shi. So here we have a thematic position arising very soon, before the means are clear. Black en- visages queening the pawn on g3, though he cannot yet see whether he will achieve this.

Need I be looking to take his rook? 3 . . . < xf2 removes the threat to my rook, and threatens 4 . . . £}xhl and if 5 xhl with check. So he will go 4 Qjr2. and the position loses some of its tension. How can Black win? Just a pawn up w'ith such a relation of forces would not win an endgame. He could give up a knight for a pawn with a theoretical draw. Something forced has to be looked for instead. Clearly I must attack and 4 . . . e6 fits the bill. His rook is en prise, a knight check on g4 becomes possible, followed by discovered check-his king cannot go to the back rank in view of my gal + . Where will his rook go?

He will play 5 gc2 attacking both knights. Then there must either be a forced win, or I will have to play the long boring endgame with two pawns against one on the K-side with only minimal winning chances.

The Calculation of Variations The ability to calculate variations rapidly and accurately is the third of the basic attributes of a chess master: lapses in this respect can cancel out in a moment the efforts of hours. That is why you may come across top class practitioners who do not assess positions well enough, or are not dab hands at combinations, but you will never come across one who calculates variations badly. This topic is dealt with thoroughly in the book 'Think like a Grandmaster', so here we restrict ourselves to a summary of the main points and then develop the theme with examples from the leading grandmasters. The first important point is the order in which we think of moves. When we are setting out to calculate various variations from a given position, we must first establish clearly in our minds all the possible candidate moves in this position. If we fail to do this and get engrossed in one line of play, we may quite fail to see what might be the main line. Once we have established all the candidate moves, we then proceed to work out the variations arising from them one by one. The question of what order to tackle them in is a matter of taste. Some players like to look at the hardest lines first and only then dispose of the easy ones. Others prefer to do it the other way round. All possible variations may be depicted in the form of a tree of analysis in which the variations and sub-variations are represented by the branches and boughs of the tree. The main thing to master is the rule that during a game you must go along each branch once ind once only. No going back, no repeating yourself! Wandering to and fro through the branches of the tree leads to loss of time and that scourge of practical playcrs-time trouble. To achieve such self-control takes great effort, but the results are well

worth it. Learn to trust your brain. It is only in very exceptional positions that a grandmaster will check and re-check the same line, and this when it is particularly complicated. As a rule he does not wander aimlessly through the branches. Then we must recall the important piece of advice that we call Blumenfeld's Rule. It often happens that a player carries out a deep and complicated calculation, but fails to spot something elementary right at the first move. In order to avoid such gross blunders, the Soviet master B. Blumenfeld made this recommendation:- When you have finished your calculations, write down the move you have decided on on the score sheet. Then examine the position for a short time 'through the eyes of a patzer.' Ask whether you have left mate in one on, or left a piece or a pawn to be taken. Only when you have convinced yourself that there is no immediate catastrophe for you should you make the planned move. There are various sorts of the tree of analysis according to the nature of the position we are dealing with. Here are some examples: (see the drawing) Capello-Kotov, Malta, 1976 Just as Black had to do the move before, White here ( 183) has to work through the variations to answer the question, can White take on fb? The first moves are clear: 1 g xfb <g>xfb 2 xe8 be 3 48+ . Now there are two candidate moves 3 . . . g5 and 3 . . . 17 which we examine in turn. I. 3 . . . Qg5 4 h4+.

do this they have to learn to discipline their thoughts, and develop the right w ay of thinking about variations. A great help in economizing on time is the right choice of opening and a knowledge of all the possible finesses in the line. If you can play the first ten to fifteen moves in just as many minutes, you can be in a state of bliss for the rest of the game. If, on the other hand, Bronstein thinks for forty minutes about his first move, then time trouble is inevitable. There is an opinion that practice in lightning games can help. Obviously if you are practised in blitz play you may find it easier to find the right decision in a time scramble, but this is not an invariable rule. Some specialists at blitz lose their way in a scramble, and on the other hand some poor lightning players cope well in time trouble. The best example is Botvinnik, who never liked playing fast games, but always managed well when short of time. So prepare well for the opening, and having saved time in that way do not lose it back again by wandering to and fro along the branches of the tree of analysis. That is the way to get out of the painful clutches of the clock. Reference to time trouble as a justification for mistakes has long been condemned by the best players. In his notes to his game with Tylor at Nottingham 1936 Alekhine wrote about one of his moves, 'A horrible mistake, and the fact that White was in severe time pressure, in my opinion, is as little justification for it as the claim by a law-breaker that he was drunk at the time of the offence. The inability of an experienced master to cope with his clock must be regarded as just as serious a fault as an oversight'. Calmness-the Paramount Consideration The reader is entitled to advice on how to play in time trouble. What is it that guarantees success at such a point? First and foremost, be self- possessed and keep calm. If you can remain cold-blooded and do not make any impulsive gestures, if you can restrain your clenched fingers from reaching out to the pieces, you will greatly improve your chances. When I was a young man I was a games demonstrator at the 1936 Moscow International tournament. The game between Flohr and Capablanca made a deep impression on me. The former world champion played inaccurately in the opening, lost the exchange for a pawn, and then blundered away the pawn as well. By move thirty his position was critical (199). Time Trouble The two players sit down to play a game in a competition in a good mood, full of hope for the outcome, calm and confident. However the clocks tick away and moods change. One player becomes inspired by chances of victory, the other sits there under the threat of defeat. Now there is no question of their former equality and sense of well-being. The change in atmosphere is noticeable in the state of the players, the position on the board and the state of the clocks. As a rule the player who stands worse is also worse off for time. Then we get the last hour of play when the evil genie of time trouble hangs like a fearful apparition over the game. This evil genie has ruined thousands of games and fine creative ideas, has decided the fate of top titles: who amongst us has managed to keep calm when the flag is lifted by the minute hand and yet there are still several moves to make? Time trouble pitilessly persecutes ordinary players and world championship contenders alike. Can it be cured, and if it can't, then how should you play with a hanging flag? The answers to these questions are of great practical importance. The thinkers and the swift reaction players The masters and grandmasters can be divided into three groups-the inveterate time trouble merchants, those who sometimes get into trouble, and those for whom the phenomenon is a very rare occurrence. It is no secret that, for example, Geller is often at odds with his clock, and this applies just as much to Bronstein, Reshevsky, and Browne. On the other hand many experienced players fear time trouble and try hard to avoid it. There are a few grandmasters who almost totally exclude it: in this regard Karpov comes to mind. His speed of thought is so great that often his opponent's flag falls when he himself, even in the toughest top games, has a great deal of time in hand. What is the reason for this? Obviously it is to be explained in terms of his natural ability, character, good nerves and most of all by the perfection of his 'thinking apparatus'. This apparatus has been so keyed up by much practice of analysis and play that it works perfectly under the most trying circumstances. How to avoid time trouble However even those who get into time trouble can get out of this habit. To

At this point Flohr finally took a breather and offered a draw. His winning chances were long gone-the time trouble had played a nasty trick on him. It is curious that on Capablanca's score sheet all the moves were written down in calligraphic handwriting. Exploiting the opponent's time shortage It is well known that it is advisable to drum up complications if the opponent is short of time, since he will not be able to work it all out in time. This is especially worth trying if the opponent has a totally won game (200): Flohr -Capablanca, Moscow, 1936 It is not hard to see that White should win. He only had to play 30 gc7 for example and Black is hopelessly placed. However Flohr went 30 g4 which let Black complicate. 30 ... 31 hg <3?g6 32 gdl?

The players carried on moving even though the forty moves laid down in the time limit had been reached. The point was that Flohr had stopped writing the moves down since he was in bad time trouble, while Capablanca did not feel that he should stop the blitz play. What if his opponent who had already gone wrong should make another mistake? Reshevsky -Kotov, Candidates T. Zurich, 1953 Here I realized that my position was hopeless, but decided to play on his chronic time shortage. Reshevsky had already played a number of moves at blitz speed, and on each occasion had made ridiculous little jumps in his seat. This had exasperated me, and my next move is explained not only by my desire to exploit my last chance, but by my very nervous state. Unexpectedly I put my queen on e2. Ifhis rook goes to fl then I have 35 • • • gdl. Reshevsky realized this straight away and nearly lost his head. His flag was quivering, but by a great effort he found the right answer.

Well, all right, it hadn't worked, but it was a fine idea. I am firmly convinced that this was my only chance and I was obliged to take it! Do we have the right to exploit the opponent's time shortage in this way? I s it ethical to try and trick in some way or other a player who has lost his head and sometimes all self-control?

'juridicial' point of view. At the start of the game each player is given 2| hours for 40 moves, on average 31 minutes a move. This 'treasure' must not be squandered. Then, on the other hand, there is no doubt that a player who plays quicker than the rate laid down runs some risk of making more mistakes than his deeper thinking opponent. So the player who has used his time to the full has tended to think the position out better. Why then should we 'take pity' on the opponent who has used his time well to make a big step forward towards beating us? By the logic of the struggle we not only have the right but also the obligation to make use of his time trouble and put the maximum difficulty in the way of his finding the best moves. The commonest misconception in such circumstances is to play quickly. Inexperienced players argue that if they take their time over moving, the opponent will use this time to work out all the variations and find the best answer. Such a policy of blitz play evens up the chances and can lead to gross blunders. The best way to exploit the opponent's time pressure is to . . . conduct the game as if there were no time pressure at all. Of course you cannot be unaffected by the situation to some extent, but you must try to sit calmly at the board and work out your moves just as if the game was only starting. This is the most unpleasant thing for the opponent who is under pressure himself, but sees that you are ignoring his time pressure. This must be discouraging for him. It is particularly important to maintain your imperturbability in positions where you stand better or in an even positional struggle. Here haste is out of the question. As I have indicated, there are cases where the attempt can be made to bamboozle, but this is only where you stand worse. If you can't see any good way to equalize then some form of unexpected shock move can be useful, even if it is unsound. This was the case with my
[diagram]
There is also the 'series of moves' technique used to baffle the opponent. You think out some unexpected line of play and spend a considerable amount of time on the process. The opponent is looking at the position during this period too, but it is hardly likely that he will work out as deeply as you can the consequences of this line. You after all have made up your mind to consider this alone, while he has to look at a range of other possibilities. Most likely many of the finer points of the line will escape his notice, since the introductory move is unexpected. Once you have worked out all the consequences you play your moves at lightning speed. In the given circumstances the chances of success arc high. Time Trouble 181 Cabalistic signs The competition player is forbidden the use of reference material and mechanisms which might help or speed up his calculations. The only thing at his disposal is the score sheet and the 'time-trouble types' mark this up with all sorts of cabalistic signs which in their opinion help them to get out of time trouble. I have seen many of these efforts on the sheets of my opponents and colleagues. The commonest is the 'mile-post sign'. After the 8th move they mark 30 m.; after the 16th 1 hr. and so on to the 40 with half an hour for each 8 moves. The intention is fine, but the implementation is pretty often poor. Such specialists in time trouble sit there using up their last quarter of an hour and they have only made twenty moves, sometimes less. Then again some people try to cope with just the last ten moves. They are reconciled to getting into time trouble, and mark up the sheet in the reverse order so that opposite move 40 is written 1, opposite 39 is 2, 38-3, and so on. Then they have the count down to zero as in the launching of cosmic rockets. They claim this gives them an instant sight of how many moves have still to be made, but not much good comes of it. Once time trouble arrives, any form of writing is forgotten in the rush to find a move and play it. Sometimes you will even see a player counting on his fingers. I have known players set up ten captured pieces by the side of the board and take one from the set after each time trouble move made. An unreliable method, and it is not clear whether the judge should permit such juggling. Should any of these methods be imitated? Certainly not! I feel they not only don't help, but can hinder. I repeat that the only way is good preparation, proper analysis of variations, confidence in yourself and calmness. This is the way to play logically and accurately, the only way to use your time properly. Anti Time Trouble Training A universal remedy cannot be proposed since the fault is the product of so many different factors, but a significant reduction can be achieved by certain prophylactic measures. Training in the calculation, of variations has already been mentioned. Try to find a complicated position which is unknown to you and has been analysed by a strong player. Put a clock by the board and allow yourself and 'the opponent' three or four minutes before the flag drops, I ry to play the position out working out the variations for eat'fi side. 1 hen compare the lines you found with the annotations. By gradually reducing the time

allowed you will get some practice at playing complicated positions with a hanging flag. For particularly bad sufferers we can recommend play in special training events with the aim of avoiding time trouble. It Is important to learn how to control your thoughts so that you do not waste time, but make up your mind without excessive timidity or doubts. Botvinnik's Advice It is particularly useful to read Botvinnik's comments, 'I tried as far as possible to rid myself of time trouble. Generally speaking you cannot be wholly rid of it, and this would be unwise. During a game there are moments when you have to examine the position scrupulously, you have to spend 20-30 minutes thinking it out and then make the remaining moves to the control at a quicker rate. This is "normal" time trouble and I do not intend to avoid it. But it often happens that a player wastes valuable time at the board -he analyses variations which can be seen in advance as unsuitable, or he cannot drag himself away from a tempting but disadvantageous line. I have taught myself to use time economically, and reached a satisfactory solution to the problem sometimes even by reducing the standard of my play. There is no other way. How else can you accustom yourself not to waste time?!' Then he adds this valuable advice, 'I long ago advised our masters who systematically get into terrible time trouble of a way of combatting this fault . . . You have to play training games in which your attention is directed primarily at the clock and not the standard of play or the result, and then continue these exercises until you have worked up the habit of using your time properly, of managing to work out all the necessary variations. I think that 90% of sufferers from time trouble would be cured by this method, with the one exception, naturally, of those who are "incurably ill".' The Three Fishes in Action The self-improvement process in a player has some similarities to the learning process of a musician. At first the student has to learn the correct handling of his instrument, then various exercises improve his technique and the suppleness of his fingers. Parallel with this is the study of the classical heritage of the great musicians, all those pieces which the performer will ultimately have to play on stage. So too with the chess player. As he improves his positional under- standing, his eye for combinations, and his technique of calculation, the future master needs practice under the competitive conditions which will test his application of these techniques. All the rich variety of middlegame positions can be reduced to three main groups:- positions in which we have the right and duty to attack; positions in which we have to defend; and positions which are level, characterized by lengthy manoeuvres. In each group the application of the 'three fishes' is decisive. Attacking As Steinitz stressed, the player with the advantage must attack, choosing the opponent's weakest spot as his object of attack. Depending on the circumstances this weak spot may be the king position, the centre or the Q-side. We will examine first the attack on the king. This is the most effective form of attack which follows up the main aim of the game-to mate the enemy king. We consider three types in order:- the attack on the uncastled king, the attack when the kings are castled on opposite sides, and the attack when both kings arc castled on the same side. A lack of urgency or an opening mistake can lead to a failure to castle when such a measure was called for. Then the other side can start immediate play against the king or some other suitable object. In many- cases the result is a failure ever to reach safety with the monarch. Books on the Sicilian Defence in particular abound with examples of this sort. The attacker must spare no effort to exploit this situation. Here is one example (201). Kotov -Kalmanok, Tula, 1931

White takes immediate measures to stop this by threatening 11 , 'g7 and so forces Black to retreat a developed piece. disincentive to castling and to be ahead of the opponent in the wing pawn race. Remember that it takes several moves to get the pawns advanced so that line opening is inevitable, and we must therefore try to calculate the consequences as carefully as if in playing a combination, especially as such an advance normally means burning your bridges behind you. The speed and effectiveness of the line opening advance is greater when the defender has made some pawn advance on that side, or when our advance is made with gain of time by attacking enemy pieces en route. The position of our pieces must be considered, since a pawn storm cannot win on its own. Ifour pieces are far away some other method of play may be called for. All these considerations must be weighed before deciding on the pawn storm.

18 4}e5 45d7 Black now played 18 . . . c7, and lost quickly; if 18 . . . Qc8, we have reached a position examined earlier in the book as diagram 141. The main rule in playing against an uncastled king is that the attacker should initiate an immediate clash so as to prevent the defender develop- ing and getting the king into safety. Do not be frightened of sacrifices to open lines against the king, though work out the consequences care- fully. Opposite side castling is normally a sign of sharp play, since each side can then advance a pawn storm against the enemy king without weaken- ing the pawn cover of his own. An attack by pieces alone is a rare occurrence in such cases, and the following questions therefore naturally arise: - Who will get in first with the pawn advance, will one side be forced onto the defenisve so that his pawn advance will merely prove to be weakening? Of course this does not mean that a few defensive moves on your king's side may not prove advisable. It may prove advisable too to advance pawns against a potential castled position even before the enemy king has left the .centre, both to act as a Kotov-A. Polyak, Moscow v Ukraine, 1937 White argued that his pieces are better placed to get at the king once lines are opened than Black could, but recognised that his advance a3 made line opening easier for Black. However with a stable centre and well placed pieces, the plan of a storm seemed sound. The position offers about equal chances to both sides.

By far the most frequent case of attack on the king is when both sides have castled short. We have already seen examples of a piece attack in such cases e.g. Karpov-Polugayevsky (Diag. 48) Lasker Capablanca (Diag 85) and a number of others. The method used is to concentrate as much force as possible on that side of the board and use weak points there to force a way home. More complicated cases occur when a pawn storm is involved, or intuitive sacrifices are played. The advance of pawns in front of your own king to help in an attack is a risky business, which can only be justified if the centre is firmly closed and the opponent is not in a position to play some counter blow there.

There are positions, however, where such an intuitive sacrifice is the only way to victory. Some would argue, why take the risk and still settle for a draw rather than get involved in the complications. It all depends on one's character, and attitude to chess. Take an example from the greatest exponent of these sacrifices to see what entrancing complications can arise from such play (206). What can happen if mass pawn advances are made in front of the king with an unstable centre is clearly shown here, where White's position crumbles quickly ( 205) Vajda-Kotov, USSR -Hungary, 1949

As the reader has already seen the successful conduct of an attack often involves sacrifices, which as a rule are based on exact calculation, if not to the very end then at least to the point where it is clear that adequate compensation is achieved. However, there arc cases in actual play where sacrifices arc based on intuition rather than calculation, where the judgement and experience of the player tell him that the offer is worthwhile even though he cannot prove this. Such sacrifices are rare and there are players who never make them, who will only sacrifice if they can satisfy themselves that the offer is quite sound. *Tr. note.

<S>14 39 g3+ Qe3 40 gd3+ -&-xd3 41 xd3+ 1-0 Among the many questions which the mind of the master has to resolve is whether to play a sacrifice. There are cases where it is obvious that he shouldn't, or that he should, but chess like life has many facets and such an ideal case is pretty rare. How much time is taken up in considering those unclear situations where he is tormented by doubt! In those cases where analysis cannot answer the question, the player has to rely on intuition and experience; often he asks himself whether such a sacrifice has occurred before in similar situations. There is also the point that he may be able to reach his aim by quieter lines. The decision also depends on style and character. Some players are bold enough to go for a sacrifice even when calculation of the variations convinces them that it is dubious. Then there is the opposite situation where a player works out that the sacrifice would give him a good game, even a win, but does not play it since a quiet line is just as effective and does not involve so m-uch emotional upset. I remember a case where Capablanca worked out an impressive combination, but then chose to make a simple move in answer to which his opponent resigned at once! Karpov too is well known for his rational approach to the game. We have given one example (diagram 48) where the press room experts 'recommended' an exchange sacrifice, but he took a simpler line. Does this mean that he avoids sacrifices entirely? Not at all! When the offer of material is the quickest way to victory, he will sacrifice even if it is not entirely cut and dried and he has to rely partly on intuition. ir Karpov-Spassky, Candidates Match, 1974 Diagram 208 is a position from the decisive 1 1 th game of the match that took him to the final.

192 Calculation and Practical Play
indicate one way or the other. These include the character and style of the opponent, the situation of the tournament or match in which you are involved, the state of the clocks, and the possible effect on colleagues in a team match. A sacrifice may be more effective if played against a quiet player than one delighting in complications. You yourself may be one or the other. If you must go for a win, a sacrifice may well be indicated, but there are situations where a draw would suit you. Complications are best avoided in time trouble, unless you stand badly, of course if your opponent is badly short of time a sacrifice by you, even if not totally sound, has good chances of success. Particular factors are involved in team competitions. Here the game is not just your personal responsibility since the course of the game will be followed with concern by your team mates. In such cases the spirit of collectivism has to be considered. Let us assume that you have played a correct piece sacrifice. Only you know the fine points of your concept; to your colleagues it might seem that you have just lost material. Then they will start getting worried and this can affect the overall score. That is why, for example, in Soviet teams playing in the Chess Olympiads there is a strict though unwritten rule. You have to play in such a way that the rest of the team does not get concerned about your position. Even the greatest adherents of sacrificial play subordinate themselves to this consideration. A large number of games are decided by assuming the offensive in the centre or the Q-side: in such cases sacrifices are less common; both piece pressure and pawn storms are suitable devices. When pawns advance in such cases they do not necessarily open lines, but the advance may also free space for the pieces to manoeuvre in. The reader has already seen examples of various sorts of offensive in the centre, and on the Q-side; often pressure on the Q-side grows into an attack on the king. Such a transfer of the attack from one wing to the other occurs frequently in practice. The important strategic postulate behind such play on both wings is that the pressure on one wing alone can be defended against adequately by the opponent, especially when the active side has no entry points for his pieces. In this case it is important to initiate action on the other side of the board. This stretches the defender's resources in having to move his pieces this way and that, especially if he lacks manoueuvring space. At some point the defender will not regroup in time and so suffer loss. Many games have been played in accordance with this strategical idea. The Three Fishes in Action 193 Defending When a player gets an inferior position he is forced to defend, as indicated by Steinitz. The first essential is to realize the moment when your are required to adopt the defensive role and give up all ideas for the time being of winning. Many players recognize this too late, and start taking the necessary measures when it is already very hard to save matters. The author of this book, must, alas, be counted amongst this number-there vou are sitting back and taking it easy when the enemy is already at the gates'. This feeling for danger is a most valuable asset, part natural and part acquired by practice. Karpov and Petrosian have such a sense of danger to a high degree. To achieve such a sense demands not just general understanding of the game, but also strong will power and self-control. Once you have recognized that you are in some danger you must mobilize yourself to create the maximum difficulties for the opponent, put obstacles in his way and so hope to slow down the pace of his assault. It is at that point that you can start thinking of seizing the initiative again. Passive defence demanding calm nerves and sticking power. There is also the policy of exchanges, especially of our passive units for active enemy ones, with the long term aim of reaching an endgame that will be easier to draw. This is particularly the case with rook and pawn endings or opposite coloured bishop endings. Of course this pre-supposes that the defender has a high level of endgame technique and knows how to play these endings which have a marked tendency towards a drawn outcome. 'Attack is the best form of defence' is a slogan that applies in many spheres of activity, chess included. If you choose the exact moment to counter-attack, it can have great psychological effect, so we advise the reader to take plenty of time over his choice of when to play the appropriate counter blow. We must stress that preparing such a counter strike when under pressure is a difficult art, but the reader must try to master it. Counter attacking moves as a rule are very striking and enrich chess no less than the finest combinations. That is why players who have mastered this art have always been so highly thought of. Level Positions The position from which the game starts can be considered as fairly level. In the course of play one side often gets the better of it while the other side is forced to defend. However in many games the equilibrium is not disturbed and the players manouevre in accordance with Steinitz's precept, trying to
194 Calculation and Practical Play
upset the balance in their favour. If no mistakes or inaccuracies are made, then level positions keep on producing even chances for each side. However the same methods of applying the three factors of chess mastery apply, though the effects they produce may well be in more subdued tones than when one side is bending the other to his will. For the same reason, play in such positions tends to be more exacting than when the aim is clearer. To recognize the crucial moment when a chance is presented is not easy and the only guarantee against failure is the overall and move-by-move assessments which we mentioned in Part One. The Three Fishes in Action 195 White has achieved one of his aims, and Black should fight this blockade by b6, but he restricts himself to attempts to make use of the weakened b5 square. 24 . . . $d7

He will try at all costs to drive an enemy knight from d5 so as to cramp Black. Also he will try to block the Q-side by a4-a5. Finally the position of the pawns at h6 and g6 may enable White to weaken the K-side further by the advance of the h-pawn to h5.

The Opening 197 game as soon as possible, avoiding all risk of falling into some sharp prepared line. Look at many of the games of Smyslov and Bronstein to see that they never agree to set their foot on some path thoroughly worked out in modern analyses, but with which they are unfamiliar. The same applies to other veteran grandmasters.
3. The opening theoretician: Only a few current or previous grand-
masters deserve or deserved this title. Their names figure in series of opening works, in regular articles in chess magazines. They are dangerous opponents, especially if you fall into one of their pet lines. However there are also cases where someone has found a hole in their published analysis and used it against them so that one might say, 'Those who live by the sword shall perish by the sword.' It is hard to follow their example, there are only a chosen few who can devote themselves to such unremitting effort. However their knowledge can be regarded as an ideal in respect of a few openings that a player should specialize in. Follow their example ofdeep study in your favoured lines, not with the aim of perpetuating your name in chess history but so as to deepen your understanding and have the confidence to play this and other stages of the game into which there may well be a carry-over effect.
4. The world champions: Once again let us learn from their example.
Straight away one can say that there were no 'widely read' types among them, except perhaps Euwe, and towards the end of their careers they nearly all turned to an 'ideas' approach. But the world champions were great connoisseurs of the openings that they did play, produced a lot of fresh ideas in them, sometimes shattering their opponents with an unexpected discovery. What practical advice can be given, how should one proceed? The best answer seems to be, 'Learn a little dbout everything, and everything about one thing'. True, this is work enough for a lifetime, but it gives a guide to the problems posed by the expansion of knowledge and information. You should choose two or three openings which you intend playing regularly in your games, and study them deeply. At the same time try and have some knowledge of the other openings. It might come in useful and the ideas found there might be applicable to your basic arsenal. First of all consider the problem of playing with Black, which is always harder in view of the initiative which White enjoys in the early stages. Settle on one opening to adopt against 1 e4 and one against I d4. 1 he choice must depend on your tastes, character and experience. Then you have to decide whether you are basically going to be a 1 c4

The Opening The exacting reader of this book whose aim is to know how to become a grandmaster may wonder at the amount of attention given to the middle game compared to the opening and endgame. Our answer is that in these phases of the game we get the same struggle of the pieces, of plans, tactical blows and combinations, though the first and last parts of a game do have their special features. However there are incomparably more books available on the endgame and opening than the middle game. As a result, understanding of the middle game has greatly lagged behind those phases of the game where memory and learning now play such a big part. We can discern four different attitudes to the opening depending on a player's tastes and character.
1. The wide reader: Talk to some young masters and they will
overwhelm you with reference to a mass of variations, complete with references to games, who played what and when, what the world champions said about it. This is not just a specialist in one opening, but a walking encyclopedia who knows nearly all openings, remembers all the variations in the specialist works of theory. Can he be called an expert in the openings? Strictly speaking, no. If you dig deeper, you find that he spouts out the variations without feeling the finesses of the position. Yet how much time goes on the study of these books and magazine articles! Such a player hardly has the time to study the basic theory of the middlegame and other aspects of chesk This approach cannot be recommended; it is sure to lead to impoverishment of your play. How often have I met such sorry experts. Out of their band has come not a single player of top class.
2. The 'ideas' man: He is the direct opposite of the wide reader. He bases
himself on a knowledge of the ideas of this or that opening, though he may not know concrete variations. He simply knows which piece to place where, which part of the front to give his attention to. This approach is the one that grandmasters tend to have towards the end of their careers, when they lack the effort or the stimulus of ambition to make them work through current analysis of openings that they may have been keenly interested in in their youth. So in opening the game, especially with an erudite opponent, such a player will play 1 <N13 2 g3 3 a g2 then fianchctto the other bishop and avoid any sharp opening fight. His argument is that he understands the position better than his opponent and it is in his interest to get to the middle The Endgame 199 side is tensed up, but suddenly we have mass exchanges and after the 'poetry' of sharp combinational struggle we get the 'prose' of the endgame. Since technique predominates in the ending, the player has to re-adjust his thoughts and his mood. There will be little scope now for brilliancy or tactics. If you can spare the time on the clock, it would pay to devote several minutes to calm down after the passion of the middle game, so that you will start examining the position in the correct way from the point of view of the endgame. The most general rule one can state about this phase of the game is that there is no need to hurry. In the opening or middle game we are conscious of the need to carry out our ideas with due despatch, not to lose a tempo and so on. If you examine the games of the best endgame players, Capablanca, Flohr, Smyslov, Karpov, you will be surprized at the number of repetitions, the slow measured progress they make. If a pawn can go h2-h4, say, the grandmaster will often take his time and play h3 first and h4 later. The reasons for this approach are:
1. Gaining time on the clock in view of the hourly control applying at
this stage.
2. The chance to sink deeper into the position, to make slight changes
and then assess what real difference they make.
3. Developing the right attitude of massive calm.
4. The psychological pressure exerted on the opponent, who is thus
convinced that he is in your power while you play cat and mouse with him. It is very hard to play well under such pressure, which often induces mistakes. In the ending, as a rule planning comes to take first place, and relegates the investigation of variations to second place-in some way a reversal of roles as compared to the middlegame. Schematic thinking comes first, as seen in the way Capablanca thought about this position (211) 19(j Calculation and Practical Play player, or a 1 d4 player. In either case there is much to be studied in view of the wide choice of replies by Black. I must admit that there is a risk ofbeing too limited in this approach, but the overall aim must be to keep your opening play in harmony with your play in the later parts of the game. To make considerable advances in your open- ing play without being able to follow this up in the rest of the game is pointless. Practical experience has shown that the more players get involved in studying theory from the many books available the more they run the risk of missing the elementary, of not seeing the wood for the trees. Even very strong players get so engrossed in a pet variation that they forget to check whether they are developing their pieces quickly and on the right squares, whether they are getting the king away from the dangers of an open centre. Of course every rule has its exceptions, and knowing when you can make, say, three moves with a knight in a row is part of overall mastery. It is useful to remember that such cases of 'breaking' the elementary rules given in beginner's books often arise when the opponent himself has made such errors first, and the need to punish him for it demands concrete reaction. Particular care should be taken over pawn moves since such moves cannot be taken back, and a weakness resulting from a bad pawn move is a permanent one. While busy with development and pressure on the centre it is a useful guide to bear in mind the overall strategic aim of that particular opening you have adopted, so that you may be consistent in following up the aim. Only in the case of forced variations should there be a need to go delving in opening books. Understanding general ideas and a mastery of the three fishes should give you the confidence to solve any opening task posed to you. Certain grandmasters keep an opening file, a collection of those variations which he will need during actual play, his own favourite lines. Such a file is handy and easily transportable so that it can be taken to a tournament. The reader may care to draw up such a file and notebook of his own, which will help him in preparing for his games. The Endgame The three fishes of chess mastery apply just as much here as to the opening or middle game, but the endgame does have its own specific features. First consider the transition to the endgame and the need to take a calm look at the new situation that has arisen. As Belavcnyets has pointed out, the middle game tends to put us in an excited frame of mind. With sacrifices and combinations in the air each Capablanca Ragozin, Moscow, 1936 The Endgame 201 As a result many formerly unclear questions have been clarified and the technique of playing positions such as R+ BP+ RP v R, 2N v pawns, Q+ P v Qand so on has been codified. In fact theoreticians have gone further by classifying the correct methods of play in many varied endings such as R+ P v R, all pawn endings and many queen endings. Is a grandmaster required to know all these analyses? Obviously not, but he does well to have an idea of their essential features. One feature that the ending shares with the middlegame is the need to understand rather than to remember. What is the best way to train in endings? You are obliged to master the elementary examples such as the square rule for pawn endings, R4-P on the 7th v R, consideration of the long and short sides of the passed pawn in rook and pawn endings. Then you have to consider those cases when a bishop is better than a knight or vice versa. After this you have to move on to endings with more material on the board. Once again we recommend the method of taking a position that has been analysed by a strong player: work through the moves yourself and compare your conclusions with the notes. As an example of this sort of approach, we take an interesting ending of some length by Rubinstein (213).
200 Calculation and Practical Play
He wrote thus:- 'White's plan is to prevent the advance of the enemy c- pawn which might make his own pawn at b2 weak, and to control the whole board as far as the fifth rank. This is achieved by playing the king to e3, the rook to c3, the knight to d4 and the pawns to b4 and f4. When this has been achieved White will advance his Q-side pawns'. Note- no variations! Nor does he worry about how much time the process might take. The main thing is the scheme, the formation that has to be reached. The next special feature is the change in the role of the king. No longer does he have to skulk in the corner for his own protection, there is an open field before him. In fact the participation of the king is often the decisive factor and it could well be that nothing fundamental should be undertaken until the king s role has been determined and his best position taken up. Exchanges give rise to the endgame, and in the ending exchanges are of paramount importance in accordance with the scheme 'What piece to exchange, what to leave on' (212) Alatortsev-Levenfish, Match 1940 White played 1 Jtd4 and Levenfish, a great master of the endgame, commented, 'The bishop had to be cherished like (he apple of his eye, since in the struggle against passed pawns the knight is not a very suitable piece.

The results have been summarized in a number of books, amongst which the series edited by Averbakh takes first place. Faktor-Rubinstein, Lodz, 1916 First of all the assessment. White has weak squares at g4 and on the white squares generally. His pawn at e4 is weak and under threefold attack. Black's bishops are well placed, but he has the drawback of a doubled pawn which makes it harder for him to exploit his advantage. Black's plan is to improve his piece position by putting his bishop on g6 or h7, and his knight on g4. Then he will try to exploit his well placed pieces by advancing the K-side pawns. In the long run further pressure will

the game's great advantage, which makes it popular amongst millions who do not play the game themselves. The achievement of good results demands physical hardiness, strong nerves, endurance, calmness and the maintenance of a strict regime. As Alekhine put it, 'During a chess tournament a master must envisage himself as a cross between an ascetic monk and a beast of prey.' Fine words! A beast of prey towards the opponent, an ascetic in one's everyday life. Alas, Alekhine himself was not always an ascetic. Botvinnik and other members of the Soviet School have worked out the right approach to preparation and sporting regime. About a month before the tournament a player should study the games of his opponents-no easy task. You should also try to get up to date with latest theory and study your own play. Alekhine stressed the last named point, and you often hear in all competitive activities the advice that if you want to be strong you have to be hard on yourself. Opening preparation is also valuable, concentrating on those lines you intend playing in the event. If something that you do not know is published in one of these lines, you do well to try it out in two or three training games. The practice of using training games to get into trim has been widely used by a number of leading players, notably Botvinnik. On the other hand, other world champions have taken a sceptical view of training games on the grounds that they lack the stimulus of a real contest and so cannot be taken seriously enough. Not everybody can force himself to give of his best in such conditions. A short time before the event begins, you should have a break to avoid boredom or stalencss. Botvinnik said that he took a break about five days before the first round; I know of other grandmasters who make the break longer than that. During the actual tournament you have to make an effort to keep calm and husband your strength. 'I try to play in a calm fashion not letting my nerves worry me, and it's not so easy to achieve this. You have to bear this in mind constantly during the game. Calmness is not just for show; my mind only works well when I keep calm, so I specially train myself to cultivate this quality' (Botvinnik). In the 1946 Groningen tournament, the veteran grandmaster Bernstein reproached me for taking too much out of myself by playing to win in every game and creating sharp positions all the time. He warned me that my strength would give out before the end of -the 19 round tournament. He was right. I once checked up on my results in top class events and found that I had often lost my last round game; I was too exhausted to

Final Words of Advice In striving to play like a grandmaster one has to improve one's mastery of the three fishes, the three main components of play. To gain the grandmaster title however, more is demanded --practical results in international tournaments, so that approval will be given by the international ruling body FIDE. Many people consider the competitive side a drawback which takes something away from the game as an art. Yet I feel the sporting clement is

cope. Botvinnik too had difficulties in this regard; 'Earlier, as a rule, in almost all long tournaments I started off by garnering a lot of points, but then at the end could hardly "stick to the saddle". In the 12th 15th rounds I nearly always lost a game. It stands to reason that you must expend all your energy in that way. It is better to use it up in more even fashion so that there is no cracking up at the end, and the whole tournament will be less tense for you.' When I played in top class tournaments, and later when I used to be captain of the Soviet team or chief judge of a tournament, I watched the routine of a tournament day that grandmasters maintained. Only a few grandmasters have the habit of going to bed well after midnight and sleeping till noon -though you can't get to sleep straight away after a game. The majority of them had got into the habit of following Botvinnik's routine. In the morning after breakfast they would take a stroll for an hour, then do their preparation for the day's game. Then go on foot to the round, have supper after the game, and then to bed. No analysing adjourned games in the evening, though to be honest only Botvinnik himself could stop himself looking at them. I must insist though that you will save a lot of nervous energy if you don't look at adjourned games straight away. The main period of analysis of these should take place on the adjourned games day, but it is permissible to have a short look at them the morning after they are adjourned. • Folke Rogard, former President of FIDE, was once stressing that the factors of success at chess were not just good play and knowledge of the game, but good form and tiptop physical condition. He was interrupted by a reporter who objected that they were talking about chess not boxing. The Swede had his answer ready, if you have to play for up to five hours a day, spend hours analysing adjourned games and openings and on top of that often sleep badly because of the great nervous tension, then you were undergoing a physical burden as great as any boxer had! Our book is coming to an end. Whether you come to play like a grandmaster depends largely on you, your talent, character, persistence. I hope that working through this book will do you good, and if you make the grade I hope you will remember the contribution made by the author's advice. Solutions to the Exercises Diagram 32.

To this end he will play his knight from c5 to c4, exchange the knight at c3 and post his bishop on d5. This will give him many strong squares in the centre.

Transfer the knight to 13 so freeing the king to eome forward; 4. Retreat the knight to fl, then-chase the enemy king into a stalemate position on a8, so that 12 is forced. This pawn is lost to the white king which comes back from c7. or c8.

Diagram 92. Karpov- Pomar, Nice Olympiad, 1974. White has the advantage with his active pieces- the bishop has good diagonals to fire along at the king, either a5 /d8 or h2 /b8, and the rook can get to the 7th and 8th ranks. Also White has more space and can activate his king, something which Black cannot do. The plan is to provoke b6 which will finally imprison the black king on the back two rows. Then the bishop goes to the h2 /b8 diagonal and the king comes up to the centre so that Black cannot successfully attack White's pawns. Finally White's pawns move forward to take part in an attack on the circumscribed king.
