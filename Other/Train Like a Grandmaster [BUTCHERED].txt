So 2 4^Xh4 p c 3 and White could see no defence to mate at b2, since if 3 фс1 p a 1+ winning the rook and then the pinned knight. Once again Alekhine takes White and goes 3 p h 8 + i <R>Xh8 4 <£sg6+ and mate next move. The whole value of this example was brought out after the actors had performed the scene when the play was examined from a technical point of view. This is an excellent example of combinative play exploiting open lines. The final combination with the queen sacrifice on h8 is a typical 'ambush' combination. Thus an entertaining episode is used for instruction purposes.* Before passing on to the topic of special chess schools in the USSR we follow the path of the improving player. When he becomes an adult he passes on into adult competitions which are based on strict competition and qualification. Only in very rare cases does the Soviet Chess Federation make so bold as to try to correct the consequences of bad luck or misfortune. The main event of the year for all players is the Soviet Championship. No matter what a player's high standing may be a grandmaster can be authorised to miss this event only by the Praesidium of the Chess Federation. On the other hand if the top players find it hard to get out of competing in the championship, aspirants to take part in it find it just as hard to get in. The qualification system works as follows:- The list of entrants for the Super League starts with the Otborochnii (Selection) tournament or from special quarter-final groups (The Chess Federation has not yet come to a final conclusion which tournaments are better but more and more protests are being made against the 13-round, 64-man Swiss * Translator's Note A 254 page book Chess School was issued in 1976 to accompany the TV course Apart from contributions by Kotov and Averbakh it contains an 80 page account by Yudovich of the history of chess and the theory of the openings Television Tuition 75 System used for the Otborochmi). From here qualifiers move on to the First Division of the Championship with only the winner of the Otborochnn seeded direct to the Top League. Then the leading few from the First Division qualify for the Top League held at the end of the year. Thus a strict principle of promotion and relegation according to actual results is observed. During the rest of the year there is an extensive programme of events, both individual and team. The chief ones are the Soviet Spartakiad, the USSR Cup and various international tournaments such as the Central Club tournament, the Chigorin Memorial, the Keres Memorial in Tallinn and so on. As is well known our grandmasters compete in international tournaments throughout the world as well as helping countries that are backward in chess by means of lectures, exhibitions and coaching. Our top players are doubtless affected by the massiveness of our organisation and the consciousness that they serve the people and so have special obligations. The scale of Soviet chess is immense - more than three million organised players, one million of them category players, spread throughout 148,O-O-O collectives and 1,500 clubs. There are nearly 700 masters, 61 grandmasters and 13 world champions out of 18. The work of popularising the game in the outside world is also immense - more than 25 countries a year are visited by our chess representatives. Different Nuances of the Word 'School' In art and literature the word 'school' can be understood as a definite creative trend which unites people throughout the world in their views on the subject in question. Then there is also the meaning of a combined organisation having its own building, head, teaching staff and programme of studies. In the period of the 1920's to the 1940's there were no organised schools where chess was taught in some form or other, yet from the very first steps along the road to creating a native School of Chess three trends emerged as regards unity of views and principles. These were the Leningrad school, the Moscow school and the Ukrainian school. A leading role was played at once by the Leningrad school, although in assessing the results of Lenmgrad-Moscow matches, of tournament performances of the time and even in analytical work we note a prolonged sharp rivalry between the representatives of the capital city and Leningrad. After the October Revolution Leningrad maintained its mass of strong and theoretically experienced masters. These great connois seurs and strong practicians raised their research work to a high level especially since their city was the place where in those days the only chess magazine Shakhmatny Listok was published. A leading role was played by players who became Soviet Champions on a number of occasions or took high places in the national championship - Levenfish, Romanovsky, Ilyin-Genevsky, I.Rabino vich and so on. Naturally with the presence of such pedagogues there emerged a wave of young talents headed by the leader of Soviet chess Mikhail Botvinmk. Here we find Ragozin, Chekhover, Lisitsyn and others. Later on came a fresh generation of grandmasters, graduates of the Leningrad Pioneer Palace who were taught by the trainer Zak - Taimanov, Spassky, Korchnoi and others. A similar development is seen in Moscow. After the October Revolution chess was supported by Nenarokov, Grigoriyev, and A.Rabinovich. Then in the 1930's we have the emergence of a group of young talented masters - Ryumin, Kan, Belavenets, Yudovich, the theoretician Simagin and so on. They competed successfully with the Leningrad players both in matches and theoretical research The Ukrainian school provided massive reinforcements. Here a leading role was played by the outstanding theoretician Rauzer who invented many systems in various openings along with another theoretician Konstantinopolsky. These were followed by new names who were to make the Ukraine famous throughout the world - Boleslavsky, Bronstein, Geller, Stein and others. The Great Fatherland War brought significant changes to the geographical location of our schools of players. By the middle of the 1940's there had been a movement of people to Moscow. Botvinnik, Levenfish and Romanovsky from Leningrad, Bronstein, Konstantinopolsky and Geller from the Ukraine. This rather weakened the two areas mentioned, though they still put up a good resistance to the capital in team matches. We must be honest though and say that the Leningrad school has fallen back from the point of the development of leading players. In our days The Russian Fedeation has played a big part in producing such names as Polugayevsky, the late Bondarevsky, Tseshkovsky, Sveshnikov, Krogius and others. There has been a growth of talent in the Baltic Republics where the names of Tal and Keres speak for themselves. We shall have occasion later to speak of the special features of the Georgian school with its flowering of female talent. That is an outline of the various schools from the point of view of territorial distribution On top of this in our days there has been the favourable development of schools in the proper sense of the word without any territorial limitations. From the 1950's onwards we have had certain schools which

Chess Trainers and their Background The chess organisation of every country sooner or later comes up against the question of chess coaching and the trainers needed to run it. Where can these trainers be got from, what sort of qualifications and training do they need? Does the trainer have to be a strong player who is now no longer playing in top events because of the age factor? Can a young master cope with such work? The experience of Soviet chess will be helpful in finding the answer to these questions, so we have decided to devote some space to it. First of all let us define terms and restrict our task to the proper sense of coaching. During top class events, especially those involving the world championship qualifying cycle one sees the players regularly accompanied by a well-known grandmaster or master. This person is the second whose task it is to help the player in his preparation before the event and before each game, often taking part in the choice of opening variations and giving advice after each game is finished and is being analysed. The main task tends to be assisting in the analysis of adjourned games The 'period of service' of such seconds is not long and during the next such

9 Botvinnik's Chess School
The chess organisation of Soviet Trade Unions had the excellent idea in 1963 of setting up a small school that would coach some of the most gifted young players of the country. Former world champ ion Mikhail Botvinnik, our greatest theoretician, and a Doctor of Technical Science expressed the desire to run the school where the studies take place by post. For nearly two decades this school has been turning out 'graduates' who have a fine grasp of chess strategy and tactics, experience of practical play and the routine needed for this. Most important of all they have had developed in them the knack of working independently at chess study. There can be no doubt that the main feature of the school is its head. Botvinnik's name has figured in the world of chess, and outside it too, for more than half a century. The 'patriarch' of Soviet chess, as we lovingly cal! him, has gone through an immense experience of match and tournament play. He took part in more than fifty top-class tournaments in his forty years of active play, was world champion for thirteen years, winning or defending the title on five separate occasions, and played for our winning Olympiad side six times. He is a player who to an unprecedented extent penetrated deeply into the possibilities of the game, more than all the remaining grandmasters of his day. Another world champion Tigran Petrosian has eloquently described the emotions of a player who had to sit on the other side of the board from Botvinnik. He once told how hard he found it to play against Fischer, but then went on, 'Yet it was harder to play against Botvinnik! You got a feeling then of having no way out. This was a very unpleasant feeling. Once in conversation with Keres I told him about this and even drew the comparison of Botvinnik as a bulldozer clearing everything away from its path. Keres smiled and commented 'Just think what it was like for those who had to play him when he was younger" No less expressive are the words of Geller, describing his feelings as he sat down at the board to play Mikhail Moiseyevich 'Games against Botvinnik, as a rule, are a battle against Botvinmk's Chess School 85 monmumental strategy. Just as the visible part of an iceberg makes up only one sixth of its height, so too in this battle the greater part of the ideas are not brought out. In such a case the consequences of the slightest mistake are quite considerable' It is easy to understand that the school of such a great expert attracted the best talent from throughout the country. These included what are now very well-known names such as Anatoly Karpov from Zlatoust, Yury Balashov from Schadrinsk, Yury Razuvayev from Moscow. Later on they were joined by Yelena Akmilovskaya from Krasnoyarsk, Harry Kasparov from Baku, Artur Yusupov and Sergei Makarichev from Moscow. All parts of our large country were represented. It did not take long to settle how the work should be organised It was decided to meet face to face in short sessions two or three times a year. These get-togethers normally took place in Moscow during the school holidays at New Year and in the spring, while in the summer the venue was a holiday resort or health centre. The administration of the school realised how difficult it is to teach chess at a higher level, especially on the basis of a correspondence course. The studies had to be adjusted to the individual features of each student, his character, age, health, style of play and preferences. A great deal had to be taken into account in particular how to develop a love for the game and how to stimulate his strong points and eradicate his weak ones. The standard study method is simple and convincing. When he goes home from a session each student gets his own individual assignment which has been carefully thought out by the coach. During the long break between sessions the student has to work through this assignment, and at the next session he must make a report on what he has done The principle is thus strictly followed that the assignments are individual but the reports on them are collective So the days of the session fly by as the keen students give an account of their progress and take part in the group assessment of the others in turn, all the while taking note of the critical comments by the coach. At the end of each session a fresh assignment is set which must be carried out before the next meeting. The students are not frightened of tough assignments, but rather welcome them, knowing that such hard tasks are a fresh step on the road to perfection. During his life a pupil has to learn from many teachers. He learns his native language, mathematics, natural sciences. Often teachers will tell how they learned and studied. Yet m the chess school the pupils have a teacher of the highest class who can pass on the lessons learned in top-class tournament play as well as the secrets of theory worked out by the most outstanding researchers in this
86 Botvinnik's Chess School
field over the last half century. That is why the time spent in Botvinnik's school and the counsel he gives is remembered so vividly by his pupils. Anatoly Karpov recalls 'My studies with Botvinnik brought me immense benefit, particularly the homework assignments which forced me to refer to chess books and to work independently! Harrik Kasparov, a student of the next generation backs him up 'In 1973 when I was still a boy who just liked playing chess Mikhai1 Moiseyevich invited me to join his school There is no price I could name for the things I got from it in the course of the five years I was there. He does not use his authority to bear down too hard on the pupils and to impose his views on them. Botvinnik is the person who confirmed in me the view that Alekhine's chess is my sort too. At each stage he suggests his approach. At the beginning of 1977 I became Soviet Junior Champion for the second time scoring 81/2 out of 9 and winning the title with a round to spare. I went to Moscow with the idea that everything was going swimmingly for me. There at the school Mikhail Moiseyevich congratulated me on my victory and suggested that I go through my winning games. Here I was severely criticised at some points in them by him, yet to hear from Botvinnik that the quality of my play in the recent event gave him great hopes for me was the height of happiness! A point to note here is that the pupil is not automatically permitted to make his report on the assignment. Before this is done his overall profile and progress between sessions is assessed by experienced teachers. These ask themselves what are his results in tournaments, what are his exam results and academic progress at school, is he fit, does he take part in sport, does he know the history of chess? They also check up all his games, assessing their standard. Only if all these things are in good order can the pupil appear before his fellows and relate how he has tackled the tasks assigned to him by Botvinnik. This superb school is organised by wise pedagogues. It is the dream of thousands of boys and girls to qualify for it. Boys are admitted from the 11-18 age group, girls from 13-18. Only the most promising talents are admitted. In addition to theoretical assignments there are practical trials such as simultaneous exhibitions. Here is an example from one such exhibition which will be useful for all chess coaches to work through. The thoughts attributed here to Botvinnik may not be exactly those thoughts that he had at the time, but this is the direction in which they will have gone, as he both tried to discover what his opponent knew and tried to play in such a way that the pupil would extract the maximum benefit from the encounter.

Well now, exchanging on e4 finishes it. If he takes with the e2

rook then a further exchange on c4 and it is a purely technical matter. What has he shown so far? Calm play in the opening without striving for too much, reasonable manoeuvring play, but then a pawn given away So the game ends and I haven't learned all that much about him. Possibly I should give him the chance to show a bit more? What if 1give up the queen? I could check his technique then.

A d 4 + 41 фЬ2 g b 6 42 ^ e 7 S cX b4 At this point the game was broken off and adjudicated a draw by the appointed third party. Such coaching sessions go on year after year, and the staff changes little by little. Sometimes former students of the school are enrolled to be teachers there. Nowadays there are quite young boys and girls studying there. Who knows what will become of them in the course of time? Our chess fans have become accustomed to seeing the reference 'studied in Botvinnik's chess school' when they read accounts of the tournament performancees of this or that young chess talent. Yes, his students have reached the top in various events and some of them are exerting themselves to reach the final stage - an attempt to take the chess crown from the most distinguished student of them all, Anatoly Karpov. So we shall try to introduce the reader to the leading 'graduates' of this legendary school. Perhaps their games and biography will stimulate the reader to strive himself to improve his play You are about to go through a picture gallery of players whose long years of hard study under the guidance of an experienced teacher finally paid off in their mastery of the theory and practice of chess. Yuri Balashov With the exception of Anatoly Karpov himself this calm, restrained, taciturn pupil of Botvinmk is the one with the best tournament record over the years. He has a particularly fme record in qualifying events for the world championship - in the last two cycles he took first place in special USSR Zone tournaments to determine our representatives for the FIDE Interzonals (in 1975 he was in a fourfold tie for first place). The annoying thing is that he has followed these successes up in mediocre fashion, and so has never qualified for a place in the Candidates' Matches that his other results would indicate as a legitimate outcome. Yuri Balashov 89 Then there are his results in the USSR Championship where he was second in 1976 and equal third-fourth in 1979 - enviable stability. Finally he has often taken first place in strong international tournaments. He has a fine knowledge of theory, and by this we do not just mean opening variations It was not for nothing that Karpov chose him as his chief second in the 1978 world title match at Baguio. I have had occasion myself to see how hard he works at this. In
1970 I was head of the Soviet delegation at the Fischer-Taimanov

Yuri Razuvayev When still very young he had a stroke of luck that many others dream of. He was fortunate enough to turn out on the junior board for the 'Trud' team in the championship of the voluntary sports societies.* Trud's top board was Botvinmk and soon young Yuri became a student in the school, though for various reasons this Yurt Razuvayev 97 period of study was not very long. Many years later Rasuvayev became the friend and helper of Anatoly Karpov. To spend years in the company of two such titans of chess is the sort of thing others can only dream about. The general opinion of commentators on Razuvayev is that he is an excellent tactician, but that his strategical 'baggage' was inadequate for a long time and this held him back from getting good tournament results and the grandmaster title. However hard work finally brought him into the ranks of our strongest players and in the 1976 tournament in Cuba he gained the long-awaited title. 'Rather belated' was the view of the sceptics, 'Razuvayev gets the title at the age of thirty-one, yet in our day there are even some sixteen year old grandmasters! However there are no obstacles for those who really love chess. The new 'old' grandmaster continued and continues to work hard. In particular he has devoted particular attention to the play of the great strategist of the past Akiba Rubinstein, The result of his study is the new book on Rubinstein in the Moscow 'Fizkultura i Sport' series, but even more important the author is still learning and so can reckon on fresh successes in the future. Along with tournament appearances Yuri has recently been coaching himself as an assistant to Smyslov in a special chess school. So this is the third world champion with whom he has worked. Not just tournament successes impress the true chess fan. The sort of fine combinative attack which Razuvayev produces enthuses him and induces him to spend hours working through their ramifications.

He worked directly under Botvinmk for three consecutive years, and then the rest of his career since then under Mark Dvoretsky, but you have to bear in mind that international master Dvoretsky is also a pupil of Botvinmk, and in recent years has been assistant to his old coach. The creative co-operation of Yusupov and Dvoretsky gives great pleasure to both of them, and the coach has often said what a fine pupil he has and what joy he gets from their get-togethers. We have spoken of the friendship of these two, but we really should speak of three, since another Botvinmk pupil Sergei Dolmatov has been a regular companion to Yusupov. The closeness of their careers can be gauged from the fact that at the 1978 World Junior Championship the gold medal went to Dolmatov and the silver to Yusupov, while in the previous event m 1977 Yusupov had been recipient of the gold medal. So the three players are often seen together and the coach can give them the same tasks, especially the key assignment - to play in bold fashion and to continue to learn all facets of chess mastery. Yusupov began quite early and has only recently left his teens, in 1973 at the age of thirteen he represented Moscow in the all-Umon Youth Games and four years later he took the World Junior Championship so becoming an international master. Quite soon after that he began his push to go further and he scored his first grandmaster norm in a tournament in Holland. A real triumph came his way in the 1979 USSR Super League at Minsk where nine famous grandmasters were in contention for the Soviet title, amongst them Tal and Geller. Young Yusupov kept on level terms with them throughout and only Geller's fine play just outdistanced his rival who came second. The impression made on his teachers and commentators was immense, and they noted in particular his fine endgame play Here is an example in his win over Так White's advantage does not seem so great and you can only admire how Yusupov made use of this insignificant plus.

Arthur Yusupov 95 This change of front by the rook to keep the passed pawns under control from the side brings no easing of the situation.

Harry Kasparov* Flohr had the quizzical comment 'As far as I can understand this game if Kasparov cannot yet be called an Academician yet the title of professor is certainly his already! This comment referred to a player who was only sixteen at the time yet had already an impressive list of tournament successes. Та I claimed that any success by the lad in the 1979 Super League would be a sensation In the event he shared 3rd-4th place with Balashov, yet it is no secret that some people expected even more from him, especially after his three wins at the start of the event. However the young man has not yet learned fully how to control his emotions and makes slips occasionally. Botvinnik's comment on this is that everyone makes slips from time to time The hard working Yusupov often has them, so Harry's occasional ones should not worry us especially, he will mature and they will disappear. In fact Kasparov's play has already made such an impression that his style and his victories are a talking point not just in the USSR but also abroad. His greatest success abroad was the spring 1979 Banja Luka tournament where he took first place ahead of a field of strong grandmasters including Petrosian, Andersson and Browne. His play was the high spot of the event and the spectators crowded in to watch him. We shall doubtless read many books and articles in the future about his play A guarantee of that is the continuing friendly contact which Kasparov is maintaining with Botvinnik He worked formally in the school for five years, and still regards himself as a pupil, in the sense that after nearly every game he phones up Botvinnik hoping to hear his mentor's praise, but also ready to hear with gratitude any critical comments that may come. Flohr points out that the young man is full of concentration and serious in his attitude. Some players prefer to walk round when it is the opponent's turn to move, and even chat (though not about the game in progress, of course) with friends and colleagues. Kasparov * Translator's Note Russian sources give the fust name as Gary or Garik but Kasparov has signed himself Harry ,n letters written m English to a Western publisher sits at the board and thinks in the way that Botvinmk used to Only when he has a clear advantage does he permit himself to get up and take a quick stroll round the stage. Then it is noticeable that he is nervous and excited and he has not yet learned how to hide this. The experts have some admiring comments to make about him though tinged at times with expectation. Petrosian, for example 'Harry is a great talent. In terms of talent I would compare him with Tal,but talent alone does not guarantee the highest achievements. A great deal will depend upon his reaction, especially how he reacts to the 'trial by fame". Despite his youth Kasparov has already played many fine games We select one of the latest from the 1979 Spartakiad where his 'marble' style was shown to perfection.

It is a real delight for me to visit the ballet 'Giselle! I am also very keen to play tennis, which I play at a high level and love no less than chess. I regret the fact that I became familiar with this form of sport so late on. Generally speaking I devote a lot of attention to physical preparation, and this helps me to play better! Lena is now one of our strongest players, and competes not only against women, in which field she has won the grandmaster title, but also against men. She seems to have the ambition to emulate Nona Gaprindashvili who has the grandmaster title not just for her long tenure of women's world champion but also for play against men. Lena's comment on this, 'I have played in several men's tournaments. I am not satisfied with my results there, but I enjoyed playing. Men rarely make just good simple moves - they try to make moves which, while perhaps not being the very best then at least are really good ones. Playing with men is excellent training! Go through this game against Petrovich in the 1979 USSR- Yugoslavia match and in every one of White's moves you will see the triumph of strategic thought, accurate exploitation of insigni ficant advantages and inventiveness in attack. In some of the moves you are sure to detect 'the hand of Botvinnik' at work.

10 Kart's Chess School
Viktor Emmanuelovich Kart is nowadays a weli-known chess trainer and must be considered a surprising and unique phenomenon in chess, the like of which we have not seen before, and may be just as rare in the future. The point is that he is a player who never scored a victory in strong tournaments, never even approached grandmaster level in his playing standard and does not even have the master title. Yet he developed a whole group of outstanding grandmasters who have carried the fame of the Lvov school to all parts of the world. His pupils speak of him with such admiration. Oleg Romanishin was once asked who coached him now that he had the grandmaster title. His reply: 'My attitude in chess and my whole upbringing in the game are the product of Honoured Trainer of the Soviet Union Viktor Emmanuelovich Kart, and if there are any failings in this upbringing then the fault lies in the pupils, not in the teacher who is a marvellous, generous and outstanding pedagogue! Fine words of the sort that every teacher would like to hear from his charges, yet they do not explain fully the fruitful results of his work over the years. After all he has produced in the last decade a whole set of outstanding players, namely grandmasters Oleg Romanishin, Alexander Belyavsky, Iosif Dorfman, Adrian Mikhal- chishin, Martha Litinskaya and many other young masters. What are his methods, what does he concentrate on? His answer: 'The main feature of our work is very likely the development of character and love of hard work. Only strong characters are capable of producing top competitive results'. Confirmation of this is seen in the attitude of tough competition between the two most talented pupils of his Oleg Romanishin and Sasha Belyavsky. When the slightly younger Oleg gained the master title his achievement was soon matched by the then fourteen year old Belyavsky. Later on the same pattern was followed, as the two vied for various titles and top places in tournaments. Yet the spirit of competition between them did not prevent them remaining friends and working on chess together. Kart's Chess School 103 This creative competition between themselves is a marked feature of all Kart's pupils. Junior colleague Dvoretsky has drawn attention to Kart's success in developing the best sides to his pupils despite their different personalities and styles of play. I can confirm this and must express my admiration for the spirit of friendship, understanding and mutual respect which applies in this famous collective. When talking to Kart's pupils l am invariably struck by the feeling of love, clearly mutual, which is so noticeable among them with regard to their coach. Let us now examine some of the better known of Kart's pupils, who in recent years have joined the ranks of the strongest grandmasters in the world. Alexander Belyavsky Young Sasha feels that he was lucky in his childhood since he was only eight in 1961 when he learned how to play chess and joined the chess circle in the Lvov Palace of Pioneers run by V.L.Kart. The youngster's chess abilities were soon developed and the typical spirit of competition in the circle led to considerable success in events at city and republic level.* Later on he became a pupil at the Number 2 Specialist School where Kart was on the staff, and then he started scoring successes at national level. In 1973 Sasha Belyavsky became World Junior Champion at Teesside, England, a great achievement which normally presages entry to the top circle of international tournaments. Sasha soon confirmed his reputation as an outstanding talent by sharing first place in the 1974 Soviet Championship with Tal so winning the grandmaster title. His successes since then have been numerous and can be attributed first of all to his native talent and his scrupulous hard work at chess. He knows that to last out a tournament which might last getting on for a month you have to have good health and strong nerves. That is why his daily routine includes skiing in winter and tennis or swimming in summer. It is no coincidence that he graduated from the Lvov Institute of Physical Culture. Possibly his studies in higher education put a brake on his advancement as a player since from 1974 he has had his ups and downs. This decline has recently been halted and he has some recent successes which can only be called record-breaking such as the perfect score of 13 points out of 13 at the 1978 Alicante tournament in Spain, five clear points ahead of the next player! * Translator's Note Lvov is the largest city in the Western Ukraine (formerly part of Poland)

Oleg Romanishin A really embarrassing state of affairs occurred at the start of the USSR Super League, 1975, in Yerevan. A 23 year old master from Lvov scored seven wins against famous players. This master was Oleg Romanishin the European Junior Champion of 1973, and the list of his victims is as follows - Petrosian, Furman, Polugayevsky, Balashov, Geller, Aiburtand Klovan. Not just the wins were striking, but the manner of their achievement brought repeated bursts of applause from the audience. Romanishin was to give his own reaction later: 'A win gives one a feeling of self-affirmation, and success - a feeling of self-expression, but only a sensible harmonisation between these urges can bring really great achievements in chess! He has not always managed to score victories. His style tends towards the combinational and tactical, and it is well-known that this preference does not always result in first prizes in tournaments So we must concede that he has his ups and clowns, greater than in many contemporary leading players, but his style of play and the content which he puts into every move has gained the admiration of fans around the world. He has that rich gift of fantasy that enables him to discover fascinating new possibilities in the depths of Oleg Romanishin 107 chess. We will not go through his tournament performances - they are very great even though his supporters were gravely disappointed at his failure in the 1979 Soviet Zonal tournament. He really should have got into the Candidates by now. However he is sure to have many successes in the future, and his fans are confident that what has always delighted them most of all, his creative play, will continue. I thought a lot about which of his games to present to readers, and then decided simply to ask him what was his favourite game. He nominated his game against Petrosian at the Yerevan, 1975, Soviet Championship that we have already mentioned. Romanishm-Petrosian Queen's Indian Defence

Black has put his strongest piece on the edge of the board at b8 where it is unable to help in the action which is about to take place on the ф -side. This factor induces Romanishin to decide on extreme measures m his ф -side pressure.

Iosif Dorfman What can you say about the play of grandmaster Iosif Dorfman was a question I once put to my friend Salo Flohr. His answer was that this was an interesting, tough player, who had somehow recently fallen back. He had shared the gold medal of Soviet Champion and then begun to play unconvincingly. Weil such things do happen from time to time with younger players (and with older ones too, the reader may add). One can only hope that this talented pupil of Kart will be able to overcome the temporary crisis and will regain his best form. Evidence of his Iosif Dorfman 109 abilities is provided by the following game, Dorfman-Chekhov, Minsk, 1976. White exploits his advantages with a series of simple clear moves. 17 b4! # d 8 18 c5!

She had seemed to have missed out on the chance of qualifying for the women's Candidate Matches after her fourth place in the
1979 Interzonal in Alicante, but took the chance of coming in as
reserve when one of the original qualifiers withdrew, and she won a dramatic match against the West German Giselle Fischdick after being 3-0 down! Such fighting spirit is perhaps a sign that she is overcoming the crisis and starting to play at her old strength. Her tactical awareness is seen in this game, Lysenko-Litinskaya, from the 1979 USSR Zonal tournament. Here grandmaster Litinskaya (the grandmaster title for women players was introduced by FIDE in 1976) carried out a mating attack. Marta Litinskaya 111 76 aQis кй±а± s m, ш ш ш,ш, ш Ш Ш Ъ Я к.

We have described the play of the 'graduates' of the three main Soviet schools. Yet we have two other significant schools which are remarkable by way of the fame of their heads. Some years ago the students' sports association Burevestnik organised a school under the direction of ex-world champion Vasily Smyslov and a similar school for young talents has been created for Spartak headed by another ex-champion Tigran Petrosian. Both schools work on the same sort of basis as the Botvinnik school, but whether this system will suit them and what sort of 'product' we shall have from their endeavours only time will show. As yet their activity has not been going on long enough for us to judge them. However the obvious desire of our leading figures to pass on their knowledge to the younger generation is there. In this respect Petrosian's comments are worth quoting: 'I consider that in chess it is possible to learn everything. That is what I believe and in my heart of hearts I cherish the dream that some day I will come across a pupil to whom I can pass on all that I know, all that I learned by dint of hard search after truth. I hope to bring on such a youngster who could work jointly with me in various researches and who could then try these out in actual play. Yet though I have not yet come across such a player I am still living in hope and like the work with youngsters. The school has been working for almost three years and there are some successes. Borya Kantser from Frunze has become USSR Junior Champion, while two lads, Kuporosov and Novikov, have reached the master norm! We can only wish our veterans good luck in the passing on of their immense experience to the young thereby making a serious contribution to the further development and popularisation of the game. Obviously studies under such conditions are a serious way of aiming for the top, but there are some of our players who have managed without long forma! schooling and still scored top-class results. We devote the remaining part of the book to some of these independent talents who have done it all on their own, or had only

Both of them are 'self-taught' in the sense that though their early efforts were encouraged by teachers their more recent climb to the top is the result of individual effort.
