Foreword by Tibor Karolyi Dear Reader, When my friend and former pupil Martin asked me to write a foreword to his book, I did not expect that I would learn so much from reading this work, but that is what happened. The first reason is that, in addition to some classic examples, he has found tactical examples that I did not know, thus avoiding one problem of many combination books. The second reason is rather different. I start working with pupils when they have already reached a high level, which means I can find a style for my pupil according to his or her natural talent and then pass on the required technical knowledge. However, I rarely work on combinations. In contrast, Martin learned chess quite late and worked hard at it, which gives him great insight into the difficulties of improving, in the same way that adults who become fluent in a foreign language see it differently from native speakers. Working through this book will help the reader to understand combinations and tactical play much better. Martin's advice is very useful. His carefully selected examples are not only instructive but very entertaining as well: many of them make a great artistic impression. I am sure that studying this book will not only bring great joy, but also improve your chess considerably. Tibor Karolyi International Master Tibor Karolyi is a successful author and a renowned trainer who has worked with Peter Leko and the Polgar sisters. Foreword by the Publisher The original edition of this book, Understanding Chess Tactics, is hailed as "a modern classic". Chess Tactics from Scratch is an expanded and updated version that benefits from major improvements. All text and analysis has been revised and improved. Also, two completely new chapters on Overloading and Candidate Moves have been added. Many readers of Understanding Chess Tactics suggested that they would like more exercises to test the understanding they gained by reading the book. So this book concludes with 300 brand-new test positions of varying difficulty. We hope that Chess Tactics from Scratch is as well received as its illustrious predecessor. John Shaw January 20 1 2 What is this book about? Chess is a visual game. A chess player must be able to recognize elementary patterns, therefore the tactics in this book will be primarily explained graphically. This approach is supported by a large numbers of diagrams, which will also allow the reader to study this book without a chessboard. Chess is also a game of logic. Logic, in the same way as chess tactics, depends on collecting and processing information. This book will show you how to accurately find the elements of tactics, and work with them creatively. This book is divided into the following parts: Chapter 1 Becoming Familiar with the Pieces!

Chapter 3 The Discovered Attack

g h This is the end of a nice combination by Tal. The black queen gave check on f6 forcing White to take. But the black pawn will take back with a check and reload itself with deadly force. Thus White has no time to save his rook. What the first piece occupying f6 (the black queen) did not achieve on this square, the following piece will do. The reloading of pieces is explained here and - strangely enough (and deservedly!) - recognized as a tactical motif in its own right and finally given a name in chess literature.

In this chapter we will learn how to organize and effectively prune the calculation process when working with tactics. This chapter brings it all together: from the easy questions such as 'How many retreat squares does a piece have?' to finding complex combinations like the one above. The previous eleven chapters are largely about what to look for. This last chapter is about how to look. Well, I called Chapter 1 2 the final chapter and that is true up to a point, as then it's time for the reader to stop reading and start working! Next are 300 puzzles to test your newfound understanding. I will say more about the puzzles on page 233. Introduction Tactics can be broken down into basic elements and systematically analysed. Therefore everybody should be able to understand tactics and use tactics successfully in his or her games. Steinitz, the first official World Champion, once pointed out that combinations are not coincidences or strokes of genius but the results of concrete positions. He taught us how to analyse any given position for its elements. The same method used to analyse positions can be applied to combinations. They too can be broken down into their elements. Although tactics sometimes can be very complicated, there is good news: tactics consist of basic elements that can be learned like a language or mathematics. Some years ago I trained for about two years with the former trainer of Peter Leko, Tibor Karolyi. With Tibor I mainly studied openings, middlegame strategy, and endgames. During this time I also solved a lot of combinations to sharpen my tactical skills. I had developed my own little routine. Whenever I thought I had discovered some mechanism or characteristic of a position, I started taking notes. The work on thousands of positions grew first into a collection of unsorted tactical insights, but finally resulted in a structured overview of tactics. Over time seemingly unconnected information turned into a coherent concept. The book you are now holding in your hands is my attempt to communicate this understanding of tactics. Most of the positions discussed in this book are original pos1t1ons from my notes. It does not really matter for teaching purposes whether these examples are well known or not. However, my experience when teaching club players is that most players did not know these positions. When I was asked to train a local club team, I thought it might be a good idea to have a look at their games from a team championship in order to find out about their playing strength. I saw the following position.

[diagram]
White is a piece down but has just played Rh4-f4, and I wondered why they were asking for training if they could play moves like this! Black obviously did not know what was going on, as he now played: 1 ... cic6?! Now I was expecting White to win back his piece. Surprisingly the player from my future club moved his queen back to h4. Now I knew they definitely needed my help. Let's look at the diagram again: 1 4 Chess Tactics from Scratch

From being a piece down at the beginning of the combination, White could have forced an equal pawn endgame. To calculate this over the board might have been difficult for you. Nevertheless, with the knowledge of this pattern (the discovered attack) you might have found it after all. This book will teach you two things: 1) It will systematically introduce you to all the elementary patterns and tactical formations. 2) It will teach you how to create and use them 1n your games. Another game from this club will illustrate quite dramatically what happens when a player is not familiar with the basic patterns and elementary motifs. Witt - Hoellwarth Germany 2004

Introduction 1 5 Holger Witt, the translator of this book, brooded over the board for half an hour and found an "ingenious" fourth possibility: losing the game. . . A few weeks later Holger, who had just started to translate this book, was playing in a tournament. A couple of days before this tournament he had been working on the chapter on double attacks. The basic pattern in mind, he had already seen a possible double attack on c2 against king and bishop. Finally the time had come to cash in on the idea he had been harbouring in his mind for quite a while. Schwappach - Witt Deizisau 200 5

Black is threatening mate with . . .Rh3 or . . .Rh4. Obviously White is desperately looking for a good reply. Again you notice the visual and obvious structural components of a tactical motif: three pieces in a row constitute a pin, here the gl -rook and Black's king and queen. Based on this basic pattern of a pin, White could have found the answer: 1 6 Chess Tactics from Scratch

The numbers in the diagram indicate the moves the knight needs to reach these squares. Imagine you are in time trouble. You have to find a safe square for your king. The clock is ticking and you cannot afford a long calculation. Now you know where to put your king in order to avoid forks for some time. For example, by placing your king on a square with the number 4. The next diagrams might look even more trivial.

 But this pattern might turn up in con1plicated situations. Only if you know these simple patterns by heart, will you be able recognize them in very difficult circumstances. In the Ruy Lopez there is the following variation:

Black will lose the exchange. Another thing that should be etched into your brain is the specific attacking tendencies that derive from the characteristic movement of any piece.

[diagram]
Black to move Although Black will queen first, he will lose the game due to the characteristic movement of the queen. Because of this the white queen will skewer Black's king and queen. In the next example it is the bishop that skewers the king and a piece. The basic pattern in mind, we just have to take the bishop to set up the skewer:

[diagram]
Over the board you could save calories not calculating moves like W'xe8 or W'xh4 as the white queen is pinned. Therefore, it is only able to move on the diagonal between its king and the opponent's bishop. You might also take the bishop. But all other moves are not an option. Beware of these optical illusions.

[diagram]
You may be under the impression that this is a blunder as it leaves White's queen en prise. But from h3 the queen was perforn1ing an all-important duty: covering the back rank mate by the white rook on c8. Consequently the white queen is untouchable. Right from the start the freedon1 of movement of Black's queen was restricted. The following examples show how the freedom to move can be restricted. This can be the consequence of: 1 . Restriction by other pieces

2. Restriction by an obstacle

3. Restriction by obligations

4. Restriction by tactical motifs

1. Restriction by other pieces

The knight is not able to move.

2. Restriction by an obstacle

The rook cannot jump over its own bishop. When a bishop is restricting a rook, as in the example above, you should look out for discovered attacks.

3. Restriction by obligations (e.g. defending

a mate) The bishop is not able to control the knight, as the pawn is threatening to promote.

4. Restriction by tactical motifs

The queen is only able to take the bishop. On the other hand the freedom of movement might be regained by: Becoming F amt ·tar with th p· 1·

1. The King

When the king is the target of a pin, the freedom of movement of the pinned piece is always radically reduced. A knight becomes totally immobile; other pinned pieces are only able to move on the line between the attacker and the king. So the pieces lose the attacking and defending functions they might have had before. In the following diagram the white queen is only allowed to move diagonally between g2 and d5 as it is pinned against the king.

[diagram]
Consequently Black's rook and queen are not under attack by the white queen and there is no mate on h7 either. The next two diagrams show how the defensive function of the queen disappears with the pin. She can neither defend the rook: Nor defend a square (mate) :

The next example demonstrates the loss of function of a pinned piece rather drastically.

Black will lose the queen or be mated. As the black queen is pinned by the white queen against the king it loses all its attacking power concerning the white rook on c l and its mobility to defend the c8-rook against :B:cl xc8 with mate.

[diagram]
If the target is the king the pin is always effectual and we can draw the following conclusions: The freedom of movement of the pinned piece is radically (in the case of the knight totally) reduced. The piece is only able to move in the line of fire of the attacking piece. Therefore, the pinned piece has no chance to defend itself against additional attacks. Bearing this in mind, it is not very difficult to see that these consequences of a pin against the king also have strategic repercussions. In an endgame the weaker side will try to hold the game by neutralizing the opponent's advantageous pawn structure or even an extra pawn with a piece. What the weaker side is trying to avoid is the exchange of this very last piece. One of the strategic consequences of a pin against the king would be the elimination of a remaining piece by setting up this pin and exchanging the last important piece, transforming the position into a won king and pawn endgame. Beliavsky -Yusupov

If White wants to stop the e-pawn the king has to move to the f-file. So in this position White resigned because:

6. And White won the pawn endgame with his extra pawn on the kingside. Tarrasch once pointed out that it is alwa�s dangerous when your king and the opponent s queen are on the same line, no matter how many pieces are in between. The next example shows that this advice should be taken seriously. 7 6 Schatz - Giegold Hof 1 928

he ran into 4• •• YMh4t!! forcing mate with 5 .:B:xh4 gxh4!. The black queen, though pinned and restricted, could still do her job along the h-file. "It is always dangerous when your king and the opponent's queen are on the same l ine." Tarrasch Now we know how dangerous it is for other pieces to enter into the line of attack between queen and king. With regard to the great value of king and queen we can also see that there will always be a threat of pinning if two of our own pieces are on one line or diagonal. Therefore you need to train your vision for these configurations on the board that might turn into a pin. The example of king and queen is the best to bring out the general principles of the pin. Note how simple things sometimes are: Schlechter - Leonhardt Bad Pistyan I 9 1 2
[diagram]
As you can easily see, the white rook and the black queen are already on one file but the file is not open. What you actually need to do first is to bring the king onto this file as a target:

Remember that a pin is made up of three pieces. Yet sometimes the target piece can also be just a square. In the last example we already had two of the three components for a pin

on the board: the black queen was opposing 1.• •b4?! the white rook. The only thing you had to do With this move Black entered a little was to create that missing third point behind adventure. the queen against which she could be pinned. If the king is somewhere near, then it is not 2.tllxc6 YM:xflt 3.@hl .Bg4 4.YMcl .Bf3 difficult to turn him into the target of a pin. If you understand how simple it is to set up a pin against the king, then you will later recognize more easily other pins or possibilities for pins as well. This example also shows the need to create the elements of a tactical motif, which does not only apply for the pin. Good players will threaten to create only the second of the three conditions of this motif and their opponents, in order to stop them, might get in to a desperate situation on other sections of the board. Good players, therefore, work with the motifs, and they are able to do so as they understand every component of the motif they are working with. Let's stay with the king as a target for a little while: Gelbmann - Gyimesi European U-20 Championship, Siofok 1 996

[diagram]
it looks as if White is not able to take the bishop on f3 or to defend against the mate on the h-file. Yet Gyimesi (with an excellent poker face! I was there watching the game and did not see any sign of worry on his face. . .) now saw the surprising 7.'Rh6!!, which would solve all White's problems: The Pin 29

[diagram]
The h-file would be covered, White would be threatening mate on h7, and if Black took the queen, White would uncover the pin of queen against king by taking the black bishop with the pawn. Although two pawns had been covering the pin we have to spot the elementary configuration of rook, queen, and king on one file. Once we have spotted this configuration we are able to use it to our advantage. White did not see this during the game and played

5.gxf3?

giving Black the chance to eventually set up a perpetual check and so the game ended in a draw. If both players had been able to see the three po ints of the pin more clearly, the game would have taken another course. We can see how important it is to recognize the configuration of the pin as early as possible and we have to see all three links of a pinning chain. One of these poi n ts is the target. To see a possible target when the piece is the king is fairly easy. But it is not only the king that can turn into a target: it could also be the surroundings of the king. Often pieces around the king have important defensive duties to perform. This gives ample opportunities to set up tactical operations. Van den Berg - Eliskases Beverw.ijk 1959
[diagram]
1 L.

[diagram]
Superficial analysis might arrive at the conclusion that the pawn on f6 is attacked twice and defended twice. Yet after White has gained a tempo attacking the bishop with his queen the picture changes completely as White is now able to set up a pin.

[diagram]

1-0 The pinning chain of queen, queen and king makes it impossible for Black to save his queen. In this example we first had the pin and then a sacrifice to win material. In the next example we will see the sacrifice first and then the material is won back by the pin. The effect of an elementary motif may occur in the beginning of a combination or later. It can either support another motif or be the winning motif itself. It is important to recognize the configuration of the pin as early as possible and we have to see a l l three links of a pinning chain.

Again the second king plays a decisive role. White's pinning piece is attacked twice, pinned against its own king and so unable to capture the black queen, but even so White's pin is enough to win the game. We have seen how to win the pinned piece in a pinning chain. Remember that this piece can be attacked from all other directions but the king's direction as the pinned piece is not allowed to expose the king to an attack. In the game Makogonov - Chekhover, Tbilisi 1 937, Black played:

Once again the pinned piece was able to perform its pinning task. Furthermore, we have to remember that in a counter-pin both defending pieces can lose their defensive properties. The pinned piece can be attacked from every other direction except from the king' s direction, as the pinned piece is not allowed to expose the king to an attack. The next example shows that the target can be conquered with tempo, especially when the king is around somewhere.

2. The pin against more valuable and more

important pieces Having learned that the king is an excellent target of a pinning chain, it is not too far fetched to assume that a pin is increasingly effective the more important the target in the pinning chain is. The value of the king is obvious. This is also clear in the case of a queen being protected by a pawn against the attack of a bishop. But what about when the value of the target is lower than the pinned piece? With decreasing value the target will also receive decreasing attention. The material value of the pinned piece is often unimportant for recognizing a potential pin. What is important is the target piece or square in order to create a pin. But this target piece or square can often be created with exchanges, attacks or by assigning a piece or square an important duty. In principle every attacked piece standing in front of a colleague has to be seen as pinned.

3. Pinning against an undefended piece

The importance and value of the target is not so relevant if the target piece will be lost when the pinned piece moves and is not able to defend the target piece.

[diagram]
34 Chess Tactics from Scratch

In this position it would be suicidal if the black knight took the pawn. The black knight would be lost after :ge 1 as it is not able to move out of the pin and defend the rook, which therefore remains undefended. But sometimes it is not necessary to defend the target directly.

[diagram]

3.Y:Yh4!

White threatens mate and at the same time sets up a pinning chain, as the pawn on f6 is not able to close the diagonal without exposing the black queen to the attack by its white opponent.

[diagram]
One undefended piece or square should already set off alarm bells with regard to any tactical motif. With two such points in a row and the last point undefended, it is pinning time. When looking to set up a pin, it is better to focus on the funda mental configuration rather than being too concerned about the value of each component. Indeed, searching for any tactic you should concentrate on the function of the pieces rather than on their value. If we are looking for the three components of a pin, it is better to look for the fundamental configuration rather than for the value of each component. This recommendation is nicely illustrated by the next example.

1. •• Y=Yc7 Black set up a rather unusual pin. After:

[diagram]
The white knight was trapped and Black had a good game with two pieces for a rook and a pawn. Again I would like to stress, and this is applicable to all other motifs, that it is easier to find all the information for a tactic when you concentrate on the function of the pieces rather than on their value. When sacrificing to give mate we do not care about the value of the pieces. It is the function that counts. Opening lines to the enemy king, or cutting off the king's escape route as in a smothered mate, takes priority over the value of the pieces used in these operations.

36 Chess Tactics from Scratch

Concluding this part about the pinning of an undefended piece, we should be aware of the danger of creating undefended targets ourselves.

[diagram]

4. Setting up a pin against a square or motif

The last point in a pinning chain can also be a square. As this concept is a little more difficult to see, let's start with a simple example. The pawn on h6 is pinned against the h7- square. If it moved, White would give mate on h7 with his queen. II. The pinned piece As with the target piece in a pinning chain, any chess piece can become a pinned piece as well. But in contrast its value must always be lower than the value of the piece it is covering. Its line of communication with the target piece is of special importance. Sometimes it might be able to move out of the line of fire and defend the target at the same time. This is why it is sometimes important to control its retreating squares. Often it is not difficult to overload the second piece with duties, especially when the target piece is an important one. As the pinned piece must already perform an important task it becomes increasingly difficult to fulfil other obligations. On the other hand we have to keep in mind that the pinned piece in some cases might turn the pin into a discovered attack. This special case will be examined later. III. The attacking piece Not every piece can turn into a pinning piece during its chess career. Kings, knights and pawns can never be the attacking piece of a pinning chain, as they cannot pin other pieces. Generally it is a mistake to believe the pinning piece must be of lesser value than the pinned piece. This misguided concept will keep you from thinking about setting up a pinning chain as in Bisguier - Pomar, page 3 5 . O f crucial importance is whether the pinning piece needs to be defended or not. In Shumov - Winawer, page 24, the pinning piece was undefended, but won the game anyway, whereas in Donner - Huebner, page 32, material was won with tempo thanks to the pinning piece being defended. So always keep in mind the status of your pieces. As we have already seen, it makes a big difference for any of the three points of the chain of a pin if that point is defended or not. The Pin 37 IY. Pinning and unpinning To set up a pin, a chain of three links must be completed. We have already sufficiently examined each of the three points: the pinning piece, the pinned piece, and the target. But what should be regarded as a precondition for a pin? Which link in the chain should already exist before considering setting up a pin? The primary conditions that make up the single links of a pinning chain are found in the role and position of each link in this chain, whose presence, value and status disclose to us the idea to use and to set up a pin. The king quite often fulfils the condition of presence, a queen often that of value, and a piece with a specific defensive task assigned to it the condition of status. All three promise an advantageous use of a pin. Therefore it is best, when setting up a pin, to start thinking of the desired result. Only if we can gain an advantage will we consciously resort to the elementary motif of the pin. Therefore the reason to intentionally apply the motif of the pin should be: a) The gain of material b) Taking away the ability to fulfil duties c) Tactical and strategic elimination of pieces It is best, when setting up a pin, to start thinking of the desired result. Only if we can gain an advantage wil l we consciously resort to the elementary motif of the pin. a) The gain of material To find a good reason for searching for the possibility of a pin and to set up this motif can first of all be found in the prospect of cashing in on an attack against the pinned piece or the target piece. The aim is the pin itself. Let's win with the pin:

Mate along the second rank or loss of the queen would follow. 1-0 Looking at the starting diagram you will easily see that the pawn on f7 has several tasks to fulfil. Firstly, it is defending the bishop on e6. Secondly, it is also blocking the formation of a queen and rook battery on the seventh rank with the lethal threat of a mate on g7. Two elements of a pinning chain already existed: the rook on a7 - the pinning piece, and the The Pin 4 1 pawn on f7 - the pinned piece. What was still missing was the target. In the initial position the pawn had only one task to perform: defending the bishop. It might be a good idea to overload its capacity by giving it another job to do. If we could lure the king behind the pawn:
[diagram]

[diagram]
We would have completed the pinning chain with the black king as a perfect target. Consequently we would render the pawn immobile. The white bishop is the bait that forced the king into the pin. In order to activate the mechanism of the pin you needed to be able to see this possibility right from the first diagram.

[diagram]
Anything that was protected by the pawn on f7 is now en prise due to the pin created by the check of the white bishop. This is a little gem that shows how pawns and pieces can lose their power when they are pinned against a valuable piece. Discovering the possibilities of a pin and creating a pin are closely connected. The next example also shows very graphically how helpless a pinned piece can become.

The rook loses all the power it had over the g-file. Its actual value is decreased drastically as the job it is performing at the moment could also be performed by a feeble pawn. When I started studying tactics I always looked at the conditions that made a combination possible. This way I learned a lot about strategy, too. I found out how to avoid certain situations and conditions {such as undefended pieces; as John Nunn aptly remarked: Loose pieces drop off. ..) . A very simple example: I realized the importance of the weak squares around the king when a lot of combinations occurred in the absence of a fianchetto bishop. I understood that the offer of a rook for the fianchetto bishop is often to my advantage. When solving exercises, you should always consider why a combination has worked.
[diagram]
Besides Black's weakened king position you should have noticed in the diagram above the awkward positioning of the a8-rook and the b8-bishop. It is exactly this inept placement of the b8-bishop that gave White the possibility for his mating attack (I.i.g7t and 2.gc8t) . The black bishop on b8 is disrupting the vital defensive line of the black rooks on his back rank. If Black were allowed to take the b8-bishop right off the board, he would have had good chances to survive the game! Sumets - Oney Istanbul 20 1 1

White threatens 2.'Rxg6t as the f7-pawn no longer defends g6, and 1 . . .�h7 would fail to 2.Bxf7 By registering the circumstances that allow a combination you will gain important knowledge for your own games. From the mistakes of others you can learn to recognize and avoid ugly strategic set-ups. Thus it is possible to learn from tactical examples how to play strategically. One of the simple lessons I learned from looking at tactics, which helps to eliminate the reason for many losses, was: avoid placing your pieces awkwardly! Even sacrificing material is sometimes a better option. There is often a superior solution to misplacing a piece, as the harmonious piece co-ordination in most grandmaster games demonstrates. A useful aid might be to ask whether Tai or Kasparov (or any other of your favourite players) would have played an intended but somehow awkward-looking move. If it looks awkward, it probably is. Be aware of such simple principles and you will automatically play one class better. The Pin 43 c) Tactical and strategic elimination of pieces It is not only the loss of the defensive power of a pinned piece that can have dramatic consequences. The inability to move can also become the beginning of the end. Hickl - Pelletier Switzerland 20 1 0

[diagram]
3.'Rc3 Black has seized control of the c5-

gl diagonal, pinned the f2-pawn and thus eliminated the defence of g3. So it would be mate-in-one with 3 ... 'Rxg3#. Quite often such a pin will be connected with the threat of mate. This kind of strategic pin that is constructed around the inability of the king to move has already been examined in the section on pins against the king. Frequently this motif occurs during the endgame, where it becomes very difficult to get rid of it as material is reduced on the board and a further exchange of pieces could result in a lost pawn endgame. However, a pin can be very annoying during the opening stages of a game as well. Weteschnik - Ruck Koszeg 1 996

[diagram]
White has just gobbled up a pawn with 'Rxg5. What is more, Black ends up in a very annoying pin. The black rook opposite the queen and the possibility of a discovered attack by Black's bishop are no real threats at all.

So unpinning by an attack on the pinning piece brings about a change in the status of the first piece in the pinning chain. The attacker is turned into the attacked. If the initial attacker was undefended or of too great a value, the unpinning manoeuvre turns into a discovered attack as also seen in the next game. This is an example of a target that turns into an attacking piece. This is also an example of how closely pins and discovered attacks are connected in principle. Alekhine - Yates Hamburg 1 9 1 0

[diagram]
With his last move ( 1 .ttJd4-e6) White deliberately pinned his own knight against his queen (target) . Although this appears to be suicidal, there is a snag for Black: the white knight discovered an attack on the black queen, so the rook cannot take the knight even though it is pinned (the d l -rook would take the black queen with check) . What is worse, Black's bishop is en prise and, to make things even more complicated, White will open the h-file once he has taken the bishop on g5, discovering very unpleasant threats to h7 and the black king. So Black has to move his queen first, but then White will take the bishop burdening Black with nightmares about his h-file. So the pinned knight on e6 turned out to be the protector of its queen, buying time with the discovered attack on the black queen for White to gain material. The target piece, the white queen on e4, had nothing to worry about.

Although this all seems rather trivial even the greatest players sometimes buy their way out of a desperate situation by knowing just a trifle more about elementary tactics than their opponent. The next example is well known but it is, for teaching purposes, a classic. Bobby Fischer demonstrates how to change the status of the points in the chain of a pin. Here the attacking piece is uprooted and deprived of its defence. Th us a pin is changed into a discovered attack. Fischer - Shocron Mar del Plata 1 959

If White retakes with the pawn the black bishop unpins by taking the pawn with check and then, no matter what White does, he will lose material. You, too, would have performed like a World Champion at this moment had you seen that you can unite the two unpinning principles we have discussed: the second piece (pinned piece) is unpinning with tempo, giving check and discovering an attack on a piece that it is not well enough defended. So a pin should not cause us horror and desperation unless it can be turned in to a real advantage. Even when our opponent is turning the heat up, the pinned piece might not be lost.

[diagram]
Although the black knight is not really defended by the pawn on d6 as this pawn is pinned against the queen, the knight is still not en prise on e5 as the knight on f3 is pinned against the undefended rook on fl . • • • • Summary Always be on the lookout to create or prevent a pin. A piece pinned against the king is extremely vulnerable and often totally immobile. King and queen on the same file or diagonal always constitutes a motif for p1nn1ng. Every undefended piece is a potential candidate for a pin. • Every attacked piece of yours standing in front of another of your pieces should be considered as pinned. • In a pinning chain the function and not the value of each piece is what matters most. • Take note of already existing parts as preconditions for a pin. • • • Two pieces of the same colour on a diagonal or file should already be regarded as a precondition for a pin. Consider possible changes of the po ints in a pinning chain. A pin can turn into a discovered attack. Chapter 3 The Discovered Attack The discovered attack has a strong schematic resemblance to the pin. As in the pin there are three pieces in a row. But in contrast to the pin there is a fourth point. The first piece and the discoverer are pieces of the same side; the third point is a piece or square of the other side. The fourth point is taken or occupied by the discoverer. What sounds complicated in words is simple in pictures. So take a look at the next diagram for a simple example:

[diagram]
The discovered attack consists of four points: 1 . rook = the principal attacker

2. bishop = the discoverer

3. queen = the victim point (victim piece/

square)

4. h7 /king = the discoverer's target

We have two pieces of the same side: White's e I -rook and e4-bishop. Then there is the third piece, the black queen on e5. These three pieces together look like a pinning chain. As already mentioned, that similarity in formation is why a pin can transform into a discovered attack and vice versa. The difference compared to a pin is an additional target - the king on g8 and the h7-square. We will call this the discoverer's target. After White has played I.irh7t we have a situation similar to a double attack: White is attacking two pieces: the rook is attacking the queen, and the bishop is attacking the king. As Black is not able to answer both threats with one move, he will lose his queen. A discovered attack is a simultaneous attack against two points where one attack against the first enemy piece is discovered by the attack on the second. The attacker and the discoverer in this mechanism have to be pieces; their targets can be either pieces or squares. First we are going to take a look at the pieces you need for a discovered attack: principal attacker and the discoverer. Then we will look at the victim piece, paying special attention to the king. Finally we will have a look at the discoverer's target. The principal attacker Looking back at the first diagram, you will easily understand that the principal attacker can never be a king, a knight or a pawn. This

52 Chess Tactics from Scratch

leaves only the long-range pieces (queen, rook and bishop) as possibilities for the principal attacker. This may sound trivial but it helps to discover the vital formation over the board, especially in complex positions. If the principal attacker is to attack the victim piece, it has to be of lower value if the victim piece is defended. If the victim piece of this attack is undefended, value does not matter with regard to the principal attacker. If the victim point in the discovered attack is not a piece but a square there has to be a winning trick the principal attacker can perform from its new square. Always keep in mind the long-range impact of the principal attacker.
[diagram]
 Initially the pieces do not exert any control down the file. If you removed the bishop, all squares on this file would be attacked once. If the bishop moved, one square is attacked twice. In the last case one move made by the bishop would mean a sudden control of three times (!) on that square. Bearing this in mind, you always have to include the control of the first piece in your calculation. Sometimes you may be able to defend a piece indirectly this way, as you can see in this game: Tai - Kolarov Austria 1 970
[diagram]
The Discovered Attack 53 The e6-pawn is defended directly by the e 1 - rook. After White played:

[diagram]
The pawn remained defended, although the line of communication between rook and pawn is interrupted by the knight.

[diagram]

[diagram]
But who would not have liked to play on a bit against the 'Magician from Riga' . . . We can also learn from this example that the principal attacker in our pattern for the discovered attack can be undefended if the discoverer discovers the attack with tempo. The discovered attack may be used to defend a piece indirectly. Sometimes it is enough to put the principal attacker in place, threatening a discovered attack. Take a look at Thimann - Felbecker, Correspondence 1 968:

[diagram]
White has just moved his bishop to d2 pinning the knight to the black queen. Not a bad idea you may think with regard to the last chapter 'The Pin'. Yet with this move he gave Black the opportunity to set up the mechanism of a discovered attack with: 1 ... Y:Yb6! Escaping the pin with tempo and equalizing the game.

[diagram]
56 Chess Tactics from Scratch

You will note that we have an undefended black queen as a possible victim piece, and the f4-knight as a possible discoverer on the same diagonal. If the white queen were on g3 the black queen would be lost. So all Marshall had to do was to clear the g3-square:

[diagram]
Black resigned, because if he had recaptured Marshall would set up the discovery:

1.. . @xg7 2.Yf g3t

Now the black queen is lost after White's next move: a knight check. 8 ..

[diagram]
Visual chess! This is what you should have envisioned: the chain of three pieces - the queen on g3, the f4-knight and the queen on d6. Try to grasp formations of this kind optically. Then you will find them automatically in any given position. In regard to this chain it also helps to notice that the black queen is undefended and that the discoverer (the f4-knight) has a target in the nearby black king. We will see how to collect this kind of information more systematically in Chapter 1 1 , Status Examination. Mating threats in connection with the threat of a discovered attack can also be poison for your future opponents. Take a look at the game Keres - Gligoric, Yugoslavia 1 959:
[diagram]

[diagram]

[diagram]
In this situation White was able to play

as the c5-sql1are was only seemingly defended twice. As White is able to discover an attack against the king with the d4-pawn, it is White who is controlling the square. After

White should have continued with:

2.dSt! Qgs

Other moves are worse.

3.d6

Winning a piece as otherwise the passed pawn, supported by the bishops and the rook, would be fearsome. (This would have been much better than the game continuation of

3.Bc4. In the game White had to wait for

hours before Black finally resigned - in an endgame where he had missed some possible drawing chances.) In the previous example an attack by the principal attacker against a victim piece had to be defended. In the next example it is the threat of the discoverer against the king that does the trick. Take a look at Alekhine - Em. Lasker, St Petersburg 1 9 1 4:

[diagram]
 6.

[diagram]
5 8 Chess Tactics from Scratch The discovered attack formation has been completed (:gd3-CtJd5-:gd7 with the king on b 1 as the discoverer's target) . Now just moving the d7-rook away would not help because of 2 ... :gd l t 3.@c2 CtJe3t winning the g2-rook. In dire straits, Alekhine sacrificed the exchange only to lose the game in a long endgame. The enormous scope of the discoverer can easily be seen in the next diagram.

[diagram]
If White's queen were to take the h8-rook then a white king on any of the marked squares would be a target within reach of the discoverer, the c8-bishop, and the white queen would be won by the a8-rook. The most dangerous form of discovered attack on a victim piece is to give a check with the discoverer. If you analyse any given position and find a discovered attack with check, as in the diagram above, then the discoverer may be able to interrupt the line of communication between its own pieces without losing anything. Take a look at the game Gruenfeld - Steiner, Moravska Ostrava 1 933:

[diagram]
Here White has been able to play l .Bf5-c2 as the b2-bishop remains defended, although it is seemingly cut off from the defence of the queen on e2. Yet you will already have discovered that Black's 1 .. . 'W'xb2 will run into

2.Bxh7t.

This mechanism also works in a reversed form against the defender. Sometimes the discoverer is just interrupting lines of communication. As mentioned earlier, the discoverer is not always the aggressor. It sometimes is enough to offer extra options for other pieces. Consider Duenhaupt - Kuenert, Correspondence 1 952/53:
[diagram]
1 L.

[diagram]
White played: The Discovered Attack 59 I . .Bd8 Interrupting the communication between the black rooks, so they do not defend each other anymore. Thus the queen on f3 is now attacking the undefended a8-rook. The small step by the bishop also discovered an attack on the f7-square: it is a double attack by the white queen on the a8-rook and f7. So it is decision time for Black: either lose a rook or lose the game straight away. Interrupting lines of communication was also the trick in Osnos - Yuhtman, USSR 1 968.
[diagram]
 6.

[diagram]
Black has just played l . . .Bf4-e3! creating two threats in one move. The e4-rook is en prise now, as it is cut off from its defender, the e2-queen. Additionally, Black threatens to win the fl -rook. This was simply too much and White threw in the towel. Sometimes the discover is just interrupting lines of communication. Now that we know that the discoverer in a discovered attack can bring death and destruction into the ranks of the defender, it is time to look at what the discoverer can do for the principal attacker. Here is an example from Krogius - Sergievsky, USSR 1 959:
[diagram]
 6.

[diagram]
I.tllg6!! 1-0 Knights are nasty pieces. Here the horse jumps to g6, discovering an attack on the black queen. If Black plays 1 . . .Rxf5, White strikes back with 2.ctJ xe7t winning the rook, forking queen and king. So the knight defends the white queen indirectly. Occasionally it may be possible to defend a piece directly as well. Take a look at Travnicek - Janata, Czechoslovakia 1 96 1 .
[diagram]
 6.

[diagram]
This shields the white queen against the attack of the d8-rook. At the same time it is opening the d3-h7 diagonal for its queen, threatening mate. Thus the rook as the

60 Chess Tactics from Scratch

discoverer in a discovered attack is directly defending the queen. White is winning, for example:

1.• •

[diagram]

[diagram]
White is going to win all of Black's pieces, as the black knight is trapped. You can see again how powerful the connection of two tactical motifs can be, in this case the discovered attack and the double attack. The strongest pieces, if pinned 1 · against the king, lose all their power • The victim point: the king Nothing is better than an attack against the king. Even if your opponent gained your whole queen's wing, if you could find a mate all his material advantages will not matter. The strongest pieces, if pinned against the king, lose all their power, and even a check by a feeble little pawn has to be answered. Discovered checks are among the most devastating weapons in a player's tactical arsenal. When they come as double check it is usually Game Over, as you will see in the next game, Petroff - Szymanski, Warsaw 1 85 1 :

This should be an important lesson for you: no matter how many pieces and pawns are in-between two long-range pieces or a long range piece and the king there is always the potential for a discovered attack as there is always the potential for a pin. Pieces might disappear or be cleared away with tempo and suddenly you find yourself trapped. If there is nothing on the square where we would like a victim piece to be, then we have to persuade a piece to go there as in Veltmander - Cherepkov, USSR 1 950.
[diagram]
After studying the position for a few seconds you will have noticed the necessary

66 Chess Tactics from Scratch

configuration of two of your pieces: the h3- bishop and f5-knight sharing one diagonal is a good start for constructing a discovered attack. You may also have noticed that the knight can evacuate the f5-square with check, so all you need is a victim piece to complete the discovered attack. This is why Veltmander played:

[diagram]
Winning the queen. Sometimes a victim piece already occupies the desired square but the value of that piece is too low. In this case an exchange on this square might help to increase the value of this point considerably. As an example consider Chigorin - Steinitz, Havana 1 889:

Black finally has to accept the gift of a bishop in exchange for his queen. So far all these operations have been rather materialistic. But sometimes it is not material you are interested in, but changing the function of a victim piece.

Within seconds you will have spotted the three points of the chain: e l -rook, e4-knight and e6-knight. The knight is defending the g7-square that is coveted by the white queen. So White used a discovered attack to eliminate the knight:

Not 1 .ttJ g5 ? Rxf6. 1-0 The knight is attacking both the queen on f5 and the e8-rook, while even more importantly opening the line of fire for the e I -rook, which is ready to sacrifice itself on e6, removing the defender of g7. A discovered attack might also be changed into a pin. The chance of this happening increases when there is more than one piece in the l ine of fire of the principal attacker. In most of the previous examples the boards have been quite crowded. Here is an example where it is fairly empty. Nevertheless, the solution found in Bagirov - Holmov, USSR 1 962, is rather pretty.

If White takes the knight, Black would simply play 2 .. .e4, opening the b8-h2 diagonal and gaining the g3-square for the black queen. On g3 the queen has a double attack against the king and e3-bishop and, all of a sudden, White's attack has vanished in a haze. If the "victim" is a square rather than a piece, the discovered attack can be difficult to spot:
[diagram]
 Deshauer - Meier Correspondence 1 953 Look closely at this position and you see that the black king is unable to move. If you could attack the king just once, it would be mate. This can be achieved with the white queen on h6 after l2J xg6t . . .hxg6 opens the h-file. Again the victim of the discovered attack is an important square:

White wins the queen as otherwise it would be Game Over for Black. The discoverer's target Concluding this chapter, let's take a look at the discoverer's target in a discovered attack. As you will remember, the discoverer's target is the square the discoverer moves to in order to discover the attack of the principal attacker on the victim piece or victim square. In rare cases the discoverer can move to the discoverer's target even without any direct impact on the position. For example, there is a small finesse in the endgame of queen versus rook:

[diagram]
The Discovered Attack 73

[diagram]
White has just played 1 .Rd5 setting up a discovered attack formation. Even a check by the rook will give White a tempo because the white king's move will give check. It is common for the discoverer to gain a tempo on its target. The classic example is a check and_ in this case you are advised to observe the consequences of this on all other points in a discovered attack. Let's examine Kan - Botvinnik, Moscow 1 936:

Botvinnik is finally able to use the discoverer's target (the king on b5) to support the pawn. This is the moment when we should remember that we can leave a piece or pawn without direct protection if it is "defended" by a possible discovered attack. The attacked white rook cannot take the pawn because of 4 .. . i.fl t.

74 Chess Tactics from Scratch

An exchange on the discoverer's target has to be analysed carefully, otherwise the discovered attack might not deliver the desired result, as in this position, which is analysis of Kirillov - Botvinnik, USSR 1 93 1 :

[diagram]
White hoped to win a piece as he thought his a2-knight was defended by the discovered attack against the d4-knight. But Botvinnik had prepared an intermediate move: 1 .• • ti:)xf3t After White recaptures the knight, Black can take on a2, as now the discovered attack would only regain a pawn. Summary • A discovered attack is always created by three points in a row. The fourth point is the target of the discoverer. • Always look at the long-range impact of the principal attacker beyond the discoverer. • • • • • • • Sometimes just threatening a discovered attack might be enough to win. When creating a discovered attack you can use squares near any of the four points as well, employing other tactical motifs. A discovered attack against the king is often highly profitable. As a check from a discoverer is extremely dangerous, moving onto the same line as a piece that is able to give a check provokes the creation of a discovered attack. The discoverer might be able to support the creation of all other tactical motifs (double attack, pin, etc.) . You can create the victim point of a discovered attack by forcing one of your opponent's pieces to move there. The victim point does not have to be a piece. Sometimes empty squares are worthy of a discovered attack, especially in connection with a threat of mate. Chapter 4 The Reloader In the early sixties Billy Wilder directed one of the best film comedies ever: One, Two, Three. It told the story of a soft drinks manager in Cold War Berlin and how he accomplished his jobs just one, two, three, snapping his fingers, "motivating" his subordinates to work harder and faster. The reloader works on the principle of one, two, three; one: you put one of your pieces onto a square for your opponent to take it; two: he takes it; three: you advantageously retake on the same square with another of your pieces. As simple as that. As always in chess, it is not as easy as soft drinks management in Cold War Berlin. For starters there are two varieties of this motif. The first possibility is to reoccupy the square with the same type of piece, as in this diagram: After the bishop has taken the knight on f7, the knight on g5 will take the black bishop, reloading the square with an identical piece. This is the simplest form of the reloader. The rule for this case is: Two pieces of the same kind are able to occupy a square without any loss of impact when it is only defended once. The other possibility is to reoccupy the square with a piece of a different type. The white knight is replaced by the bishop after the black pawn on g7 has eliminated the knight. The rule for this case is: The second piece occupying the square does not have to be of higher value than the first but its action has to compensate for the loss of the first piece. It is important to note that the second piece that is reoccupying the square has to gain something, in our example checkmate. The trick is that the sacrifice of the first piece, which your opponent is not able to turn down, enables the second piece to occupy a square it would not have been able to occupy otherwise. In many cases the occupation of the crucial square by the first piece creates the motif for the second. Therefore, this motif is sometimes difficult to spot. But here is a little trick for you: it helps a lot to be on the lookout for squares you wish to place your pieces on, even if your wish doesn't seem possible. The dream square might become reality by moving

another (!) piece to that square first, paving the way for you to occupy it once more; this time with the piece you initially envisioned for that glorious square. This way you will spot the motif and also find a way to clear the path for the second, reloading, piece. Let's take a closer look at the first case of the reloader. In the following diagram we see a black king in trouble. With a closer look, you will easily discover that the black king would be mated if you could put the rook on a6 without it being taken.
[diagram]
The only thing remaining to do is to clear a6 of all influence by Black.

[diagram]

The trick worked because the a6-square was only defended once but attacked twice by pieces with similar abilities, i.e. to move vertically and horizontally. Therefore, either queen or rook could have given mate on a6 if it had not been defended at all. The destruction of the protective pawn structure around the enemy king, as in the previous example, is a common use of this mo ti£ In the next position (analysis of Tai - Smyslov, Yugoslavia 1 959) it is the combination of queen and bishop that proves a deadly force:

[diagram]
1.YNxf6t .Bxf6 2. i.xf6 mate

It is not important whether the first piece captured a piece or not; the important thing here is that the second piece is able to occupy the square. The devastating effect of the second piece is the characteristic of the reloader. Another characteristic is the provocation of your opponent or, as the Godfather would have put it, you are making an offer he cannot refuse. Gutop - Roshal

We will come across this example once more when looking at mating patterns. White is threatening ttJe8t with an attack on the black queen. 1 .Wff3 The second piece is coming to the aid of the first piece (the f6-bishop) , which is already in place.

Guess who won .. . To spot a reloader, be on the lookout for diagonals and files into your opponent's camp and for squares where you could, for example, nicely perch a knight, especially around your opponent's king. The Reloader 79 Now for the reloaders with different types of pieces replacing each other. This type of motif can be more difficult to spot, as the second piece is of a different type and consequently performs different tricks on the square that has been cleared by the first. Therefore, imagining what you could do on a particular square with different pieces is very important if you want to discover the motif. Gofshtein - Afek Israel 1 992

It is increasingly difficult to spot the key move when the first piece greatly changes the conditions on the square for the second piece to perform a special tactic on this square, which the first piece would not have been able to perform there. Tactics can be beautiful and here is a good example from 1 96 1 , the year the wall was built in Berlin (remember: One, Two, Three):

This example shows very nicely that even very strong players are prone to overlooking motifs like the reloader; this is your chance and it might happen in any game you play. The reloader enables pieces to occupy vital squares that are defended by the enemy's pawns or pieces. In the next case discovering the reloader was a small step on the road to the World Championship (this is a further explanation of an example we have already seen in the chapter on the pin) .

check can be answered by a check. Of course this will never happen to you .. .) After the ingenious, yet not unusual, application of the reloader by World Champion Tai, let's look at a final example where the reloader appeared in a quite unusual fashion. The following example is based on analysis by Naiditsch of the game Naiditsch - Sutovsky, Dortmund 2005.

[diagram]
An unusual, slightly delayed, but very pretty reloader. The second rook on h8 is decisive as the white queen is bound to the h6-square. • • • • • • Summary Two pieces of the same kind are able to occupy a square without any loss of impact when it is only defended once. The second piece occupying the square of the first does not have to be of higher value but it has to compensate for the loss of the first. The reloader may be used to eliminate a defender. The reloader enables pieces to occupy vital squares that are defended by the enemy's pawns and pieces. Think about what a defending piece could do if it moved to the square of the piece it is defending. If you use the reloader against the enemy king, it will almost always mean a gain of tempo. Chapter 5 The Double Attack Imagine you are preparing pancakes for breakfast. There you are in front of the oven and in the pan are delicious golden pancakes; they are just about ready. The telephone rings. Now you face a tough choice: either answer the call and let the pancakes burn, or say 'stuff communication, I'm hungry' and do not answer the call. This is what the double attack is about: one piece is attacking two enemy pieces and only one can be defended or moved. If, for example, both pieces are undefended or of greater value than the attacking piece, one of the two attacked pieces will be lost. The explanation is trivial yet a lot of players, and very good players as you will see in this chapter, forget about it: in chess you are allowed to move only one piece at a time. Every chess piece has the ability to perform this tactical trick. It is the most common motif in chess. So beware. If we create a scheme for the double attack we could break it down into three points. There are two poi n ts which are attacked. I will call them tactical target 1 and tactical target

2. They are marked with a box. The third

point is the square from where the attacker is threatening the two enemy pieces. I will call this point the tactical base and it is marked with a circle. Tactical Target 1 Tactical Target 2 This graphic shows the moment when you can take advantage of your opponent's situation to create a double attack. All three basic components of the double attack are there to see. But this chapter is not only about the components and their character, it is also about the timing and how to create the situation represented by the scheme given above. And although this motif is called double attack and the scheme shows only two tactical targets, there might be more. Who has not dreamt of a knight forking king, queen and rook? Whenever you start to create the situation of a double attack, it does not matter where you start, whether it is the tactical base or one of the tactical targets. Sometimes you might even start from scratch. And there is no set sequence in which you have to construct your double attack. You can start with either tactical target or the tactical base. Because the formation of the double attack is sometimes incomplete, it is difficult to see the hidden motif.

84 Chess Tactics from Scratch

In connection with the double attack I have also called the attacked opponent's pieces tactical targets. This is not to make things more difficult for you, but simply to avoid confusion when tactical targets are squares or motifs. I will start my lesson on the double attack with the tactical base, paying special attention to the knight. Then I will take a look at the tactical targets, and here the king, as always in tactics and in chess in general, naturally plays the most important role. The Tactical Base The tactical base is the square that a piece has to occupy in order to attack two or more of the opponent's weaknesses at the same time. As every chess piece (knights, pawns and king included) can perform this nasty trick, the rules and recommendations for the tactical base apply for every piece on the board. However, from Orwell's Animal Farm we know that some animals are more equal than others, and in the case of the double attack, it is the pawn and the knight that are special. A double attack by a pawn is often devastating, as the pawn itself does not have great material value. If it is lost in the course of the operation it does not really matter, as it normally faces pieces of greater value. But the real specialist for double attacks is the knight. Due to its peculiar way of moving, when a knight attacks other kinds of pieces they cannot strike back and take out the offender. Its strange movement is also responsible for the double attack by a knight being one of the most common oversights in chess. But, before we go deeper into the mechanics of the knight, let us take a closer look at the tactical base in general. It is important to note that after a piece has landed on a certain square all points it could reach from this point are prospective squares for a double attack. These squares are the possible tactical targets of your double attack. The diagram below shows every possible square of the rook on dl .

[diagram]
In the next diagram the circled squares are the sensible tactical bases from where the rook would be able to perform a double attack on two tactical targets marked by a box.

[diagram]
So much for the theory, now let us see what it looks like in a real game. The following position is from one of the games Paul Morphy played against Schulten in New York 1 857. The Double Attack 8 5 1 .• • Y;Yf6 did not solve all his problems. The game continued:

[diagram]

[diagram]
If Black takes the knight with his king then two of the three elements of the double attack would already be on the board. Both the king on f6 and the b6-knight are the tactical targets of the d I -rook, which could perform a double attack from d6, the tactical base for this motif More than 1 00 years later the trick was still working. The following position is from Jansson - Pytel, Stockholm 1 975:
[diagram]

1.YMd4

[diagram]

[diagram]

However Black did not have full compensation for his queen. Two years later it was possible to see that Pytel had learned his lesson well. In Le Havre he played Lederman and this time Pytel put a piece on a tactical base that was seemingly defended.

[diagram]
With the knowledge you have already acquired you will be able co see why Schultens next move

1.. .

[diagram]
1 L.

[diagram]
You see the marked tactical targets of the b5-knight if it occupied c7. Consequently, the black queen is not defending d5, as it has to prevent the knight from hopping to c7. So 7.YMdS!? is possible in this position. The black queen is overloaded as in our previous examples. There is another important lesson to be learned here: if you examine a tactical base you always have to take into account all possible tactical targets. You will not recognize the full potential of the tactical base if you only look at the obvious tactical targets. As a double attack requires at least two tactical targets, it is easy to recognize the possibility for a double attack if we already have a tactical base and one tactical target. The only thing to do now is to create the second tactical target to trigger the mechanism. Former World Champion Boris Spassky gives a fine example of how to do this. Take a look at the next diagram showing a position from Spassky - Averkin, USSR 1 973. The Double Attack 87

Black wins. White's third move would have exposed the queen to a double attack, because e5 and h2 are tactical targets of the tactical base g4. The game Bellon Lopez - G. Garcia, Cienfuegos 1 97 6, shows how a tactical target of a knight is occupied, before the horse jumps to its tactical base.

[diagram]
Occupying the tactical target before the knight has occupied the tactical base e3. White is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. If he does not take the rook, he will be mated. But if he takes the rook, he will have to give his queen for a rook and a knight:

2.f;Yfl

[diagram]

[diagram]
Alekhine played:

[diagram]
If the queen takes the h6-rook, it would have moved onto the tactical target of the tactical base f7. As one of the other tactical targets of f7 is the black king on d8, the rook is defended by the tactical motif of the double attack. In the next game we have a rook defending a seemingly hanging queen, although this example is far more spectacular. Dantas - Wexler Mar del Plata 1 95 1

[diagram]
1 . . . �fl This was too hot to handle for Dantas. If White takes the queen it is mate with . . . !!h2. If he takes the rook, he would first lose the queen and then the game. The last example is an interesting case. Although the f2-rook does not have direct control over e 1 , it is indirectly defending the black queen on this square by a threat of mate. On the other hand, from e 1 the queen is directly defending the f2-rook. Note the possible influence of the tactical base on squares that are not within its direct reach. We have seen that there is no fixed sequence for the occupation of the tactical base and the tactical targets. If one of the tactical targets is originally occupied then the motif of the double attack is more difficult to see. Another difficulty of setting up a double attack might be the creation of the necessary configuration of three or more points. The next diagram is an example of a potential double attack that is not so easy to see.

[diagram]
White has the chance to defend his b7- knight with I ..Bb5 . If Black then captures on b7, White would take the c6-knight, forking rook and king.

94 Chess Tactics from Scratch

Consequently, there are two things you should keep in mind when you study the possibility of a double attack: 1 . Make sure you have checked all possible sequences for occupying the three different points.

2. Keep in mind that you might have to

create the second tactical target. The previous example leads us to the topic of the tactical target but is also a nice illustration of the function of the tactical base as well. Try to find every tactical base and tactical target for the g4-knight and the b6-bishop in Kapengut - Kupreichik, USSR 1 976:

[diagram]
I am sure that you have found the tactical base for the black knight on e3, although it is defended at the moment.

If Black takes the white a-pawn, the white king will catch the black pawn on al while the bishop stops the f-pawn on the newly opened diagonal. During the middlegame it is more difficult to turn the king into a tactical target. Often he has to be 'motivated' by a sacrifice to leave his safe position. As usual, it helps to make an offer that cannot be refused. Vasiukov - Taimanov Tallinn 1 965

The undefended e4- rook is the first tactical target for the double attack. All other squares on the f-file are possible second tactical targets. You should pay special attention to the squares close to the black king. The trick of this double attack was to force the king onto one of these squares (f6) . Consequently, not only the king but also the squares next to the king have to be considered as potential tactical targets in relation to the king. When you are thinking about a double attack and you have already found one tactical target you should always watch for options against the king, as he is a wonderful second tactical target. Sometimes the king is already where you want him, but if not you might be able to 'persuade' his majesty to move a little to make life easier for you. The Double Attack 99 The easiest way to get within reach of the king is to open lines into his position. Looking over the walls of the castle we see the king in the garden.

Now the black queen can no longer give check on c4. A draw was agreed shortly thereafter, as the black king cannot find a safe haven. • • • • • • • • • • Summary A double attack consists of a tactical base and two (or more) tactical targets. Every square that can be reached from the tactical base must be considered as a po ten rial tactical target. The tactical base can be occupied if a piece defending the tactical base has a more important task to perform. In order to occupy the tactical base with material gain, you might first have to sacrifice. If you have got a tactical base and only one tactical target you might be able to create the second tactical target. A tactical target can be a piece, a square, or a tactical motif. Look out for undefended pieces! They are likely candidates as tactical targets of a double attack. A check should always be considered as a potential tactical target. If the king is a tactical target, the tactical base will almost always be occupied with tempo (check) . The squares next to the king might be turned into tactical targets. Chapter 6 Overloading Overloading is the opposite of the double attack. It is when a piece rather than attacking two squares of importance, has a responsibility on two important squares. In this case we talk about a piece being overloaded. This is only relevant if the opponent can 1n some way exploit this. In the game Stocek - Prokopchuk played in the 20 1 0 Czech Open Rapid Championship they reached the following position:

The knight on c3 is sort of pinned (although the b8-rook is defending the queen) and Black's back rank is fragile, making the b8-rook overloaded. Bent Larsen managed to take advantage of all of these themes with one surprising move:

It might be a coincidence, but many of Bent Larsen's most famous combinations involved taking advantage of the opponent's overloaded pieces. In the following example he managed to get his grip into the collar of a reigning World Champion. Overloading is quite a common theme in tactics, often in combination with other themes.

There are two themes in play here. One is the double attack of d3 and g2, which the knight can perform from f4. The other is the overloading of the bishop on g3, which has to look after the pawn on h4 as well as the f4- square. Larsen grabbed his chance with: 1 ... cixh4! Karpov now decided to accept the loss of the pawn and tried to hold the position with

2.Re2.

If he had taken on the challenge, he would quickly have been forced to resign:

2.cixh4 gxd3!

The potential knight fork on f4 is devastating.

[diagram]
Often a piece is overloaded without it having any great importance. It is not hard to imagine that a piece is defending several important squares, but the opponent cannot take advantage of it. We should not overstate the importance of this theme; only pay dutiful attention to it, in the same way as we pay attention to other tactical themes. However, it can be quite unpleasant when we find that we have two pieces that are overloaded, which is exactly what happened to Robert Byrne as White in a famous game against Bobby Fischer in the 1 963 US Championship, which Fischer famously won with the perfect score of 1 1 / 1 1 .

The mission is completed. The combination that started with stripping the white king of his defending pawns and bishop has progressed to removing the overloaded heavy artillery that flew to the king's aid. And not only can the queen not take on d4, due to the mate on g2, she is also pinned and thus unable to defend against the mate anyway. Overloaded pieces are found on the board most of the time. The key is to work out when their dual responsibilities are causing problems. • • • • Summary Overloading is the opposite of the double attack. It is when a piece rather than attacking two squares of importance, has a responsibility on two important squares. Overloading is quite a common theme in tactics and we will come across it throughout this book, often in combination with another theme. Often a piece is overloaded without it having any great importance. It is not hard to imagine that a piece is defending several important squares, but the opponent cannot take advantage of it. Overloaded pieces are found on the board most of the time. The key is to work out when their dual responsibilities are causing problems. Chapter ? Mate The following statement may come as a surprise, yet there might be a grain of truth in it: The ultimate aim when playing chess is checkmate. Either you are able to attack the enemy king directly, or you gain a material plus which you will use in the endgame to finish off your opponent's hapless monarch. In order to give mate you should know the standard mating patterns. They will save you time and energy. The reason why professionals find more combinations in less time than amateurs is that they have stored countless patterns in their minds. Whenever they are confronted with one of these patterns they will remember it and instantly know what to do. This is not a question of ingenuity but of learning and experience. After a while you too will be able to retrieve acquired patterns. These mating patterns also function as a yardstick to judge the strategic and tactical implications of a position, or a move, that you are considering. But mating patterns can do more for you. They often function as a starting point for a deeper analysis of a position. As with the tactical motifs, looking beyond the circumstances of the current position helps a lot. Once you have discovered the crucial pattern, it is helpful to mull over a position for a while. The mating pattern might function like the beam of a lighthouse. Suddenly you get an idea of how to navigate your ship in order to reach the desired position. It is always easier to devise a plan when you know where you want to go. And if your operation does not result in mate, then the threat of mate may be enough to give you the necessary tempo to gain a crucial material advantage. So try to keep in mind the apparently strange idea of starting your calculations from a final position (an aim) that anticipates the tactical realization, as the final position already comprises the moves leading to it. No other tactical motif will demonstrate this method as well as the mate, because it is the most clear and final tactic in chess. The mating patterns Mate with the queen The queen is the most powerful piece on the board as it combines the patterns of movement of rook and bishop. Thus the queen is able to control a lot of squares around the king and control of squares is crucial when it comes to giving mate. In the following pos1uon, the queen (aided by her king) has control over six of the eight possible squares the black king could move to. 4 3 2 1

It is not very difficult to recognize this pattern, yet even good players seem to forget it sometimes. Take a look at the game Stern - Maiwald, Germany 1 992:

The influence of the queen on the squares around the king is often underestimated. Consequently, you have to recognize the squares controlled by the queen in order to avoid disaster. Knowing the standard mating patterns will save you time and energy. Whenever you are confronted with one of these patterns you will instantly know what to do.

In the above position the e5-rook ends up diagonally on h8. So ignore the laws of chess for a moment when looking for a profitable target.

But there is one pattern that can be considered to be the classic: The king is pushed in to the corner and the knight has control over two crucial squares: on g8 it is defending the rook and on h7 it cuts off the escape route of the king that the rook cannot control. Post - Flamberg, Mannheim 1 9 1 4, shows how things look in real-life chess.

Black resigned anyway. If he takes the bishop, White simply reloads on f6 and the discovered check of the knight becomes a motif again. Quite often the h3- or h6-squares are cleared by sacrificing another piece (e.g. the queen) . After the defender takes with the pawn he loses control over the critical square and the cavalry rides in with a final charge. Here is an example from Fild - Tenner, USA 1 933, where Black sacs his queen.

For example, 7 .. .E!g8 8.Bxg7t E!xg7 9.E!f8t and mate next move. 1-0 Drawing on mating patterns saves time and energy when it comes to calculating tactics against the enemy king. More importantly, they do not restrict your creativity in the game. Mating patterns are rather like cooking methods, and there is still plenty of scope for the chef to vary the ingredients and seasoning. This is where your creativity comes in. So in our final example we see a slightly different design of mate with bishop and knight. In Alekhine - Fletcher, London (simul) 1 928, one of the greatest chess chefs prepared his own specialty bishop and knight mate:

1 22 Chess Tactics from Scratch Now the defender of the crucial f7-square is taken out of the game.

[diagram]

[diagram]
If you look at the diagram of the initial position for this combination you can see that at the beginning there was the idea that a check on the b 1 -h7 diagonal might be lethal for Black. Now that you had the fundamental idea, it was not too difficult to calculate the rest, especially with the mating pattern in mind. Without recognition of the basic idea and some calculation, you might have been under the impression that the white queen had to simply move away and give up the exchange. Only the mating pattern gave the idea that White can sacrifice the queen. Mate with queen and knight (smothered mate) In the bishop and knight mate we could of course replace the bishop with a queen, as the queen moves diagonally as well. But the queen and knight can also perform a special trick that is especially pleasing: smothered mate. The knight, by discovering a check, gains control over a square a second time. The queen is sacrificed, and the piece that captures the queen takes away the last breathing space of the king, then the knight gives mate. As usual, pictures are faster than words, so the following four diagrams show the four steps towards the final pattern. The fact that this mating pattern is famous does not mean that every chess player will manage to defend against it, and sometimes even a world class player can be caught. Look what happened in Timman - Short, Tilburg 1 990. Mate 1 23

[diagram]
 4 3 2 With the last diagram in mind, let's take a final look at the characteristics of this pattern: • The knight gains the tern po to get to its final square with a discovered check on the king. • A queen or a bishop controls the crucial diagonal. • The queen sacrifice takes away the king's breathing space.

With a bishop on fS it is mate. The only thing you have to do now is to change the initial position to match your dream position. Mate with two knights You may already know that mate with two knights against a lone king can only be achieved when the defending side helps with bad moves. But with chessmen around the king a mate with two knights is not so difficult to accomplish. There are two theoretical possibilities. The first is when the two knights cover four squares in the shape of a box. The second possibility is when they control four squares on one rank or file The first possibility is a rare bird in tournament chess but occasionally it is sighted, as in Amsterdam in 1 902 when Speyer played Couvee.

[diagram]
It is easy to see that if the e5-knight could safely move to g6 it would be mate, because the combined knights control all the king's squares on the back rank. Therefore:

mate. 1-0 Mate with two rooks This mating pattern is rather easy to see, as two parallel lines controlled by two rooks can be mate. Typically this pattern must be used on the edge of the board if there are no other pieces or pawns available to prevent the attacked king from escaping. The benefit of the edge of the board is obvious: there is no need to control a third parallel line, as the king cannot escape to the i-file. The position Speyer vs. Couvee, "Amsterdam 1 902" (previous page), has been assigned to wildly different countries, dates and tournaments in various sources. In this way chess " history" is as open for discussion as " real " history. 1 28 Chess Tactics from Scratch Here is an example from Pillsbury - Maroczy, Paris 1 900:

You may be surprised to find the next example As with the two-bishop pattern, a rook can of in this category and not as an example of a back course be replaced by a queen. But the queen's rank mate. However, it is a brilliant example of Mate 1 29 how to start the calculation with the desired pattern as a focus. In Tarrasch - Walbrodt, Hastings 1 895, Tarrasch started his tactical operation from this position:

In Lehmann - Blau, Switzerland 1 952, it looked as if the white queen was en prise.

Remember the pin? (Black's queen can only move diagonally.) Together with our newly acquired motif it does the trick: the white queen is not needed because if 1 . . .Rxa4 then

2.f!e 1 t will soon result in mate.

The back rank mate This pattern is created by a horizontal check by either rook or queen. Another essential ingredient is the unmoved pawn formation in front of the king. If a pawn has moved the back rank mate will need extra help to cover the escape square. Such an escape square is commonly known as a luft, which is an abbreviation of the German word Luftloch, meaning an air-hole: kings need to breathe! The back rank pattern is not difficult to see. Consequently the recognition of the pattern is not what catches out the defender; it is his misplaced belief in the soundness of his defence of his back rank or the impression that the attacker would not be able to get to the back rank that leads to his downfall. Therefore, as in the case with a queen and king on the same file or diagonal, even the slightest inkling of a back rank mate should be enough to set off alarm bells. 1 30 Chess Tactics from Scratch Here is an example of an overoptimistic player who thought his back rank was sufficiently defended. In Fontein - Euwe, Amsterdam 1 939, White found out that after:

[diagram]

2.hxg3 which leads to a mating pattern that

is very common, although the sequence is reversed. That is, the rook is executing the coup de grace after the knight has taken control over the g l - and g3-squares. Two common mating patterns: If the attacking side has no knights then a bishop on f2 does just as well. The recipe for this mating pattern {let's assume an example of Black mating on the kingside) follows the previously mentioned one, two, three process: 1 . The h-file is opened by a sacrifice.

2. A piece that is able to control gl and g3

occupies the second rank.

3. A rook or queen gives mate on the h-file.

Although this sounds rather simplistic it has worked several times in the past. The sequence was changed in Meo - Giustolisi, Italy 1 959:

[diagram]
Black cannot avoid the mate with two heavy pieces after 1 3.:gh4. The quiet move s.:gfl !, bringing the rook int o the attack, should be easy to understand now. So although Anand missed a chance to deliver this classic Greek Gift sacrifice, it was in a very complicated setting. A lack of defenders for the black king (especia l ly there being no knight on f6) is likely to i nvite the bishop sacrifice on h7. This wil l often happen when the knight has been ousted by a white pawn on e5. In many cases the calculations are not so complicated. In Yates - Marin y Llovet, Hamburg (ol) 1 930, we see a typical invitation for the bishop sacrifice on h7: there are no defenders of Black's castled king. Especially there is no knight on f6, therefore take note of White's advanced and ousting pawn on e5, which makes sacrifices like this more likely.

The black queen blocks the only escape of the king, an important point in understanding this example. With colours reversed we can study this classic mating pattern in Fuetterer - Zinkl, Znaim 1 897.

The final section in this extravaganza of mating patterns is the rook on the seven th rank. Here it is not the pawn gobbling monster that you should fear, but its ability to restrain the king to the back rank and to aid other pieces to give mate. Here is an example by Petrosian who, quite undeservedly, is not remembered for his tactical brilliance. In this game he was playing against Gipslis in Riga 1 95 8, and after his opponent had weakened his king's position the future World Champion struck with precision. If it were not for the f7-pawn, a rook on the seventh would rule over this rank. Without much further ado, Petrosian changed that:

A possible sacrifice of the two bishops against the castled position. Every piece or pawn aiming at the king should be regarded as having the potential to give mate. Place your pieces actively and try to 2) Standard position of the bishop in this control squares around the king. Then mate, pattern. in whatever form, will crown many of your games. Mate Summary The knowledge of mating patterns is a good compass when visualizing a possible attack against the king. However it is equally important to bear in mind the control of the squares around the king, and look for the forces needed without sticking to patterns in a stereotypical way. A detected mating pattern or a possibility of mate should not be taken lightly. The pattern often becomes a reality earlier than the defending player might have calculated. In this case, miscalculations result in mate. Consider leaving flight squares for your king. Of course, weakening the kingside by h3 or . . .h6 is often unnecessary or even downright bad in a castled position. Nevertheless, when the middlegame shows no more danger of an attack, it sometimes is a good idea to lose a tern po to prevent any later accidents on the back rank. Mating attacks and patterns with their strong and clear targets represent a good way of how to think in chess. These strong motifs represent the ideas from which you should start your thinking and calculating process. You should start from a target, an idea, and then find a way to realize it. 1 4 1 Chapter 8 Gain of Tempo/Intermediate Move Napoleon once pointed out that "From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step." In chess, we call this step a tempo. We talk about a gain of tempo if one player moves a piece and the other player has to respond to this particular move and is not free to move another piece at will. It looks as if one player has gained the right to move twice in a row. A gain of tempo, small as it seems, can have drastic consequences as we have seen in previous chapters. Sometimes it is possible to gain the tempo for a second piece and then this piece might start a tactical operation such as a discovered or double attack. In this chapter we will study three different aspects of the gain of tempo. We will examine: 1 . The gain of tempo in general

2. The gain of tempo against the king

3. The intermediate move

1. The gain of tempo in general

Whenever you want to move a piece you should check whether you could gain a tempo with that piece. This sounds a little cumbersome and you may argue that you will waste a lot of time if you do this on every move. On the other hand, looking for a gain of tempo will soon become second nature to you and after a while you will not be thinking about it consciously any more. If you are planning to relocate a piece, there are two points where you can gain a tempo: either the piece gains the tempo on the way to its target square or right on the target square. The following example illustrates this rather nicely. Black can win in various ways, but the simplest is to gain a tempo: Urankar - Radie Germany 1 980

[diagram]
1 ..J�f4t The rook's real target is the f5-pawn, but first Black sets up a gain of tempo. The white king has to move. If White plays 2.@h5 then 2 ...�xf5t gains a tempo. Or if White plays

[diagram]

as Black threatens mate next move. 1 44 Chess Tactics from Scratch We have to keep in mind that on every square we put one of our pieces, we might either gain a tempo with the piece that has been moved or for other pieces of our army. This is exemplified in Hort - Portisch, Madrid 1 973:
[diagram]
 6.

[diagram]

[diagram]
If the queen had moved to h6 directly from f6, the king would still be defending the rook and Black could have played . . . f7-f5, blocking the diagonal of the d3-bishop. But the short stopover on g5 changed the position radically and now mate is inevitable. There are many positions and phases in the game in which you can gain a tempo. Sometimes you feel a desperate need to gain a tempo, in other situations you are surprised by a gain of tempo by your opponent. But if you develop a feeling for the tempo in small tactical operations, you might also be aware of the power of that little extra time when it comes to taking strategic decisions. The next diagram shows a razor-sharp position from a clash between Spassky and Korchnoi,

USSR 1 95 5 .

[diagram]
White urgently needs more time (a gain of tempo) in order to defend against the threat of mate after a rook sac on h3. And he gained this time with an ingenious move:

Now White has only a few spite checks before . . . ttJc2 mate. 0-1 There are many possible motifs we could study in connection with the gain of tempo, but let's stay with cutting the lines of communication and take a look at Zilberstein - Dementiev, Grozny 1 968 .

Evacuating a square in connection with a gain of tempo to enable another piece to occupy this square can be compared to a discovered attack. Simply moving a piece to another square and then replacing it for a winning motif is not very interesting to look at. Things change, though, when the piece that is evacuating a square supports the motif of its successor on this square, as we can see in Radovici - Kolarov, Romania 1 957:

[diagram]
1 ..J �h5!! 2 . .Bxh5 g5 3.cixe8 Rxe8 0-1 The black rook cleared the square for the pawn that will trap the white queen. At the same time the e8-rook was replaced by the black queen and consequently h5 is no longer an option for the white queen. In the next example the black king is in the middle of the board, but it is not time for the endgame yet. In Opocensky - Hromadka, Kosice 1 93 1 , White restricts Black's king and finally gives mate. After seeing the solution, you may argue that breaking up an en passant possibility is a structural change rather than a gain of tempo. I am inclined to agree. Evacuating a square is not a motif in itself but is about winning a tempo for a subsequent motif. The knight will perform the tempo theme here. In this position tempos are gained in order to execute a motif, a mate. Even if I am completely wrong, you will at least enjoy a pretty combination:

[diagram]

The sixth rank is opened for the a6-rook cutting off all the king's backward escape routes.

2.tild.3t

Evacuating the f4-square for the white f-pawn with a tempo while simultaneously eliminating the black e-pawn with its en passant possibility . . .exf3. White will therefore be able to play 3.f4 mate. 1-0 You are already quite familiar with Miles - Martin, Birmingham 1 977 (pages 54 & 95), but the gain of tempo here shows very clearly how tactical operations {motifs) are often introduced with a gain of tempo: Gain of Tempo/Intermediate Move 1 47
[diagram]
1.a4!

The move order can be decisive when we consider the gain of tempo. The next position is similar to Capablanca - Reti, London 1 922, where I placed the black rooks differently for instructive purposes. This is how a gain of tempo influences positional play.

[diagram]
And only now:

2.d5

With 1 .d5 White would have closed the diagonal of the c4-bishop and rendered a discovered attack by the bishop against the black queen and king impossible, failed to gain a tempo for the development of the a l -rook, and would have allowed Black to develop the a8-rook to c8 without the awkward placement of the black queen on b8. The gain of tempo against the king A gain of tempo against the king means giving check so the piece that is giving check can move a second time. Again, it looks as if you are allowed to move twice in a row. In the course of a combination this check can come at any stage. If it is somewhere in the middle of the sequence we call it an intermediate move, and this will be dealt with a little later. With a few rare exceptions, tactical chess is always connected with a gain of tempo, as we want to be able to move again and again without allowing our opponent a moment's peace. Therefore the king is a great target when it comes to planning tactical operations. Here are some things you should remember about the king in connection with the gain of tempo: • The gain of tempo against the king permits putting pieces on squares they could normally only have reached in two moves. This even turns a knight into a long-range piece. • Suddenly you are able to control squares you would not have been able to control without the gain of tempo against the king. • A gain of material and tempo can be combined if we take another piece while giving check. • Sometimes one tempo is enough to escape an otherwise indestructible mating net. • If you promote a pawn with check in an endgame, this one tempo often proves decisive as the other player could be losing a crucial move in a pawn race.

Mag 1 48 Chess Tactics from Scratch Let us take a look at a few examples. Transferring a piece to another square using a check does not need special explanation. But keep this situation in mind when you are analysing your opponent's possibilities. Let's have a simple example of what we are talking about: Nimzowitsch - Capablanca St Petersburg 1 9 1 4

We have seen in the previous example how many tempos can be gained against the king. However, sometimes losing only one tempo is like missing the decisive penalty kick in a football match. And sometimes the tempo gained by a check is the only path to safety, as this adaptation of the game Medina - Sanz, Olot 1 975, shows. In order to keep the beautiful mate while underlining the need to find a saving tempo, I have added the rook on a8 to the original position.

White looks in dire straits. He will only survive if he manages to gain a tempo against the black king. In this example this tempo actually leads to a stunning finish.

Gain of Tempo/Intermediate Move 1 5 1 We know there is symmetry in chess, so it is not only the gain of a ternpo against the king that can lead to the downfall of a proud kingdom, the loss of a tempo can have the same disastrous effect. I do not know where the next position is from, but it is very instructive.

White gained a tempo and Black lost it and with it the game. 1-0 Capablanca, although better known as a strategist rather than a deadly tactician, was superb in deal ing with elementary tactics. A thorough study of Capablanca 's games will teach the reader a great deal about the subjects you wi ll encounter in this book. Obviously you have to protect your king against a gain of tempo by your opponent. If you fail to pay attention to this issue you might ruin the work of a whole, long game within a second.

In this position Capablanca played: I.'iMeS! This wins much more easily than 1 .Rf6 would have. A queen exchange is the only remedy to save the black king from mate. 1 .Re5 prevents 1 . . .Rd6 coming with a check and a tempo, as White blocks the diagonal to his king. Black had to give up another pawn first by playing: 1 ... £6 In order to exchange queens after:

2.'iMxf6 'iMd6t

He resigned two moves later. Capablanca, although better known as a strategist rather than a deadly tactician, was superb in dealing with elementary tactics. Therefore, a thorough study of Capablanca's games will teach the reader a great deal about the subjects you will encounter in this book. In Capablanca's smooth positional style you will also discover why some tactics just don't work against players of his class. Their pieces always work together harmoniously. 1 52 Chess Tactics from Scratch Without "loose ends" (like undeveloped and If, from the first diagram, Black tries another undefended pieces) there is unlikely to be any plan, he will not survive either: tactical misfortune. When it comes to an endgame, a tempo often decides the game. So the result of an 80-move struggle might be decided by the smallest difference in timing. 8 6 4 3 2 1 Grigoriev 1929

Black loses his queen. There are many endgame studies where promoting with check is the key to the solution, and gaining or sometimes losing a tempo (triangulation) is often the clue to "solving in style". When it comes to an endgame, a tempo often decides the ga me. The result of an 80- move struggle might be decided by the smallest difference i n timing. Gain of Tempo/Intermediate Move 1 53 Here is an example of a promotion during a middlegame. The following position from Baseler - H. Mueller, London 1 962, looks rather complicated. But looking beyond the circumstances of the current position will help you to find the solution.

[diagram]
If we could get rid of the f5-bishop and the white king, the pawn would promote. As the pawn would promote with check if the king were somewhere nearby, we could afford to sacrifice heavily to make this happen. And there you have it:

Black also feels free to invest his queen, as he will get a new one.

3.@xg2 fl =YNt 4.@g3 YNxd3t

Black wins. Successful promotion is often connected with the gain of tempo. At times, it even pays to promote the pawn to a humble knight as in Gulko - Grigorian, USSR 1 97 1 :

If 3 . . . ci>h8 4.ttJeg6 mate, so .. . 1-0 The tempos you may gain against the king will help to redeploy your troops freely. A queen might change diagonals using check to gain a tempo. Another common use of the tempo against the king is the situation when the pawns defending the king have been attacked and the king is exposed to the enemy pieces. Sometimes entire pawn chains are pulverized this way as Filipowicz - Ujtelky, Budapest 1 976, shows.

5. A gain of tempo might be the last resort in a

desperate position The intermediate move What exactly is an intermediate move? An intermediate move is a move that is inserted into a seemingly forced sequence of moves. The intermediate move is not the main move of the sequence and it is not the final move that is finishing the sequence. So why bother with it? Because the intermediate move can change the tactical situation on the board: the intermediate move can create a follow-up motif or prevent a follow-up motif, or the intermediate move can guarantee an uninterrupted series of moves. If the intermediate move is a check then it interrupts the opponent's tactical operations, and this is why the intermediate move often comes as a surpnse. The trick is to start a sequence of moves, then insert a move in-between that gains a tempo, so that the initial operation can be finished without losing the initiative. Before we all get lost in definitions, let's take a look at a position and everything will be clearer. A common motif in a series of exchanges is an in-between capture of a piece with tempo before restoring the material balance. This motif plays a role in the following opening analysis of the Sicilian Dragon.

White would have found time (and the e3-square for his rook) to defend against . . . :R:b 1 with :R:e3. But now the b3-bishop is taken with check. The next example is an altered version of Vladimirov - Kharitonov, USSR 1 977, where the bishop on g6 was a pawn in the original example! Again an intermediate move is used to open lines against the king:

So sometimes even world champions can go wrong with intermediate moves, but they definitely consider intermediate moves at all times. So don't forget intermediate moves, and try to make use of them in your games! Vt QD Vi KI L_F| " Gain of Tempo/Intermediate Move Summary Whenever you want to move a piece you should check whether you can gain a tempo with that piece. You can also gain time by stopping your opponent from gaining tempos against your pieces. Tactical operations (motifs) are often introduced with a gain of tempo. A gain of tempo against the king permits putting pieces on squares they could normally only have reached in two moves. This even turns a knight into a long-range piece. It becomes possible to control squares that were out of reach without the gain of tern po against the king. A gain of tempo within a combination helps to create a forcing sequence of moves. An intermediate move allows a combination to start before certain obstacles have been removed and before creating any weaknesses in the opponent's position. 1 59 Chapter 9 The X-ray Attack In an X-ray attack one of the pieces controlling a square is exercising this control indirectly, all the way through an enemy piece. This sounds almost incredible, defying the laws of chess physics, but a look at the next diagram will help explain the concept.

White can play 1 .E!f8t because f8 is already defended by the white queen, although the black queen seems to block this control. This is the important thing to remember with the X-ray attack. Although it does not look like it, effectively the attacking side is controlling the key square more often than the defending side. The enemy piece finds itself sandwiched between two attackers. There are two different types of X-ray attack. The first can only be performed by the long range pieces. In the first type the attacking pieces share a connection, that is, they move in the same direction. This can be achieved by

[diagram]
The next example is also quite spectacular:
[diagram]

[diagram]

[diagram]

Again the attacker is reloading on a square he hits more times than the defender. The value of the reloading piece is not important ("3 points") ; it is its performance that matters. In a way the X - ray attack is a special case of the reloader: one piece is sacrificed on a certain square and the second occupies it after the first has been eliminated. 1 64 Chess Tactics from Scratch As with all other tactical motifs, the X-ray attack can be combined in many ways. For example, pins and interrupting lines of communication as in Tukmakov - Gufeld, USSR 1 972, with Black to move:

[diagram]
1 ... irxd4t! Now 2.�xd4 would be answered by 2 . . .�e l t (X-ray attack) 3.<j;>f2 �fl t. This move is possible because the queen on b5 controls fl . This is why 1 . . .�e 1 t was not winning immediately.

[diagram]

attack is a prelude to mate. So instead the white king has to go to fl and turn itself into the target of a pin by the black queen on the d3-rook: There can be an overlap between an X - ray and a discovered attack. If we have a potential discovered attack, then the attacking piece could be said to have an X - ray influence through the piece that may move away.

The next position shows a similar dilemma for the defender:

Black's queen and rook both have two jobs to do: preventing the mate and defending each other. Now that their line of communication is interrupted, one will be lost. Quite often a piece is burdened with two jobs and not able to undo a l ine interruption by leaving its square. Consequently, this piece 's control over a l ine or diagonal can very easily be cut off. Opening and Closing Lines of Communication 1 7 1 If two lines intersect, occupying the crossing point would mean cutting two lines with one piece. In our scheme the diagonal A-A and the horizontal B-B cross each other on d5.

I.tiJf3! This is not the only path to mate but it is the shortest and by far the most beautiful. The f2-rook was guarding f8, the g2-bishop was watching a8. Whichever piece takes the knight, one of the two crucial squares will be left unguarded and it will be mate next move. On rare occasions this kind of interruption has been seen in tournament chess as well. In Fuchs - Korchnoi, Yerevan 1 965 , the c4- bishop and the line of communication of the d2-rook cross each other on d3.

Sometimes a line of communication is created just to lure a piece away from its initial square. Once it has left this square the line is interrupted again. Sometimes it is possible to interrupt the line of communication on a square that seems well defended by a piece. When the defender has more important tasks to perform it is often unable to reopen the line of communication by itself. Check the complete line of a long-range piece, no matter how many other pieces are temporarily in the way. Whenever you need to restrict your opponent's pieces, closing a line might be a good trick. Chapter 1 1 Status Examination A few preliminary thoughts about status examination Consider the game Borisenkov - Mezenev,

USSR 1 950:

[diagram]
4.E!:h3!

[diagram]
3.@xbl

The status of the king is radically changed as it is now on the first rank. 3 ... fl =Y*ft The f-pawn promotes with check, winning a crucial tempo. This is a good example that understanding all the individual elements of a position does not necessarily mean understanding the whole position. After you have learned about the elements of tactics, you need a method that will enable you to analyse a position as a whole. Otherwise you might arrive at faulty conclusions, as in the initial analysis of the position above. This method has to be easy to understand and it also has to be easily applicable. Above all, the method should not turn into a tyrant. If it required you to go through every step every time it was your move, you would not use it. If you tried, you would lose on time. On the other hand it makes sense to have some kind of checklist, in the same way pilots do. You cannot take back moves on the board. Decisions are final in chess. It is a bit like flying a plane where every mistake could be the last. Nevertheless, there must be a safe way for pilots as every day thousands of planes fly around our globe, landing safely at their destinations. The status examination provides you with similar checklists. Advanced players might not need any of these checklists. Nevertheless, they will still benefit from reading through this chapter, as some of the points made will deepen their understanding of tactics. Initially weaker players will benefit from these checklists as they help them to become aware of and avoid blunders and oversights. But they should abandon checklists whenever they feel they have become useless routines. The points dealt with in this chapter will hopefully turn you into a high-flying chess player instead of an accident-prone wood- pusher. . Status Examination The status examination does exactly what its name says: it takes a close look at the status of each piece on the board. Principally, you have to look at two things with each piece. First, you have to find out its current status: whether it is attacked, defended, hanging, pinned, etc. Then you have to see this piece as an element of a picture, which is related to other elements. Ask yourself how the status of this piece changes the status of other pieces. If you find out, for example, that a knight is pinned against your king, the status of the knight is absolutely pinned. The king cannot be exposed to an attack. Consequently, the status of all other pieces that were formerly defended by the knight is affected. If they were only defended by this knight, they are now en prise if they are attacked. Status Examination 1 79 The basics of the status examination Im partial stocktaking is what the status examination is about. Neither ideas about the original tactical value and dynamic potential of a piece, nor any premature strategic conclusions about a position, should stop you from going through the basic status examination. Assessing the pieces' status dispassionately before you move is necessary. You should do it for the situation before and after the move as a change of position by one piece might alter the whole situation. And here Orwell does not apply: all pieces are equally important. Do not be fooled by jumping to any instant conclusions. For exam pie, looking at the board, you discover you could win a pawn but your opponent would get some strategic compensation for it. Without further ado you calculate the operation and execute it; after all, you do not want to end up in time trouble. Yet continuing the status examination of the position, you might have noticed the possibility for an even more profitable continuation. So before you move you should look at the following: 1 . What is the status of each piece? (Is it defended, does it have duties to perform, restricted movement, etc.) What is the new status of the piece if moved to its new square? Does it have a retreating square and, equally importantly, how has it changed the status of all other pieces connected with it?

2. Which squares can be occupied? Here

you have to check for direct occupation and indirect occupation. Remember, sometimes a square only seems to be defended.

3. Are there further connections of pieces and

squares in more complex positions? The status examination is not about restraining intuition. The status examination is a safety device for your intuition. Let's start with a simple example. Take a look at a position arising after:

Petrosian played 1. tLl g5??. This shows that even the greatest players sometimes need to run a systematic basic check-up before they make a move. Perhaps Petrosian was so preoccupied with positional questions that he forgot about the basics. And if you can learn something from a world champion here, it is that relying on a rough estimate will give you a rough ride. You should start your analysis of each piece by looking at its current situation. When you are clear about the status you can go deeper into the position. Loboda - Pankevich

Furthermore, you will notice that it shares a diagonal with the black king and of course you remember that two pieces in a row constitutes the precondition for a pin. Just this information would have been enough to start you looking for a possible combination to exploit the results of the status examination of the c5-rook. Start your analysis of a position by looking at the status of each p iece. When you are clear about the status you can go deeper into the position.

Black would collect an undeserved point) . There is no doubt that the duties certain pieces have to perform are important for the status examination and possible combinations based on it. Here are some useful questions to ask when it comes to this subject: Is it possible to place another duty on the shoulders of a piece that is already occupied with other important matters? 1 82 Chess Tactics from Scratch In Ratner - Podgorny, Moscow 1 946, White asked himself this question and came up with the following answer:
[diagram]

[diagram]
The status examination of this position should deliver the following results: • The black queen has to defend the f6- knight. If Black loses the knight, he will be mated. • The f6-knight is blocking White's path to the g7-bishop and thus preventing mate. • The g7-bishop is pinned by the white queen against the king and cannot recapture on f6 as long as it is still pinned. • The d7-pawn is undefended as all its defenders are occupied with other important duties. The d7-pawn is attacked by the d I -rook. Taking a look at the list, you will easily see that White can snatch the d7-pawn with

After the text move Black cannot take the rook with his bishop or the knight, as this would interrupt the line of communication between the queen and the f7-square. But if the queen takes the rook then 2.Rxd5t leads to mate. If you look even more deeply into a defending piece's position you could also analyse the tactical motifs for other pieces if they took the defender on that square.

[diagram]
The white queen defending the f7-rook was attacked and had to move to a square where she still defends the rook. There she ran into a pin against the c2-rook. Black is winning. Hence, if you are attacked, examine carefully the flight squares of your defending pieces as well. Consider flight squares as being of the same importance as initial squares. Ifyou see a piece performing a duty you should analyse the status of that piece carefully. Every defender is a possible tactical target. You have to take a close look at the changes of the position of any defender after each move. Another useful consideration is what happens if the defender has to recapture after the piece it was defending is captured? If you see a piece performing a duty you should analyse the status of that piece careful ly. Every defender is a possible tactica l target. 1 84 Chess Tactics from Scratch Balashov - Spragg ett The status examination of the e3-bishop revealed the motif of a pin against the king so Taxco lnterzonal 1 985 the motif would naturally apply for the queen

as well. Accordingly, a square or a defended piece must always be analysed together with the defender. Here are a few more examples of what can be discovered by taking a closer look at your pieces.

Looking down the g-file may have started devious ideas in White's mind:

1-0 The status examination for the c8-rook shows that it is bound to the defence of the black queen. Unfortunately, the poor rook also has to keep an eye on g8 as the following status examination for other pieces and squares reveals. The status examination for the g7 - square will tell you that it is a possible mating square for the white queen. Thus the king on g8 would run into a deadly tempo by Rg3t. You would also have discovered this if you had started your status examination with the position of the black king, especially as you already know that not only the king's position but also the squares around him are of crucial importance (in this example: the possibility of gaining a tempo on g8) . A simple method to find neat tactics is to count how many times a point is attacked and how many times it is defended .. .

Probably White only considered a queen capture on h3. The real problem here is that White is facing an eventual mate on g2.

White resigned. Black's simple plan is . . . !!g6 and there is no reasonable way to stop it. 4- 1 86 Chess Tactics from Scratch One important feature of the status examination is to consider the both the value of a piece (say, a valuable rook or a mere pawn) and also its method of moving. Whereas moving backwards might be an important option for a rook, it is, of course, never an option for a pawn. The value of a piece also has consequences when, for example, it comes to a status examination of the king's position. So let's take a closer look at each piece in turn. The pawn Apart from the en passant rule, the status examination for the pawn is no different from other pieces. Yet the relatively low value of the pawn compared to the other pieces is of crucial importance in the event of a double attack. A pawn's fork always hurts. A key characteristic is the pawn's lust for expansion, as Nimzowitsch once called its desire to make it to the back rank, dreaming of promotion. The possibility of promoting should always be part of a pawn's status examination, and not only when it has reached the seventh rank as in Lobigas - Micheli, Skopje (ol) 1 972.

[diagram]
You may pity the g7-pawn. Undefended and desolate, it is opposing the enemy king. So far Black has missed three opportunities to eliminate the offending peasant. He will not get a fourth:

[diagram]
Black resigned because of 1 . . .gxh5 2.ih?t. So when you look at the status of advanced pawns always keep in mind the possibility of their promotion. The knight As we have already seen in the chapter on the double attack, the knight is a born double attacker. When you do a status examination for a knight, look for possible tactical bases and tactical targets in your own and your opponent's camp. And remember: with an extra tempo knights can suddenly turn into long-range pieces. Another knight speciality is the check it gives. You cannot put a piece in between, so after a knight check the king must move if the knight cannot be captured. If you combine all these simple facts about a knight, you may find something inspired in the following position: Ligterink - Pachman Amsterdam 1 994

1.gxc7t! gxc7 2.Bxb6

This is a little combination based on the motif of the pin. If Black invested a tempo in defending the knight, the bishop would simply take the knight and the pawns would become unstoppable. Euwe said that when

1 88 Chess Tactics from Scratch two connected pawns have no more than four moves combined for both to reach the back rank, a rook cannot stop them. This would be precisely the situation here. So if Black had tried: 2 • • • gc8 3 . .Bxd8 �xd8 4.b6 The pawns are too strong for the rook. The queen and the rooks The queen is the most powerful long-range piece, followed by the rooks. The high value of these pieces often turns them into targets for all kinds of tactical operations. Therefore you should always have an escape route open for the queen and rooks if things become too hot to handle. A boxed-in queen or rook very quickly becomes a target of lethal tactics.
[diagram]
 Morphy - de Riviere Paris (match) 1 863 A status examination for the black queen shows that she is immobile. If she could be attacked from the g5-square by the f3-knight she would be lost. Therefore Morphy simply played: 1 . .Bxh6! The king The king is the most valuable piece on the board. Consequently your status examination for the king has to be flawless. However, the precision you will learn in doing the status examination for the king will also help you to become more precise for other pieces. As we have seen throughout the book, the king is the Number One tactical target. We have also seen that not only the king's current square is important but also the squares around the king. These are: 1 . Flight squares for the king

2. Squares next to the king

1. The flight squares

Start with simple check-ups. For the king, the simplest question to ask is which squares he could move to and whether these possible flight squares could be controlled. After all, this is what the game is about: controlling all the squares the king could possibly move to and then attacking him. As most arbiters know, mate ends the game. Looking for possible mating patterns is a good remedy against being caught by surprise. Luczynowicz - Szymanski Poland 1 953

The idea that pops up when making the status examination of the white king is using a beautiful rook journey with e3-e5-h5-h3. In this box many squares are already under Black's control. After

2.Rxf6 we would have the following skeleton

position:

[diagram]

[diagram]
White has sacrificed a pawn in order to take away squares from the king and so weave a mating net.

[diagram]
Rescuing the black bishop would spell mate after Bf3-e4. Notice how the a-pawn, far away from Black's king, was used in this manoeuvre. This should be a reminder that you have to analyse every piece, the whole board, before you embark on such an important operation as a mating attack. In reduced positions like this you have to exploit every resource at your command, otherwise your attack might not succeed. Strangely enough, sometimes the inability to move is the only chance of surviving an attack. Stalemate may be your opponent's last resort, and there is nothing more annoying than dropping half a point because you did not anticipate it. Consequently, stalemate has to be one of the items on the checklist when you are doing the status examination for the king, especially during the endgame. So if your status examination renders the result that the enemy king has no flight square it could be stalemate time. A classic example is Post - Nimzowitsch, Barmen 1 905.

[diagram]

[diagram]
1.figSt! Qxg5 stalemate

Besides getting rid of the last mobile piece, the sacrifice closed the final flight square on h4. In other cases, creating the stalemate involves pure tactics and the knowledge of how many squares a piece is able to control. Titenko - Murey

USSR 1 963

[diagram]
1. •• Y:Ycl t A double attack on king and queen. The new position of the white queen on c l creates an instant stalemate as the queen, moving vertically, horizontally and diagonally takes away all the flight squares of the black king. All these examples show that the player who is about to lose the endgame has one last option: stalemate. Therefore you should always look for this configuration. There is a little trick to see the stalemate more easily. Ask yourself which piece on which square would take away the final flight squares. And, with regard to the last example, remember that elementary tactics might even be employed on the last move of the game. Just like the opera, it is not over until the fat lady sings. 1 96 Chess Tactics from Scratch As we have already seen with the elementary tactical motifs, it helps to envision a specific target position. In Nismeev - Boltobekov, Correspondence 1 977, after Black found the initial idea (the black king has no squares with a white queen on g6), he also found a way to get rid of his remaining pieces:

[diagram]
l .. . '3xg6t 2.Y:Yxg6 ciflt 3.@xfl Y:Yxf4t Black draws with either perpetual check or stalemate. The following example shows that sometimes you have to try hard a little harder to force the stalemate. Pietzsch - Fuchs West Germany 1 963

2. The squares next to the king

The squares next to the king are all squares that allow a direct or indirect tactical impact on the king's position. All files, ranks, and diagonals in to the king's position have to be examined carefully. Squares and lines with possible checks have to be analysed for their tactical implications and simultaneously be seen in possible relation to other parts of the board. Does that sound complicated? A simple case is to follow the consequences of a check. Often it pays to see where a check will lead. Block - Felderhof Amsterdam 1 9 1 2

I.est The first check is easy to see, but the audacious pawn is using the fact that the square it has just occupied is rather unhealthy for both king and queen because of the nasty pins the bishop threatens (from d4 or the "new" check on g3) due to the diagonal configuration of king and queen.

The black king is certainly able to stop the pawn, however ...

[diagram]
The squares next to the king are all squares that allow a direct or indirect tactical impact on the king's position. As we have seen with many elementary tactical motifs, it is sometimes possible to force the king to another square where the motif could then be used. In the case of a double attack, for example, the king often served as a tactical target to win material. But if a mate is possible on one of the squares next to the king, the game could be over very quickly. Sometimes you should check how the king's status would be on his neighbouring squares, too! Status Examination 20 1

The crosses mark the squares that are under fire by the white pieces. If the black king were on c5 , a diagonal check (on the gl -a7 diagonal) would be terminal, thus White can simply play:

When a square next to the king is occupied by a piece you still have to do a status examination for this square, as the king might have to retake on this square if the piece is captured.

You can conclude from this example that every piece defended by the king is a possible target for a sacrifice to lure the king to that square. Rules of thumb like this make it possible for you to research the tactical potential of every king position in a systematic manner. Therefore, tactics (unless strategically motivated) are not strokes of genius and can be learned (as can the judgement needed for most strategic sacrifices by the thorough study of the elements of positional chess) . If you take a look at the squares next to the king in Vanka - Skoda, Prague 1 940:

Now the black queen has to find a safe square but wherever she turns 2.W'xf6t and

3.Bb2 will be fatal.

Of course you should look not only at the squares next to your opponent's king but also around your own .. . Pay attention to any piece that is within the horizon of its king.

The king may not be the fastest piece on the board but here it was certainly fast enough. If a piece runs out of retreat squares and is inadequately defended, it will be in trouble if attacked. In Chapter 1 Becoming Familiar with the Pieces we talked about restricting a piece. There we had a poor knight placed at the edge of the board having no squares to go to because these were controlled by a bishop. This also happened in one of my games:

204 Chess Tactics from Scratch

[diagram]

[diagram]
The knight has no retreat squares as the escape route tf:Jc7-a8-b6 is controlled by Black's a-pawn. The black king will attack the knight and so White had to resign a well-played game just because he did not check the status on its new square of his only remaining piece .. . Advancing a3-a4 would save the knight but not the game, because Black will soon be a pawn up in the ensuing pawn ending. Together with the status examination, you should not only take a close look at the piece's current square, but also examine the other squares to which it may have to move. If the defender has to recapture on the square of a piece it was defending, you need to examine this square in advance. If you think you can do without, you may end up like Black in Blau - Donner, Switzerland 1 958.

Usually you will see in a split second whether it is worth putting the effort into more detailed research of a square. Only then will you need to continue with the complete status examination for the move. The occupation of squares This part of the chapter is not about finding the important squares you want to occupy. It is about whether you can move to a certain square and under which circumstances. You can move to a square directly if you have more control over it or the value of the piece occupying it does not matter. Psakhis - Agzamov

The analysis of complex positions Bringing together the results of the status of each piece is the starting point for combinations. Consequently a combination is always the result of elements that can be discovered by a status examination. There might be only one result of a status examination for each piece but many different ways to combine these results. Status Examination 2 1 1 Looking at the single elements of each position, we are able to unearth combinations we might not have seen otherwise. Another important ability is to envision a position beyond the tangible tactical realities. In a dream you can achieve anything. So why not imagine a position you would like to have, even if it looks impossible to reach at the moment. We have already seen a similar approach when dealing with mating patterns. Discovering the weaknesses of your opponent's pieces and position can still create an image that will give you a target for your plans and calculations. Consider the following position:
[diagram]
 Petrosian - lvkov USSR-Yugoslavia 1 979

[diagram]
Petrosian played:

[diagram]

Recognizing the main motif is not very difficult when you take a look at this position (the black king's position, and the e l -rook's possibility of controlling squares around the king) . Potential elements are part of the analysis of the position above. You have to ask yourself, what would happen if a rook landed on e5. At the moment this move is impossible, or at least ridiculous. Imagining the rook on e5 you will eventually find the solution for the position:

[diagram]
If the knight were defended, it would be mate already. This should have been the starting point of the combination. Now we discover that if Black took the knight the king would run into White's pawn formation with either f3 or h3 mate. Therefore, in the initial position you just have to get rid of the bishop protecting e5. Sometimes it may even be helpful to imagine illegal or impossible moves when you dream of a position, if you can make use of it afterwards back in chess reality. A status examination can be the first step on the way to changing the current position to your dream image. Another step is combining the elements you have learned about in this book. On a basic level you have to see the possible collaboration of two pieces in a rook and bishop mate, for instance, or the three-piece configuration of a pin. The relation between the pieces and the motif is the decisive step. In a dream you can achieve anything. So why not imagine a position you would like to have, even if it looks impossible to reach at the moment. 2 1 2 Chess Tactics from Scratch Erbis - Kempf The rook is undefended and a possible tactical target for a double attack of the white West Germany 1 954 queen on d4. From there it is not difficult to
[diagram]
1-0 Your target idea should be a rook and bishop mate on d8, seeing the file of the dl -rook all the way through to the end. The d7-bishop is blocking the way to that deadly dB-square. Only from the c6-square can the f3-bishop force the d7-bishop to move. A look at the c6-square shows that it is defended twice by Black. The status of these two pieces reveals that neither can move (the black queen has to defend e7 against mate). Putting it all together gives you the information that 1 .Bc6 is the move in this position. Take a look at Neukirch - Malich, Gera 1 962:

Collecting the basic information for all the pieces and squares around the king does not tell you how to create a position such as the first diagram of this game. But you will be able to understand this combination and maybe one day you will unleash a tactical firework worthy of Tai. In contrast to the endgame, very few middlegame positions require a status examination for every single piece on the board. As always there are exceptions and here is a spectacular one: 2 1 4 Chess Tactics from Scratch Saemisch - Nimzowitsch Copenhagen 1 923

1 ... �xd5! 2.exd5 h6! Attacking the bishop. The first move might be attributed to the attacking instinct ofTal but the second move was surely found by taking a closer look at the elements of the position. The status examination for the g5-bishop after the opening of several (!!) lines of attack (the e-file, the 4th rank for the black queen, and the h8- a l and f5-b l diagonals) shows only two retreat squares for this piece: f4 and e3. The f4-square is not a safe haven as this square is a tactical target of a double attack by the e5- knight if it hops to d3. The e3-square is not any better. After the discovered attack . . . ctJxf3t the bishop becomes the prey of the e8-rook. Status Examination 2 1 5 The status examination for the white queen shows that she is pinned against the king. So the queen no longer controls the e3-square, which is vital knowledge if the bishop moves there. The status examination of the black queen shows that she cannot be taken without losing a tempo for White as the pawn reloads attacking the a3-rook. The status examination for the b3-knight is of crucial importance for this game. A black rook on e3 would pin the knight against the a3-rook and would be difficult to defend, and the a4-knight might be lost as well. So:

[diagram]
This did not come as a real surprise.

[diagram]
White returns the piece, controlling the tactical base d3 of the black e5-knight and consequently the f4-square becomes a retreat for the g5-bishop. White was just slightly worse in the resulting position. Wow! That was a lot of examination and calculation. Fortunately you usually don't have to analyse such difficult positions as Tai because you (unfortunately) don't play like he did (yet!?) . Summary • Understanding all the individual elements of a position does not necessarily mean understanding the whole position. • After you have learned about the elements of tactics, you need a method that will enable you to analyse a position as a whole. The status examination provides such a method. • The status examination takes a close look at the status of each piece on the board. Principally, you have to look at two things with each piece. First, you have to find out its current status: whether it is attacked, defended, hanging, pinned, etc. Then you have to see this piece as an element of a picture, which is related to other elements. Ask yourself how the status of this piece changes the status of other pieces. • Impartial stocktaking is what the status examination is about. • Before you move you should look at the following: 1 . What is the status of each piece? (Is it defended, does it have duties to perform, restricted movement, etc.) What is the new status of the piece if moved to its new square? Does it have a retreating square and, equally importantly, how has it changed the status of all other pieces connected with it?

2. Which squares can be occupied? Here

you have to check for direct occupation and indirect occupation. Remember, sometimes a square only seems to be defended.

3. Are there further connections of pieces

and squares in more complex positions? • The status examination is not about restraining intuition. The status examination is a safety device for your intuition. Chapter 12 Candidate Moves In his classic work Think like a Grandmaster Soviet grandmaster Alexander Kotov explained how he developed from a promising player into a world-class grandmaster by training his calculation. In the process he brought two new concepts into chess terminology, the tree of analysis and the candidate move. His aspiration to have a human being think like a mechanical device has since been discredited many times over, not the least by the editor of the 1 995 Batsford edition, who points out that even computer programs do not religiously calculate one line to the end. Having said that, Kotov was right on the money when he emphasized the importance of organizing your calculation of variations as well as the importance of looking for ideas. Up to this point this book has been focused on what to look for, more than on how to look. No other approach would make sense; there is no reason to learn how to look, if you do not know what to look for. For this reason we shall use this final chapter of the book to discuss calculation and especially the importance of using candidate moves as a technique.

White has very good winning chances in this ending and we could no doubt analyse even further with the electronic tools at our disposal, but no doubt we have already made at least one mistake in the analysis, which would dilute the value of whatever conclusions were reached. Also - this long line has nothing to do with the game! Obviously it springs from the game and is interesting, but the players were never close to reaching this position. To say that these lines are complicated understates it! We have to look ten moves forward before the 5 Candidate Moves 227 position has any kind of clarity (White has the advantage, but how far this reaches is still not clear) . The fact that we can analyse our way to a final conclusion at home is not so relevant when we are sitting at the board and have to calculate the variations in our heads. Mogranzini is an International Master and a gifted tactician, but he had no chance of seeing all these lines in practice. However, he could have made the correct decision, if he had used The Method of Elimination to compare 24 .. . E!:xe2, 24 .. . .Bb5 and his eventual choice 24 .. .bxa2, in which we line up our candidate moves (here just three of them) and then try to eliminate them one by one, to choose between the ones left standing. This would not be by analysing ten moves deep, but by using our ability to look for candidate moves to see what is wrong with our own candidates. Had Mogranzini used this technique, there is no doubt he would have found the right choice, 24 . . . .Bb5!, but instead he took the pawn on a2. 24 ...bxa2?
[diagram]
White to play and win Black was no doubt looking forward to playing . . . .Bb5 and . . . .Bh6, as well as the simple . . . E!:xe2. It is clear that there are many options here for White, just as it is reasonably clear that this could be a deciding moment of the game and that it is therefore justified for him to spend a good deal on time on choosing a good move. Using the idea of candidate moves mechanically, we could get quite a long list:

25.fxe6, 25.f6, 25.ttJf4, 25 .ltJg3, 25 . .Bf3,

25. <i>f2 and so on. Most of these are sensible moves to consider and a quick look at all or most of them certainly makes sense. However, if we do not actually look - and by this I mean spend time looking - we might miss a logical move, as indeed I have deliberately done in drawing up this list. The move itself is innocuous, but the ideas behind it are not obvious unless we spend a bit of time actually looking at what is happening, rather than trying to shoehorn the pieces into fitting our plans. In the game White became excusably confused by the large number of decent-looking moves and went for what appears to be the least logical of all of them.

25.f6?

From the lines we have already calculated, we already know that Black wants to play . . . .Bh6 to activate the bishop. So it does not appear logical for White to provoke Black into playing this move. But you can easily understand White's thinking if you try - and most of us have good reasons for playing the moves we do, only not always the right reasons! In this case White was hoping that the fact that the black king will be under threat of a back rank mate for the rest of the game would matter greatly. But as we shall see, he is giving Black extra activity and thus this dream scenario does not arise. The winning move was to go straight for the a-file with: 25 .E!:al !!

[> Candidate Moves 229 see that White has a strong attack on the black king as well as an extra pawn. And contrary to previous lines, White is not in danger of getting mated, as the black rook is on e2 rather than c2 and cannot check the king. This is obviously really difficult stuff, but using the technique of candidate moves White would have stood a good chance of finding most of this. And note that the most complicated line he needed to see was again only three or four moves long. The difficult thing was to pick the right move to analyse and to do this in a reasonably organized way. Calculating variations is exceptionally difficult and even the best players in the world struggle with this. The thing to remember is that improvement is always possible, but perfection is not. Chess is a draw with perfect play, but it can end in any of three results in a game between two humans. The best we can do is to prepare ourselves for the fight, so we can take advantage of our opponents' mistakes. Let's return to the game.

Both players made plenty of mistakes and oversights and a number of them changed the evaluation from lost to drawn and back again. We are not talking about ten-move variations with swinging swords, but 2-4 move long variations with a minimum of sidelines. b

232 Chess Tactics from Scratch

Still, chess is desperately difficult and we can only feel sympathy for the players as they struggled with the variations and their steadily depleting time. The players' tasks would have been easier if they had trained in the use of candidate moves (we will return to this in the exercise section) . Also useful would have been prophylactic thinking, the method of comparison and the method of elimination. But it does not really make great sense to discuss these elaborate methods of calculation at this point, when the emphasis should be on getting into the habit of looking for ideas, using the technique of candidate moves, before they are analysed one by one. If you read the first edition of this book, I hope you have found this new chapter useful and a valuable addition to your concept of chess tactics. Using this technique will help you in the next section, where you will have the chance to put your new knowledge to the test. Please wait a moment before you rush to test yourself with the tactical exercises. There is one more thing I would like to point out: Tactics will only come about in your games if you activate your pieces! Like cannons in a cellar, your pieces will be tactically useless until they are placed on the firing line. Don't let your troops celebrate at home, send them to the battlefield!

Too tough for this book? White to play and win This book has evolved many times since its original self-published German edition, with minor improvements included for each reprint. It is forgiving for the author that the book is never truly finished, and with this new version it is possible for new (as well as old) readers of this book to benefit from the huge amount of feedback I have received over the years. For example, it is now hard to understand why the first edition did not have arrows next to the diagrams showing who is to move .. . Much of the feedback related to the exercises. In previous editions there were a few at the end of most of the chapters, but in total not very many. Readers often praised the understanding of tactics the text gave them, but were frustrated that they did not have more exercises to test their newfound knowledge. So when I started work on this edition I considered writing a complementary volume of exercises, a workbook if you like. I began selecting relevant positions and quickly decided to focus on recent games (even so, a number of Bent Larsen's best combinations are used - this is meant as a tribute to the ferocious great Dane) . When I was quite far along in the process it suddenly dawned on me that my efforts to assist the reader could be seen as profiteering. Although I had around 400 good test positions (a number that equals some of the other puzzle books available) I was not certain the audience would support my efforts. It was for this reason that I, in agreement with the publisher, decided to make the workbook a part of the new edition. It was not a commercial decision, but hopefully neither the publisher nor I will be punished for increasing the printing and transport costs by making the book 1 28 pages thicker! I also decided to eliminate about a hundred of my collected exercises to make sure I only had appropriate positions with clear solutions. Less is sometimes more. The content The sorting of the positions is based first of all on the corresponding chapter earlier in the book. Look at the headers at the top of the page to see where you are. It did not make sense to create exercise sections for Getting Familiar with the Pieces or Double Attack, as most exercises include double attacks and all of them involve moving the pieces! Instead I created sections on Openings and Endings, to add some colour. I could have written chapters on these subjects, but I had to stop somewhere, and there are whole books in print about tactics in the opening or endgame .. .

Within each section the exercises are organized in increasing level of difficulty. I have used the traditional system of 1 -5 stars, but of course opinions will vary about how difficult each position is ("Five stars? I solved it instantly.") . Suggested working method The set-up in this section is the standard format for exercise books by Quality Chess. The diagrams are on the right-hand page and the solutions are on the next page (safely out of sight!) . For this reason I suggest you solve six exercises at a time. Especially I recommend that you write down your solutions! If nothing is written down it is easy to trick oneself into thinking "Oh yes, I spotted that idea." Improvement comes from having measurable results. If you do not write down your solutions, you are not really measuring the value of your solving. The level of the positions This is not the most difficult exercise book on the market. I selected the positions to fit the audience and build up basic skills. When you have tried to solve all the positions in this book, you should be ready for the many other exercise books that are available. I would naturally recommend the Quality Chess Puzzle Book as the next step, to be loyal to my publisher! I rejected a few positions because they were too difficult, including the one on the previous page. Judge for yourselfl It is from Barbosa - Demianjuk, Moscow 20 1 1 :

PART 3 More Tests and Solutions CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE Basic Tactics CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO Advanced Combinations CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE Professional Combinations CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR Solutions to Tests from Part 1 CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE Solutions to Tests from Part 3 Glossary Index vi 1 99 Acknowledgments Once again, I am much indebted to the many people who labored with me on this effort. Thanks to Michael Franett for supplemental text and finishing touches, and to Eric Woro for eagle-eye proofreading and edi torial suggestions. And, of course, thanks to all the folks at Microsoft and Online Press who saw this book through to completion, particularly Tara Powers-Hausmann, Joyce Cox, LarryPowelson, Dean Holmes, and Eric Stroo. You were all terrific. vii Introduction I n my first book, Play Winning Chess , I discussed the history of chess and introduced the basic rules and strategies of the game. Teaching chess to beginners is an exercise in creativity. The teacher can go about the task in myriad ways. Some teachers might explain the rules and how the pieces move and then use the world's great chess games-especially their own as examples. Others might focus on how to play certain openings or how to checkmate. Though all of these methods may eventually lead to an under standing of the basics, some methods produce Quicker results than others. In Play Winning Chess, I chose the most direct path. I broke down the game of chess into its four elements-force, time, space, and pawn structure and showed how these elements can be combined to produce a number of principles of play-principles I deduced from studying thousands of master games. Understanding the four elements helps you understand the moves of the masters and inspires you to formulate plans of action in your own games. After you've grasped the basics, it's time to go to the next level of chess and explore the world of tactics. Only then can you fully appreciate the beautiful combinations that a mastery of tactics allows you to create. Whereas teaching beginner-level chess takes creativity, teaching tactics is a matter of conveying classical knowledge. The teacher can package this knowledge and spin it out in a variety of ways, but the knowledge is basi cally the same. Winning Chess Tactics won't teach you anything about tactics and combinations that the chess world doesn't already know. However, I've found that accessing this knowledge about these concepts can be anything but easy . Few of the books that teach combinative play explain tactics and combinations in an instructive manner. The rare exceptions tend to be for advanced players, making a study of this subject rather difficult for those ix

WINNING CHESS TACTICS

with less experience. In this book, I divide tactics into themes, which I thoroughly explain and illustrate. Each chapter starts out with a discussion of the basic forms of the theme and progresses to increasingly more complex examples. This teaching technique allows for easy learning at the lower levels but also continues instruction right up to the master class. My goal is to enlighten beginner and tournament player alike! Teaching for such a range of player strength has its drawbacks. For example, I don't stop to explain every chess term that I need to use, and as a result beginners will have it a little tougher here than in the first book. I expect you to have some basic chess knowledge. In particular, you should know the following: • How the pieces move • The rules of the game • How to read and write algebraic chess notation • How to count the force (the value of the pieces) • Basic chess terminology • The four elements of chess and their associated principles, as expounded in Play Winning Chess For lower-level players who might stumble over the chess terms in this book, I've provided a glossary. My advice is to avoid skipping over terms that you are unfamiliar with. Look them up. Take the time to understand each term, and you'll be able to take this book in stride. A word about terminology of a different sort: Things haven't changed much in the chess world since I wrote Play Winning Chess a year ago. Chess players come in all colors. shapes, and sizes, but they are still overwhehn ingly male. In this book, I'll continue to refer to chess players as he. Hopefully, the situation will someday be different. I strongly recommend a detailed study of the material in these pages for any aspiring chess player. After all, as nice as it is to admire the artistic combinations that the great chess players have given us, it's much more Introduction satisfying to create them ourselves! And I hope this book will be the tool that allows you this satisfaction. While you are studying tactics and combinations, you might find your self spending long hours alone, huddled over your chessboard. As soon as you're ready, I advise you to get out and test your skills against those of other chess enthusiasts. Though reading this book will not guarantee that you'll win, it might start you on your way to a championship. The sport of chess is remarkably well organized; in fact, very few sports have such a large international network of players. Local clubs, states, and national federations organize club championships, state championships, and national championships. A scoring system of 1 point for a victory, \12 pointfor a draw, and 0 points for a loss allows contestants to gradually attain Master, International Master and Grandmaster status. The 146 national federations, including the us Chess Federation, all belong to the Federation Internationale des Echecs (FIDE), which organizes the World Champion ships. The World Championships are contested for millions of dollars; in fact, the prize fund for the 1993 World Championship match is $4 million! So join your local club, enter and win tournaments, and who knows, you might manage to bag yourself a championship. Happy hunting! xi Yasser Seirawan Seattle, Washington

PART 1

Tactics and Combinations This part is the meat of the book. After defining tactics and combinations, I break them down into themes thatI explain briefly before offering examples that illustrate the "how to" and "why." Most of these examples are fairly basic, but occasionally I throw in something more difficult to show how the simplest tactic can be combined with another and yet another to produce something mind-boggling_ If an example is not clear to you, go over it many times. If you continue to draw a blank, go over the section again and again and again until your raw, paper-cutfingers can't turn another page, your bloodshot eyes see only the hazy outlines of chess boards, and you begin to wish you had never taken up the sport of chess! (Hmmm. . _ Perhaps I should get out of the chess business and start a new career as a drill sergeant!)

CHAPTER ONE

Definitions I jknow, definitions are boring. You'd probably just as soon skip them and ump right into a few juicy games. Be patient. Well get to the games and some of them are beauties-soo n enough. But before we delve into the world of tactics and combinations, we should begin by defining them. For some strange reason, these terms see m to cause confusion. Just what are tactics and combinations? Surprisingly, coming up with a satisfactory definition of these commonly used chess terms is more difficult than one might suppose. Tactics Chess is a game of strategy where two people pit their wits by mobilizing their pieces and developing plans based on such elements as force (the numerical value of the various pieces), time (the efficiency with which the pieces are developed), space (the territory controlled by each player), and pawn structure. Good players like to pick a strategy and follow it to its logical conclusion. Unfortunately, they're often thwarted by a strange randomizing factor known as tactics. Tactics can both support your own strategy and destroyyour opponent's strategy. They take the wind out of general strategic plans because they have the power to completely and advantageously change any situation. Thus, we arrive at this definition of tactics: Tactics are maneuvers that fLlke ailvanflJge if short-term opportunities. 3 PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations For example, suppose your neighbor has invited you for dinner and an evening of chess. You've enjoyed a scrumptious banquet, and the game has been laced with heady amounts of port. Your neighbor must now face your guillotine. Under no circumstances do you want to lose. Your strategy is to control the center and prepare an inexorable Kingside assault. Who can argue with the principle of such an approach? However, in the middle of the plan, your opponent engineers a Knight fork that picks up one of your Rooks. You're busted, and your game falls apart. A brilliant strategy wrecked by a simple Knight fork. Where did you make your mistake? You are the victim of a tactic. Clearly, you have lots to learn. Conversely, you can use tactics to your advantage. They can act as an early warning system that prevents your opponent from intruding on your plans with tricks of his own. As you work through the lessons in this book, you willcome to realize that tactics are actually the guard dogs of strategy. By staying on top of the tactical possibilities, you willbe able to defend yourself against your opponent's tactical forays and force him to follow the strategic path you want him to tread. Combinations In the classical chess literature, there has been tremendous disagreement as to the true meaning of the term combination. Surely the World Champion Emanuel Lasker (he enjoyed a 27-year reign-()ne of the longest in history) should know what a combination is! Let's take a look at his thoughts on the subject: In the rare instances in which the player can detect a variation, or set of variations. which leads to a desirable issue by force, the totality of these variations and their logical connections. their structure. are called a combination. Lasker's definition has several problems. however. First, his style is ponder ous and does not promote an easy understanding of the term. Second. he 4 CHAPTER ONE: Definitions considers combinations to be rare occurrences, which is not at allthe case. Combinations of some sort can be found in the majority of master games, sometimes in the moves actually played and often in the variations hidden behind those moves. Third, Lasker fails to mention that all combinations include a sacrifice. Fourth and perhaps most important, he claims that combinations necessarily lead to a "desirable issue by force," leaving out any possibility that a combination could fail and lead to the loss of the game. What about a situation in which you have a clear advantage, try a beautiful combinative idea, and after a perfect defense from your opponent. you find your advantage devalued to plain equality? Is an unsound combination no longer a combination simply because it is flawed? Certainly not! This tendency to ignore the possibility of incorrect combinations also mars this otherwise excellent definition offered by former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik: A combination is a forced maneuver or maneuvers combined with a sacri fice as a result of which the active side gains an objective advantage. Note Botvinnik's use of the word sacrifice. He is saying that the marriage of a forcing series of moves with a sacrifice makes a combination. This definition is easy to read and understand but falls short of the mark because of the final few words, "gains an objective advantage." Building on the efforts of these great men, I offer this simple definition: A combination is a sacrifice combined with aforced sequence of moves, which exploits SPecific peculiarities of the position in the hope of attaining a certain goa/. So we have managed to define the beast, but does this definition make it easier for you to recognize a combination? Not at all! To develop a feeling for combinations, we must break them down into types that you can familiarize yourself with. I discuss each type in detail in the chapters that follow. 5 PART 1: Tactics and Combinations Recognizing Tactics and Combinations Two authors, Grandmaster Yuri Averbakh and International Master Jeremy Silman, have written extensively on tactics and combinations. Two books in particular, Averbakh's Tactics for the Advanced Player (Sporverlag Berlin, 1986) and Silman's How to Reassess Your Chess (Davenport: Thinkers' Press, 1986), suggest useful shortcuts that make it easier to recognize situations where tactics and combinations might exist Let's look at some of these authors' theories. Averbakh's Rules of Recognition Averbakh considers that almost all combinations are based in some way on a double attack: If we regard the term "double attack" in a broader sense than has been done up to now by theoreticians, namely not merely as a two-pronged attack but as a combination of attacks and threats, we notice that the double attack in one form or another is the basis of most tactical operations. At first I didn't want to agree with such a simplified view, but the more I thought about it, the more sensible Averbakh's theory sounded.The double attack is tremendously important, and I recommend that you spend a good deal of time going over the examples of double attacks in ChapterTwo. Once you have mastered the material there and have moved on, you will notice that the combinations in later chapters also involve double attacks, which seems to confirm Averbakh's theory. Silman's Rules of Recognition Silman insists that combinations cannot exist without one or more of the following present: • A weakened (or open) King. When a King has poor pawn cover, has no defenders, or is otherwise weak, a combination is prob ably in the works. 6 CHAPTER ONE: Delinitions • A stalemated King. When a King has no legal moves, tactics that produce check also result in checkmate. • Undefended pieces (not pawns). Any unguarded piece is sub ject to destruction by a double attack or fork. • Inadequately guarded pieces. Such a piece appears to be safe, but a sudden double attack can place the piece in jeopardy by adding another attacker. If you notice one or more of these factors on the board, Silman contends that you should look for a combination. However, if none of these factors is present, it is doubtful that a combination will materialize. Well, that's it for the definitions. It wasn't so bad, was it? Now you need to train yourself to spot combinations. How do you do that? Learn the tac tics presented in this book, gain a thorough understanding of the double attack theme, and practice Sihnan's Rules of Recognition. You will then be a very dangerous opponent! 7 CHAPTER Two The Double Attack

double attack, as the name implies, is an attack against two pieces or pawns at the same time. Beginning players quickly learn that a simple attack against a single enemy piece or pawn can easily be countered in a variety of ways. A better alternative is a simultaneous attack against two pieces or pawns, only one of which can be defended by the op ponent This type of attackis the basis for much of the tactical play in chess. Although some experts maintain that a double attack must involve two different pieces, I also consider forks (attacking two pieces or pawns with just one piece or pawn) to be double attacks. In this chapter, we'll take a look at three types of double attack: • Discovered attacks • Forks • Attacks by a pawn The double attack is a tactic. It doesn't qualify as a combination for two reasons: First, a double attack can be one move as opposed to a series of moves; and second, a double attack doesn't necessarily involve a sacrifice. Many other tactical themes involve double attacks; these themes are studied in later chapters. Here, we11look at the double attack in its purest forms. Discovered Attacks A discovered attack is essentially an ambush. Here's a general definition: A Queen, Rook, or Bishop lies in wait so that it can attack when another piece or pawn of its own color moves out of its way. Let's look at some examples. PART 1: Tactics and Combinations DIAGRAM 1. White to play. DIAGRAM 2. White to play. Diagram 1 shows a simple but clear example of a discovered attack. If White moves his Bishop, he will create a discovered attack on the Black Queen with the Rook on el. However, moves like l.Bd3 or l.Bf3 don't accomplish much because Black would sidestep his Queen to safety on d6 or f6. This is where the double attack comes in handy. By playing 1.Ea6!, White creates a discovered attack on Black's Queen and also attacks his Rook on c8, threatening two pieces at once with one move. After you have grasped the principle in an example, it can be instructive to change the position a bit to see how the change affects the result. In Diagram I, how would putting the Black b6·pawn on b7 aff ect the situation? What if the Black Rook were on a8 instead of c8? In Diagram 2, Black has two Knights (6 points) vs. a Rook and a pawn (6 points) and appears to be doing well. Unfortunately, both Knights are undefended. (Remember Silman's Rules of Recognition from Chapter One.) White creates a discovered attack with 1.Ke3!. Suddenly Black's d8-Knight is attacked by White's Rook, and the f3-Knight is threatened by White's King. Black, to his sorrow, is forced to part with a Knight. As in Diagram I, White has the chance in Diagram 3 to initiate a discovered attack on the Black Queen by moving his Bishop out of the way 1 0 CHAPTER Two: The Double Attack of his Rook. Quiet moves like LBe3 or 1.Bc3 don't take advantage of the situation (no double attack!) be cause Black would calmly move his Queen to safety with 1... QeB or

1...QfB. However, White can attack

both the Queen and the Bishop on e7 with the surprising 1.Bg5! (l.Bb4! accomplishes the same thing). Nor mally such a move is impossible be cause the Bishop is hanging to both the h6-pawn and the Bishop on e7, but in this case the discovered attack DIAGRAM 3. While 10 play. on Black's Queen by the Rook makes the Bishop a less attractive tidbit. After 1 .Bg5!, Black has to make a difficult choice. He could move his Queen to safety with l...Qe8, but then the point of 1.Bg5 would be obvious: White would be attacking the Bishop on e7 with both his Queen and his Bishop while Black would be defending his Bishop only once with his Queen. Then, with the simple 2.Bxe7, White would pick up a piece for free (a gain of 3 points). Although most players hate to part with their Queen, a much better move for Black is 1 . .. Bxg5! 2.Rxd8+ Rxd8. True, Black loses his Queen (9points). But in return, he gains a Rook and a Bishop (for a total of Bpoints). He is down only 1 point and can still put up a tough fight. There is another possibility in the position. (Always remember the words of the great Emanuel Lasker: "When you seea good move, look for a beller one!" Sound advice. Inexperienced players have a tendency to make the first move that looks good.) Instead of the strong l.Bg5!, White might also consider 1.Bxh6! This move wins a pawn (I point) because the Bishop is invulnerable due to the discovered attack on Black's Queen. This alterna tive is an example of a pure discovered attack. It is not a double attack because only one Black piece (the Queen) is threatened. 1 1 PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations DtAGRAM 4. White to play. The position in Diagram 4 is identical to that in Diagram 3 with two exceptions: White's Queen sits on f3 instead of e2, and Black's Rook sits on bS instead of as. Is 1.BgS or I.BM still a good move? No! Black is now able to step out of harm's way with l...QfS because 2.Bxe7 Qxe7 leads only to an even trade of pieces. The big difference between this and the previous diagram is a result of the White Queen's position on e2. Previously she joined in the attack against the Bishop on e7. Because I.Bg5 now fails to yield any advantage, White is better off playing either l.Bxh6, which wins a pawn, or the stronger

1.Bf4!, which creates a discovered attack on the Queen and an additional

attack on Black's Rook on bs. After l .Bf4! Qf8 2.Bxb8 Qxb8, White ends up winning an Exchange-a Rook for a Bishop or Knight-for a 2-point advantage. Discovered Checks The most effective type of discovered attack involves checking the enemy King. This type of discovered attack is even stronger if it includes a double attack. Because of the check, the opponent is helpless to prevent the other attacking piece or pawn from devouring its victim. Let's look at a few examples of discovered checks. If we do nothing but count points, the position in Diagram 5 appears to be very good for Black. His Queen (9 points) outguns White's Bishop on a1 (3 points). However, instead of counting points, look carefully at the posi tion. When White attacks the Black Queen with l.Ne4+, Black can't move his Queen to safety because White's move also unleashes a discovered 1 2 CHAPTER TwO: The Double Attack DIAGRAM 5. While 10 play. DIAGRAM 6. While 10 play. attack by the White Bishop against the Black King. This discovered check is Black's doom. He must get out of check with 1. •• KgB, whereupon White calmly eats the Black Queen with 2.Nxd2. White now has an extra piece and a commanding 3-point advantage. Diagram 6 shows another example of a crushing discovered check attack. White plays the kamikaze l.Bh7+!, checking the Black King and uncovering the Rook, which now threatens the Black Queen. Black would dearly love to take the unprotected White Rook with I...Qxdl+, but the rules won't let him leave his King in check. Poor Black is forced to play 1. •. Kxh7, after which 2.Rxd6 picks up the Black Queen and gives White a material advantage. By now you probably realize that it is not a good idea to leave your Queen opposite a Rook, no matter how many pieces are between them! One of the guiding strategic principles of chess is When you are ahead in material, it is a good idea to make even trades. Why? Because as the number of pieces you have on the board decreases, the relative importance of a material advantage-even of only a pawn-increases. 1 3 PART l: Tactics and Combinations i i 1 1 DIAGRAM 7. Black to play. • For example, in Diagram 7, Black is a pawn ahead and would like to ex· change pieces. In his attempt to force an ending without Queens, Black plays L..Nd6. Is this a good move? By attacking White's Rook, Black hopes, after something like

2.Rf4 or 2.Re7, to exchange Queens.

Unfortunately for Black. l...Nd6?? is a blunder! He has forgotten that his Queen is completely undefended. (Remember Silman's Rules of Recog· nition!) With 2.Re8+!, White places his Rook on a hopeless square, but thereby allows the White Queen to uncover an attack on its counterpart on d5. Black must get out of check, but after he captures the offensive Rook with 2 ...Nxe8 or 2 ...Rxe8, White snaps off the Black Queen with 3.Qxd5, for a hefty 3'point material ad· vantage (9 for the Queen vs. 5 for the Rook plus 1 for the extra pawn). Was Black wrong to want to trade pieces? No, but he went about it in an unfortunate way. The correct route is the simple 1. .. Nxe3! because then

2.Qxe3will leave Black with a solid extra pawn. Note that White's discovered

check tactic no longer works. To 2.Re8+??, Black responds with 2 ...Rxe8. l11en 3.Qxd5 fails to 3 ...Nxd5 because the Knight on e3 is protecting Black's Queen. According to an eloquent old friend of mine, the moral of this story is Don't leave your stuff unprotected. It might get chopped off! It's important to note that the seven board positions we've looked at so far are simple illustrations of a tactical theme. Diagrams 6 and 7 also offer us our first glimpses of combinations. In Diagram 7, we saw a sacrifice-

2.Re8+!-that led to a forced response. Black had to get out of check, so

White achieved his goal of capturing the undefended enemy Queen. CHAPTER Two: The Double Attack Double Checks The most powerful type of discovered attack is the double check. This type of check tends to be very strong because it checks the King with two pieces. The King is forced to move, and the enemy anny is thus frozen for at least one move. In Diagram 8, White is a pawn ahead, but appears to be on the verge of defeat because his Rook is pinned by the Black Bishop. After Black captures White's Rook. Black will be the one with the edge in material. White's solution to the pin is LBd6++!-a double check. (Don'tforget that a pinned piece is still able to check!) Black would love to capture the Rook or Bishop, but his King is being attacked by two pieces, and he can't chop off both the offenders at the same time. Black's best reply is L •• KgB. Then 2.Bxc5 breaks the pin and leaves White with an extra piece and pawn. Diagram 9 is a silly but graphic example of a discovered attack turned into a double check. Black is so far ahead in material that one would expect White to give up and do something more enjoyable with his time. However, instead of resigning, White plays LNg6++, and wonder of wonders ... the move produces double check and mate! DIAGRAM 8. White to play. DIAGRAM 9. White to play. PART 1: Tactics and Combinations Now that you understand the basics of discovered attacks and double checks, I'll give you the opportunity to try to figure out some tactics on your own. The first few tests in the next section willbe reasonably easy, but they will get harder. In fact, some of them are very hard. Don't get discouraged if you don't get all the answers! Instead, just relax, do your best, and study the solutions given in Chapter Twenty-Four. Tests TEST 1. It's Black's move. White has given Black the chance to capture his pawn on g2 with l...Rxg2. Is this a trap? Should Black munch the g2-pawn? TEST 2. With material even in a boring endgame, this game seems destined for a draw. But tactics can be used in the most innocent settings. It's White's tum to play. Can he win material? TEST 3. Black's game appears to be fine. He has plenty of space for his army, the Black Bishop is more active than its counterpart, and the Black passed pawn on d4 is solidly defended. It's White's tum to play. How can he tum the tables? If. CHAPTER TwO: The Double Attack TEST 4. It's White's move. His Bishop is pinned if it moves. White's Rook will fall prey to Black's Queen-and his Rook is attacked by the Bishop on f6. As a result, Black is feeling pretty good about himself. It seems that White's best chance is l.Rdl c6 2.Bb3 Qxdl+ 3.Qxdl Rxd1+ 4.Bxdl Bxb2, leaving Black with an extra pawn for the ending. Can you fmd anything better for White? TEST 5. It's White's tum to play. Black's Queen and Rook are putting formidable pressure on the e-file. White must worry about the e3-pawn being swallowed with check and then a Black Knight sinking into the fine e4-square. Can you find the White move that throws these positional con siderations out the window? TEST 6. As I mentioned, tactics and combinations are the foundation of classical chess play. I had to rummage through the dustier parts of my library for this position, which is the conclusion of a study by a gifted chess "composer," A. Troitzky, in 1896! (Studies are compositions that highlight unusual tactical themes.) In this study, White has an extra pawn and is one step away from queening. Un fortunately, his Rook is in the way, and any move by the Rook will allow Black to capture the pawn with ... Rxa7. If White tries 1.Kb6, protecting the pawn and threatening to move the Rook, Black will chase the White King away with l...Rb1+

pieces, the King and the Bishop on el. go after Black's Knight. Black is forced to part with another piece, giving White an advantage in material.

It's White's turn to play. He is tempted to grab the a4-pawn. Is this the best move? TEST 10. White has two things going for him: the possibility of a fork on e7, currently prevented by the Black Rook on c7, and pressure against Black's c6-pawn. Does White have any way to make these advantages bear fruit? TEST 1 1 . It's White's move. Here he has a prob lem similiar to that of the previous test. How would you take advantage of this position?

It's my move and I'm up two pawns, but Black hopes to pick up one of my White Rooks for his Bishop. Fortunately for me, Black's King is very weak and his Bishop on a3 is not defended. How did I take advantage of these two factors? TEST 1 3. Another fond memory from my tourna ment career.

After several more moves, Black resigns. Now that we have seen the pawns in action, we can take a look at their virtues: • You have more of them than of any other piece. • They are "baby Queens." Each has the potential to become a Queen when it reaches the other side of the board. • If you trade a pawn for a piece, you get the better part of the deal. Pawn Forks Armed with this theoretical knowl· edge, let's jump right into some practical examples of pawn forks. In Diagram 26, Black should play l...dxe4 or l...Bb4, but instead he makes a typical beginner's mis· take: 1.. . Bd6?? 2.e5! This pawn fork willwin one of the Black pieces. Amazing, but true: The two mighty Black pieces are helpless against the lowly White pawn! DIAGRAM 26. Black to play. PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations DIAGRAM 27. White to play. DIAGRAM 28. White to play. By creating a pawn fork in Diagram 27, White has two ways of winning material. One method is l.f4!, by which White threatens to play 2.fxe5, thereby winning a pawn and forking two Black pieces. If Black answers with either 1 .. .exf4 or 1 .. .exd4, then 2.eS leads to the desired fork. The other possibility is l .dxeS! BxeS 2.f4, which threatens Black's Bishop. The cleric's only retreat, 2 • • •Bd6. is smashed by 3.eS and another fork. These examples make it clear that pawns are a menace. If you can't completely eradicate the critters, you must respectfully tiptoe around them. Don't make them mad: They obviously bite! Discovered Attacks with Pawns Aside from forking, pawns can also take part in discovered attacks. As shown in Diagram 28, White can create a discovered attack with l .c4. White's Bishop on b2 suddenly threatens Black's Queen, while Black's Bishop on ds is ambushed by the pawn. Black loses material. CHAPTER TwO: The Double Attack Tests TEST 1 7. It's Black's tum to play. Would l...Qg5 be a reasonable move? TEST 1 8. It's White's move. Black's position seems to be secure, but he is actually set up for a knockout punch.

However, the d6-pawn is threatened by Black's Knight on eS. It's White's tum to play. Although White could defend the pawn by playing l.Rcdl, he could instead force a sequence of moves that features the tactics I've shown. Can you find the second solution? Frustration alert! This problem isn't easy!

The Pin

hen you attack a piece that your opponent cannot move without losing a different piece of greater value, you are pinning the first piece. When the piece of greater value is the King, this tactic is called an absolute pin; when it is not the King, the tactic is called a relative pin. Clearly an absolute pin is a far more serious threat than a relative pin because your opponent absolutely cannot move the pinned piece. (Put ting his own King in check is illegal.) 'il1e pin is one of the most common tactics used in chess, so you should study it very carefully. Bear in mind that any piece is vulnerable to a pin, but only a Queen, Bishop, or Rook can do the pinning-a King, Knight, or pawn can only play the victim. Let's look at the absolute pin first. Absolute Pins Pins occur during all phases of the game, but they are most common in the opening. An example of a typical absolute pin in the opening is as follows: l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Ne6 3. Nc3 d6 4.Bb5. The result is shown in Diagram 29. Black's Knight on c6 can't move because White's Bishop would then attack Black's King. Should Black panic at the first sign of such a pin? No, the Knight is we)) protected by the b7-pawn, and its capture by the White Bishop would DIAGRAM 29. Black to play. PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations simply lead to an even trade. Because of this, Black can play 4 ••• a6, asking White what he intends to do with his Bishop. VVhite then has to decide whether to trade pieces with 5.Bxc6+ bxc6 or to retreat with 5.Ba4 and allow Black to break the pin with 5. • •b5. If Black doesn't want to weaken his Queenside pawns, he would be wiser to play 4 ... Bd7 instead. This move gives the Knight an extra defender and simultaneously breaks the pin. Although this particular pin does not prove to be fearsome, an absolute pin can have a powerful impact on many positions. Pins are particularly useful in fixing a piece on a vulnerable square so that it can he won at your leisure. Pins can also prevent a piece from taking part in an offensive or defensive maneuver elsewhere on the board. Diagram 30 picks up the previous example where we left it. White has played the useful move d2-d4. Black has squandered a move with the awful a7-aS and has lost the important a7-a6/b7-b5 pin-breaking possibility. Taking advantage of the situation, White now plays l .d5. The poor Black Knight is unable to run away from the pawn, and White wins a piece. It's that simple. Don't let a pin freeze your pieces on doomed squares. Here's another opening sequence that commonly occurs in the games

CHAPTER FOUR

[diagram]
The Skewer

skewer has bee!] likened to a pin in reverse. With a pin, the attacker's objective is to win the pinned piece or the more valuable piece behind it. With a skewer, the attacker's objective is (0 threaten a valuable piece so that it is forced to move, allowing the capture of a piece behind it. The position in Diagram 39 illustrates two skewers. White's Bishop on ds is skewering Black's Rook and Knight, while White's Rook is skewering Black's King and Rook. (If we were to invert Black's two Queen side pieces and place his Knight on c6 and his Rook on b7, we would have a pin instead of a skewer.) Although Black is a Rook ahead in the starting position. he will finish up on the short end of the material count. First, his priceless King is in check and is forced to move with 1. .. Kg6. White responds with 2.Rxf8, capturing the skewered Rook. But Black's problems aren't over. He is destined to lose even more material because of the other skewer by the Bishop.

Perpetual Check Evans-Reshe\'Sky New York, 1963 Another way for a losing player to save an otherwise hopeless position is to engineer a perpetual check. This situation comes about when one player repeatedly places his enemy's King in check. The King is harassed back and forth and is unable to escape the series of checks. When a sequence of PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations DIAGRAM 50. White to play. DIAGRAM 51. White to play. moves results in the pieces moving back and forth on the same squares and in the exact same positions three times, the game is called a three time repetition of position and is declared a draw. Diagram 50 shows a simple case of a perpetual check. Black threatens to checkmate White with 1...Rb8+ or 1...Rf1+, so White must scramble to save himself. Fortunately, an easy draw is available with 1 .Qg6+ Kh8 2,Qh6+ KgB 3,Qg6+, when the original position is repeated. After three repetitions, either player can claim a draw. Diagram 51 is another common example of a perpetual check. Black is about to execute the enemy King, but White is able to survive by repeatedly checking Black's monarch. By keeping Black busy with checks, White prevents his opponent from lowering the axe elsewhere on the board. A draw by perpetual check results after 1.Rg7 + Kh8 2.Rh7+ Kg8 3.Rhg7 +!.

All chess players love to hunt down the enemy King. But capturing the King isn't easy. Usually the King sprints by castling to the Kingside, where he is protected behind the pawns on f2, g2, and h2. To get at such an entrenched monarch, a player will often sacrifice a piece or two to draw the supposedly safe King out into hostile territory. When the King is floating around in the center without cover, he usually perishes because the enemy pieces can quickly hunt him down. U you sense such a checkmating possibility, throw aside any material concerns. Even if you are many pieces down, a check· mate always ends the struggle in your favor.

up with to create a King hunt? Back Rank Checkmate A back rank checkmate occurs when the King is on the back rank; its pawn shield is in place, preventing it from moving up the board; and it is under attack by the enemy Queen or Rook. When the King has nowhere to run, the check is deadly. The pattern that produces back rank checkmate is one of the most common and most important in chess. Every player at one point or another has fallen victim to a back rank checkmate. The mere threat of CHAPTER FIVE: King Tactics and Combinations DIAGRAM 61. White 10 play. DIAGRAM 62. White to play. it strikes fear into the hearts of experienced players. As a result, moves such as h3 and ...h6 or g'3 and ... g6 are quite common. In chess terms, moves like these are called making luft. (Luft is a German word meaning air.) Giving the King "air" (room to breathe; in other words, an escape square) elimi nates the back rank problem once and for all. Our first example (Diagram 61) shows how to avoid a back rank checkmate by making luft. Black threatens to checkmate White on the back rank with l...Rcl Checkmate or 1...Rel Checkmate. How can White prevent his King's demise? Ifhe plays l.Ral, his Rook will be stuck on the back rank, playing nursemaid to the King. The usual method of dealing with Black's back rank checkmate threat is for White to move one of the pawns that imprison his King, playing either 1.h3 or 1.g3. However, before deciding on this course of action, White must consider what the other Black pieces are doing. Here, l.h3 still allows l...Rcl Checkmate, because Black's Bishop is controlling the h2-square. The correct move is Lg3, which limits the scope of Black's Bishop and gives the King the comfortable g2-square to run to. The simple goal of trapping a cornered King on the back rank is the driving force behind many combinations. Diagram 62 illustrates a common back rank checkmating sequence. Black seems to be defending his back PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations if " 1 1 • : DIAGRAM 63.

2.Rxe8 Checkmate .

In Diagram 63, Black's }(jng is tucked away in a comer, and the back rank is weak. Moreover, Black is woefully behind in development because his Bishop has nowhere safe to go. As good as things look for White, he is unable to finish off his opponent because Black's Queen is keeping White's Rook from playing ReB. White's goal is clear: Make the e8-square available for the Rook, and checkmate will follow. In light of this goal, the suicidal l .Qd6! makes a lot of sense. White offers up his Queen, knowing that if she is taken, the e8-square will no longer be defended. Because 1...Qg8 and l...Qf7 fail to

2.BxQ and l...Qxd6 2.Re8+ leads to checkmate, Black has no choice: He

must throw away his Bishop with l...Bd7 or l...Be6 to keep his back rank safely protected. However, after 1.. .Bd7 2.Qxd7, the loss of the Bishop still leads eventually to a White victory. We have seen that a weak back rank is a serious problem-one to be carefully avoided in your games. Inexperienced players are often so caught up in their plans that they don't take the time to ensure their }(jng's safety. A good rule of thumb is to make some lufi as soon as you see future back rank problems looming. Be especially careful when the center of the board starts to clear and the enemy Rooks have open files. On the other hand, if your opponent seems to be neglecting his back rank. start looking for possibilities that might lead to a back rank checkmate. I've made a couple of changes to the previous position to produce Diagram 64. One big difference is that White's back rank is now weak, but Black doesn't seem to be in any position to take advantage of it. If White thinks he can win with the same moves as in the previous example, then CHAPTER FIVE: King Tactics and Combinations DIAGRAM 64. White to play. DIAGRAM 65. White to play. he's in for a surprise. Play proceeds: l.Qd6 Bd7! 2.Qxd7?? White snaps up the Bishop because he thinks the extra piece will lead to an easy win. To his surprise, he loses his Queen when Black plays 2 ••• Rd8!. Suddenly the roles are reversed! Black is pinning the White Queen to the opposite back rank, and Queen moves, such as 3.Qxb7, allow 3,..Rdl+ followed by checkmate. If, after l.Qd6 Bd7!, White notices the rude trap that Black has set, he might try 2.Qxf8+ Rxf8 3.Re7 in the hopes of getting a good endgame. However, Black can still use a pin and take advantage of White's weak back rank to make life easier for himself with 3 ••• Re8!. Then 4.Rxd7?? ReI is checkmate. Alternatively, 4.Rxe8+ Bxe8 should lead to a draw. By now, you probably have a sense of how tactics can be combined to take advantage of a weak back rank. In the previous example, we saw the effectiveness of a pin combined with a back rank checkmate. Diagram 65 shows how a back rank problem can also make forks and double attacks stronger than usual. Black's Queen is stuck guarding the e8-square, and the normally impossible l.Nc7! is now an excellent move because of possibil ities like l...Qxc7 (or 1...Qxd2) 2.Re8+ Nf8 3.Rxf8 Checkmate. Faced with threats of2.Re8+ and 2.Nxa8, Black resigns the game. Tests PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations TEST 53. It's Black's move.

Deflection

t times, you might find yourself on the brink of victory, except that your opponent clings to life as hard as he can. As often as not, his tough defense is made possible by one hard-working piece that is somehow holding everything together. To break down such a position, you need to chase the defender away from the critical area in the hopes that the defense will then fall apart Preventing the main defending piece from performing its duties usually reduces the opponent's army to chaos. This concept is the basis of the tactic known as deflection. The concept of the overworked piece is, to my mind, virtually the same as the concept of deflection. An overworked piece is one that is asked to do too much: The piece performs double duty, if you will. All you need to do is pull it aside, at which point its duties willbe left undone. Here's an example. In Diagram 66, Black is behind a pawn and, un derstandably, wants to get back his lost material. He plays 1 . •• Qxb2?? and feels pretty satisfied. After all, his Queen is well defended by his Bishop. Unfortunately, Black has placed this Bishop in an overworked position. The Bishop not only has to defend the Queen, but must also block any checks that materialize on the back rank. This double duty leads to immediate disaster after 2.Rd8+, DIAGRAM 66. Black to play. PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations because Black has no choice but to play 2 ..• BfB. Then after 3.Qxb2, his poor Queen is whisked off the board. Until now, I've focused on the thought processes of the attacker. Let's switch for a moment to the point of view of the defender-not as much fun, but we1l get back to the attack soon enough. For now, let's defend. We've seen that undefended pieces make ripe tactical targets, so you know that defending your pieces is important. The best defenders are pawns. They are slow and small, but they make excellent supporters. However, be careful when your pieces have to defend one another; the results can be disastrous. Often, a defending piece can simply be chased away, as Diagram 67 illustrates. Here, material is even, but Black's Knight on b3 is hanging. Black's best move is the retreat l...Nbc5, which allows White to devour an extra pawn with 2. Rxb6. Not thrilled with such a possibility, Black defends the b3-Knight with 1. .. Nec5?? In his efforts to save a pawn, Black ends up losing a piece. White's 2.d4 puts the c5-Knight under attack, and if that Knight moves, the one on b3 falls. In Diagram 68, White has just played Qd3, offering to trade Queens. Black is not averse to this arrangement, but he wants to trade on his own terms. So, instead of the safe l...Qxd3, Black plays l.. . RdB?? This move also appears safe, until you consider that this Rook is the Queen's only DIAGRAM 1>7. Black 10 play. " . • 1 1 1· DIAGRAM 1>6.

The correct defense is l...Kf8, after which 2.Rxh7 or 2.Qxh7 loses to the threatened ... Qxf2+. Instead, Black plays it "safe" with 1.•• Qf7?? and loses the house after 2.Rxh 7 +!, when his King is forced to abandon the defense of his lady. The game continues with 2 ••• Kxh7 3.Qxf7+, and then-horror of hor rors-Black loses everything because his King and Rook are forked! In all of these examples, the defender's mistake was relying on his pieces to defend one another. Of course, pieces are capable of defense, but some times you have to be careful that your defending piece doesn't become the victim of a deflection tactic. So far, we've looked at simple cases of deflection and overworked pieces. But this tactic can occasionally produce very involved, exquisite combina tions. The position in Diagram 70 on the next page is one of the most beautiful examples of an overworked piece and the art of deflection. It is a classic. Black's Rook on e8 is under pressure from White's Rooks, but Black's Queen seems to be holding everything together. Noticing that Black is PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations DIAGRAM 70. Blad< to play. Adams-Torre New Orleans, 1920 suffering from a potential back rank weakness, White then decides to do everything possible to deflect the Black Queen from the defense of the e8-Rook. He attacks the Queen with l.Qg4!, forcing her to flee. Because

produces checkmate, Black plays 1 .. . QbS, which leads to 2.Qc4!!. Once again, White's Queen attacks her Black counterpart, but this time two Black pieces can capture the im pudent White Queen. Black chooses 2 • • . Qd7 because both 2. ..Rxc4 and

2. .. Qxc4 lead to checkmate after

3.Rxe8+. White seems to have gone crazy when he plays 3.Qc7!!, but he's

still trying to pull Black's pieces away from the defense of the eS-Rook. If either Black piece takes White's Queen, then a checkmate on e8 will occur. Play continues with 3...Qb5 4.a4! (more harassment of the poor Black Queen) 4 ...Qxa4 S.Re4! (threatening 6.Qxc8!, when 6. .. Rxc8 7.Rxa4 leaves White with an extra Rook) S ... QbS (5 ... Rxc7 is still impossible due to 6.Rxe8 Checkmate) 6.Qxb7!. Now Black's Queen has nowhere to run to! Because 6. ..Qxb7 7.Rxe8+ leads to checkmate, Black resigns the game. This complicated battle deserves close scrutiny, and I recommend that you play it over several times until you thoroughly understand the ideas and variations. Now for some tests. To solve the problems in this section, take a long, hard look at enemy pieces that are attacked or overworked, and then find a way to make these factors work for you. CHAPTER SIX: Deflection Tests TEST 57. It's White's move. The only defender of the Black Knight is the Bishop on d6. How can White take advantage of this position? TEST 58.

My opponent has sacrificed a piece for a few pawns. His back rank is not defended, and if I can lure his Queen away from the protection of e8, then Qe8 would be check mate. How did I accomplish this goal? TEST 61. White is down the Exchange, but he has a strong attack and it's his turn to play. Notice that any move by the Rook on g8 would allow Qg7 Checkmate, while Black's Queen must protect his f7-pawn or face Nxf7 Checkmate. How can White lure Black's pieces away from their impor tant defensive posts?

CHAPTER SEVEN

Battery on an Open File or Diagonal

s you gain experience, you11learn that open files and diagonals are crucial for Rooks and Bishops if you want them to play an active part in the game. Many players don't realize the advantages of reinforcing control of files and diagonals by doubling the pieces on these open lines. By putting two Rooks on a file or a Queen and a Bishop on a diagonal, you can create situations where the lead piece can make excur sions into enemy territory under the watchful protection of its backup piece. (Because the Queen and the Rooks move in similar ways, it's sometimes even possible to triple on a file, though not on a diagonal.) Doubling on a file or diagonal is known as creating a battery. Batteries are the powerhouse punches of chess, and any opportunity to create one must be carefully cultivated. Playing Down an Open File When both players have pawns on the same file, the file is closed. When no pawns are on a file, the file is open. And when only one player's pawn is on a file, the file is half-open. Open files are the Rook's highways into the opponent's position. In particular, the 7th rank is usually the Rook's stron gest position and is sometimes referred to as the "refreshment rank." A Rook on the 7th rank refreshes itself by munching on enemy pawns while simultaneously eyeing the enemy King. Many authorities go so far as to say that getting a Rook on the 7th rank is worth a pawn sacrifice. Let's look at some examples. PART 1: Tactics and Combinations DIAGRAM 71 . While 10 play. DIAGRAM 72. White 10 play. By playing l .Rd7 in Diagram 71, White forks the h-pawn and b-pawn. He also ties down Black's King on the 8th rank. The difference between the potential activity of the two Rooks is now striking. Always do your best to ensure the activity of your Rooks. Too often, players try to develop their Bishops, Knights, and Queen but do little to bring their Rooks into the battle. As strong as a Rook on the 7th rank is. doubled Rooks on the 7th are even stronger. Often called pigs on the 7th, doubled rooks on the 7th rank attack the enemy pieces with the ferocity of wild boars. Such colorful expressions, whatever their origins, certainly help impress upon us how powerful these Rooks become. In Diagram 72, White plays l.Rd7, and if Black defends his h-pawn with 1 .• • KgS, then 2.Ree7 obliterates him. Here's an example: 2 ...h5 3.Rg7 + Kfs 4.Rxg6. Black loses several pawns. Placing two Rooks on the 7th produces such a strong position that sacrificing a pawn to achieve it is a real bargain. From the position shown in Diagram 73, White plays l.Re7!, to which Black responds Rxf5. (If Black defends with l...Rf7, then 2.Rxf7 Kxf7 3.Rd7+ gives White an active Rook and Black a passive one, leaving Black badly tied up.) Now 2.Rdd7 means Black will lose his Kingside pawns as well as some of his Queen side pawns. CHAPTER SEVEN: Battery on an Open File or Diagonal DIAGRAM 73. While 10 play. DIAGRAM 74. While 10 play. Understanding the importance of the 7th rank makes it easier to appre· ciate the usefulness of an open file. In Diagram 74, Black would be in good shape if he could take the d-file with L.Rds or if he could prevent White from penetrating it with l...Kfs followed by 2 ...Ke7. But unfortunately for Black, it is White's move. By playing I.Rd2, White lays claim to the d-file, and Black is powerless to prevent the charge to the 7th. The position in Diagram 75 is almost identical to that in Diagram 74. The difference is that each side has a second Rook. Now when White goes after the d-file with l.Rd2, Black is able to mount a challenge with

I. • •

RfdS. However, White's ability to double his Rooks and create a battery enables him to dominate the d-file with 2.Radl! Rxd2+ 3.Rxd2. Once again, Black is unable to stop White's inevitable jump to the 7th. The domination of files by dou bling Rooks on them is considered a DIAGRAM 75. While 10 play. PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations strategy rather than a tactic. A Russian children's rhyme goes: It's very practical but just not tactical! However, when you add such batteries to tactics like pins, double attacks, and back rank checkmates, you open up a whole world of combinative possibilities! Diagram 76 shows an example of doubling and tripling on a file com bined with themes of double attack and use of the pin. When White plays l .Bxh7!, Black can try the following defenses: • 1 ... Kxh7, which leads to 2.Qd3+ (a double attack against h7 and d7) 2 • • • Kg8 3.Rxd7. White has won a pawn. • 1 . ..g6, which traps the Bishop (Black hopes to win it later). White then plays 2.Qd2, creating a triple battery on the pinned Knight and ensuring that after Black picks up the trapped Bishop, White will enjoy a one-pawn advantage. • 1 . •• e5 or 1 . •. c5, both of which are met with 2.Rd6 and varia tions similar to those produced by the previous two defenses. An open file is particularly useful if it provides a route to the enemy King's encampment and can be used for a checkmating raid. In Diagram 77, White threatens to end the game with Qh8 or Qh7 Checkmate, knowing DIAGRAM 76. While 10 play. DIAGRAM 77. Black 10 play.

He is willing to give up a lot of material to reach his goal, but a direct move like I.Qh5 (threatening 2.Qxh7 Checkmate) allows l...Be4 (defend ing the h7-pawn) , whereas LQd3 f5 2.gxi6 e.p. (en passant) gxf6 brings Black's Queen to the defense of the h7-pawn. So White plays with the in tention of opening the deadly h-file by sacrificing a Rook: l .Rxh7! Kxh7

2.Qh5+ KgB 3.Rhl (creating a battery on the h-file) 3 • • • f6. Black's third

move is the only way to stop 4.Qh8 Checkmate. Black is hoping for 4.Qh8+ Kf7, which will allow him to run with his King. However, White's next move closes the escape hatch: 4.g6!. Black's entombed King is doomed because

5.QhB Checkmate is inevitable and the King has nowhere to run.

Now try your hand at a few tests. Those that follow all involve Rooks on open files combined with tactics. Tests PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations TEST 62. This position is an example of a discov ered attack made possible by the battery of White's Rooks on the open d-file. It's White's move. How can he best take advantage of the situation? TEST 63. White controls the game because of his iron grip on the d-file. Black can't move either of his Rooks, or he will lose his Knight to Rxd7. Moreover, his Knight is pinned because moving it results in the loss of the dB-Rook. How can White take advantage of this very favorable situation? TEST 64. Black is exerting some unpleasant pres· sure on White's a2-pawn. It's White's tum to play. How can he relieve this pressure? CHAPTER SEVEN: Battery on an Open File or Diagonal TEST 65. This test is quite a bit harder than the others, but its difficulty also makes it the prettiest! White has sacrificed a piece and a pawn to be able to mount an attack along the h·file, but Black has managed to block the attack by placing his Knight on h5. Can White break through? Playing on an Open Diagonal Open diagonals are to Bishops what open files are to Rooks. If you have Bishops on the board, it's important to place them on long, open diagonals so that they can constantly threaten to swoop down on the enemy position. Significantly, in chaturanga, the ancient Indian precursor of chess, Bishops were the equivalent of archers, who were considered to be good protectors and, given a view, fine attackers. Always be on the alert for ways to open up your position in order to give your Bishops more room to operate. Let's look at a few Bishops and the havoc they can wreak. In Diagram 79, Black is up two Exchanges and a pawn, and it's his move. Nevertheless, he is dead in the water. Why? Because the Black King is stalemated, so any check is checkmate. In addition, White's two beautiful Bishops are scoping out their long diagonals. Black's troubles are obvious. White threat· ens to checkmate with Bb2+, and Black is powerless to prevent it. DIAGRAM 79. Black to play. PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations DIAGRAM 80. White to play. DIAGRAM 81 . White to play. The position in Diagram 80 is rather mundane, but it does demonstrate that Bishops are a danger to all enemy pieces if they manage to find good diagonals. Here, White hunts down the poor Black Rook with I.Bf3 Res

2.Bb7, at which point the Rook has no escape and will soon be captured.

Diagram 81 is a classic case of a King being restricted in its movements by a Bishop. Black's King is stalemated. As I discussed in Chapter Five, White must try to find a way to break through because any lasting check will be the last check! In this case, White makes an elegant Queen sacrifice with 1.Qxc6+!, which allows the innocent-looking Bishop on f1 to decisively join the game. After 1...bxc6, 2.Ba6 is checkmate. As strong as a Bishop dominating a diagonal can be, you can often augment its power by placing the Queen on the same diagonal. Such a battery can be as potent as doubling Rooks on a file. In Diagram 82, Black's position looks safe enough, but White is able to win a pawn by doubling on the bl-h7 diagonal via I.Qd3!. White then threatens 2.Qh7 Checkmate. Black is forced to play 1. ..g6. after which

2.Bxh6 picks up the now-undefended h6-pawn.

CHAPTER SEVEN: Battery on an Open File or Diagonal DIAGRAM 82. White to play. DIAGRAM 83. White to play. The position in Diagram 83 allows White to show his power on the al-h8 diagonal with l.Qc3. Black is then powerless to prevent the threats of

2.Qh8 or 2.Qg7 Checkmate. (The f7-pawn can't block with 1...f6 because

it is held in an absolute pin by the Bishop at c4.) Notice how Bishops can be particularly effective when operating on adjacent diagonals. Many of the great combinations of chess history have arisen because Bishops on adjacent diagonals have been trained on the enemy King's position. Tests TEST 66. Black has a material advantage of two Knights vs. a Rook, for a I-point edge. What can White play to show the power of his Bishops? PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations TEST 67. It's Black's move. White threatens to fork Black's Queen and Rook with Nc5. Is

1. .. Bx84 a good defense?

TEST 68. Again, it's Black's move. Is 1... b5, which attacks White's Bishop on c4, a good idea? TEST 69. If you learned your lesson from Dia gram 81, you will be the master of this situation. It's White's tum to play. No quiet moves here. Can you shatter the Black position?

CHAPTER EIGHT

By now, this concept should be perfectly clear: If the result of the game depends on the queening of a pawn, you must do everything pos sible-including sacrificing pieces and other pawns-to accomplish this goal. Diagrnm 85 offers another exam pie. Here, materialis even, but Black's pawn on d3 has more queening po tential than any of its brothers. The plan is clear: Tum this pawn into a Queen or force White to give up a decisive amount of material to stop the promotion. Normally a move like

1...d2 is strong. A White response of 2.Kf2? Rd4, with the double threat of

3 ...Rxd8 and 3 ...dl=Q, wins Black a piece, whereas2.Rdl? Rel+ is even worse for White. A stronger defense is 2.Ba5!. Because White's Bishop now helps control the el-square, 2 ...Rel+ no longer works, and 3.Rdl and 4.Kf2 lead to a draw. To win the position in Diagram 85. Black needs something more ex treme: I...BeI!! fits the bill. This fine move blocks White's Rook and threatens 2. .. d2, 3 ... dl=Q+, and a win. Because 2.Rxcl d2 produces the double threat of 3. ..dxcl=Q and 3 ... Rel+ (another win), White has to play

2.Ba5. leading to 2 ...d2 3.Bxd2 Bxd2. Down a piece and seeing no

prospects, White resigns. In Diagram 86, White desperately wants to queen his h5-pawn, but a direct run with l.h6 fails to 1...f4 2.h7 f5, as Black's Bishop covers the queening SQuare. The advance of Black's f-pawns is what enables Black's Bishop to cover the h8 queening SQuare, so White decides to block these pawns with the suicidal l.Bf4! Black now gives up because 1 .. . Kxf4 2.h6 leads to the creation of a new White Queen. CHAPTER EIGHT: The Power of Pawns DIACRAM 86. While 10 play. Everz-Kiff meyer Germany, 1 964 DlACRAM 87. White 10 play. When a pawn is unopposed on a file and no enemy pawn can impede its advancement by capturing it, then the pawn has achieved the exalted status of a passed pawn. We have seen how important it is to queen your passed pawns before your opponent can queen his. Often, though, your pawns will not be passed, and you will be forced to find ways to get them by the enemy's sentries. Diagram 87 is a classic example of how to sneak a pawn through. Both players have exactly the same set of pawns, and it is hard to imagine either side creating a "passer." However, White can force one of his pawns through using a sequence of moves called a breakthrough combination. White sacri fices two pawns to get one promoted. Here's how he does it 1.g6! hxg6 (1...fxg6 2.M! g x h 6 3.f6 queens the f-pawn) 2.f6!, threatening 3.fxg7. Black is forced to capture with 2 • • •gxf6. White plays 3.h6, ensuring that his newly passed pawn will be queened. Although Black now has con nected passed pawns, they are much slower than White's pawn, which is farther up the board. The breakthrough combination works only if your pawns are closer to queening than your opponent's. (Note that if it were Black's move in PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations Diagram 87, he would be able to dash all White's hopes because l...g6!

2.hxg6 hxg6 creates an impenetrable blockade.) You should commit the

position in Diagram 87 to memory because it occurs often in the games of chess masters. The important breakthrough combination comes in various sacrificial forms. Often a piece will sacrifice itself so that the pawns can get a running start. Let's take a look at a simple illustration. In Diagram 88, White wins by blowing away the Black pawns that are blockading his own pawns with l.Nxf6! gxf6 (if Black doesn't capture the Knight, White plays 2.Nh5 followed by 3.Nxg7) 2.g7, leading to the coronation of the g-pawn. The next example shows the breakthrough combination in a more complicated setting. Diagram 89 is a mixture of the concepts presented in Diagrams 87 and 88. Black's pawn on g3 is the closest one to queening, but at the moment, it is finnly blocked by its White counterpart By sacri ficing a piece, Black sets off a chain reaction: 1 .• •Nxd5+! 2.exd5 e4! (Black threatens to free the g-pawn with 3. ..exf3 4.gxf3 g2 and a queening) DIAGRAM 88. White to play. DIAGRAM 89. Black to play.

Black's King a new bride) 3 .. . exf3 4.Nd2 f2! (a key move; the alternative 4 ...fxg2?? 5.Nf3 is a bad mistake that leaves Black's pawn firmly blocked by the Knight) 5.Kd3 f3! (finally, White's important g2-blocker is de stroyed) 6.gxf3 (if White plays 6.Nx f3, then fl=Q produces an instant Queen) 6 . . .g2. At last, Black's pawns have forced their way through.

CHAPTER EIGHT: The Power of Pawns DIAGRAM 90. While 10 play. DIAGRAM 91 . While 10 play. Stalemate possibilities are sometimes hard to see because the piece that causes the stalemate has not yet been created. When your opponent "allows" you to queen a pawn, double-check that he hasn't set you up for a stalemate. The next example shows a slightly more complicated version of un derpromotion. In Diagram 91, White plays l.f8=Q, but Black's King is then stalemated. To draw, all Black has to do isgive away his Queen: 1...Qel+

ecOy tactics are some of the most satisfying in chess. The idea is simple: If you find yourself wishing that one of your opponent's pieces were on a particular square, you must find a way to force him to move there. To perform this magic, it's often useful to visualize the position you want and then do your best to create it (always bearing in mind that your opponent will not willingly cooperate). If achieving your goal involves a sacrifice, then so be it. Naturally, the sacrifice is the prettiest kind of decoy. However, some other enticement will often do the trick. Diagram 93 shows a simple example of a nonsacrificial decoy. White would love Black's g-pawn to move so that the f6-Bishop is no longer defended. So White plays l.Qf5, threatening checkmate on h7. Black can save his King only with 1 .• • g6, but then White's wish is fulfilled because

CHAPTER TEN

Clearance Sacrifice

magine this situation: You have an opportunity to make a big move-a move that's strong enough to win material or perhaps even check mate. The catch is that one of your own pieces is in the way, and taking the time to move the obstruction to a safe square will give your opponent the chance to mount a defense. The solution to this dilemma is to sacrifice the obstructing piece! Known as a clearance sacrifice, this tactic forces your opponent to take the obstruc ting piece, thereby vacating the square of your dreams and forestalling any defensive measures. How can you force your opponent to capture the piece, even though this action will lead to his doom? The best way is to check your opponent's King with the obstructing piece, which forces a response. The next best way is to capture something with the obstructing piece. If your opponent does not recapture, you will have gained a material advantage. Obviously, a checking move is the most compelling method. An example is shown in Diagram 99, where White is mounting a strong attack down the g-file. If his Rook were not on g7, he could make a brilliant checkmate with Qg7. The problem here is to dump the ob structing Rook and clear the g7 - DIAGRAM 99.

Be cause l.Rg8+?? fails to 1 ...Rxg8 and l.Rxf7 Qxf7 allows Black to defend theg7·square, White must find a more forcing variation. This is where the check comes in. White plays l.Rh7+!. Black must take the Rook but has no time to stop the checkmate- 1 ••.Kxh7 2.Qg7 Checkmate. The next example also involves a checkmating situation, but this time the solution is a bit more complex. In Diagram 100, both Kings are in terrible trouble. Black threatens to checkmate on a2, and defenses like l.Rd2 fail to L...Qxa2+! 2.Rxa2 Rxa2 Checkmate. Clearly White has to get to Black's King first. White notices that if the White Queen were not on f5, he could play the powerful Nf5+. Checks are the only threats that willkeep Black from dropping the axe, so White moves his Queen out of the way with a forcing check: l .Qxg5+!. The f5-square is now vacant, and Black must take the White Queen with 1 ... Nxg5, which leads to 2.Nf5+ Kg6 3.h5 Checkmate. This series of checks prevents Black from making the one move he needed to win the game. Our goal in Diagrams 99 and 100 was checkmate. However, at times the target will be a piece other than the enemy King. In Diagram 101, the Black Queen has few moves. If former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik can play Nc4, he will attack the Queen, cover the b6-square, and unleash his g3-Bishop on the c7-square. In other words, the Black Queen will be trapped! The problem is that the c4-square is occupied by a White Bishop. Bearing in mind what you have just learned about the clearance sacrifice, you'll easily understand the moves ofthis great World Champion: l.Bxf7 +! (vacating the c4-square for White's Knight) 1.•• Rxf7 2.Nc4. Black loses his Queen and eventually loses the game. CHAPTER TEN: Clearance Sacrifice ...1

CHAPTER ELEVEN

[diagram]
X-Rays and Windmills

n this chapter, I cover x-rays and windmills, two tactics that lead to surprise attacks. Both are easy to overlook. The x-ray happens fairly often, so you should study it carefully. The windmill is very rare but very powertul: It can lead to the capture of your opponent's entire army! The X-Ray The x-ray tactic, which has a lot in common with the discovered attack, brings to mind Superman's ability to see through objects. It enables a piece to mount an attack even when other pieces are in the way. It also enables a piece to capture a defended piece or pawn even when the attacking piece itself doesn't seem to be defended. Only Queens, Rooks, and Bishops can perform an x-ray. Diagram 104 shows a simple illustration. White hasjustmoved his pawn to as, attacking the Black Knight. White thinks his pawn is safe be cause his Rook on c5 protects it. However, in this case, safety turns out to be only an illusion. With 1 .• • Rxa5!, the a8-Rook captures the pawn, while Black's Rook on d5 applies an x-ray. (The pawn was actu ally attacked by both Black Rooks, and White's c5-Rook was helpless to stop them.) The x-ray tactic is particularly strong in the presence of aback rank DIAGRAM 104. Black 10 play. 1 1 1 PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations DIAGRAM 105. Black to play. DIAGRAM 106. Black to play. weakness because threats of check or checkmate then add fuel to its [lTe. In Diagram 105, White is aware that his King faces the danger of a back rank checkmate, but because the el- and fl-squares seem well defended, he feels secure. White expects 1...Rxe2 2.Qxe2 to produce an even exchange of material. He fails to perceive that an impending x-ray exists and that the e1-square is attacked not only by Black's Queen but also by his Rook. White's death is swift but sure: 1... Qel +! 2.Rxel Rxe1 + 3.Nfl Rxf1 Checkmate. Here's another example of what happens when a player is not aware of an impending x-ray. In Diagram 106, White thinks his Rooks are well protected and expects Black to play the boring 1 ...Rxd2 2.Rxd2 Rxd2 3.Qxd2. Instead, his universe comes to an end after 1...Qxdl +! 2.Rxdl Rxdl Checkmate. Even if White had prevented the back rank checkmate by moving one of his pawns to h3 or g3 earlier, Black would still use the x-ray tactic because he wins two Rooks for a Queen-a I-point advantage. How could White have avoided this disaster? The wise player considers all the checks and captures at his opponent's disposal, and 1...Qxd1+ is both a check and a capture! 1 1 2 CHAPTER ELEVEN: X-Rays and Windmills So far we have looked at pure x-ray attacks. However, some dis covered attacks are also x-rays, and it is a toss-up whether they should be discussed here or in Chapter Two, where I covered discovered attacks. Diagram 107 is a case in point. At a glance, you can't tell that Black's Bishop on g7 poses a real threat to White's Rook on al. Perhaps the Bishop could x-ray through to the Rook, but using this tactic seems DIAGRAM 107. Black to play. more fantasy than reality because the Bishop's diagonal is blocked by a Knight and the solidly en trenched d4-pawn. Black is not deterred by all this sensible thinking, however. He plays 1 ...Nxe4! 2.dxe4 d3! (a double attack) 3.Bxd3 Bxal . The Black Bishop dines on the White Rook after all! Notice that Black accomplishes his goal in Diagram 107 by using what we call forcing moves. The chief characteristic of these moves is that the opponent's choice of replies is severely limited, which, among other things, makes calculating the likely response much easier. Tests TEST 84. It's Black's move. Are any x-rays hid ing out here? 1 1 3 PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations The Windmill TEST 85. Black plays the brazen I...Nxd3. Can he get away with this move? The windmill, an extremely potent but rare tactic, consists of a discovered check, followed by a normal check, followed by a discovered check, and so forth. It ends only when the attacker gets what he wants out ofthe situation. In Diagram 108, we see how the windmill tactic enables White to win everything. A mixture of checks, discovered checks, and captures leaves Black paralyzed. He is being eaten alive, and there's nothing he can do about it! White begins with l.Rxd7+. (Notice that the Bishop on e5 has discovered an attack on Black's King.) Play continues with I. .. KgB

In this game, Black is the great former World Champion Emanuel Lasker, who held the title for 27 years. If this guy can get caught in a wind mill, then everyone is susceptible! White begins with l.Bf6!, attacking 1 1 4 CHAPTER ELEVEN: X-Rays and Windmills the g7-pawn with both the Bishop and the Rook. Black would nonnally defend with ...Ng6, but l.Bf6 also un covers an attack against Black's Queen by her counterpart on h5. So Black reluctantly plays 1 ... Qxh5. Now White can use the windmill tactic: 2.Rxg7+ KhS 3.Rxf7+ KgS

Sometimes it's useful to mentally insert forcing moves into each possible slot in a series to see which one is most effective. Note that l.e4+? would not have worked for White because Black can play l...Ke5! 2.a6 Bh7 3.a7 Bxe4, and the Bishop stops the White a-pawn. A lovely study! The piece that is most vulnerable to constant attack is the Queen. Virtually every enemy piece can threaten her, and she is simply too valuable to give up. Diagram 114 shows a Queen running for cover only to find that she has no truly safe place to hide. White, who is up a Queen and a pawn for two Knights, seems to be well on his way to victory. However, his fortunes undergo a radical reversal after 1.• •Nd5!, when Black threatens to capture the Queen with ... Bh4+ followed by ...Rxd8. White avoids the Bishop's check with 2.O-O. Now Black is able to force a perpetual pursuit of the Queen with 2 •••Bg7 (threatening 3 ... Rxd8) 3.Qd6 (the only safe square) 3 • • •BfS! 4.QdS (again, the only safe square) 4 . . •Bg7. Black repeats the position and claims a draw. Now try your hand at a test To solve this problem, all you have to do is find something to attack and never let up! 1 21 PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations Tests TEST 88. In this well-known position from the Slav Defense (1.d4 d5 2. c4 c6-one of Black's most solid defenses to the Queen's Gambit), White can capture a "free" pawn on b7 with l.Qxb7. If White wants to win the game, is capturing this pawn a wise decision? Building a Fortress Building a fortress involves setting up a strong defensive wall that prevents your opponent from making decisive inroads into your position. We'll look at two types of walls: one that prevents the King from crossing over into your territory and one that keeps out your opponent's entire army. Keeping Out the King When you and your opponent have traded most of your pieces. your best bet is to bring your King into play. No longer attacked by the entire enemy army, his Majesty can show that he is a strong piece in his own right A good exercise to test the King's powers against other pieces is to put a monarch on the board against a single enemy Queen or a lone Rook. The best the mighty Queen can do by herself is force a stalemate position. The Rook can set up an impassable wall of squares but that's all. Against a lone Bishop or Knight, the King can also go pretty much where he wants. The King's strength is particularly apparent when a King and Queen face a lone King or a King and Rook face a lone King. By itself, a Queen or Rook cannot force a checkmate. Both need the King's help. It stands to reason, then, that when you are down material in an endgame, you might be able to save the game if you can keep the enemy King away from your own monarch. 1 22 CHAPTER THIRTEEN: Other Kinds of Draws DIAGRAM 115. Either player to play. DIAGRAM 1 1 6. Black to play. In Diagram 115, White is ahead a Queen for a Rook and a pawn-a 3-point advantage. However, he can't win because his King can't cross over the 5th rank. If his King could get to e7, White would be able to combine an attack against the f7-pawn with an attack against the Black King, winning the game. Black prevents this slaughter by playing ...Rf5-<\5-f5-d5. He counters any Queen checks with ... KgB or ...KfB, giving White no way to get his King into the game. Here, the Rook's power to set up an impassable wall of squares in front of the enemy King has saved the day. Though the Rook has less strength than the Queen, Black draws easily. Substitute a Rook and Knight for the White Queen and see for yourself. 'This type of anti-King blockade has enabled many a player to save an otherwise hopeless position. White is very happy with the position in Diagram 116. He is up a Queen and a pawn for a Rook and a Bishop-a 2-point advantage. He intends to answer l...exd5 with the nasty surprise 2.Qb2+, forking Black's King and Bishop. However, Black sees a chance to create the blockade shown in Diagram 115 and calmly plays 1. ••Bxd5!. After 2.exd5 Rxd5, White will eventually be forced to accept a draw. 1 23 PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations DIAGRAM 1 1 7. Either player to move. DIAGRAM 118. White to play. Study by V. Chekhover, 1947 Keeping Out the Enemy Anny When you are behind in force, it is very hard to keep all your opponent's pieces out of your camp. However, if you can hold them at bay, then a material imbalance becomes unimportant. A glance at Diagram 117 is all you need to realize that neither player's army can break into the other's camp. To prove the point, remove Black's Bishop and Rook. Now Black is down 8 full points in force, but he will still draw the game with ease because even with extra forces, White can't do anything to break through. In Diagram 1 18, White is doing fine materially (three pawns and a Bishop for a Rook) , but Black threatens to play ... Rh2 and then systemati cally devour all the White pawns. White can force a draw by setting up a blockade that prevents both Black's King and Rook from penetrating White's position. Here's how: l.Kdl! Rh2 2.Kel! (sacrificing the White Bishop) 2 ••. Rxg2 3.Kfl Rh2 4.Kgl (kicking the Black Rook out of the White camp) 4 . . . Rh6 5.f3! White's fifth move is the key to keeping out 1 24 CHAPTER THIRTEEN: Other Kinds of Draws the Black King. (fo test the strength of this move, try to find a way for the Black King to get in.) Play continues with 5. . .Re6 (Black hopes to get to e2 or el) 6.Kfl (protecting the e2- and el-squares) 6•••Kf7 7.Kf2. Now neither Black's Rook nor his King can penetrate the blockade. White's King will simply shuttle back and forth between f1 and f2. If Black plays ...Rh6, then White's King will switch the action to gl and g2. Note also that White will counter a Black move of ... a5 and ...a4 with the blocking h4. Thus, the game is an inevitable draw. In the following tests, simply aim to keep the bad guys out, and all will be well. Tests TEST 89. White is up a Queen and pawn for a Rook and a Knight-a 2-point edge. Is l.e4 a good move for White? TEST 90. Black is up a Rook. and it's White's tum to play. Should White give up, or can you find a move that offers him a glimmer of hope? 1 25 Study by J. Hasek, 1932 PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations Material Imbalances That Lead to a Draw A material advantage is wonderlul but will do you no good if you can't win the game. To become proficient at chess, you must understand that some types of material advantages are not by themselves enough to force a win. If you have a material advantage, you need to know whether it's one of the winning types, and conversely, if you are down material, you need to know whether to try to draw an otherwise lost game. In this section, we'll look at the most common types of non-winning material advantages: two Knights vs. a lone King; a Knight and a Rook-pawn on the 7th vs. a lone King; and a Bishop and a wrong-color Rook-pawn vs. a lone King. Two Knights vs. a Lone King One of the greatest injustices of chess is the fact that without pawns on the board, two Knights cannot beat a lone King. Because two Bishops or a Bishop and a Knight can easily accomplish this feat, two Knights are considered less valuable than two Bishops or a Bishop and a Knight Let's look at the examples in Diagrams 119 and 120. DIAGRAM 1 1 9. White 10 play. DIAGRAM 120. Black 10 play. CHAPTER THIRTEEN: Other Ki nds of Draws In Diagram 119, White is up two Knights for nothing, and he has managed to corner the Black King. But he still can't win the game! If White plays I.Nh6+, Black must avoid l...Kh8?? 2.Ngf7 Checkmate and play

1.. .Kf8, which leaves White with no way to kill off the Black King.

Black looks like he is on his last legs in Diagram 120. His King is in trouble, and he is down two pawns. However, Black knows that White's two lone Knights are insufficient for a win, so he plays 1.•• Nxd5! 2.Kxd5 (2.e7 Nxe7 produces a draw) 2 ...Nxe6!. The frustrated commander ofthe White army can play on for a while, but eventually he must concede the draw. A Knight and a Rook-Pawn on the 7th vs. a Lone King If you are ahead in an endgame, the least-valuable pawn to own is usually an a- or h-pawn. In fact, these pawns can be liabilities. Because the a- and h-pawns occupy the edge of the board, they offer the defender stalemate chances that no other pawn would give him. One such case is the hopeless situation shown in Diagram 121. Black is down a Knight and a pawn. Normally this position would give White an easy win: l.Kf6 Kg8 2.Kg6 Kh8 3.Nf7+ Kg8 4.h7+, and the pawn is promoted. However, suppose White blunders with l.h7?? Suddenly the game is a draw! Though this move would be a winner with any other pawn, here two factors combine to save Black: First, the Black King can't step off the edge of the board; and second, the Knight can't move without hang ing the h-pawn, and if the White King defends the h-pawn, a stalemate will occur. After 1. .. Kg7 2.Kf5 Kh8, the direct 3.Kf6 produces an im mediate stalemate, and 3.Kg4 Kg7

4.Kh5 Kh8 gets White nowhere

because 5.Kh6 still stalemates the DIAGRAM 1 21. White to play. Black King. 1 27 PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations DIAGRAM 122. Black to play. Diagram 122 shows another ex ample. Though down a pawn, Black draws easily by playing for the posi tion in the previous diagram. With L •.Nf5!, he forces White's pawn to the unfortunate h7-square. White obliges: 2.h7 Nd4 3.Kdl Nxc2! (the simple 3 ...Kg7 also draws, but Black wants to be dramatic) 4.Kxc2 Kg7 5.Kxc3 Kh8. Now White sim ply can't win. The moral of all these positions is simply this: Ifyou are way ahead in material and you have an a- or h-pawn, be careful not to give your opponent a chance for a stalemate! A Bishop and a Wrong-Color Rook-Pawn vs. a Lone King Forcing a stalemate with this combination of material is probably the most useful last-minute saving technique a defending player has. This situation comes up amazingly often. The attacking player is confident of his extra material and often fails to notice this defensive possibility until too late. The position in Diagram 123 is a simple illustration of this theme. The result will be a draw no matter where the pawn sits on the h-file. If White's Bishop stood on the dark squares, White would win easily, but the fact that the pawn promotes on the color opposite to that of the Bishop enables Black to hold on by taking advantage of the stalemating possibilities offered by the a- or h-pawn. After LKg6 Kg8 2.h7+ Kh8, White is faced with a stalemate (as he also is with 2.Be6+ Kh8). No matter what White does, he will be unable to chase Black out of his comer. The vintage position in Diagram 124 shows that this method of defend ing against a Bishop and a wrong-color Rook-pawn has been known for a very long time! Black saves himself with L ..Ra 1 + 2.RfI Rxfl + 3.KxfI Bh3! 4.gxh3. White would like to play 4.g3, but his pawn is pinned to his 1 28 CHAPTER THIRTEEN: Other Kinds of Draws DIAGRAM 123. White to play. DIAGRAM 124. Black to play. King! Also notice that 4.Kf2 Bxg2! leads to the position shown in the previous diagram. With 4 . . . Kh6, Black retreats to his comer on hs and claims the draw. No matter how many pawns White piles up on the h-file. the game will end in a draw unless the White Bishop controls the pawns' queening square. The drawing mechanism we have just looked at is very useful and should be studied thoroughly. Whenever you are losing and your opponent has a Bishop and a Rook-pawn of the wrong color, there is still hope! Trapping the Big Gun Another way to save a game if you are down in material is to trap your opponent's strongest piece and make it more or less useless. Remember, if it can't flex its muscles, it can't cause you any pain. In Diagram 125 on the next page, Black is up a Rook for a mere pawn. However, White can save himself by entombing the Rook with l.Bb8!. Now the only active participants in the game are the two Kings and Black's Bishop. Because a lone Bishop can't force a win, the game must eventually end in a draw. 1 29 PART 1 : Tactics and Combinations DIAGRAM 125. White to play. DtAGRAM 126. White to play. Study by F. Zimkhovitch, 1927 Diagram 126 shows a complicated but extremely beautiful example of how to nullify the powers of the strongest piece on the board. The trouble with White's game is his very weak b2-pawn. Black threatens to win with ... RbI and ... Rxb2, when Black's b-pawn would rush down the board and become a Queen. White first takes steps to prevent the promotion: 1.Bg4+ Kd6 2.Bf5! Ra2! (threatening to get the pawn after all) 3.Nxa2!. White captures the Rook, but now the Black b-pawn turns into an unstoppable a-pawn with 3 . . . bxa2 4.Kcl al-Q+. However, after 5.Bbl!, White is assured of a draw. Though Black is ahead a full Queen for a Bishop-a 6-point advantage-he can't win because his Queen has no moves. She's on the board but has no role in the game. White willplay Kc2-c1-c2 ad infinitum, until Black agrees to the draw. Now for a couple of tests. In the following diagrams, you are down and quickly losing consciousness, but in every case you can find a way to hold on. Many a player would be depressed by these positions. but with a positive attitude and a little knowledge, you can often work miracles. 1 30 CHAPTER THIRTEEN: Other Kinds of Draws Tests TEST 91 . Black is down two pawns and threat ened with f6+. It's his move. How can he wipe the smile off White's face? TEST 92. Black is down two pawns and being pushed backward.

PART 2

G reat Tacticians and Their Games Whenever chess aficionados get together and the discussion turns to one great player or another. the question of his playing style always comes up. Was that chess master a quiet positional player who enjoyed maneuvering his pieces to and fro? Or was he a madman who turned the board into a minefield of tactical possibilities? This part is dedicated to players of the latter type: the men considered to be the greatest tacticians of all time.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

[diagram]
Adolf Anderssen (1 81 8-1 879) BAorn in Breslau, Germany, Adolf nderssen is considered to be one of the greatest combina tive players of all time. In the course of his long tournament and match career, he won the first big interna tional tournament (London, 1851) and was considered to be the strong est player in the world until his de feat in match play by the American Paul Morphy in 1858. He also won first prizes at Manchester in 1862 and Baden-Baden in 1870, took third at Vienna in 1873, and finished sixth at Paris in 1878 at the age of 60. like the majority of players of his day, Anderssen knew only how to attack, but in a field crowded with attackers, he had no equal. His two most famous victories-the Immortal Game and the Evergreen Game-will live as long as chess itself. An amazing imagination and unequaled tactical eye make his games exemplary sources of fantasy for which past and present masters have always had a fondness. In 1877, Anderssen received a very rare honor from German chess players, who organized a tournament to commemorate the 50th anniver sary of Anderssen's first chess game. He showed that he had learned the 1 35 PART 2: Great Tacticians and Their Games DIAGRAM 127. Whit. to play. Anderssen-Zukertort Berlin, 1869 game well by tying for second and third place in the tournament at the advanced age (for the 19th cen tury) of 59. The following example shows how Anderssen typically hacked his opponent to bits. In Diagram 127, material is even, but Black's minor pieces are out of the battle and White's pieces and pawns are threat ening the Black King. Seeing his chance for a strange sort of back rank checkmate, Anderssen lures Black's King into the open with l.Qxh7+! Kxh7 (now 2.Rh3+ fails to 2. ..Qh6, so White prevents Black's Queen from defending) 2.f6+! KgB (even more abrupt is 2 ...Qxd3 3.Rh3+ KgB 4.RhB Checkmate) 3.Bh7+! (allowing White's Rook to check the King with tempo. The immediate 3.Rh3 allows Black to create an escape route on f7 for his King with 3 ... Rxf6.) 3• • • Kxh7 4.Rb3+ KgB 5.RbS Checkmate. Anderssen played such extraordinary games that some were given the distinction of a title. Two such games were dubbed "The Immortal Game" and "The Evergreen Game." The Immortal Game Anderssen-Kieseritzky London, 1 851 Played in London in 1851, this "friendly" game caused a great stir at the time and was reported in newspapers and journals around the world. In 1855, a chess journalist named Karl Falkbeer referred to it as "The Immortal 1 36 CI IAPTER FOURTEEN: Adolf Anderssen ( 1 81 8-1879) Game," believing that it would always be one of the greatest chess games ever played. Here it is. 1 .e4 e5

2.f4

White's second move is the prelude to a pawn sacrifice known as the King's Gambit, an ultra-aggressive opening that was very popular in Anderssen's day. White's idea is to sacrifice a pawn to gain a majority of center pawns, potential open files for his Rooks, and a lead in development. Today, the King's Gambit is rarely seen in top-flight chess.

2. .•exf4

Like most players of the last century, Black feels duty-bound to accept the sacrifice. It is the "manly" thing to do!

3.8c4

Modern players prefer 3.Nf3, which prevents Black's next move. 3 ... Qh4+

4.Kfl b5?!

This dubious counter-sacrifice drives the Bishop from its nice diagonal but gives up the pawn.

Both sides are hurrying to mobilize their pieces for the attack. Here, White develops his Knight with tempo because it attacks the Black Queen. 6 . .. Qh6

7.d3

White defends his e4-pawn and frees his cI-Bishop.

[diagram]
This move is typical of the period. Though Black is threatening 8 ... Ng3+

9.hxg3 Qxhl +, he is also placing his Knight on the rim, where it loses its

influence over the center. In those days, players often brought out two or three pieces and then started to attack. Now players give more thought to controlling the center and the deployment of all their forces. By today's 1 37 PART 2: Great Tacticians and Their Games standards, Black has violated the principle of not moving the same piece twice in the opening.

8.Nh4

White stops Black's threat, intending to position the Knight on the nice f5 outpost, from which it can harass the Black Queen. 8 ...Qg5

9.Nf5

Note how both players are moving the same pieces again and again. 9 ...e6 1 0.g4 Nf6? More lost time. Black should have played for an exchange of pieces with 1O. ..cxb5 11.gxh5, even though White would retain an advantage. 1 1 .Rgl ! White has had enough! He defends his g-pawn and sacrifices the Bishop so that his pawns can gain time by chasing Black's Queen. 1 1 ... cxb5 Not wishing to be banned from all future chess events, Black reluctantly accepts the gift and glares defiantly at his opponent. 1 2.h4 Qg6 1 3.h5 Qg5

14.Qf3

White develops a piece and threatens to play 15.Bxf4, which will trap Black's Queen.

14. .. Ng8

Black continues to play with this Knight, but now his Queen can safely retreat to f6 or d8. 1 5.Bxf4 Another White piece comes out with gain of tempo. 1 5. ..Qf6

16.Ne3 Be5?

1 38 CHAPTER FOURTEEN: Adolf Anderssen (181 8-1 879) This attack on White's Rook is easily parried. Black should have realized that preventing White's next move was more important than engaging in a counterattack. 1 7.NdS!? Amodem player would push back Black with 17.d4, expecting 17...Be7, after which 18.Nd5 is crushing. If Black plays 17. .. Bxd4, then 18.Nd5 wins a piece. However, true to his nature, Anderssen jumps forward with reckless aban don. (He probably planned the checkmate on move 23 and couldn't resist the chance to play into it.) 1 7 ...Qxb2 Black attacks White's Rook on al.

23.Be7 Checkmate

The final position, shown in Dia gram 129, is very pleasing! White has sacrificed his Queen, both Rooks, DIAGRAM 129. and a Bishop to obtain a pure minor piece checkmate. A pure checkmate is one in which none of the squares around the checkmated King is covered more than once by the winning side. Though obtaining a pure checkmate is more satisfyiI)g to composers of chess problems than to over-the-board players, it is fitting that this famous final position has this aesthetic bonus. The Evergreen Came Anderssen-Dufresne Berlin, 1 852 Another ofAnderssen's "friendly" games was immortalized when Wilhelm Steinitz, the first official World Champion, dubbed it "The Evergreen Game." It went like this: 1 .e4 e5

2.Nfl Nc6

4.b4

The Evans Gambit is another old-time favorite. White sacrifices a pawn so that he can gain time by pushing around Black's Bishop. Modem Grandmasters prefer 4.d3 for a quieter game. CHAPTER FOURTEEN: Adolf Anderssen (181 8-1879) 4 •.. Bxb4

White eschews recapturing the pawn and threatens 9.Bxf7+, which will win a pawn and check the King.

Black defends the f7-pawn by placing his Queen on a vulnerable square.

Black doesn't fall for White's trap and play 9 ...Nxe5??, which leads to 10.Rel d6 11.Nxe5 dxe5 12.Qa4+, followed by l3.QxaS and the loss of the Black Bishop. Black knows that when your King is in the center, he shouldn't open up any new files.

10.Rel Nge7

1 1 .Bal b5?! Instead of getting his King to safety with 11...O-O, Black tries to counterat tack. He's forgotten the principle that you should avoid opening lines when your King is in the center. 1 2.Qxb5 Rb8 1 3.Qa4 Bb6 1 4.Nbd2 Bb7 1 5.Ne4 Qf5? Black continues to waste time and continues to leave his King in the center.

White threatens 17.Nd6+, with a discovered attack on Black's Queen. 1 41 PART 2: Great Tacticians and Their Games

DIAGRAM 130.

... Qh5 1 7.Nf6+! (130) As you can see in Diagram 130, White wants to force Black to cap ture the Knight on f6. (White will take the Black Queen on hs if Black resists.) The reason for this sacrifice is that after IS.exf6, White has blasted open the e-file and enabled his Rooks to join in the hunt for Black's King. The possibility of opening lines against the enemy King, especially when he is in the center, should always be considered. 1 7. ..gxf6

18.exf6 Rg8

19.Radl QxfJ

Black can't resist taking this Knight because he can now threaten to checkmate White on g2.

20.Rxe7+! Nxe7?

After this move, White has a forced checkmate. Black probably overlooked White's stunning reply. I say "probably" because in the old days players who knew they had lost a game sometimes allowed their opponents to win brilliantly. A better defense was 20. ..Kds! 21.Rxd7+ Kc8 22.Rd8+! KxdS (not 22 ...NxdS, which leads to 23.Qd7+!! Kxd724.Bf5++ and then Bd7 Checkmate)

most important matches he ever played. It was a tribute to his standing in the chess world that Paul Morphy was universally considered the strongest player in the world after defeating Anderssen in 1858. After Wilhelm Steinitz edged Anderssen out of the winner's seat with a score of 8-6 in 1866, he claimed to be the first World Champion and was generally accepted to be such. It is worth noting that Anderssen is the man he had to beat to wear this crown. 1 43

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

[diagram]
Paul Morphy (1 837-1 884)

orn in New Orleans, Louisi ana, of a Spanish-Irish father and a French Creole mother, Paul Morphy was an exceptionally strong player by the age of 12. Later he studied law and was said to have been able to recite most of the Civil Code of Louisiana from memory. He passed the bar at 19 and had to wait a year to be eligible to practice law, so he decided to spend some time playing chess. That year-1857-it so happened that the American Chess Congress was held in New York. Morphy's stunning victory at the Congress was followed by a triumphant European tour, culminating in his match win over Anderssen. Morphy returned to the United States in 1859 universally acclaimed as the best player in the world. Sadly, he played no serious chess for the rest of his life and was beset by mental problems in his later years. Why was Morphy so much better at chess than everyone else? He was a great tactician, but no more so than Adolf Anderssen. What made him invincible was his understanding of some modem chess principles. He attacked only after he had developed all his forces, and he fought like a tiger for control of the center. PART 2: Great Tacticians and Their Games The fact that Morphy was ahead of his time was lost on his contempo raries, most of whom could never figure out how he had trampled them under his feet After losing to Morphy, Anderssen WTote: He who plays with Morphy must abandon allhope of catching him in a trap, no matter how cunningly laid, but must assume that it is so clear to Morphy that there can be no Question of a false step. Let's look at one of Morphy's outstanding games. Morphy-Duke of Braunschweig and Count lsouard, Paris, 1 858 In this game, Morphy offered an exquisite example ofrapid mobilization of an army followed by flawless execution of an attack. The game was played in a French opera theater and was reported around the world. Though Morphy faced the combined wits of a Duke and a Count, the battle proved to be one-sided. It is considered required reading for allchess lovers. Enjoy. 1 .e4 e5

Morphy shows admirable restraint and, instead of grabbing Black's b-pawn, decides to go for a quick knockout. This approach requires that he develop his pieces as quickly as possible. Notice the difference between Morphy and the other players of his era: He attacks only after developing all his pieces, whereas other players bring out one or two men and attack right away. (Another difference is that other players feel obliged to accept all material offers, whereas Morphy accepts them only if doing so gives him an advantage.) Back to the game. 8 ... c6 Black defends the b7-pawn and keeps White's pieces out of the d5-{)utpost.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

[diagram]

[diagram]
Rudolf Spielmann (1 883-1 942) Rmudolf Spielmann was a short, ild-mannered, and friendly man. Like Adolf Anderssen, Spielmann's personality had little to do with his chess style, which was recklessly aggressive. Unlike An derssen, however, Spielmann did not play chess in the Romantic era, and defensive technique had become more important Positional concepts, rather than exclusively combina tional ideas, were the stock-in-trade of the masters of Spielmann's day. Crazed, attacking players were looked upon as relics from an earlier, more primitive time. A lover of gambit openings, Spielmann played many swashbuckling games but never felt that he had reached his full potential. Finally, in the late 1920s, Spielmann undertook a thorough study of positional concepts and endgames. The resulting change of style propelled him into the ranks of the world's top ten players. Reuben Fine once wrote that Spielmann's main concern in life, apart from chess, was to accumulate enough money to buy limitless quantities of beer! PART 2: Great Tacticians and Their Games Always proud of his attacking prowess, Spielmann once lamented, "I can see combinations as well as Alekhine, but 1 cannot get to the positions where they are possible!" This iimocent little statement is actually quite revealing and illustrates the changes the game was undergoing at the time. Of course, you could still sacrifice pieces and attack, but to be successful against the strongest players, you had to master all phases of the game. The time of the one-punch knock-{)ut artist was quickly coming to an end. However, we can still enjoy replaying some haymaker chess games. Let's look at a beautiful example from the young Spielmann. His beloved beer must have tasted good after this one! Spielmann-A. Flamberg Mannheim, 1 91 4 This game is a good example of Spielmann's early style.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

[diagram]
Frank Marshall (1 877-1 944) B om in New York, Frank Mar shall was US Champion from 1909 to 1935. Like Rudolf Spielmann, Marshall was a throw back to a previous chess era, and he quickly became known as a very tricky player who often swindled his way to victory. Reuben Fine claimed that he had met no one, not even Alexander Alekhine, who had a keener eye for the purely tactical and combinative side of chess. In spite of his keen eye, poor Marshall usually got stomped when he played extended matches against such giants as Emanuel Lasker (in 1907) and Jose Raul Capablanca (in 19(9). They simply avoided his tricks. By playing for strategically difficult positions-in Lasker's case-or for simple positions-in Capablanca's case-they created situations in which Marshall's tactical and combinative strengths failed to make an impression. The Lasker and Capablanca matches represented new developments in chess strategy. The Lasker contest was an example of strategic confusion, whereas the Capablanca contest was a battle of extremely different styles: Capablanca's "simplicity first" style vs. Marshall's crazed "bombs away" style. Marshall was unable to develop effective plans for dealing with either opponent, and he never knew what hit him! PART 2 : Great Tacticians and Their Games Though Marshall didn't do well against the chess gods, he nevertheless had his moments in the sun, dismantling most of the other masters in decisive fashion. The Pipe Game Marshall-A. Burn Paris, 1 900 Britisher Amos Bum loved to smoke a pipe while looking over the possibil ities on the board. In "The Pipe Game," Marshall beat Burn so quickly that Burn was never able to get his blasted pipe lit! l .d4 dS

The expected 17.Qh7+ KfB will allow Black's King to run to safety. 1 7.RhB+! Black resigns. Marshall's last move struck like a thunderbolt. Because the Black Bishop is pinned and can't take the White Rook, the Black King is forced to make the capture and move into the comer. Then 17 ... KxhB 1B.Qh7 is checkmate. A scintillating example of Marshall's attacking style! When it worked, it worked well. And it seemed to work better in tournaments than in matches. Marshall greatly preferred the variety of opponents found in tournaments to facing the same, well-prepared foe game after game. He said that he wanted "novelties in opening play, slashing attack and counterattack. The grim business of wearing down your opponent has never appealed to me very much." PART 2: Great Tacticians and Their Games Marshall-A. Rubinstein Lodz, 1 908 Here's another game that is typical of Marshall. Always happy to take chances, Marshall's gamble pays off when, with both Kings under heavy fire, his renowned opponent gets confused. 1 .d4 dS

1 1 .a3 Ne6 1 2.Bd3 QxeS Black regains his pawn, and the game is roughly balanced. The isolation of Black's d-pawn is compensated by his powerful dark-squared Bishop. A modern master would now move his King to safety with 13.O-O, but Marshall had no patience for safety-first measures. As a chess player, he lived for the attack! 1 3.h4? Such wing attacks are usually successful only if you control the center or if CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: Frank Marshall (1 877-1 944) the center is closed. Here, the center is open and can be changed by Black (dS-d4), so White's Kingside action is suspicious and seems destined to fail. 1 3• ..

The destruction of the pawns that shielded White's King leaves the White monarch in great peril. 1 8.fxg3 Qg5 1 9.Qd3 Both sides are swinging for the fences. With this move, White defends the e-pawn and prepares for Qh7+, hoping to kick-start his own attack.

Take, for example, the following position. from which he made a move that stunned the chess world and became known as one of the most brilliant moves ever played! As you can seein Diagram 140, Black is ahead a piece, but White is attacking both Black's Queen and his h3-Rook. Black's move is a beauty: 1.• •Qg3!!.

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

[diagram]
Alexander Alekhine (1 892-1 946) Born in Moscow to a wealthy family, Alexander A1ekhine has the morbid distinction of being the only man to die while hold ing the World Champion title. A player of extraordinary tactical vi sion, A1ekhine was also the first great theorist of openings. Pushed by a burning ambition to win the World Championship, A1ekhine re alized that tactical ability alone was not enough to take him to the peak. By tireless study, A1ekhine mastered allphases of the game. He is in many respects the prototype of the modern Grandmaster. By thoroughly studying openings and intensely analyzing his opponent's games, A1ekhine broke a new trail to greatness that has been followed by many of today's profes sional chess players. Not a very likeable man, A1ekhine was a drunk and a Nazi sympathizer. Nevertheless, he achieved such a high playing level that many chess fans rank him with Capablanca, Lasker, Fischer, and Kasparov as one of the five greatest players who ever lived. 1 63 PART 2 : Great Tacticians and Their Games Alekhine-O. Chajes Carlsbad, 1 91 1 Let's look at a game that has the Alekhine stamp all over it. A sharp opening is followed by forceful play that culminates in a crisp tactical finish. Note particularly Alekhine's tactical mastery, which he uses to gain material and achieve eventual victory. 1 .c4 This is the English Opening, which was rarely seen in those days.

Reti-Alekhine Baden-Baden, 1 925 In 1927, A1ekhine challenged Jose Raul Capablanca for the World Cham pionship, eventually winning the title in one of the most difficult matches ever played. While preparing for the Championship match, A1ekhine played the following game, exhibiting perhaps his most celebrated combination its depth is truly awesome. 1 66 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN: Alexander Alekhine (1 892-1 946) Richard Reti, A1ekhine's opponent in this game, was a chess rebel who preached a bunch of new ideas that were labeled "hypermodern." One of the main tenets ofhypermodemism concerned the center. The classical old guard preached that success depended on ownership of the center, whereas the hypermoderns insisted that you could allow your opponent to build a big pawn center as long as you could later attack the center from the flanks. Reti began the game like this: log3 The ideas of the hypermoderns were certainly not lost onAlekhine. He took the best ideas from each school of chess thought and mixed them together to come up with a system of his own. 1 .•• e5

2.Nf3!?

White's move is a little risky because his Knight gets pushed around with loss of tempo. However, he is willing to run hither and thither with this Knight, hoping to goad Black's pawns forward so that he can later attack them. He wants to show that they are not strong, but merely targets. Compare the ideas of Reti with those of players from Anderssen's and Morphy's era, and you will be struck by the vast difference in their thinking. The time of chess professionalism, and the strategic thought that comes with it, had arrived. The game continues: 2 ••• e4

Keep in mind that you should never set a trap without expecting your opponent to see the threat. If he misses it, you can congratulate yourself on your nice win. If he sees it, your move should nevertheless improve your position in some way. In this case, Reti sees through the trap. 1 7.8f3 The greedy 17.Bxh3? leads to 17 ...Qxh3 18.Nxb7 Ng4 19.Nf3 Nde3! 20.fxe3 Nxe3 (threatening 21 ... Qg2 Checkmate) 21.Qxf7+! Kh8! (not 21. ..Kxf7

CHAPTER NINETEEN

Mikhail Tal (1 936-1 992) When Alexander Alekhine died in 1946, there were no tactical wizards wait ing in the wings to take his place_ The science of pure chess took cen ter stage, and the chief of the scien tists, Mikhail Botvinnik, reigned from 1948 to 1960, with the exception of a one-year period when he lost the title to Vasily Smyslov-winning it back in a rematch. This impressive performance seemed to indicate that all future World Champions would be positional players. Little did the chess world suspect that another firebrand would appear and take the game by storm. Mikhail Tal was born in Riga, Latvia, in 1936. During his professional career, his style was characterized by risk and daring, and he reveled in tactical duels and complex combinations. A man of unbelievable tactical vision, he was able to calculate long, complicated variations after merely glancing at a position. Considered to be an unsound player, he neverthe less confounded his critics by consistently winning tournament after tour nament In 1960, at the tender age of 24, Tal achieved the unthinkable, 1 75 PART 2: Great Tacticians and Their Games knocking Botvinnik aside and claiming the World Champion title as his own. Botvinnik said: I was surprised by his ability to figure out complex variations. Then the way he sets out the game; he was not interested in the objectivity of the position, whether it's better or worse, he onty needed room for his pieces. All you do then is figure out variations which are extremely difficult. He was tactically outplaying me and I made mistakes: Did Ta1's coronation mean that a new era of attacking play was at hand? Many players thought so, and some coaches went so far as to insist that their students play aggressive ly and sacrifice whenever possible. As Ta1 put it These poor young players must have breathed a sigh of relief when I lost the title back to Botvinnik (in 19tH). Now they could play calm positional chess again! As we go to press with this book, we are stunned to learn of the death of Mikhail Tal at the age of 55. We are allthe poorer for his loss. His games willbe his everlasting memoria1. Tal-Miller Simultaneous Los Angeles, 1 988 The first Tal game we'1l look at is remarkable not because Tal was playing a simultaneous exhibition of 20 to 40 games (most top players can handle this type of simultaneous exhibition), but because he defeated his opponent in such a stunning way. lnstead of being upset at his loss, Ta1's victim wore a beaming smile after the game.

CHAPTER TWENTY

Garry Kasparov (1 963- )

fter Mikhail Botvinnik re gained his title in 1961, play ers with positional styles once again held the highest chess titles. The world of chess was domi nated by the likes of Tigran Petros yan, with his motto of "safety first"; Boris Spassky. who had an aggres sive, universal style; and Bobby Fi scher, who had a very clear, simple, classic style. In 1975, Anatoly Karpov won the title by default from Fischer. Thereafter, Karpovset outto prove that he deserved to be World Champion. With his refined, dry style and relentless precision, he crushed everyone in sight. People dreamed of a Tal-like player who would rise up and brighten the chess world with tactical fantasy. The dream became reality when Garry Kasparov won the title from Karpov in 1985 at just 22 years.of age! Born in Baku, Azerbai jan, Kasparov is considered by many to be a reincarnation of Alexander Alekhine. A master of all openings, Kasparov slices and dices his opponents with a combinative vision that is every bit the equal of Tars and Alekhine's. The excitement of Kasparov's style has revitalized interest in chess. PART 2: Great Tacticians and Their Games In the following three contests, we'll see how Kasparov crushes his opponents. Allthree opponents are among the world's strongest Grand masters, but none of them can stand up to Kasparov's hammer-like blows. Hiibner-Kasparov Hamburg, 1 985 Match Game 1 In a six-game training match, Kasparov clobbered Germany's top player. The match ended in a 4\1.!-to-l\l.! victory for Kasparov. This, the first game of the match, was an indication of things to come. 1 .c4 The English Opening. A couple of years after this game, Kasparov started playing this opening himself. 1 .• • e5

Imperative is 11.Nc3 Ng4 12.Qd4 Be7, which keeps Black's advantage to a minimum. Now White is put on the defensive, and he never recovers. 1 1 ... Ng4! 1 2.Qd4?! Confused, White allows himseH to be dragged into a tactical grinder. A better move is 12.Nxe6 Nxe3 13.NxdB Nc2+ 14.Kd1 Nxal 15.Nxf7 Kxf7 I6.Bxa1 Bxe7, even though Black then has a big advantage. 1 2 ... Ne4!! (147) A shocker that hangs the Black Knight in midair. As you can see in Diagram 147, the immediate threats are 13. .. Ngxf2 and 13 ... Qa5+. White faces disaster after only twelve moves. 1 3.Bh3 White's King now hasfl to run to. White avoids I3.Qxe4 Qa5+ 14.Kd1 Nxf2+, which produces a royal fork. Also unpleasant is 13.Ngh3 Qa5+ I4.Kdt d5, with a crushing attack.

A typi cal Kasparov attack. CHAPTER TWENTY: Garry Kasparov ( 1 963- ) Kasparov-U. Andersso n Tilburg, 1 981 Because of his style ofplay, Ulf Andersson is considered to be one of the world's most difficult players to beat. Whereas many players seek action and attacking chances for their own pieces, Andersson's goal is simply to stymie the activity of his opponent's pieces. The would-be attacker becomes increasingly frustrated, often lashing out with an unsound sacrifice that this defense-minded Grandmaster simply pockets. However, asyou11 see in this game, the 18-year-Qld Kasparov did not seem to be impressed!

As its title indicates, Part 3 starts with a series of tests. Unlike the tests in the chapters in Part 1, these tests are presented cold-I don't give you any clues about which tactics might be involved. Finding out whether check mate is possible or whether the capture of a single pawn is the solution I'm looking for will cost you some moments of concentration, just as it would in a real game. As well as trying to solve the problem correctly, write down your answers, indicate the tactic associated with the problem, and note any variations that come to mind. Try to discover not only the best move, but also the best defense and how to win against that best move. Pursue the positions as far as you can. So that you can judge how well you've done, I've assigned a point value to each of the tests in these chapters. When you have fmished all the tests, look up the answers and calculate your score.

Solutions to Tests from Part 1

n this chapter, I have gathered together the solutions to the tests pre sented in Part 1. You shouldn't have any trouble understanding these answers. In each chapter, I gave lots of clues about what to look for, so I expect you will have done well. Chapter Two Tests TEST 1 : No! 2.Ne!! is a double attack on Black's Queen and Rook. Then 2• • •Qg5 3.Nxg2 Qxg2 wins the Exchange for a pawn (a I-point advantage) . TEST 2 : The surprising I.Nxh4! wins a pawn. TEST 3: A classic pawn snatch: I.Nxd4!. Then l...Nxd4 allows 2.Bxg4, whereas 1...Bxe2 2.Nxe2 keeps the pawn. TEST 4 : The stunning 1.8gB!, which threatens both the Queen and a check- mate on h7, is a winner for White. TEST 5: Best is I.Nf5!, which threatens the Black Queen and opens up the White Queen's path to the checkmating h8-square. (In this case, a piece discovers an attack against a square instead of against a piece or pawn.) TEST 6 : The elegant solution is I.RcS! Rxa7. The pawn must be captured; otherwise, a8=Q forces the capture of a Rook. Then 2.Kb6+ is a discovered check, which captures the Rook. PART 3 : More Tests and Solutions TEST 7: White plays the interference move l.BdS!, which ends Black's protection of the as-Rook and makes a discovered attack on the f7-pawn. For Black, 1...Raxds 2.Qxf7+, t . .. RfS 2.QxaS, and 1...Qf5 2.QxaS are all hopeless. TEST 8: White plays l .Rxf6!, with a double threat of 2.Qxg4 and 2.Rg6+ (the dreaded double check). Black should play 1...Nxf6 2.Qxg4, even though this sequence leaves White with a Bishop and two pawns for the Exchange (full material equality), and the pin still causes Black gTeat anguish. Instead, Black can't resist the bait offered on dt, and with 1 . .. Bxdl?, he chops off the White Queen. The conclusion is made possible by a double check: 2.Rg6++ (attacking Black's King with both the Bishop on b2 and the Rook on g6; note that the Rook on g6 is defended by the Bishop on d3) 2 • • • Kh7 3.Rg7++ (another double discovered check, this time with the d3-Bishop as the Rook's partner) 3 ••• KhS (the Rook can't be captured because ofthe protection of the b2-Bishop) 4.Rh7+ KgS 5.RhS Checkmate. The brutal flurry of checks gives Black no chance to do anything but move his King! TEST 9: Lured by the prospect of taking a pawn and attacking the Black Knight, White could play l.Qxa4. Unfortunately, with l...Qc7, Black can hold on. Emanual Lasker once said, "When you see a good move, you must sit on your hands and look for a better one." This bit of wisdom serves White well here. If he plays l.QdS+, after 1.• • Kh7 2.Qxa5, he wins a piece. TEST 10: White wins with l.Rxc6!, snaring a pawn and drawing the de fender away from the critical e7-square. Black can't take the Rook because

1...Rxc6 2.Ne7+ leads to a family fork.

TEST 1 1 : As before, White can chop off the c-pawn with l.Nxc6!, after which 1...Qxc6? 2.Ne7+ captures the Queen. All well and good, but what happens if Black plays 1 .•• Nxc6 instead, covering the e7-square with two pieces? White blasts this threat apart with 2.Qxc6! Qxc6 3.Ne7+, recov ering the Queen and ending up with an extra pawn. CHI\PIER TWENTY-FOUR: Solutions to Tests from Part 1 TEST 12: White can start a series of checks that soon lead to a fork on the Black King and the loose a3-Bishop: l.Qa8+ Kd7 2.Qc6+ Kc8 3.Qa6+, which wins the Bishop. Don't forget Silman's Rules of Recognition: When an enemy piece is undefended and the enemy King is weak, a tactical move has a good chance of success. TEST 1 3: The tempting l.Qf5? threatens both the d7-Knight and a check mate on h7. However, Black can parry both threats with 1 ...Nf6. So I played the forceful l.Nxh7! Kxh7 2.Qf5+ Kg8 3.Qxd7, which netted me an extra pawn and an eventual victory. TEST 14: White found the exceedingly strong l.Qc4!!, which led to Black's immediate resignation! Because this move threatens Black's Rook on c8 and sets up 2.Qg8 Checkmate (it forks a Rook and a checkmating square), Black has no time to capture the loose White Rook on e8, and 1...Rxc4 is answered by 2.Rxf8 Checkmate. TEST 15: Black creates a fork by giving his Queen away with 1 ...QgI +!, and White gives up. Why? Black's move forces the White King to retreat to the unfortunate gl-square with 2.KxgI, after which Black can take a Bishop with 2 ... Nxe2+ and simultaneously fork the King and Queen. Because Black is then up a piece, White resigns. TEST 16: I was able to fork White's Queen and Bishop with 1 ... Nce5!. Then, when White's pawn takes one Knight off the board with 2.dxe5, my other horse is able to take its place: 2 ...Nxe5 3.Qg3 Nxc4. This combina tion leaves me with an extra pawn plus a good position, and I went on to win the game. TEST 1 7: No! Playing 1...Qg5?? loses a piece because it walks right into a double discovered attack.Mer2.d4!, Black's Bishop hangs to the d4-pawn, and the Black Queen is attacked by the cI-Bishop. PART 3: More Tests and Solutions TEST 18: White's b6-pawn is blocked by its Black counterpart on b7. Seeing that the pawn advance would be strong, White plays l.Rxc6+!. Then 1 • . •bxc6 2. b7+ leads to a fork that immediately regains the Rook and leaves White with an extra piece for a pawn (a 2-point advantage) . TEST 19: White plays a combination that depends on many factors for its ultimate success: 1.RxcS!+ RxcS (1...Kxc8 is impossible because of

2.Rxe8+; note that the Knight on e8 needs to be carefully watched) 2.d7! (a

pawn fork) 2 • • • Kxd7 (a forced capture, but now Black's King is on the same diagonal as his Rook) 3.Bg4+ (skewering the King and Rook) 3 • • •KdS

4.BxcS. White is now up an Exchange and a pawn (a 3-point advantage)

because 4 ...Kxc8 hangs the Knight on e8. Chapter Three Tests TEST 20: With l.Qh5+, White puts an end to the fight Black cannot cap ture the White Queen because the d3-Bishop is pinning the g6-pawn. After 1 ••• Kg7, Black is wiped off the board with 2.Qxg6+ KhS 3.Qh7 Checkmate. TEST 21 : I'm willing to sacrifice a Rook and a Knight in order to achieve the position shown in Test 20: l.Rxh7! Kxh7? (in the actual game, Black played 1...f5, and after 2.Rh 1, I was a pawn ahead and eventually won)

2.Ng5+ (having pulled Black's King to the vulnerable h7-square, I sacrifice

another piece to make way for my Queen) 2 • • •fxg5 (better is 2... Kg8, but then 3.Nxe6 gets back all my material plus dividends of a pawn) 3.Qh5+ (notice the similarities between Test 21 and Test 20; the Black King will be checkmated because his pinned pawn cannot capture the White Queen) 3• • • Kg7 4.Qxg6+ KhS 5.Qh7 Checkmate. As this example shows, no material price is too much to pay if it enables you to force a checkmate! TEST 22: White has to play l.Khl. If he plays l.Bd4??, he loses a piece because this Bishop is then pinned to the King, making 1 ... Qxe5! possible. CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR: Solutions to Tests from Part 1 TEST 23: Black's 1.• • Qd4?? is a blunder that immediately loses to 2.Rdl!. Black then has two hopeless possibilities: 2 ...Qxc3 3.Rxd7+ followed by

4.bxc3, or 2...e5 3.Rxd4. Black should have played 1 ...KgB, which produces

a defendable position. TEST 24: White creates an absolute pin by temporarily sacrificing his Queen: l.QxfS+! KxfS 2.Ne6+ (forking Black's King and Queen; Black can't play 2. ..Nxe6 because his Knight is pinned to his King) 2 • • • Kf7

3.NxdS+. White wins the Exchange for a 2-point advantage.

TEST 25: White's l.Qxa7 is a pretty strong move, but he can smash Black completely with l .RdS+! because the forced 1.• . KxdS creates a pin on the Knight (the Black Queen's only defender). After 2.Qxc6, Black gives up. This example demonstrates an important principle: A piece that is suffering under an absolute pin can't defend anything. TEST 26: Warning: Even absolute pins can be broken! After the blunder

1.. . Qxf6??, White plays 2.Rxc5!. Suddenly Black's pin is gone! Notice that

2. ..bxc5 is a bad idea because of 3.Bxf6, so Black must move his Queen and

accept the loss of a piece. TEST 27: Far from it! Black loses a whole Knight to l.Qxe4!, which makes use of the pin against Black's d5-pawn. If Black defends his Queen, the White Queen retreats to safety. and 1 ...dxe4 2.Rxd7 is also quite hopeless for Black. TEST 28: If you said "Yes," then you fell for my trap! Making use of the relative pin on the bl-h7 diagonal with l.Nxg4?? looks promising (the f5-pawn can't move because of Bxg6) until Black bashes you with 1...Bh5! and an absolute counter-pin! White's shortsighted greed then costs him his Knight.

B-lahcek i sw cooumldp leikllee dto t o move, but any move he makes will say "Pass," but cannot legally do so. CHAPTER TWENTy-FOUR: Solutions to Tests from Part 1 He has to move something. He can't move the e7-Knight without hanging the other c6-Knight. He can't move the c6-Knight because Bxd7 10ses the Queen. If he moves either of his Rooks, Bxc6 picks up the Knight. And ifhe plays 4... Ke8 or 4... Qe8, White will play 5.b5 for a deadly pin along the c-file. The best choice for Black is pawn moves on the Kingside, but he would eventually run out of these and be forced to make a self-destructive move. With these grin1 thoughts runni ng through his mind, Black resigns the game. (Allhe has to do is tip over his King, shake hands, and his problems are solved!) This position is a wonderful example of the power of a pin along an open file and of how the doubling of Rooks (or even tripling, with the Queen, as we saw here) increases the pin's strength. Chapter Four Tests TEST 34: Though White has a strong skewer available with l.Bb3+ followed by 2.Bxf7, this move turns out to be only second best. Correct is the game ending 1.Qf5 Checkmate! Just because you have the opportunity for a powerful skewer, pin, or fork doesn't mean you have to play it. Take your time and look for something even better. The skewer, pin, or fork won't run away while you're scouting around. TEST 35: White can take his pick of skewers. Both 1.Be8 followed by the capture of one of the Rooks and 1 .Ra5+ Kd6 2.Rxb5 Kxd7 leave White with a one-pawn advantage. TEST 36: White has three diff erent skewer possibilities. He can play 1.Qc2+, skewering Black's King and Bishop; or 1.Qe2+, skewering Black's King and Rook; or 1.Qg2+, skewering Black's King and Queen. White should play

1.Qg2+ because the Queen is the most valuable piece. Note that l.Qb4+

wins the Black Rook but is a fork, not a skewer. 21 1 PART 3: More Tests and Solutions Chapter Five Tests TEST 37: Black plays 1 ...Rc4+!, which forces 2.Qxc4. The White Queen then takes away allof the Black King's remaining squares. As you can see, your King does not have to start out in a stalemated position. By bringing your opponent's pieces closer to your King, you can make your opponent create the stalemate himself by taking away the only squares that were available to your King. But be careful when creating stalemates. You can easily set yourself up for a checkmate instead! TEST 38: The first idea is poor, but the mystery move is l .Bd4+!, which forks Black's King and Bishop and forces 1. .. Bxd4, stalemating White's King and ensuring a draw. TEST 39: It is a big mistake because White can now save the game with

2.QxgS+!, forcing 2 .. .fxg5, which makes the h4·square uninhabitable. Also

note that the g3-pawn can't move because it's pinned by the Black Queen. Instead of the terrible l...Rg5??, Black could have played l...Qh5+ (getting rid of all stalemate possibilities once and for all) 2.Kg2 Qd5+. Then a forced exchange of Queens leads to an easily won endgame. The exchanging of pieces when ahead in force is called simplification. When you have a large advantage in material, trading pieces is often a good strategy because you destroy your opponent's hopes of counterplay. Because Black is on the attack, an even better approach than simplification is 1...Kg7!, which makes

2. ..

3.Kh2 Qh1+! 4.Kg3 (4.Kxhl is an immediate stalemate) 4 ... Qxg2+!, which

forces White to capture Black's remaining piece. A draw follows. CHAPTER TWENTy-FoUR: Solutions to Tests from Part 1 TEST 42: White is hoping for 2 ••• Qxg3??, when suddenly his King is stale mated and all he needs to do is jettison his remaining two pieces. He plays

3.Qg8+! Kxg8 4.Rxg7+!. Now 4 ...Kxg7 or 4 ... Qxg7 leads to a stalemate,

and 4. .. Kfs 5.Rf7+! Kes 6.Re7+! also gets Black nowhere. White will keep offering the Rook until a stalemate occurs. TEST 43: Ifs checkmate after l.Qxh7 +! Bxh7 (this Bishop can't move now because it is pinned by the Rook on hI) 2.Ng6. Note that the immediate l.Ng6+ Bxg6 fails. TEST 44: White draws immediately by playing l .Re8+ Rxe8 2.Qxe8+ Kh7 3.Qh5+ Kg8 4.Qe8+, forcing a repetition. TEST 45: Black's King cannot cross over the d-file boundary because of White's Rook on d5. The King also happens to be trapped on the 1st rank because of White's other Rook on h7. White can draw by using his Knight to harass the Black King: l.Nf6+ Kf8 2.Nd7+ Kg8 3.Nf6+, and so on. TEST 46: Black can force a draw with 1.•• Nxg5! (preparing a forced entry into White's King position) 2.hxg5 Nxd5!! (creating a double attack) . Black now threatens 3 ... Nxc3 or 3 ... Qxg5+. The first threat is more trouble some, so White must capture the Black Knight Play continues with 3.Nxd5 Qxg5+ 4.Khl Qh4+ 5.Kgl Qg5+ 6.Khl, producing a draw. TEST 47: Black has a pretty way to save himself with 1. •. Rxh2+! 2.Kgl (White would lose after 2.Kxh2? Rxf2+, with a quick checkmate) 2 • • •Qxg3 +! (a nice way to connect the Rooks on the 7th rank) 3.fxg3 Rag2+ 4.Kf1 Rf2+ resulting in a draw. TEST 48: Kick the door open with l .Qxh7 +! Kxh7 2.Rh3 Checkmate. TEST 49: White gets crushed by 1.•. Qxg3+! because after2.Kxg3, the King's cover is destroyed and the King is in a vulnerable position with few available moves. When the dB-Bishop joins in with 2 • • •Bh4, the game is over because checkmate has been called! 21 3 PART 3: More T esls and Soiulions TEST 50: White starts to sacrifice his pieces in an effort to expose the Black King: 1.Rxf6! gxf6 2.Qg4 (threatening to move the g6-Knight for a strong discovered check) 2 •••f5 (attacking the Queen and attempting to keep the White Rook out of the battle. Black avoids 2 .. .fxe5 3.Nxe5+ Khs 4.Nf7 Checkmate) 3.Ne7++ (White's Queen is still safe because Black's King is in a double check) 3 ••• Kf8 4.Nxf5!! (tearing down the wall). Now White's remaining pieces will hunt down Black's undefended King: 4 • • •Bxf5

5.Rxf5+! (material no longer matters because White wants checkmate and

nothing but checkmate!) 5 ••• exf5 6.Qxf5+ Ke7 7.Qf7+ Kd6 8.Qd7 Checkmate (or 6 ... Kg7 7.Qg6+ Khs S.Nf7 Checkmate). A good demonstra tion of the power of the discovered check! TEST 51: By sacrificing my Rook with 1... Rxc2+!, I strip White's King of all protection. Play continues like this: 2.Kxc2 Rc8+ 3.Nc3 (the King's stroll with 3.Kd3 fails to 3 ...Qb5+ 4.Ke3 Qxa4, when I have full material equality plus a very strong attack. Play with this position to understand why White's King is not happy. One possible sequence is 5.Kf2 Rc2 6.Qd3 Qf4+, and a win for Black) 3 •••d4 4.Rbl Qc6! (building the pressure against the c3·Knight) 5.Rb3 Nd5 (bringing the Knight into the battle and continuing to bash away at the c3-Knight) 6.Nbl Bg4! (now all my pieces are taking part in the fight) 7.Qh2 (the Bishop is taboo: 7.Qxg4?? Ne3+ forks the King and Queen) 7 ... dxc3. 1 now have complete material equality (a Bishop plus two pawns, worth a total of 5 points, vs. a Rook, also worth 5 points) and a very strong attack (. .. Bf5+ is in the air) . I will win in a few more moves. TEST 52: By sacrificing his Queen, White forces the Black King to embark on a death march: l.Qxh7+!! Kxh7 2.Nxf6++ (the Knight can't be cap tured because the King is attacked by both the Knight and the Bishop-a double check) 2 ••• Kh6 (stepping back with 2 ... Khs is not advisable because the King is then stalemated, and any check, such as 3.Ng6, is checkmate)

3.Neg4+ Kg5 4.h4+ Kf4 5.g3+ Kf3 (a noble gesture, but it's very unusual

for a King to lead its whole army into battle because the front line faces the fiercest fights-here, the King turns out to be the first major casualty) CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR: Solutions to Tests from Part 1

6.Be2+ Kg2 7.Rh2+ Kgl S.Kd2 Checkmate. The White King is not

actually delivering checkmate here. It merely steps out of the way of the Rook on al. Thus, we have a very rare discovered checkmate. Heed the warning: This fate often awaits adventurous Kings! TEST 53: Black loses after 1.•• Rxa2 because the e8·square is covered only twice. After 2.Qxc7! Qxc7 3.ReS, White conquers the back rank for checkmate. A much safer first move for Black is 1...g6, when White has to take the threat of 2 ...Rxa2 seriously. Best of all is 1 ...Ne6! blocking the e-file, preparing ...Ra8xa2. TEST 54: A terrible move is 1... Qxa2?, which allows 2.Ral. The Queen is then pinned and lost If Black tries to wriggle free with a move like 2 • • • Qxb2, White plays 3.RaS for a back rank checkmate. TEST 55: This time it doesn't work! After 1.Qe8+ Rxe8 2.RxeS+, Black can safely block the check with 2 ••• BfS, when White has insufficient compensation for his sacrificed Queen. TEST 56: The greedy pawn grab l ••• Qxa2?? loses to 2.Qe8+! Rxe8 (2 ...Bf8

3.Qxd8 leaves White with an extra Rook) 3.Rxe8+ BfS 4.Bh6!. The pin

means Black is powerless to prevent 5.RxfS Checkmate. Chapter Six Tests TEST 57: White can win a pawn with l .Nxe5! because Black's Bishop is overworked as the sole defender of both the pawn and the Knight. After l • • •Bxe5, White has successfully lured the defender away from the Knight, and 2.Rxh4 safely recaptures the piece. TEST 58: With 1.•• Qe3!, Black wins at once. The idea is to pull the Rook from its important defensive post on h3. White resigns because 2.Rxe3 allows 2 ... Rh2+ followed by 3 ...Reg2 Checkmate, and 2.Rxf2 succumbs to 2 ... Qxh3+ 3.Kgl Qg3+ 4.Rg2 Qxg2 Checkmate. Note that 2.Rh4 Qf3+ is also deadly. PART 3 : More Tests and Solutions TEST 59: By deflecting the Queen of course! With a little thought, you should be able to come up with l.Rxc8!, which draws the Queen away from the protection of the f6-Bishop. Black resigns rather than face 1 .. .Qxc8

2.Nxf6+ (I already have a lead of 6 points vs. 5, but to top it off 1 am fork

ing Black's King and Rook) 2 • • • Kg7 3.Nxd7, and 1 will end up with an extra piece. TEST 60: With l.Bd5!, 1 brought my extra piece into the attack. This move threatens some big discovered checks, attacks Black's Rook, and attempts to draw the Queen away from the protection of the e8-square (1...Qxd5 Ieads to 2.Qe8 Checkmate) . Black replies with 1... Rg4+ 2.Kf2 Qc5 (preventing the possibility of3.Qe8 by pinning my Queen to my King) 3.Rxc7+!. Black resigns. He can save his Queen with 3 ...Qxd5, but then my Queen is freed from the pin, and 4.Qe8 Checkmate follows. TEST 61: White can snuff out allresistance with 1.Rb8!! and the threat of

2.Qg7 Checkmate. (The Rook can't take the Queen because it's pinned.)

Black has no good answer to this move because l...RxbB allows 2.Qg7 Checkmate, and l...Qxb8 runs into 2.Nxf7 Checkmate. Chapter Seven Tests TEST 62: White wins with l.Nxc6! bxc6 2.Rxd7, for an extra pawn. TEST 63: White can win a pawn with I.Nb6! axb6 2.axb6. The defender is forced to run away with 2 ••• Rcc8. After 3.Rxd7 Rxd7 4.Qxd7 Qxd7

5.Rxd7, White also enjoys a Rook on the 7th. Though this play is excellent

for White, even stronger is l.b4!, which leaves Black powerless to prevent

2.Nc5 (l...b6 2.axb6 axb6 3.Nxb6 is no help). By exploiting the pin in this

way, White makes even greater gains. TEST 64: White should activate his Rook with l.RdI!, taking over the all· important d·file and threatening to win a Knight with 2.Rd7 +, which forks the King and Knight. If White plays the slow and cowardly 1.a4 to free the CHAPTER TWENTY-FoUR: Solutions to Tests from Part 1 Rook from its duties as defender of the a-pawn, then l...Rd8 enables Black to claim rights to the Mile_ TEST 65: !fyou tried l.Rxh5 hoping for 1...gxh5?? 2.Qxh7 Checkmate, you lose any brownie points you might have gained {rom previous tests because Black plays l...Nxd3+ and your Bishop disappears from the board with check! Then 2.Kbl gxh5 3.Rxh5 allows 3 .. .f5, when the Queen defends the h7-pawn from c7. The correct answer is the surprising l.Qxh7+!!, to which Black responds t • . . Kxh7. White has created a pin along the b l-h7 diagonal that allows him to blast open the h-file with gain of tempo. After 2.Rxh5+, Black can't take the Rook because his g6-pawn is pinned by the Bishop. Black is checkmated after 2 . • . Kg7 3.Rh7+ Kg8 4.Rh8+ Kg7 5.Rth7. In this contest of attacks (Black threatens Nxd3) , White triumphs because all his moves come with check. TEST 66: White can win a whole piece with l.Rxc6! because t ...Bxc6? allows 2.Bc4+ Bd5 3.Bxd5 Checkmate. TEST 67: Playing 1 .. .Bxa4 wins a piece and stops the threatened Knight fork. Normally, this move would be ideal but it doesn't take White's tactical threats along the a2-g8 and al-h8 diagonals into account. White forces checkmate with 2.Qxf6+! Bxf6 3.Bxf6. TEST 68: This position is almost identical to the one in Testfil. In that case, White won by placing his Queen on c3 and forcing checkmate on the long diagonal. Here, White needs to get his Knight out of the way to do the same thing. After the unfortunate 1 ... b5?, White delightedly plays 2.Nxb5!. Black doesn't have time for 2...axb5 because 3.Qc3 produces an inevi- table checkmate. TEST 69: White eradicates all life on Black's side of the board with l.Rxe7!! (a clearance sacrifice-the Rook blocked White's real intentions so he throws it to the winds-see Chapter Ten for a more detailed explanation on this tactic) 1 . . .Qxe7 2.Qxc6+! bxc6 3.Ba6 Checkmate. 2 1 7 PART 3 : More Tests and Solutions Chapter Eight Tests TEST 70: Black wins after 1 . . • Bxg3! 2.hxg3 h2, when his h-pawn is crowned. TEST 71: By sacrificing his Rook with l.Rh5!!, White is able to pull Black's Rook away from the White pawns. Black gives up because after 1...Rxh5

2.fxe7, he cannot stop 3.e8=Q.

TEST 72: White turns his f-pawn into an unstoppable passed pawn after 1 . Qc8+ Kh7 2.Qxe6!. Black is down a Rook after 2 • • • fxe6 3.f7, and a new Queen is about to be born. He gives up. TEST 73: Strangely enough, Black actually wins this position! He can initi ate a breakthrough combination with 1 • • •f4! 2.004 (2.gxf4 h4! followed by

3...h3 Ieads to a quick Queen) 2 • • •h4! (threatening to queen with 3. ..h3 and

4.Rf7+ Kg8 5.Kg6 Qb1+ 6.R3f5 leads to 7.Rf8+ and a win.

[diagram]

1.g5+! Kxg5 2.Qf4.

TEST 60: Desperate measures are clearly called for because White will checkmate Black as soon as he gets a freemove. Black wants to get his Bishop to f3, so he plays 1 ... Qh 1 + n, forcing White's King to the unfortunate hi-square. After 2.Kxh1 Bf3+, Black puts his Bishop on f3 with a check and a gain of tempo. White is the one to be checkmated after 3.Kg1 Rdl. Chapter Ten Tests TEST 61 : Attacking the Bishop with 1...Ne7 gets Black nowhere because

2.Be4 or 2.Ba4 breaks the pin. If the b4-pawn were not in the way, Black

could play l...Nb4, forking the Queen and Bishop. If it's in the way, get rid of it! Black plays l.. .b3!, and White resigns, knowing that 2.axb3 Nb4 forks the Queen and Bishop. TEST 62: White sees that his Bishop needs the c7-square if his upcoming attack on Black's King is to be successful. Because his Rook is in the way, he forces Black to take it by playing l.Rc6+!, which leads to Bxc6 2.Nc5+ Ka5 3.Bc7 Checkmate. 2 1 9 PART 3: More Tests and Solutions TEST 83: White gets his Queen off the important h6-square with l .Qe6+!, after which either 1. ..Nxe6 or l. .. Bxe6 are met by 2.Nh6 Checkmate. Chapter Eleven Tests TEST 84: A big check awaits on the cl-square, based on the weakness of White's back rank. Black can knock White out with l.. .Bxa4!! (opening up the c8·Rook with a gain oftempo so that it can x·ray through to cO 2.Qxa4 Qcl +! 3.Rxcl Rxcl + 4.Qdl. Usually White would resign at this point. By playing on, White hopes for one of four things to happen: Black loses on time; Black fall s into a long-lasting, drug-induced sleep (the moral here is to never accept refreshments from your opponent); Black drops dead (believe it or not, this happens from time to time at chess tournaments, and to die at the chessboard is actuallyan ideal way to go for many chess fanatics); or reality as we know it comes to an end. In the absence of these setbacks, Black is free to conclude with 4 • • •Rxdl Checkmate. TEST 85: Yes, he can. With 1 ...Nxd3!, Black wins an important pawn, and with 2 ... c4, he intends to cement his Knight on the d3-square. If White tries to take the Knight with 2.Rxd3, Black wins with a nice x-ray: 2 ...Qxdl +!

3.Qxdl (3.Rxdl leads to Rxdl+ 4.Qxdl Rxdl Checkmate) 3 ...

Rxd3. Now both 4.Qe2 Rdl+ and 4.00 Rdl lead to the capture of White's Queen and a subsequent Rook vs. Bishop advantage (2 points). TEST 86: White can create a windmill with l.Qxg7+! Nxg7 2.Rxg7+ Kh8 3.Rxd7+ Kg8 4.Rg7+ Kh8 5.Rxb7+ Kg8 6.Rxb2, after which White is suddenly up a full piece! TEST 87: White could set up a windmill with l.Qe7 +! Nxe7 2.Rxe7 + Qb7

3.Rxb7+ Ka8 4.Rxb5+ Ka7 5.Rh7+ Ka8 6.Rd7+ Kb8 7.Rxdl, after

which Black has lost all his pieces. CHAPTER TWENTY-FoUR: Solutions to Tests from Part 1 Chapter Thirteen Tests TEST 88: Strangely enough, 1. Qxb7 leads to a forced draw because Black is able to create a perpetual pursuit of the White Queen. After I .. .RbS

2.Qxc6 RcS 3.Qa6 Ra8 4.Qb5 Rb8, Black simply continues to attack the

White Queen until the draw is agreed upon. TEST 89: If White plays l.e4??, Black creates a blockade with I . .. dxe4

2.dxe4 Nxe4+! 3.fxe4 Rxe4, followed by ... Rc4 and .. . Ra4. Then White's

King can never get over the 4th-rank banier. TEST 90: White can squeeze a draw by giving up his remaining piece to create a fortress: 1.&7+!! Rxa7 2.b6 RaS 3.Kc3 (having completely closed the Queenside, White must rush over to the other wing and try to keep the enemy Rook from penetrating on the g-file) 3• • •Bxg4 4.Kd2 Kc8

5. Kel Kd7 6.Kfl Rg8 7.Kgl! Bh5+ S.Khl!. The game is a draw because

neither the Black King nor the Bishop can penetrate White's position, and if the Black Rook stays on the g-file with B ... Rg2, the game ends in stalemate. TEST 91 : With 1 .•• Bxf5! 2.Kxf5 KhS, Black can reach a basic draw. See Diagram 121 for a detailed explanation. TEST 92: Show White that you had it all worked out and were never really in trouble by playing 1 .•• Nxg4! 2.Nxg4 Bxg4 3.Kxg4 Kf6 followed by ... Kg7 and ... KhB. The game is a draw·because the h-pawn is crowned on the opposite color to the Bishop. Review the position in Diagram 123 for a reminder of why White cannot win here.

CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE

[diagram]
Solutions to Tests from Part 3 The tests i n Part 3 are different from those in Part 1. First, they are far more difficult and have no clues explaining which tactics to look for. Second, they are part of a larger picture. As you read the following solutions, you'll notice that I've assigned each problem a certain number of points, and I suggest that you keep a written record of your score. At the end of this chapter is a chart you can use to determine how well you absorbed the information I presented. No matter how you fared, I hope this book has helped you appreciate the beautiful world of tactics and combinations and that you will one day produce your own brilliancies. Chapter Twenty-One Tests , TEST 93: Here we have two themes: back rank checkmate and destruction of a defender. White checkmates with l.Qxd6+! (destroying the defender of e8) 1 .••Qxd6 2.Re8. Value: 1 point. . TEST 94: Black's undefended Queen enables White to launch a discovered attack with l.Bh7 +! Kxh7 2.Qxd4. after which White's material advantage should give him an easy victory. Value: 1 point. • TEST 95: This position demonstrates two kinds of forks. White is doubled on the dile, but at the moment, this file is blocked. After l.Bxe5+! (which forks the King and Rook) , White opens the c-file with again oftempo. PART 3: More Tests and Solutions Black can now choose between the loss of the Exchange with 1...Kg8

2.Bxb8, or the loss ofthe Queen with l...Nxe5 2.Rc7+ (which forks the King

and Queen) . Value: 2 points. s TEST 96: At a glance, things look hopeless for Black. He is down an Exchange, and his pawn structure is awful. White is hoping for l...Qxf5?

2.Qxc3, with which he would technically win the game. Unfortunately for

White, he forgets that his back rank is weak and his Queen is undefended. He gives up after 1. •.Rb3!! because 2.axb3 Qxd2 and 2.Qcl Rxbl 3.Qxbl Qxf5 give Black a decisive material advantage. (Both 2.Qxa5 Rxbl+ and

2.Rdl Qxd2 3.Rxd2 Rbl+ lead to checkmate.) Value: 2 points.

• TEST 97: Here we have another back rank situation. If Black's Queen were not defending his Rook, then Rxf8 would be checkmate. With this in mind, White plays l.Qe5!, with the double threat of 2.Qxg7 Checkmate and 2.Qxc5, which grabs a Queen. Black has to resign because l...Qxe5 takes his Queen away from his Rook and allows 2.RxfB Checkmate. Value: 2 points. TEST 98: A hasty player might slide home with 1.cB=Q?? and expect his opponent to give up. However, Black's King would then be stalemated and the shocking l...Qxb2+!! would deliver both a draw and a harsh dose of reality. White sees this possibility and makes a point of freeing the Black King and stopping any stalemates with I .Rc4!. Then Black cann ot prevent

2.cS-Q. Value: For 1.c8=Q??, -lpoint; for 1.Rc4. 2 points.

TEST 99: This position is silly, but it is a good demonstration of the power of a double check. Believe it or not, just 12 moves produce a forced checkmate, as follows: l .Rf2++ Ke3 2.Rf3++ Ke4 3.Re3++ Kd4

4.Re4++ Kd5 5.Rd4++ Kc5 6.Rd5++ Ke6 7.Re5++ Kb6 S.Rc6++

[diagram]

2.Qxel Rh2 is checkmate. Value: 1 point

TEST 1 02: All of Black's pieces are undefended, and his back rank is weak. Small wonder that White can find a tactic: l.Qe5!. Black gives up because l...Qf6 2.Qxf4! Qxf4 3.Rd8+ is a quick checkmate (l ...Qxe5 2.Rd8+ also leads to checkmate) . Value: 1 point. TEST 103: White's h6-Bishop is guarded once and attacked once. If I could play ...Qh4+, I would fork his King and Bishop, but atthe moment my Knight is in the way. The answer then is to shove it aside with gain of tempo:

1... Nxe4! 2.Nxe4 Qh4+ 3.g3 Qxh6 4.O-O-O Qxd2+. My extra pawn

eventually leads to the win. Value: 1 point. TEST 1 04: White's threatofRxf7+is deadly. However, the simple 1. .. Qxf4! destroys the pin and frees the Black pieces. After 2.gxf4, Black can take advantage of the position of the White Queen by playing 2 ...Bg8. The Queen is then trapped, and Black ends up with a decisive material advan tage. Value: 2 points. TEST 1 05: Whenever I see a King in the center, I look for possible checks against it Here, I captured White's center pawns by creating the following fork: 1 .. .Nxd4! 2.Nxd4 Qh4+ 3.g3 Qxd4, with the e5·pawn next to fall. Value: 1 point. PART 3 : More Tests and Solutions TEST 106: White seems to be in trouble. He can't play l.Bxg5 because his Bishop is pinned to his King. Another poor move is 1.Bxd4?? because Qxd2 captures the White Queen. The pins are a bother, but with LQxd4!, White can break them both. Black then resigns because 1...cxd4 2.Bxg5 leaves White with an extra piece. Value: 1 point. TEST 107: With the pretty l .QhB+!, White can create a fork. Black resigns because 1...KxhS 2.Nxf7 + Kg7 3.Nxg5 leaves him with a hopeless endgame. Value: 1 point. Chapter Twenty-Two Tests • TEST 1 08: The only thing stopping Qg5 Checkmate is Black's Queen, so White upsets Black's defense of this square with I.Re5!' Now 1 ...dxe5 allows 2.Qg5 Checkmate, so Black chooses an alternative: L •• Rbl + 2.Kg2 Qxe5 3.Bxe5 dxe5 4.Qe4+ Kf6 5.f41. White wins in another ten moves. Value: 2 points . . TEST 1 09: White wins beautifully by first stalemating the Black King and then making use of a discovered-check tactic: LRhB+!! NxhB (hemming in Black's King with his own Knight) 2.Qh7+! (forcing Black's King onto the diagonal occupied by White's light-squared Bishop) 2 •••Kxh7 3.Rh5++ (forcing the King back into its stalemated hole with a double check) 3 • • • KgB 4.Bh7 Checkmate. Value: 3 points. TEST 1 1 0: Black notices that with 1...Nf3, he can attack White's Queen. Unfortunately, White can simply move the Queen to safety. However, if White's King were on gl or h2, then ... Nf3 would be a fork. Black's plan, then, is to force White's King onto one of the squares where the ...Nf3 fork can occur: 1 •••Rdl+ 2.Kg2 Rgl+!. Now both 3.Kxgl and 3.Kh2 allow

3. ..Nf3+ with a fork on the King and Queen, so White resigns. Value: 2 points.

CHAPTER TWENTY·FIVE: Solutions to Tests from Pan 3 TEST 1 1 1 : The Black Rook on e7 is attacked once and defended once. If White could attack it just one more time, he could win it With l.Nxg6+!, he gets what he wants. Now l...Qxg6 leaves the Rook on e7 without a defender, and 1...hxg6 allows White to create a double-attack fork with

2.Qh4+. Then both the e7·Rook and the King are being hit, and Black is

[diagram]

7.Kd6 Rxc2. Then Black's material advantage gives him an easy win.

Value: 4 points. TEST 1 14: The first part of the solution to this test is based on the fact that Black's c6·Knight cannot move without losing the Queen on a5. The final part is a fork at the end of the game. This is the solution: l.Nde5+!! fxe5

2.Nxe5+ Kf6 (2 ...Ke7 10ses to both 3.Nxc6+ and 3.Qxc6! Nxc6 4.Nxc6+, the

winning move) 3.Qxa5 Nxa5 4.Rxb8! RhxbS 5.RxbS Rxb8 6.Nd7+ Ke7 7.NxbS. White emerges with a winning endgame. Value: 5 points. TEST 1 15: With Black's Bishop and Queen lined up on the long open diagonal, White's King is precariously placed. If Black could somehow open the a-file, then a Rook check would finish off the poor King. Black first PART 3 : More Tests and Solutions sacrifices an Exchange with 1 .• • Rexc7! in order to make the as-square available to the cS-Rook. Then 2.bxc7 Nb4+! (forcing the opening of the a-file) 3.axb4 Ra8+ 4.KbI Ral achieves checkmate. Value: 4 points. TEST 1 16: I won this game by setting Black up for a Bishop fork. Here's how: 1.fxe5! Bxe5 (1...fxe5? 2.Bg5+ forces the capture of materia\)

2.Nxb6! Nxb6 3.Bxc5+ Kd7 4.Bxb6, and my material advantage leads

to an easy win. Value: 3 points. TEST 1 1 7: Both Kings are feeling the heat, and it's just a matter of which one will be the firstto be checkmated. Seeing that Black threatens l...Re4+, White realizes that she has no time for Quiet moves. Aware of the power of doubled Rooks on the 7th, she plays 1.Qg7+! Kxg7 2.Rfxf7+ (doubling the Rooks on the 7th with tempo) 2 ... Kg8 3.Rg7+ Kb8 4.Rh7+ KgB

5.Rbg7 Checkmate. Value: 3 points.

TEST 1 1 8: Black's Queen is undefended, making this combination possi ble: I.Qh3! (threatening 2.Qh7 Checkmate) l. .. Kxf7 2.Qh7+ Ke8

3.Qh8+ Kd7 4.Qxb8, and White wins. Value: 2 points.

TEST 1 1 9: Black would love to play l...Qdl Checkmate, but his Bishop is in the way. This neat space-clearing sacrifice enables Black to get his way: I ... Bf5! (blocking the Queen's access to dl. Now both 2.Qxf5 and 2.Nxf5 lose to 2 ... Qdl Checkmate) 2.Qf3 Bd3!+ (forcing the King to give up control of the el-square). White resigns because both 3.KgI ReI and 3.Qxd3 Qdl are checkmate. Value: 2 points. TEST 1 20: White sees the possibility of Rxb7+ Checkmate and heads right for it with I.RbI!. Because 2.Qxb6 Checkmate is threatened and because l...Qxc5 loses to 2.Rxb7 Checkmate, Black has no choice but to play

1. .. Nd7, defending his Queen and attacking White's Queen on c5. Now the

(avoiding l ...hxg6 2.Nxg6 Checkmate) . White takes off the h7-pawn with

2.Qxh7!, making the g6-sQuare available to his Knight Black resigns

because 2 ...Nxh7 3.Ng6 is checkmate. Value: 3 points. TEST 1 24: White can force checkmate in nine moves by drawing Black's King out into the open. Here's how: l.Qh6+!! Kxh6 (l...KhS leads to

2.Qxh7+! Kxh7 3.hxg6++ Kg7 4.Rh7+ Checkmate) 2.hxg6+ Kg5 3.Rh5+!

(a sacrifice that allows the f-pawn and the Bishop to join in the attack with gain of tempo) 3• • • Kxh5 4.f4+ Nxe2 5.Nf6+ (an important move that keeps Black's King away from g4) 5 • • • Kh6 6.Rh! + Kg7 7.Ne8+! (drawing the Rook away from the defense of the f7-pawn) 7 ••• Rxe8 8.Rxh7 + Kf6

9.Rxf7 Checkmate. Value: 4 points if you saw the whole scenario. Give

PARl 3: More Tests and Solutions yourself 1 point if you found l.Qh6+, 2 points if you also found 3.RhS+, and 3 points if you then found 414+. TEST 1 is: I had been playing for this position for some time. The audience was convinced that Black had everything defended, but I had this possibility of a Knight fork and an easy winning ending: 1.Bxe6+! Bxe6 2.Qf8+! Kxt8

3.Nxe6+ Ke7 4.Nxc7. Now Black has the choice oflosing his dS·pawn or

protecting it with 4 ...Kd6, which allows S.Ne8+, forking yet another pawn. Black chooses to resign instead. Value: 2 points. TEST 1 21>: White can pursue a powerful checkmating attack with 1.Nf6+ (stalemating the Black King) 1... KhS 2.Qg6!! (spectacular! White's Queen is hanging in two ways, and his Knight onf6 is also hanging. The immediate threat is 3.Qxh7 Checkmate) 2 ...Qc2 (defending the h7-pawn-alI de- fenses by captures lose: 2. ..hxg6 3.Rh3 Checkmate; 2 .. .fxg6 3.Nxg6+! hxg6

Black's Queen) 3.Rh3! Qxg6 (3 ... fxg6 is met by 4.Rxh7 Checkmate)

4.Nxg6+ fxg6 5.Rxh7 Checkmate. Value: 4 points. If you saw 1.Qg6. give

yourself 1 point. If you also saw that all defenses by captures lose for Black, give yourself 2 points, and if you spotted the 2. .. Qc2 defense, give yourself 3 points. TEST 1 27: White's Knight is trapped. He could give up his remaining pawn to save the Knight with Us? Kg3 2.Ng6 Kg4 3.Ne7 BxfS, producing a draw. However, by using the double-attack and discovered-check tactics, White can save everything and win the game. Here's how: 1.Bc7! Kg3 2.Ng6! Bxg6 3.f5+ (threatening both King and Bishop) 3...Kg4 4.fxg6, giving White a new Queen. Value: 3 points. TEST 1 28: A series of pins signals the end for White: 1. .. Rg5+ 2.Rg2 Qc5+

3.Qf2 (3.Khl leads to RhS+ 4.Rh2 ReeS!, after which the threat of

S. .. Rxh2+ followed by 6. .. RhS is decisive) 3 ...Re2!! 4.Rxg5 (4.QxcS results in Rgxg2+ S.Khl Rh2+ 6.Kgl Reg2 Checkmate) 4 ...Qxg5+. White resigns. Value: 4 points. CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE: Solutions to Tests from Part 3 TEST 1 29: At first, this position looks rather dull. There is no hint of suspense in the air. However, after 1.f7! Kg7 2.fS-Q+! Kxfs 3.Rfl+, Black is lost because of this very nice pin: 3 ••• Kg7 (playing 3. .. Ke7 means White wins a Rook with 4.Rfel!) 4.Rg2+ Kh6 5.Rhl+ Rh3 6.Rgh2!. White achieves his objective of winning a Rook. Value: 4 points. TEST 1 30: Black uses two types of pins to attack the White King: 1..• Ng4+!

2.hxg4 Qxg4 (threatening 3 ... Qh4+ Checkmate) 3.00 Qh4+ (enjoying

the fact that White's g3-Bishop is pinned to his King and that he can force another pin) 4.Bh3 Bd7 (exploiting the second pin) 5.Khl Bxg3 6.Rxg3 Qxg3 7.Bxd7 Qel+ S.Kh2 Qe2+, the goal of the combination. After

9.Qxe2 fxe2, Black crowns a new Queen. Note that this finish is a demon

stration of the power of a passed pawn_ Value: 4 points. Give yourself 2 points if you got as far as 4 ... Bd7, but you must have seen 8 ... Qe2+ at the end to get the full 4 points. TEST 1 31 : This very difficult combination is based on a series of pins and ends in a fork. The obvious l.h8=Q?? Bxg6+ 2.Kal Be7! leads to a threat of 3 ... Bf6+, with a deadly attack. White cann ot forestall this possibility with

3.Nf3 because 3. ..Bf6+ 4.Ne5+ Ke7 gives Black the better position. If White

is to be successful, he must play the surprising l.Nf4!!. This suicidal looking move draws the g-pawn away from the defense of the h4-square and allows White the possibility of this strange pin: l • • • g,cr4 2.hS-Q Bg6+

3.Kal Be7 4.Nf3 Bf6+ 5.Ne5+ Ke7 6.Qxh4!! (the goal ofl.Nf4: White's

sixth move is not possible with Black's pawn on gS) 6• • •Bxh4 (forestalling

7.Qxf4 and an easy win for White) 7.Nxg6+ S.Nxh4, and a win for White.

Value: 5 points. If you saw that 1.h8=Q is good for Black, give yourself 1 point, but if you didn't find l.Nf4, you get no further credit. TEST 132: At first glance, this position looks completely hopeless for White because he can't prevent Black from crowning his h2-pawn with check. However, White has only one pawn that can move, so he plays for stalemate PART 3 : More Tests and Solutions with l.h7+ Kh8 2.Bg7+ Kxh7 (now White has no more pawn moves, but his King seems to have plenty of places to go to) 3.Bal +! (excellent-this move takes the aI-square away from the White King and simultaneously deprives the Bishop of any moves) 3 • • • Kg6 4.Rxc6+ Khs S.Kh2!! (the goal of White's play: when Black promotes his pawn, White's King will have no legal moves) S•••hI-Q (forced, because White threatens to stop the promotion with RcI; White now gets rid of his last mobile piece) 6.Rh6+! Kxh6 Stalemate! Value: 5 points. A tough test! What's more, you get credit only for the answer given! TEST 1 33: White can force checkmate by placing Black's King in a stale mated position so that any check is checkmate. This is the solution: l.QgS+!! BxgS 2.hxgS+ KhS (Black thinks he is safe because the pinned pawn prevents White from playing g4) 3.Rh8! (threatening ...Rxh7 Check mate) 3 • • •Qxh8 (abandoning the pin) 4.g4 Checkmate. Value: 3 points. TEST 1 34: The enticing 1. .. Rxc3?? looks like a winning possibility, but it is actually a losing blunder. Black sees that2.Qxc3?? Qb I leads to checkmate and 2.bxc3?? Qxc2 drops the White Queen. So how can such a first move be bad? Look to Black's back rank for the answer: 2.Rd8+ BfS 3.Bf4!! (giving the White King a place to run to and also threatening 4.Bh6 with a quick checkmate) 3• • •QaS (after 3 ... QaI+ 4.Kh2 Rxc2 5.Bh6, Black will be check mated) 4.Rxf8+ Kxf8 S.Qxc3. Down a piece, Black gives up after a few more moves. Value: 3 points. TEST 1 35: Black expects the defensive l.Be2, but instead White shatters the pin by jumping to the attack: l.NxeS! Bxdl 2.BbS+ c6 (after 2 ...Nd7

3.Bxd7+ Qxd7 4.Nxd7, White ends up with an extra piece) 3.dxc6 (threat

ening discovered checks with 4.c7 or 4.cxb7) 3• • •Qb6 (also hopeless for Black is 3 ...a6, which leads to a White win after 4.c7+ axbs 5.cxd&=Q+ Rxds

6.Nxdl) 4.cxb7+ QxbS S.bxa8-Q+. Black resigns. Value: 3 points.

CHAPTER TWENTy-FIVE: Solutions to Tests from Part 3 TEST 1 36: A celebrated combination. The great Rubinstein starts by sacri ficing some pieces to draw White's Queen away from the defense of the e4-Bishop: 1. .. Rxc3!! 2.gxh4 (2.Bxc3?? leads t02_ ..Bxe4+, when Black can't recapture on e4 because of ...Qxh2 Checkmate) 2 ...Rd2!! (the second shock) 3.Qxd2 (3.Bxc3 loses instantly to 3 ... Bxe4+ 4.Qxe4 Rxh2 Check mate; a similar result occurs with 3.Bxb7 Rxe2 4.Bg2 Rh3! 5.Bxh3 Rxh2 Checkmate and with 3.Qxg4 Bxe4+ 4.Rf3 Rxf3 5.Qg2 RfI+ 6.Rxfl Bxg2 Checkmate) 3 ...Bxe4+ 4.Qg2 Rh3! White resigns because he cannot defend against checkmate on h2. Value: 5 points. If you found L..Rxc3 and

2. .. Rd2, give yourself I point If you also worked out the consequences of all

the lines other than 3.Qxd2, give yourself2 points. If you saw the tricks with Rh3, take 4 points. TEST 1 37: White starts a magnificent combination based on the poorly defended Black Queen, the vulnerable Black King, and the loosely defended Black Rook on c8. The c8-Rook is attacked by White's ci-Rook and x-rayed by White's Queen. Here's how: l.Rxe7+!! Kf8! (countering with a threat of back rank checkmate-now every White piece is hanging; worse was l...Qxe7 2.RxcS+ RxcS 3.Qxc8+, with an easy win; also hopeless was 1...Kxe7

2.Rel+ Kd63.Qb4+ Kc7 4.Ne6+ KbS 5.Qf4+ and a win for White) 2.Rf7+! Kg8

(2... Qxf7 is still impossible because 3.Rxc8+ wins a Rook) 3.Rg7+! (the indestructible Rook makes a funny impression; if Black captures the Rook with his King, White captures Black's Queen with check) 3 ... Klt8

4.Rxh7+!. At this point, Von Bardeleben realized he had lost and stormed

out of the tournament hall. He didn't return and forfeited the game. Steinitz then showed the spectators how the game would have ended: 4.... Kg8

5.Rg7+ Klt8 (5. . . KfS leads to the winning 6.Nh7+ Kxg7 7.Qxd7+) 6.Qh4+

Kxg7 7.Qh7+ Kf8 8.Qh8+ Ke7 9.Qg7+ Ke8 10.Qg8+ Ke7 1 1.Qf7+ Kd8 12.Qf8+ Qe8 13.Nf7+ Kd7 14.Qd6 Checkmate. Value: 5 points. Give yourself 1 point for LRxe7, another point for realizing that 3 ... KhS is forced and that 3 ... Kfs allows the winning 4.Nxh7+ Ke8 5.Nxf6+. Give yourself a third point for sacrificing a Rook with 6.Qh4+.

Glossary Active: In relation to an opponent's style, denotes a preference for aggressive or tactical types of play. Otherwise, means an aggressive move or position. Advantage: A net superiority of position, usually based on force, time, space, or pawn structure. Algebraic notation: Many ways of writing chess moves have been devised over the years. In fact, there are probably as many ways of writing chess moves as there are languages. However, algebraic notation has become the international standard. Essentially, each square on the chessboard is given a letter and a number. The files are assigned the letters a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h, from left to right from White's perspective. The ranks are assigned the numbers 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, from bottom to top from White's perspective. Thus, the bottom left corner is square al and the top right comer is square hs. When a piece travels from one square to another, algebraic notation enables you to identify the piece and the square to which it is moving. FOI· example, if the Rook moves from square al to square a8, you write Ra8. For pawn moves, you write only the square to which the pawn moves; for example, e4. Castling Kingside is written O-O, and castling Queenside is written O-O·0. In this book, algebraic notation is sometimes referred to as chessnotation or simply notation. Analysis: The calculation of a series of moves based on a particular position. In tournament play, you are not allowed to move the pieces during analysis but must make all calculations in your head. When the game is over, opponents commonly analyze the game they have just played, moving the pieces about in an effort to discover what the best moves would have been.

Annotation: Written comments about a position or game. The comments can take the form of narrative, chess notation, or a combination of both. Attack: To start an aggressive action in a particular area of the board, or to threaten to capture a piece or pawn. Battery: Doubling Rooks on a file or a Queen and a Bishop on a diagonal creates a battery. Berserker: A playing style characterized by frenzied attacks with one or two pieces. Named after ancient Scandinavian warriors who worked themselves up into battle frenzies and then charged their opponents with little regard for strategy or personal danger. Bishop pair: Two Bishops vs. a Bishop and a Knight or two Knights. Two Bishops work well together because they can control diagonals of both colors. See also Opposite-colored Bishops. Blockade: To stop an enemy pawn by placing a piece (ideally a Knight) directly in front of it. Popularized by Aaron Nimzovich. Blunder: A terrible move that loses material or involves decisive positional or tactical concessions. Breakthrough: Denotes a penetration of the enemy position. Calculation of variations: The working out of chains of moves without physically moving the pieces. Castle: A player castles by moving his King and Rook simultaneously. Castling is the only move in which a player can deploy two pieces in one move. Castling allows a player to move his King out of the center (the main theater of action in the opening) to the flank, where the King can be protected by pawns. Additionally, castling develops a Rook. Glossary When White castles Kingside, he moves his King from el to gi and his hI-Rook to f1. When Black castles Kingside, he moves his King from e8 to g8 and his h8-Rook to f8. When White castles Queenside, he moves his King from el to cl and his aI-Rook to d1. And when Black castles Queenside, he moves his King from e8 to c8 and his a8-Rook to d8. Center: The center is the area of the board encompassed by the rectangle c3-c6-f6-f3. Squares e4, d4, e5, and d5 are the most important part of the center. The e- and d-files are the center files. Checkmate: An attack against the enemy King from which the King cannot escape. When a player checkmates his opponent's King, he wins the game. Classical: A style of play that focuses on the creation of a full pawn center. Classical principles tend to be rather dogmatic and inflexible. The philosophy of the classical players was eventually challenged by the so-called "hypermoderns." See also Hypermodern. Clearance sacrifice: A move that sacrifices an obstructing piece to make way for a strong move. Closed game: A position that is obstructed by blocking chains of pawns. Such a position tends to favor Knights over Bishops, because the pawns block the diagonals. Combination: A sacrifice combined with a forced series of moves, which exploits specific peculiarities of the positions in the hope of attaining a certain goal. Connected passed pawns: Two or more passed pawns of the same color on adjacent files. See also Passed pawn. Control: To completely dominate an area of the board. Dominating a file or a square, or simply having the initiative, can constitute control.

Counterplay: When the player who has been on the defensive starts his own aggressive action. Cramp: The lack of mobility that is usually the result of a disadvantage in space. Critical position: An important point in the game, where victory or defeat hangs in the balance. Decoy: A tactic that lures an opponent's piece to a particular square. Defense: A move or series of moves designed to thwart an enemy attack. Also used in the names of many openings initiated by Black. Examples are the French Defense and the Caro-KannDefense. Deflection: A tactic that involves chasing the opponent's main defending piece away from the critical area so that the defense falls apart. Development: The process of moving pieces from their starting positions to new posts, from which they control a greater number of squares and have greater mobility. Discovered attack: A discovered attackis an ambush. A Queen, Rook, or Bishop lies in wait so that it can attack when another piece or pawn moves out of its way. Discovered check: A discovered attack that involves checking the enemy King. Double attack: An attack against two pieces or pawns at the same time. Double check: A discovered attack that checks the King with two pieces. The King is forced to move, and the enemy army is thus frozen for at least one move. Doubled pawns: Two pawns of the same color lined up on a file. This doubling can only come about as the result of a capture. Glossary Draw: A tied game. A draw can result from a stalemate, from a three-time repetition of position, or by agreement between the players. See also Stale mate; Three-time repetition of position. Elo rating: The system by which players are rated. Devised by Professor Arpad Elo (1903- ) of Milwaukee and adopted by FIDE in 1970. A beginner might have a 900rating, the average club player 1600 , a state champion 2300, and the World Champion 2800 . En passant: A French term that means in pass ing. When a pawn advances two squares (which it can do only ifit has not moved before) and passes an enemy pawn on an adjacent file that has advanced to its 5th rank, it can be captured by the enemy pawn as if it had moved only one square. The capture is optional and must be made at the first opportunity; otherwise, the right to capture that particular pawn under those particular circumstances is lost. Endgame: The third and final phase of a chess game. An endgame arises when few pieces remain on the board. The clearest signal that the ending is about to begin is when Queens are exchanged. Equality: A situation in which neither side has an advantage or the players' advantages balance out. Exchange: The trading of pieces, usually pieces of equal value. Exchange, The: Winning the Exchange means you have won a Rook (5 points) for a Bishop or a Knight (3 points). FIDE: The acronym for Federation Internationale des Echecs, the interna tional chess federation. File: A vertical column of eight squares. Designated in algebraic notation as the a-file, b-file, and so on. See also Half-{)pen file; Open file. Flank: The a-, b-, and c-files on the Queenside, and the f-, g-, and h-files on the Kingside.

Force: Material. An advantage in force arises when one player has more material than his opponent or when he outmans his opponent in a certain area of the board. Forced: A move or series of moves that must be played if disaster is to be avoided. Fork: A tactical maneuver in which a piece or pawn attacks two enemy pieces or pawns at the same time. Gambit: The voluntary sacrifice of at least a pawn in the opening, with the idea of gaining a compensating advantage (usually time, which permits development) . General principles: The fundamental rules of chess, devised to enable less advanced players to react logically to different positions. Also used more often than you would think by Grandmasters! Grande combination: A combination that involves many moves and fea tures many types of tactics. Grandmaster: A title awarded by FIDE to players who meet an established set of performance standards, including a high Elo rating. It is the highest title (other than World Champion) attainable in chess. Lesser titles include International Master and FIDE Master, which is the lowest title awarded for international play. Once earned, a Grandmaster title cannot be taken away. See also Elo rating; Master. Half-open file: A file that contains none of one player's pawns but one or more of his opponent's. Hang: To be unprotected and exposed to capture. Hole: A square that cannot be defended by a pawn. Such a square makes an excellent home for a piece because the piece cannot be chased away by hostile pawns. Glossary Hypermodern: A school of thought that arose in reaction to the classical theories of chess. The hypennodems insisted that putting a pawn in the center in the opening made it a target The heroes of this movement were Richard Reti and Aaron Nimwvich, both of whom expounded the idea of controlling the center from the flanks. Like the ideas of the classicists, those of the hypermoderns can be carried to extremes. Nowadays, both views are seen as correct A distillation of the two philosophies is needed to cope successfully with any particular situation. See also Classical. Initiative: When you are able to make threats to which your opponent must react, you are said to possess the initiative. Interpose: To place a piece or a pawn in between an enemy attacking piece and the attacked piece. Intuition: Finding the right move or strategy by "feel" rather than by calculation. Kingside: The half of the board made up of the e, f, g, and h files. Kingside pieces are the King, the Bishop next to it, the Knight next to the Bishop, and the Rook next to the Knight. See also Queenside. Luft: A Gennan tenn that means air. In chess,it means to give the King breath ing room. It describes a pawn move made in front of the King of the same color to avoid back rank mate possibilities. Major pieces: Queens and Rooks. Also called heavy pieces. Master: In the US, a player with a rating of 2200 or more. Ifa player's rating drops below 2200, the title is rescinded. See also Grandmaster. Mate: Short for checkmate.

Material: All the pieces and pawns. A material advantage is when a player has more pieces on the board than his opponent or has pieces of greater value. See also Point count Middlegame: The phase between the opening and the endgame. Minor pieces: The Bishops and Knights. Mobility: Freedom of movement for the pieces. Occupation: A Rook or Queen that controls a file or rank is said to occupy that file or rank. A piece is said to occupy the square it is sitting on. Open: Short for open game or open file. Also refers to a type of tournament in which any strength of player can participate. Though a player often ends up with opponents who are stronger or weaker than himself, the prizes are usually structured around different rating groups, with prizes for the top scorers in each group. Such open tournaments are extremely popular in the United States. See also Open file; Open game. Open file: A vertical column of eight squares that is freeof pawns. Rooks reach their maximum potential when placed on open files or open ranks. Open game: A position characterized by many open ranks, files, or diago nals and few center pawns. A lead in development becomes very important in positions of this type. Opening: The start of a game, incorporating the first dozen or so moves. The basic goals of an opening are to • Develop pieces as quickly as possible. • Control as much of the center as possible. • Castle early and get the King to safety, while at the same time bringing the Rooks toward the center and placing them on p0- tentially open files. Glossary Openings: Established sequences of moves that lead to the goals outlined under Opening. These sequences of moves are often named after the player who invented them or after the place where they were first played. Some openings, such as the King's Gambit and the English, have been analyzed to great lengths in chess literature. Opposite-colored Bishops: Also Bishops of opposite color. When players have one Bishop each and the Bishops are on different-colored squares. Opposite-colored Bishops can never come into direct contact. Overextension: When space is gained too fast By rushing his pawns forward and trying to control a lot ofterritory, a player can leave weaknesses in his camp, or can weaken the advanced pawns themselves. He is then said to have overextended his position. Overworked piece: A piece that is required to single-handedly defend too many other pieces. Passed pawn: A pawn whose advance to the 8th rank cannot be prevented by any enemy pawn and whose promotion to a piece is therefore inevitable. See also Promotion; Underpromotion. Pawn structure: Also referred to as the pawn skeleton. All aspects of the pawn setup. Perpetual check: When one player places his opponent in check, forcing a reply, followed by another check and another forced reply, followed by another check that repeats the first position. Because such a game could be played forever, after the position repeats itself, the game is declared a draw. See also Three-time repetition of position. Perpetual pursuit: Similar to a perpetual check, except that the pursued piece is a Bishop, Knight, Rook, or Queen, instead of the King. Petite combination: A combination that involves only a few moves.

WINNING CHESS TACTICS

Pig: Slang for Rook. Pigs on the 7th is a common term for Rooks doubled on the 7th rank. Pin: When one player attacks a piece that his opponent cannot move without losing a different piece of greater value. When the piece of greater value is the King, this tactic is called an absolute pin; when it is not the King, the tactic is called a relative pin. Plan: A short- or long-range goal on which a player bases his moves. Point count: A system that gives the pieces the following numeric values: King-priceless; Queen-9 points; Rook-5 points; Bishop-3 points; Knight-3 points; and pawn-l point Positional: A move or style of play that is based on long-range considera tions. The slow buildup of small advantages is said to be positional. Prepared variation: In professional chess, it is common practice to analyze book openings in the hope of finding a new move or plan. When a player makes such a discovery, he will often save this prepared variation for use against a special opponent. Promotion: Also called queening. When a pawn reaches the 8th rank, it can be promoted to a Bishop, Knight, Rook, or (most commonly) Queen of the same color. See also Underpromotion. Protected passed pawn: A passed pawn that is under the protection of another pawn. See also Passed pawn. Queenside: The half of the board that includes the d-, c-, b-, and a-files. The Queenside pieces are the Queen, the Bishop next to it, the Knight next to the Bishop, and the Rook next to the Knight. See also Kingside. Quiet move: An unassuming move that is not a capture, a check, or a direct threat. A quiet move often occurs at the end of a maneuver or combination that drives the point home. Glossary Rank: A horizontal row of eight squares. Designated in algebraic notation as the 1 (1st) rank, the 2 (2nd) rank, and so on. Rating: A number that measures a player's relative strength. The higher the number, the stronger the player. See also Elo rating. Resign: When a player realizes that he is going to lose and graciously gives up the game without waiting for a checkmate. When resigning, a player can simply say, "I resign," or he can tip over his King in a gesture ofhelplessness. When you first start playing chess, I recommend that you never resign. Always play until the end. Romantic: The Romantic (or Macho) era of chess from the early to mid- s, when sacrifice and attack were considered the only manly ways to play. If a sacrifice was offered, it was considered a disgraceful show of cowardice to refuse the capture. Today, a player who has a proclivity for bold attacks and sacrifices, often throwing caution to the wind, is called a romantic. Royal fork: A fork that attacks the King and Queen. Sacrifice: The voluntary offer of material for compensation in space, time, pawn structure, or even force. (A sacrifice can lead to a force advantage in a particular part of the board.) Unlike a combination, a sacrifice is not always a calculable commodity and often entails an element of uncertainty. Simplify: To trade pieces to quiet down the position, to eliminate the opponent's attacking potential, or to clarify the situation. Skewer: A threat against a valuable piece that forces that piece to move. allowing the capture of a piece behind it. Smothered checkmate: When a King is completely surrounded by its own pieces (or is at the edge ofthe board) and receives an unanswerable check from the enemy, he is said to be a victim of Smothered checkmate_

Space: The territory controlled by each player. Space count: A numerical system used to determine who controls more space, in which 1 point is allocated to each square on one player's side of the board that is controlled by a piece or pawn belonging to the other player. Speculative: Made without calculating the consequences to the extent normally required. Sometimes full calculation is not possible, so a player must rely on intuition, from which a speculative plan might arise. Stalemate: In the English language, a stalemate refers to a standoff be tween opposing forces. In chess terminology, a stalemate occurs when one player is so bottled up that any legal move he makes willexpose his King to immediate capture. A stalemate results in a draw (a tied game). Strategy: The reasoning behind a move, plan, or idea. Study: Theoretical positions, or compositions, that highlight unusual tac tical themes. Style: Players approach chess in different ways as a result of their person alities and preferences. The types of move a player chooses are usually indicative of the player as a person. Typically, in a game between players of opposing styles (for example, an attacker vs. a quiet positional player) , the winner will be the one who successfully imposes his style on the other. Tactics: Maneuvers that take advantage of short-term opportunities. A position with many traps and combinations is considered to be tactical in nature. Tempo: One move, as a unit of time; the plural is tempi. If a piece can reach a useful square in one move but takes two moves to get there, it has lost a tempo. For example, after l.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.Qxd4 Nc6, Black gains a tempo and White loses one because the White Queen is attacked and White must move his Queen a second time to get it to safety. Glossary Theory: Well-known opening, middlegame, and endgame positions that are documented in books. Three-time repetition of position: Occurs when the players have been moving back and forth, repeating the same position. Often happens when a player, behind in material and facing eventual loss, sacrifices for a perpetual check (see Perpetual check). A three-time repetition of position results in a draw (a tied game). Time: In this book, in addition to the common use of the word ("Black does not have time to stop all of White's threats"), time is a measure of develop ment Also refers to thinking time, as measured on a chess clock. See also Tune control; Tempo. Time control: The amount of time in which each player must play a specified number of moves. In international competitions, the typical time control is 40 moves in 2 hours for each player. After each player has made 40 moves, each is given an additional amount of time (usually 1 hour for 20 moves) . If a player uses up his time, but has not yet made the mandatory number of moves, he loses the game by forfeil, no matter what the position on the board. Time pressure: One of the most exciting moments in a tournament chess game. When one or both players have used up most of their time but still have several moves to make before they reach the mandatory total of 40 or 45, they start to make moves with increasing rapidity, sometimes slamming down the pieces in frenzied panic. Terrible blunders are typical in this phase. Some players get into time pressure in almost every game and are known as time-pressure addicts. Transposition: Reaching an identical opening position by a different order of moves. For example, the French Defense is usually reached by l.e4 e6

2.d4 dS, but l.d4 e6 2.e4 ds transposes into the same position.

Trap: A way of surreptitiously luring the opponent into making a mistake.

WINNING CHESS TACTICS

Underpromotion: Promotion of a pawn to any piece other than a Queen. Variation: One line of analysis in any phase of the game. It could be a line of play other than the ones used in the game. The term variation is frequently applied to one line of an opening; for example, the Wilkes-Barr e Variation (named after the city in Pennsylvania) of the Two Knights' Defense. Variations can become as well-analyzed as their parent openings. Entire books have been written on some well-known variations. Weakness: Any pawn or square that is readily attackable and therefore hard to defend. Zugzwang: A German term that means compulsion to move. It refers to a situation in which a player would prefer to do nothing because any move leads to a deterioration of his position, but he moves something because it is illegal to pass. Zwischenzug: A German term that means in-between move. A surprising move that, when inserted in an apparently logical sequence (for example, a check that interrupts a series of exchanges) , changes the result of that sequence.
