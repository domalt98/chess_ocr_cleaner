INTRODUCTION TO THIS EDITION
eople have been asking for a new printing of Best Lessons of a Chess Coach for over a decade. I first went to Sunil and Ed requesting they make just a few minor edits, but we were soon engaged in a major re-write, going back to Ed's original transcriptions of Sunil's classes at Hunter College Elementary School and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation's Saturday chess program at the Girl Scout House in Scarsdale. For this edition, we wanted to be certain that the main theme of each lesson is clear and that we go off on fewer tangents. We also determined where additional or alternate diagrams would benefit the student. By making a slight change in lesson order, we now present a grandmaster game followed by one or more of Sunil's games where he encountered similar positions and concepts. And two additional games, originally planned for the 1993 book but left out due to page count restrictions, have been completed and are presented herein. Another change is in the presentation of the Illustrative Games. They now appear at the end of each thematic section, and include a number of modern grandmaster games. Each of these games is presented with a series of commented diagrams which follow the flow of the game and emphasize the themes. In addition, many of these games are supplemented with exercises. With the great wealth of chess now available on the Internet, something Sunil and Ed did not enjoy in the early 1990s, you can readily find these games and play them through, which we highly recommend. This book is available on the Forward Chess app which also allows you to see all the moves of a game, not just the diagrammed positions. In his lessons, Sunil makes the point that there is validity in studying games in their entirety. Rather than simply solving puzzles, studying games exposes you to many different types of positions and helps you formulate an appropriate strategy to try in your own play. In the time I have been working with Sunil, I cannot count how often people have commented that Best Lessons of a Chess Coach is among their top two or three books because of how much they learned. So, without further ado, this new edition is for them, and for the many younger generations of chess players who would love to have a lesson from one of our nation's most successful chess instructors. Turn the page, class is about to begin. Robert McLellan Editor, Best Lessons of a Chess Coach: Extended Edition 8
PREFACE
ne of the biggest stumbling blocks in the development of aspiring chess players comes sometime after they begin to play in tournaments. In the heat of competition, their minds are often plagued with questions they do not know how to answer: "Who has the better position?" "Should I resolve the tension in the center?" "Can I improve the placement of my pieces?" "What is the best way to penetrate my opponent's defenses?" Such questions cannot be answered by mere reference to a laundry list of canned precepts. Every truth about chess must be couched in context - preferably in the context of a real game. To play chess well, and to appreciate it the most, one can do no better than to study complete, well-annotated master games. This book presents a series of classroom lessons by nationally acclaimed chess coach Sunil Weeramantry, aFIDE master who is in current and continual practice. Sunil's lectures bring the reader through the entire life cycle of a game, making clear what is happening at key moments. The cumulative effect of studying these lectures is to give the improving player tools with which to win. We hope the reader will find a good amount of chess entertainment while seeing how the story of each of these games unfolds in the classroom. There is a great deal of beauty, logic, and artistry to admire and enjoy in the games and ideas presented. When Sunil lectures on the games of the great masters, one can imagine being there. When Sunil lectures on his own games, one can share the experience along with him - the excitement, disappointments, and satisfaction of a well-played game. This book is organized into four thematic sections, each containing several lessons. Each lesson presents one complete game that illustrates one or more themes. The lessons are dialogues in which Sunil frames questions for his students. You should pause to answer the questions yourself. Note that the first answer given in the text may not be the correct one. Sometimes these wrong answers provide the best opportunity for learning. Diagrams are provided to help you follow the game and visualize the possibilities, but it is also recommended that you play along on your own chess set. You will also be given exercises within each lecture. You may wish to set up the position on a board, perform your own analysis, and make notes for comparison to the answers given at the end of the lesson. Review notes are provided to reinforce the important points made during each lecture. These notes are segmented into "Themes" and "Advice." As you read these, try to recall the context in which the ideas were presented. If necessary, go back and find the relevant paragraphs. At the end of each of the four thematic sections, you will find Illustrative Games. These games highlight the themes of the associated lessons. Play through these games to get a feel for how thematic positions develop in different situations. Such pattern reinforcement is important to the development of chess skill. Preface If you should encounter chess terms you do not understand, please refer to the Glossary provided at the end of the book.
PART A
OUTPOST SQUARES
he games in this section demonstrate the establishment and exploitation of outpost squares. A piece posted on such a square exerts pressure on the opponent's position and supports the attack. d5 is an outpost Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense)
LESSON 1
[diagram]
HOME AWAY FROM HOME
ur first lesson introduces the idea of the outpost square as a permanent advantage that can support the steady build-up of an attack. In this game, note how Grandmaster Vasily Smyslov secures his position against counterplay before launching the final assault. This game was played in the USSR Championship in 1945. While Smyslov did not win this event, he went on to place second in the 1948 World Championship tournament and, in 1957, became the seventh World Chess Champion. There are four criteria that qualify a square as an outpost: • It should be a central square, preferably in enemy territory. • It must be safe from attack by a pawn. • It must be subject to effective occupation, preferably by a knight. • It must have an anchor. The anchor should be a pawn. Why is an outpost square important? If you can establish a safe place in enemy territory ("a home away from home"), you can use that square to launch an attack.
V. SMYSLOV - I. RUDAKOVSKY
Moscow 1945
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4
[diagram]
The Open Sicilian. A Sicilian is considered either "open" or "closed" depending on whether or not White plays the move d2-d4, opening both central diagonals within the first three moves. Every player should learn how to play the Open Sicilian. Before playing closed positions, you need the open game experience. At some point, in order to win, a closed position must be opened up.
3...cxd4
Black trades his c-pawn for White's d-pawn; this gives him two center pawns against White's one.
4.Nxd4 Nf6 (D)
Question: There is a trap in this position. Tell me what happens if White plays e5. What is wrong with this move? Answer: It moves a pawn twice. True, but it is not a loss of time, as it places the f6-knight under attack. Look for a tactical reason. Answer: Black has ...Qa5+, checking the king and attacking the e5-pawn. Right. This is adouble attack. Look for one when you see an unprotected piece or pawn.
5.Nc3 d6 6.Be2 Be7 (D)
After 9.f4
[diagram]
Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense) This variation, with black pawns on e6 and d6, is the Scheveningen Sicilian, so-called because it was first played in Scheveningen, asmall village in The Netherlands that hosted a very strong tournament in 1923. While modestly placed in terms of development, the e7-bishop protects the d6-pawn. Not every piece can go on the attack. Black hopes to complete his development, expand on the queenside by pushing his a- and b-pawns, line up his heavy pieces on the c-file, and play for an eventual ...d6-d5, using his extra pawn to strike in the center of the board.
7.O-O O-O 8.Be3 Nc6
Notice that White has placed both bishops on the same central file, leaving the other one open for his rooks. We have now reached the end of the opening. White has all of his minor pieces developed; Black has all but one. (D) Question: How should White further develop his position? Answer: Bb5. No, this is harmless. Black can easily defend with ...Bd7. If White now trades bishop for knight, Black will reply with ...bxc6, getting yet another pawn into the center. The correct move is...
9.f4 (D)
After lO.Wel
[diagram]
After 11...e5 It is extremely important to get two pawns together on the fourth rank whenever feasible. This controls the four squares in front and acts as a screen to provide maneuvering room from behind. Two pawns on the fourth can act as a screen to move pieces around. You do not have to advance these pawns - they perform a valuable function where they are. This move also creates more space for the rook on f1. And it gives you a middlegame plan: White will attack on the kingside. Always try to start an attack on the side of the board where you have more space. Once you establish a space advantage, either the kingside or queenside, move your pieces to that side of the board and conduct an attack. Pay attention to how Smyslov builds up his attack without giving Black counterplay. Comment: What about the weakness on f2? It is not an important weakness if it cannot be exploited. Your king is only as weak as your opponent's ability to attack it.
9...Qc7 10.Qe1 (D)
A key move - Smyslov creates a way for his queen to move to the kingside. You would not have thought of this without the earlier kingside expansion. This is why you must study an opening system; middlegame plans are easier to formulate when you have a thorough grasp of why each opening move was played.
10...Nxd4 11.Bxd4 e5 (D)
After 14>Sxf6 (12,fxe5 variation) After 13...Ac5 (12.fxe5 variation)
[diagram]
Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense) Question: White's bishop is under attack. How should he proceed? Answer: Trade pawns: 12.fxe5 dxe5. Then play 13.Qg3 and pin the e5-pawn. Question: So how might Black respond to the double attack on the pawn? Answer: 13...Bd6. Answer: But then White just wins a free piece with 14.Rxf6. (D) Okay, I see that the g7-pawn is pinned, but is it really a free piece? Exercise 1-1: In the variation 12. fxe5 dxe5 13.Qg3 Bd6, White can try to win a free piece with 14.Rxf6. Does this work? Analyze several moves ahead until all potential checks and captures have been evaluated. Question: We can still conclude that 13...Bd6 is not the best defense; Black has a much stronger move. What is it? Answer: 13...Bc5, creating his own bishop pin, is much stronger. (D) Bravo! If White now plays 14.Qxe5??, Black will play queen takes queen and laugh! Or, Bf14.Bxc5, then 14...Qxc5+ 15.Kh1 Kh8 stopping Rxf6, and Black is fine. Smyslov can see that the tactics with 12.fxe5 do not work, so he adopts a more strategic plan.
12.Be3 (D)
After 12.Ne3
1. Better
2. Better
White chooses to maintain the pawn structure because two connected pawns on the fourth rank enjoy a space advantage over one on the fourth and one on the third. (D) If Black initiates a pawn trade, White retains a pawn on his fourth rank against a black pawn on its third, thereby retaining a space advantage. (D) What White does not want to do is initiate the trade himself, as this will result in an equal pawn position. (D)
3. Equal
[diagram]
Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense) You may be wondering, "What does all this have to do with checkmate?" Well, in chess, you fight all sorts of battles, big and small. Winning a game of chess is a matter of accumulating advantages. Do this well and eventually, you will overwhelm your opponent. There is no need to attempt a quick knockout. Black now makes an error that increases White's advantage.
12...Be6? (D)
This loses a valuable tempo and allows White to consolidate his space advantage on the kingside. Current theory recommends 12...Bd7 instead.
13.f5 Bc4
Question: Should Black have offered to trade light-square bishops? Answer: Yes. White's light-square bishop might be able to attack on the kingside. Not at all. It is better to retreat with 13...Bd7. You must distinguish between thinking ahead and merely dreaming! There really is no way for White's e2-bishop to take part in a kingside attack. Do not handicap your thinking by conjuring up threats that cannot be made. Fixed pawn chains restrict the movement of bishops. Here, White's light-square bishop is a bad bishop because its movement is restricted by its own pawns on e4 and f5. Black's light- square bishop is agood bishop because its movement is not hindered by its own pieces. In general, one does not trade the good for the bad. Nevertheless, Black is offering to trade his good bishop for White's bad bishop so that he can get his queen to c4. His idea is to put pressure on e4 and support a pawn break with ...d6-d5. This plan is ill-conceived. After 14."$xc4 After 16.Nd5 (variation)
14.Bxc4 Qxc4 (D)
Question: The contrast in the position is striking. Now who has the good bishop? Answer: White. Question: And how should White protect his e4-pawn? Answer: Qh4. That protects e4, but White must be careful about walking into a discovered attack, for example 15...Nd5. Sometimes the best course of action is to anticipate trouble before it happens. Any other ideas? Answer: Bg5. A very good move! By pinning the knight, this move does two things: itprotects the e-pawn, and it prevents the freeing move ...d5.
15.Bg5 Rfe8
Black protects the pinned piece. Question: What is White thinking about doing next? Answer: He can play Nd5. (D) Not yet. Exercise 1-2: 16.Nd5 is a blunder. Why? After 17,..Bxc2 (variation} Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense)
16.Bxf6
White has identified the potential outpost square on d5, and, even though the bishops will get traded off, he takes the knight on f6 so that he gains absolute control of the d5 square.
16...Bxf6 17.Nd5 (D)
This is a central outpost square. It cannot be attacked by a black pawn and is effectively occupied by a knight which is anchored by the e4-pawn. The knight attacks f6 and e7 on the kingside, and also exerts influence on the queenside. You do not know yet how this game will end, but what you do know is you have seized control of one great square! The knight is like a tennis player in the middle of the court: it can pivot to the right or the left. It will dominate the bad bishop. Of course, White may choose to trade off his knight at the right time, and for the right price. For example, taking the bishop on the next move would weaken Black's castled position. Question: What if Black now plays ...Qxc2 ? (D) Answer: Attack the queen with Rc1. That would cost an extra pawn after ...Qxb2. There is a better move. Exercise 1-3: Find a better move for White after 17...Qxc2.
17...Bd8
After 18x3
[diagram]
After 20...Sc8
[diagram]
This protects c7 and allows the queen to capture the c2-pawn. Smyslov now decides to take care of his queenside weaknesses. He will put a protected pawn on c3, thus stopping Black's counterplay. Then he will switch over to a kingside attack.
18.c3 (D)
Now, if 18...Bb6+, do not even consider trading the knight for the bishop. White simply moves his king to safety. Black's bishop will be stranded on the queenside and will not be able to assist in the king's defense.
18...b5 19.b3
A difficult move to find. This does not weaken c3 because that pawn is defended by the knight in the outpost. By denying Black any counterplay on the queenside, White will be free to launch a kingside attack without distraction.
19...Qc5+ 20.Kh1 Rc8 (D)
Despite occupying ahalf-open file, Black's move does little. Avoid good-looking moves that do nothing for your position. Better is20...f6.
21.Rf3
White plays a rook lift. This maneuver is one of two ways to attack the castled king. The other is a pawn storm. These two techniques do not work together. A rook lift is generally preferred over a pawn storm if both players are castled on the same side of the board. After 22...g6 (variation)
[diagram]
After 22..,gxf6
[diagram]
Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense) Compare the relative strengths of the rooks. Rooks, to be strong, must have a turning point on the file. This is why Black's c8-rook is not as well placed as it looks. White now has a number of favorable elements for a kingside attack: Black's g7 and h7 are targets, and his pieces are out of position. White is shifting his army to the kingside, and his f5- pawn is positioned to disrupt Black's defenses All this is being supported by the knight on the outpost square!
21...Kh8?
Once again, Black should attempt to slow White's attack with 21...f6.
22.f6
This pawn advance would have worked equally well on the previous move. Now, if Black replies with 22...g6 (D), White can initiate a standard middlegame checkmating pattern which forces a win regardless of Black's defense. Learn as many of these patterns as you can, as they will help you steer your attack in the right direction. Exercise 1-4: How should White proceed against 22...g6 ? There are two variations.
22...gxf6 (D)
23.Qh4 Rg8 24.Nxf6 Rg7 25.Rg3 (D)
After 25.sg3 Exercise 1-5: After 25.Rg3, White is threatening a forced mate. What are the moves?
25...Bxf6
Black takes the knight to avoid White's threat.
26.Qxf6
The focal point of the attack has shifted from h7 to g7. It is not uncommon for the focus of the attack to change as the defender begins to protect his position. When there are several weak squares around the king, they provide the attacker with multiple focal points.
26...Rg8
Note that the rook on g3 performs two functions. It attacks g7, and it also defends c3 preventing Black's queen from starting a counterattack.
27.Rd1
White activates his other rook, threatening to capture the pawn on d6 and continue on to the back rank.
27...d5 28.Rxg7 Rxg7 29.Rxd5 1-0
As White's queen protects d8, Black cannot stop White's rook from reaching the eighth rank. After 14.gxf6 (12.fxe5 variation)
[diagram]
After 16,..dxc3 (12.fxe5 variation) Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense)
ANSWERS
Exercise 1-1: In the variation 12.fxe5 dxe5 13.Qg3 Bd6, White can try to win a free piece with
14.Rxf6. Does this work? Analyze several moves ahead until all potential checks and captures
have been evaluated. (D) Answer: White does not win a free piece. Black replies with 14...exd4 15.Qxd6 Qxd6 16.Rxd6 dxc3. (D) Now White should keep the c-file closed with 17.b3. Control of the d-file gives White the advantage. 17.bxc3, on the other hand, destroys White's pawn structure and gives Black excellent counterplay against White's doubled c-pawns after ...Be6 and ...Rac8. Exercise 1-2: 16.Nd5 is a blunder. Why? Answer: 16.Nd5 loses a piece to a frequently seen combination. Black plays 16...Nxd5, protecting his bishop with his knight while simultaneously creating a discovered attack on White's bishop.
(D)
After 16>..Nxd5 (16*Nd5 variation) After 18,Sf2 (17...Bxc2 variation)
[diagram]
After 23.Rh4 (22...g6 variation) The result is the win of a piece for Black regardless of which capture White makes: 17.exd5 Bxg5 or 17.Bxe7 Nxe7. Note that this tactic would work even if the e7-bishop were not protected by the rook. Exercise 1-3: Find a better move for White after 17...Qxc2. Answer: After 17...Qxc2, the right move would be 18.Rf2. (D) This move attacks the queen and protects b2. White wins the exchange without dropping any more pawns: 18...Qc4 19.b3 Qc6 20.Rc1 Qd7 21.Nc7 forking the two rooks. Exercise 1-4: How should White proceed against 22...g6 ? There are two variations. Answer: White can answer 22...g6 with 23.Qh4. (D) After 25.Sg3 Smyslov - Rudakovsky 1945 (Sicilian Defense) The idea isQh6, threatening mate on g7. If 23...Rg8, White wins with the queen sacrifice 24.Qxh7+ Kxh7 25.Rh3#. If instead 23...h5, White still attempts to reach h6 with 24.Qg5. Black's only way of stopping this maneuver is to play 24...Kh7. Now 25.Rh3 sets up a rook sacrifice on h5 with a mating attack. Exercise 1-5: After 25.Rg3, White is threatening a forced mate. What are the moves? (D) Answer: White is threatening 26.Qxh7+ Rxh7 27.Rg8#. This is a typical mating pattern you should familiarize yourself with.
REVIEW
Themes Making a middlegame plan (9.f4 and l0.Qe1). Space advantage in the center (9.f4). Maintaining tension (12.Be3). Bad bishop versus good bishop (12...Be6 and 13...Bc4). The outpost square (15.Bg5, 16.Bxf6, 17.Nd5). Building the attack (10.Qe1; 15.Bg5 through 21.Rf3). Preventing counterplay (18.c3 and 19.b3). Shifting focal points (23.Qh4 through 29.Rxd5). Advice Two pawns on the fourth can act as a screen to move pieces around. Always try to start an attack on the side of the board where you have more space. Your king is only as weak as your opponent's ability to attack it. You must study an opening system; middlegame plans are easier to formulate when you have a thorough grasp of why each opening move was played. Winning a game of chess is a matter of accumulating advantages. Do not handicap your thinking by conjuring up threats that cannot be made. Anticipate trouble before it happens. Avoid good-looking moves that do nothing for your position. A rook lift is generally preferred over a pawn storm if both players are castled on the same side of the board. Rooks, to be strong, must have a turning point on the file. Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian)
LESSON 2

KNIGHT MUSIC
n the previous game, we saw the strength of a knight that took up residence on a central outpost square, and eventually lent support to a direct attack on the king. In this game, without even launching a direct attack, a knight posted one rank deeper in enemy territory disrupts White's queenside by totally paralyzing the opposing rooks. This game was played in the U.S. Amateur Team Championship. Over one thousand players compete on 4-person teams in this annual "chess extravaganza," and they all compete in the same division. It is a great tournament, especially for young and improving players like yourselves. The best way to improve your game is to challenge more experienced players.
L. PUGH - S. WEERAMANTRY
Somerset (New Jersey) 1992
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6
This introduces the King's Indian Defense.
3.Nc3 Bg7
Black fianchettoes the king's bishop. Now White has two choices. The most common move is 4.e4, to establish the big center.1 If you are playing Black, itis all right to let White do this so long as you hit back at the right time and not let the center advance on you. My opponent chose to play more conservatively.
4.g3 (D)
After 4,g3
[diagram]
4...O-O 5.Bg2 d6 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.O-O Bg4 (D)
This is the King's Indian Defense Classical Fianchetto, Simagin Variation. It is named after Vladimir Simagin, a Russian grandmaster who was one of the trainers of Vasily Smyslov, the world champion we met in the previous lesson. This move introduces a clear strategy: Black wants to seize control of the central dark squares (d4, e5). Question: How does 7...Bg4 advance Black's plan? Answer: It targets the knight that protects the d4 and e5 squares. Exactly. White's knight on f3 is the principal defender of the central dark squares. Black's purpose in moving to g4 is not just to develop the bishop, but to eliminate this knight. Trading bishop for knight early in the game often saddles the opponent with doubled pawns, as in the Exchange Variation of the Ruy López or in the Nimzo-Indian Defense. This trade, without forcing the creation of doubled pawns, is unusual because strong players typically value bishops over knights. I have played ...Bg4 against players of various strengths. Many of them will chase the bishop away. When they do this, I smile to myself, because it shows that they do not fully appreciate the purpose of the move. My opponent chased the bishop.
8.h3
After 8.d5 (variation) Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian) This wastes a move and pushes Black to do exactly what he intended. Do not help your opponent carry out his plans! Question: What is a more constructive move for White? Answer: 8.Be3. That is a solid developing move, but it is too early to decide where to place this bishop. There are other good moves. Answer: d5. (D) Yes. Advance your pawn and chase Black's knight out of the center! This is White's best move, according to current opening theory. Black's knight on c6 does not have a good square to go to. Question: Where could the knight go? Answer: Move back to b8. That may not be so bad at all - back to b8, then out to d7. So long as the center remains closed, this loss of time is not critical. Let's look at some other choices. Answer: Knight to b4. This will be met by a3, forcing the knight to the rim on a6. The way back into the game is through c5, but this will be short-lived because the knight will again be chased by b4. If Black wishes to maintain a knight on c5, his a-pawn should already be on a5. Answer: Knight to a5. This attacks the c4-pawn, but again the knight is on the rim, and Black must be careful lest the knight get trapped. Back to the game...
8...Bxf3 (D)
After 8..Jbtf3 After 10...fixe5 (9.exf3 variation) Question: Which way is White going to take back? Answer: With the bishop, because taking with his f-pawn doubles the pawns and blocks the g2-bishop. It looks like it does not make sense to take with the pawn, but if Black does not find the correct response, itmakes a lot of sense. A long time ago I played this opening, and at the time I did not know it well. I was playing Black against an experienced master who took back with the pawn (9.exf3). I reacted incorrectly and ran into immediate trouble. Iplayed 9...e5 to break up the center. He took my pawn, and I recaptured with the knight (10.dxe5 Nxe5). (D) What I did not appreciate at the time is that Black cannot maintain a knight on e5. White would first protect his c4-pawn with 11.Qe2, then chase the knight away with f4, reopening the long diagonal for his fianchetto bishop. Despite having doubled pawns, White still has good control of the center. Getting stronger at chess is a matter of experience and study. After a loss, go back and study the critical positions. I did so and learned how to respond correctly to the pawn capture. The correct move for Black is 9...d5, threatening to trade pawns and isolate White's d4- pawn. Should White attempt to avoid the trade by playing c4-c5, the d4-pawn will still remain under pressure from the g7-bishop. (D) After 9,..d5 (9,exf3 variation)
[diagram]
After 9...M7 Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian) There are two weaknesses associated with an isolated pawn: the pawn itself and the square in front of it, which can serve as an outpost. If an isolated pawn is on its fourth rank or below, it cramps the other pieces and restricts their mobility. If the isolated pawn has advanced to the fifth rank or beyond, and is well protected, it can be strong. It becomes more dangerous as it advances. When playing against an isolated pawn, blockade it, especially with a knight. When playing with an isolated pawn, gain space by advancing it, and create piece play on the adjacent files. In this game, White played the correct way, recapturing with the bishop.
9.Bxf3 Nd7 (D)
Now we have a double attack on the d4-pawn, and it is not easy to protect it. Question: How does White protect the d4-pawn? Answer: Push it. Not this time. Question: Why isd5 no longer a good move? Answer: Black has ...Nd4. Not bad. You are moving to a center square, but you are not choosing the best square for the knight. After 10... ce5 (10.d5 variation] After 10-,.e5
[diagram]
Answer: Move the attacked knight to e5, with a double attack on the c-pawn and the bishop. Right. (D) If White protects the pawn with 11.Qb3, Black can attack it again with 11...Nb6, after which the pawn falls. Exercise 2-1: After 10.d5 Nce5, defending the pawn with 11.Qd4 would be disastrous. Why? In the game, White protected d4 with the e-pawn.
10.e3 e5 (D)
Question: What is the main point of 10...e5 ? Answer: To fight for control of the center. Question: What is Black's best move against 11.dxe5 ? Answer: 11...Ndxe5. Exactly, and again both the c4-pawn and the bishop are attacked. Question: What will Black do against 11.d5 ? Answer: Retreat the knight to e7. Correct. (D) After ll.&eS
[diagram]
Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian) Question: Now, with the center closed, how can Black create play? Answer: Pawn to f5. Yes. You must play ...f7-f5 and expand on the kingside. Let me say this again: When a single pawn is on the fourth rank, and there is a chance to get another pawn to an adjacent square, do it!
11.Ne2 (D)
An unexpected reply. White chooses to defend the d-pawn, rather than advancing it and locking the center.
11...f5
This move is normally played when the center is locked. However, it is still effective in this position because White cannot open the center in a meaningful way.
12.c5 (D)
White insists on forcing open the center. What better way to guarantee this than by creating more pawn contact? White hopes his bishop pair will come alive. This is a challenging move. If Kasparov had played 12.c5, I would probably be sitting there shaking! I would think this is some incredible move, just because of the person who played it. Well, you have to forget about who you are playing against and focus on the position at hand. When confronted with a novel or surprising move, take your time. Do not rush your reply. It is always scary to leave the security of the familiar behind you, but a chess player must have the confidence and the courage to strike out on his own. Personally, Ifind the prospect of creating something new to be quite exciting!
12...e4
I decided to block out the bishop with a gain of tempo, and then capture the pawn.
13.Bg2 dxc5 (D)
Question: What does White do now? Answer: Qb3+ recovers the pawn. Yes. This was his plan when he played c5. Of course, I'm not saying it was a good plan.
14.Qb3+ Kh8 15.Qxb7 (D)
After 15.Qxb7
[diagram]
Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian) White has succeeded in destroying Black's queenside pawn structure. Black is left with an isolated a-pawn and doubled isolated c-pawns. The c6-knight is also threatened.
15...Nb4
Black takes care of the principal threat. Question: What compensation does Black have for his shattered pawn structure? Answer: Maybe Black can trap White's queen. Good point. You should be alert to such opportunities. Even if the queen does not get trapped, it will lose a lot of time getting back to safety. Look at the placement of White's pieces. There is not a single piece that is beyond the second rank, except the queen. Remember, not even the most powerful piece can successfully tackle an entire army. Answer: The doubled c-pawn can be traded off. Right again. But Black has to be careful about the timing of that trade. If Black allows White's knight to get into d4, his light squares become vulnerable, as he does not have a light- square bishop to protect them. Question: What else does Black have? Answer: The knight can jump into d3. Exactly. Black has obtained active piece play as compensation for the structural weaknesses.
16.Qb5 (D)
After 16.Sb5 Exercise 2-2: After 16.Qb5, Black has a forced win of material. Can you find it?
16...Rb8
This does not win material, but it maintains Black's advantage.
17.Qc4 Nd3 (D)
The knight has found a home! Occupying an outpost square is a goal in itself. Black's knight on d3 neutralizes the d-file and takes away e1 and c1, disrupting White's development. Meanwhile, look at Black's rooks - they have their choice of files. Now, White should not let this knight stay on d3. However, if he tries to get rid of it with Nf4, his pawn structure will be destroyed regardless of which way he recaptures. Another idea for White is to enable Nc1 by playing Rb1 and Bd2. Black can counter by preparing the advance of his c-pawn to c4, strengthening the outpost. Then, if White ever captures the knight, Black will recapture with the c-pawn and establish a monstrous protected passed pawn on d3.
18.Qc2 (D)
After 18,Qc2
[diagram]
Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian) White retreats his queen to protect b2. I hope you have noticed that White's last five moves have all been queen moves. What started aggressively (14.Qb3+) has ended rather timidly. Do not move the queen out too early. Even the 14th move can be too early if you have not developed all your pieces. White has nothing to show for the queen's adventures, while Black has gained in development at its expense. As he is not presently under any pressure, Black has time to regroup. The next step, then, is to improve the position of the major pieces. Black's rook on b8 is already in a good position. The queen on d8 and the rook on f8, on the other hand, are not doing anything significant. Question: From a long-term point of view, where should Black's f-rook be placed to help you form a winning plan? Answer: On c6 to support the c5-pawn. He can move the rook there from f6. On the whole, a good plan, but it would be better not to block the c7-pawn. Answer: On d6. Yes, that's very strong. Playing on the d-file works, because d4 is a target. The plan I came up with, however, focused on the c-file. Answer: On c8, then after ...Nb6, Black can push the c7-pawn. Agreed. This idea looks at eliminating the weakness of the doubled isolated c-pawns. With the rook on c8, I can trade the c5-pawn, and then advance the c7-pawn. Question: But first the queen must be moved. Where should it go? Answer: Queen to g5. I considered that, but my play right now is on the queenside. Answer: Queen to e7. Yes. That is the move I played.
18...Qe7
This move helps guard e6 against a possible invasion by White's knight and connects the rooks. It fits in neatly with the plan I have already outlined. After 21.$Jxd4
[diagram]
White now thought for a long time and did what many players are guilty of doing when they cannot find a constructive plan: He pushed a random pawn.
19.a3 (D)
This looks very much like a "wait and see" move. The problem with waiting is that Black has too many options. Question: What new weakness does 19.a3 create in White's position? Answer: The square b3 is weak. Yes. Look at that beautiful square! I was sitting there thinking, "Wow - another perfect outpost!" But first things first. It is time to take over the c-file.
19...Rfc8 20.Rb1
White protects the b2-pawn in order to free the c1-bishop.
20...cxd4 21.Nxd4 (D)
Taking with the knight keeps White's pawn chain intact, but leaves his position horribly cramped. Taking with the pawn might result in its loss, but would at least open a diagonal for the dark-square bishop. Sometimes, it is better not to hang on desperately to every single pawn, but to let one go to secure active play.
21...c5 22.Ne2 c4
Now the black knight on d3 is there to stay. After 23.£Jd4
[diagram]
Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian)
23.Nd4 (D)
The knight jumps back into the center, but there is not much it can do without help from the rest of White's pieces.
23...N7c5 (D)
Question: What is Black's plan? Answer: To jump into another outpost on b3. Correct. Exercise 2-3: If White tried to pick off a pawn with 24.Qxc4, what would happen next?
24.Bd2
White finally gets his bishop out - on the twenty-fourth move!
24...Nb3 25.Bc3 (D)
White decides to block the c-file and hopes to challenge Black's g7-bishop. Instead, ifWhite trades knights with 25.Nxb3, Black recaptures with the pawn, forcing the queen back and securing another outpost square, this time on c2! Once a rook occupies that outpost, the invasion along the c-file will be crushing.
25...Nxd4 26.exd4 Qd6 27.Qd2 Bxd4 28.Qe3 (D)
Of course, the queen is safe because Black's d4-bishop is pinned.
28...Rd8 29.g4
Desperation. White has waited too long to create play. He cannot break the stranglehold. Even if White trades pawns on f5, it is Black with his superior mobility who will be able to switch his forces over more effectively for a kingside attack.
29...Rb3 30.gxf5? (D)
After 3O.gxf5?
[diagram]
Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian) White does not see Black's threat.
30...Rxc3!
This wins a piece by force by breaking the pin.
31.Qxe4 Rc2
White is down a piece for just a pawn. He resigned shortly thereafter. After ll.Bd4 (10.d5 variation)
[diagram]
After 17...Na3 (16...&C2 variation)
ANSWERS
Exercise 2-1: After 10.d5 Nce5, defending the pawn with 11.Qd4 would be disastrous. Why?
(D)
Answer: Black would discover an attack on the queen with 11...Nxf3+ 12.exf3 Bxd4. Exercise 2-2: After 16.Qb5, Black has a forced win of material. Can you find it? Answer: Black could have played to win material with 16...Nc2 17.Rb1 Na3. (D) Forking the rook and queen. Now 18.bxa3 Rb8 19.a4 Rxb5 20.axb5 yields Black a queen for rook and knight, but there is still a way to go for victory. Exercise 2-3: If White tried to pick off a pawn with 24.Qxc4, what would happen next? (D) After 24.Bxc4 (variation)
[diagram]
After 26. xb3 (24,Qxc4 variation)
[diagram]
Pugh - Weeramantry 1992 (King's Indian) Answer: Black would play 24...Nb3, skewering the bishop on c1, which is now attacked three times. The best White can do is bail out with 25.Qxb3 Rxb3 26.Nxb3. (D) White has point-count material equality, but Black is firmly in control of White's cramped position, and can continue to exert pressure with moves like ...Rc2 and ...Qc7, among others.
REVIEW
Themes Contesting the central dark squares (7...Bg4). The strengths and weaknesses of the isolated pawn (9.exf3 d5 variation). Occupying the outpost square as a goal (17...Nd3). Improving piece placement and eliminating weaknesses (discussion after 18.Qc2). Advice Fight back against the pawn center; do not let it advance unopposed. Occupy the square in front of the isolated pawn; it is an excellent outpost. When playing with an isolated pawn, advance it beyond the fourth rank and create piece play on the adjacent file. Avoid trades that increase the activity of your opponent's pieces. Do not send the queen into enemy territory without support. It can get trapped, or lose time getting out. Before undertaking active operations, improve the position of badly placed pieces. Connect your rooks; they work best together. Do not hold onto pawns at all costs; it is better to let one go to secure active play. __________

This is the only move that avoids a trade of queens. However, itis a mistake as White has an immediate tactic that wins material. Exercise A1-1: After 14...Qa4?, find a winning tactic for White.
15.c4
White misses the tactic. Instead, he sacrifices a pawn to trade off Black's strong light-square bishop.
15...Bxc4 16.Nc3 Qb3 17.Bxc4 Qxc4 18.Bg5 Qe6 19.Bxf6 Qxf6 (D)
After 23...Bg5 With the trade of light-square bishops and the elimination of the f6-knight, the last remaining defenders of d5 have been removed. Black can no longer prevent White from occupying this outpost. Note the similarity in strategy with Smyslov-Rudakovsky (Lesson 1).
20.Nd5
The knight occupies its new home.
20...Qh4 21.Qe2 Bf8 22.Qf1!
If White attempts to chase Black's queen away immediately with 22.g3, the queen will occupy h3, after which the only practical way to dislodge it would be to trade queens.
22...Rac8 23.g3 Qg5 (D)
The mobility of Black's queen is clearly restricted by the reach of White's centralized knight. Black should have retreated the queen to h6 immediately as 23...Qg5 loses a tempo.
24.h4 Qh6 25.g4 g5?
This only aids White's attack.

The centralized knight exerts control on both sides of the board. In Smyslov-Rudakovsky (Lesson 1), this knight helped launch a kingside attack. In this game, White prepares a breakthrough on the queenside.
21...f6?
This weakens the a2-g8 diagonal.
22.a4
Black's queenside pawns are weak. Whether Black chooses to defend b5 or to trade pawns on a4, his queenside pawns will fall.

Black decides to protect his b5-pawn, but in so doing, he leaves the rook on c6 unprotected, allowing a simple winning tactic.

After 31.g5 (A3) Schlechter - John 1905 White presently occupies a strong outpost on e5 with his knight. Should Black challenge it with 18...Nd7, White will lock the position with 19.c5 and welcome a trade on e5, enabling the rook to replace the knight in the outpost.

White intends to play g4-g5 to create more space on the kingside, but is concerned that Black may get some counterplay with ...Qf6-f5. He therefore begins to redeploy his knight to e3, to deny Black this option.
29...Rg7 30.Ne3 Qe7 31.g5 (D)
Advancing the g-pawn frees the g4 square and allows White's knights access to advanced outposts on f6 and h6.

(A5) Tarrasch - Vogel 1910 Black is hoping to double rooks on the d-file, but White temporarily shuts down the file with a simple pawn advance, and simultaneously creates more maneuvering room for his knight.
21.c5 Kg8
Doubling rooks immediately does not work in view of Nxf7+, winning material.
22.Nc4
White picks the perfect time to switch targets. Black has great difficulty keeping his e5-pawn protected.
22...Rfd8 23.Rxd7 Rxd7 24.f3 Nh6 25.Nxe5
White has correctly calculated that he has the time to capture this pawn and bring his knight back in defense. Meanwhile, Black's knight languishes on the edge of the board.
25...Rd2 26.Nc4 Rc2 27.b3 Rxa2 (D)
Black regains his pawn, but at a considerable price. Not only does he lose control of the d- file, but he is not even able to attack either of White's unprotected queenside pawns with his rook.
28.Rd1 a5 29.Rd8+ Kg7 30.Ra8 a4 31.Rxa4 Rxa4 32.bxa4 (D)

White attempts to slow down the advance of Black's center pawns by guarding the e4 square. But Black is not to be denied.

This clearance sacrifice is designed to give Black's knight a commanding square on e5.
23.Bxf6 Qxf6 24.fxe4 (D)
White must capture this pawn. Taking the e5 square away from Black with 24.f4 would leave Black with a protected passed pawn on e4.

Boleslavsky-Lisitsin 1956 Exercise A1-1: After 14...Qa4? (D), find a winning tactic for White. Answer: White plays 15.Nc7. This wins the exchange, as Black's attempt to save the rook with
15...Rac8 allows 16.Bb5, trapping Black's queen.
Botvinnik-Tartakower 1936 Exercise A4-1: Find a win of material for White after 21...Rxe7. (D) Answer: White wins material with 22.Nf5+ (better than 22.Bxh6+) as 22...Bxf5 23.exf5 attacks the g6-knight and discovers an attack on the queen by the bishop on b2. Exercise A4-2: After 26...Rad8 (D), see if you can find an even more crushing move than

Answer: White launches a direct assault on Black's king with the destructive sacrifice 19.Nxh7!. If Black accepts with 19...Kxh7, then White plays 20.Qh4+ Kg8 21.Bxg6 threatening mate with Qh7. Black is forced to give up his queen: 21...Nxg6 22.Qxd8. Black's castled position still collapses even if he declines the sacrifice: 19...Bd7 20.Bxg6 Nf5

WEAK SQUARES
he games in this section build upon the ideas of the previous section, with special emphasis on the importance of pawn structure and the role it plays in supporting the attack. They illustrate how exploiting weak squares, whether on one or both colors, allows a player to infiltrate the opponent's position and develop a successful attack. After 2,..d5 (variation) Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined)
LESSON 3
[diagram]
HIS MAJESTY ON THE MARCH
common misconception is that advancing a pawn to attack your opponent's piece is always desirable. On the contrary, such an advance may create weak squares in your own position. Every time a pawn advances, it loses control of one or more squares. Once this happens, there is no backing up to try and regain control. In this game, future world champion Alexander Alekhine is playing against Fred Yates, who had already won the British Championship four times and would go on to post two wins against Alekhine. But not this time. Alekhine cleverly exploits the weak squares created by his opponent and uses them to secure a clear path into enemy territory. This game was played in the strong London 1922 tournament, won by Capablanca. Alekhine finished second. A. Alekhine - F.D. Yates London 1922
1.d4 Nf6
A flexible move which retains many options for transposing into different openings.
2.c4 e6
Question:What happens if Black instead tries to play d5 right away? (D) After 4...±e7 After 6... c6 (variation) Answer: White will capture the pawn. Question: Yes, and what happens after Black takes back with Nxd5 ? Answer: e4 attacks the knight and sets up a strong center. Exactly. If Black does not prepare ...d5 with ...e6, he will lose control of the center.
3.Nf3 d5
Black offers to transpose into a Queen's Gambit Declined. Instead, he could try the Queen's Indian Defense with 3...b6. He could also try the Bogo-Indian Defense with 3...Bb4+, a line named after Efim Bogoljubow, an elite player in the first part of the twentieth century.
4.Nc3 Be7 (D)
The transposition into the main variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined is now complete.
5.Bg5 O-O 6.e3
This is the only logical move. White needs to activate his light-square bishop. Now Black has an important decision: should he move his knight to c6 or to d7? Let's look at 6...Nc6 first. (D) Question: If he moves to c6, itblocks the c-pawn. Why is it important for Black to be able to move the c-pawn? What is the word I am looking for? Answer: Space. Yes! Space is extremely important. Do you see how cramped Black's position is when the knight is on c6? After 6*.. bd7
[diagram]
Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined) Question: How many such squares does Black have behind the pawn line to develop his pieces? I want you to identify the squares. You should count the square even if it is already occupied by one of your pieces. Do not count the back rank. Answer: Three - d6, d7, and e7. Yes. Three squares are not enough to place all the minor pieces. Question: Now imagine that Black's c7-pawn is on c5. How many squares would he have? Answer: Five - c6, c7, d6, d7, and e7. Precisely. With a single pawn move, you would almost double your space.
6...Nbd7 (D)
Black chooses the right move. The c-pawn is free to advance as needed. Question: Of course, the bishop on c8 is now blocked. How can you fix this? Answer: Play ...b6 and fianchetto the bishop. Yes, this will also help Black support ...c5. In general, I would say that in queen pawn openings where Black has a central pawn chain (f7/e6/d5), do not place a knight on c6 until the c7-pawn has advanced.
7.Rc1
It is not hard to understand this move - White is positioning his rook for a possible opening of the c-file.
7...c6 (D)
Black decides to advance his c-pawn one square, opting for a solid pawn center. This is the most popular response to Rc1, but there is a drawback. Question: What is the issue with ...c6 ? Answer: It blocks in the bishop. Yes. It is further burying the light-square bishop. If the bishop was bad to begin with, can you see how much worse it is now? Black understands this but feels it is more important to limit White's potential rook activity along the c-file. As already mentioned, Black could fianchetto the bishop instead: 7... b6 8.Bd3 Bb7 9.O-O c5.
(D)
This position offers equal chances. The bishop is definitely more active.
8.Qc2
White doubles up on the c-file.
8...Re8
While there is a possibility that the e-file will open, the real purpose of this move is to free the f8 square. Question: How does Black intend to use this square? Answer: Move the bishop there. After 9,jNd3
[diagram]
Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined) That is possible. Perhaps Black is expecting White to play cxd5, after which he would recapture with the e-pawn and open the file. Question: How else can Black use the f8 square? Answer: He could put the knight there instead. Good.
9.Bd3 (D)
Look at the two batteries White has lined up: Qc2/Bd3 and Rc1/Qc2. See how the queen is coordinating well with the bishop and rook? White is exerting a lot of pressure along both the b1-h7 diagonal and the c-file. White is now ready to castle and his pieces are well coordinated. Black must decide how he is going to complete his development. With pawns on e6 and c6, it does not make sense to fianchetto the c8-bishop.
9...dxc4
Black chooses to trade pawns on c4 to free d5 for his knight. He waits for White's bishop to move to d3 before making this capture, in order to gain a tempo by forcing the bishop to move a second time. However, this comes at a price - Black has to trade his most advanced pawn.
10.Bxc4 Nd5 (D)
After ll...Ra5+ (variation) This sets up a trade of pieces. When in a cramped position, try to trade off pieces to ease the congestion. Question: What should White play in this position and why? Answer: Pawn to e4. It chases the knight out of the center. No. This does not work. Exercise 3-1: If White plays e4, how does Black win material? Question: What else might White play here? Answer: Knight takes knight. No. This trades off two sets of pieces after 11.Nxd5 exd5 12.Bxe7 Qxe7. Although the position is equal, this move actually helps Black achieve his goal of trading pieces, and allows him to re-establish a strong center pawn on d5. Try again. Answer: Knight to e4. Yes, this is what Alekhine plays.
11.Ne4
In Alekhine's own analysis he claims that the more accurate move is 11.Bxe7, as played in Game 11 of the world championship between Capablanca and Emanuel Lasker just a year earlier (Havana, 1921).
11.Ne4 is a new move introduced in this game. Alekhine is taking a calculated risk because
he must have been aware that the clever intermediate move 11...Qa5+ would tilt the balance in Black's favor. (D) This move forces White to move his king to f1. Although he does have several ways to block the check, all variations favor Black. The worst option is to block with Nc3. Exercise 3-2: After 11...Qa5+ 12.Nc3, how does Black win material? Yates did not find the queen check in this game. However, he did learn from his mistake, as when he found himself in this identical position four years later in a game against Grünfeld (Merano 1926), he played 11...Qa5+ and won the game. After 13...b5?
[diagram]
Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined)
11...f5? (D)
Surprised by Alekhine's novelty, Yates goes astray and makes a serious strategic error. Black appears to win a piece by chasing away one of the defenders of the g5-bishop, but this is an illusion. White simply plays the intermediate move 12.Bxe7 and saves his piece.
12.Bxe7 Qxe7 13.Ned2
Far from winning a piece, the move 11...f5 turned e5 into a powerful outpost for White. Question: How does the trade of dark-square bishops affect Black's position? Answer: Black has traded off his good bishop. All his center pawns are fixed on light squares, and the dark squares are now weak. Now it becomes clear why ...f5 is an error. Before advancing a pawn, consider its long- term consequences. Does it justify losing control of critical squares?
13...b5? (D)
Amazingly, Black repeats the same error on the queenside. Once again, he advances a pawn to chase away an enemy piece. Question: What weaknesses are created by this move? Answer: The c6-pawn becomes weak. Yes. Notice how the base of Black's pawn chain has shifted from b7 to c6. This is now a backward pawn on the half-open c-file. Avoid giving yourself a backward pawn on a file that After 15,..a5 abode! gh your opponent controls. Question: Is this the only long-term weakness? Answer: No. The c5 square is another potential outpost for White. Question: How can White take advantage of this? Give me a winning plan. Answer: White can play bishop takes knight. Black must take back with the c-pawn or lose it. Good start. That is one useful trade. Keep going. Answer: Trade the d7-knight, so the f3-knight can occupy e5. Question: How does White do that? Answer: Move the d2-knight to b3, then c5, and trade it for Black's d7-knight. That is totally the right plan. Trading knights enables you to get your f3-knight into e5. It will be a monster!
14.Bxd5 cxd5 15.O-O
White completes his development.
15...a5 (D)
Black hopes to get in ...a5-a4 to prevent White's knight from going to b3.
16.Nb3
White makes it in time.
16...a4 17.Nc5
As you can see, once you formulate agood plan, the moves come easily.
17...Nxc5 (D)
Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined) Black is hoping that trading more pieces will make it easier to hold on for a draw. This is not the case in this position, because simplification increases White's control. Even though avoiding the trade with 17...Nb6 does not solve Black's problems, itwould keep the position closed a little longer. Simplification does not guarantee equality. Question: How does White recapture on c5? Answer: With the queen. Yes. Stick with the plan. You are not trying to create a passed pawn here. You want to maintain control of the file, along with the dark squares and the e5 outpost. After the queen trade, White will double rooks on the c-file. An open file is a highway into enemy territory. When there is only one open file on the board, the player who controls it is in command of the game.
18.Qxc5 Qxc5 19.Rxc5
With fewer pieces on the board, the weakness of the bad bishop becomes even more obvious.
19...b4 20.Rfc1 Ba6 21.Ne5 (D)
White's knight has reached its central outpost and is a dominant force. Despite the open f1- a6 diagonal, Black's bishop has no constructive moves. Exercise 3-3: Should Black play ...Rec8 and attempt to trade rooks? Write down your analysis. After 23.a3 After 25.h4
[diagram]
21...Reb8 22.f3
White initiates the final plan. He will use the weak dark squares to march his king into the center unopposed, adding an extra attacker.
22...b3 23.a3 (D)
White avoids the trade and locks up the queenside pawns. The player who controls the only open file must not allow the opponent to create an open file of his own. Exercise 3-4: Should Black play 23...Rc8 and try to trade rooks now? Write down your analysis.
23...h6 24.Kf2 Kh7 25.h4 (D)
Having locked down the queenside, White turns his attention to the kingside.
25...Rf8
As trading rooks is not an option, Black is reduced to making waiting moves.
26.Kg3
Exercise 3-5: White sticks to his plan, though he could have won material after 25...Rf8. How?
26...Rfb8 27.Rc7
After 30...Ng8
[diagram]
Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined) After you establish control of a file, find the point of invasion. The most effective point will be on the seventh or eighth rank.
27...Bb5 28.R1c5
This puts pressure on the bishop.
28...Ba6 (D)
The bishop retreats. Black cannot let his rook be tied down to its defense; he will need this rook to defend the e6-pawn when it is eventually attacked.
29.R5c6
White attacks the e6-pawn.
29...Re8 30.Kf4
White's king continues its journey.
30...Kg8 (D)
Black moves his king because he is in virtual Zugzwang. One of his rooks is tied down protecting his bishop, while the other must look after the e6-pawn. Any pawn move will result in the loss of material. The only piece that can move with impunity is the bishop, but it does not have an effective move. Question: White now makes a move that further paralyzes Black. What is it? Answer: Nd7. After 34".Eg8 This move will be played, but not yet. Answer: h5. Yes. This further restricts Black's pawn moves and creates another outpost on g6 for the knight.
31.h5 Bf1 32.g3 Ba6 (D)
Question: How does White pursue the attack? Answer: He can double rooks on the seventh rank. That is correct.
33.Rf7 Kh7
Black anticipates White doubling his rooks on the seventh rank, and moves his king to be able to protect the g7-pawn.
34.Rcc7 Rg8 (D)
Black appears to be holding on, as everything is presently defended. White needs a new threat. Question: Can you find the next move? Answer: Nd7, heading for f6. Yes. After 36...ggffi Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined)
35.Nd7 Kh8
Black moves out of the pin along the seventh rank to stop White from playing Nf6+. Question: How should White proceed? Answer: Move the knight to f6 anyway. If Black takes the knight, he will be mated on h7. Very good.
36.Nf6 Rgf8 (D)
Black pins White's rook to the f6-knight, hoping to prevent Rxg7.
37.Rxg7
White sees the mating attack and continues regardless.
37...Rxf6
The only move that stops an immediate checkmate.
38.Ke5
The king delivers the final blow. It certainly helps to have the extra attacker. Black's f6-rook is now lost because if either black rook goes to f8, White delivers mate in two with 39.Rh7+ and
40.Rcg7#. Accordingly, Black resigns. 1-0
After 11.e4 (variation) After ll...Ba5+ (variation)
ANSWERS
Exercise 3-1: If White plays 11.e4, how does Black win material? (D) Answer: Black plays 11...Bxg5 12.Nxg5 (if 12.exd5, then 12...Bxc1 13.Qxc1 exd5+ 14.Be2 Nf6 wins the exchange and a pawn) 12...Qxg5 13.exd5. (D)
13...Qxg2 14.Kd2 (14.Rf1 exd5+)14...Qxf2+ 15.Be2 Qxd4+.
Black is ahead three pawns and stands to win more. Exercise 3-2: After 11...Qa5+ (D) 12.Nc3, how does Black win material? After 24,£jc6 (21...Sec8 variation) Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined) Answer: If White answers 11...Qa5+ with 12.Nc3? (12.Kf1 is best), then 12...Nxc3 uncovers an attack on the g5-bishop. White cannot play 13.Qxc3 because of 13...Bb4. If instead White tries 13.Bxe7, then Black wins two pawns with the intermediate move
13...Nxa2+. (D)
14.b4 Nxb4 15.Bxb4 Qxb4+.
Intermediate moves are strong tactical resources. You can spot them if you remember that recaptures are not automatic. Note: After 12.Nc3, Black could also have played 12...Nb4, with the follow-up 13.Qa4 Qxa4 14.Nxa4 b5 winning a piece for a pawn. Exercise 3-3: Should Black play 21...Rec8 and attempt to trade rooks? Write down your analysis. Answer: No. If 21...Rec8, then 22.Rxc8+ Rxc8 23.Rxc8+ Bxc8 24.Nc6 (D) wins material as the knight threatens the b4-pawn as well as a knight fork on e7. Exercise 3-4: Should Black play 23...Rc8 and try to trade rooks now? Write down your analysis. Answer: No. If 23...Rc8, then 24.Rxc8+ Rxc8 25.Rxc8+ Bxc8 26.Nd3 Bd7 27.Nc5 (D) After 27. c5 (23...Sc8 variation) wins a pawn as Black's bishop is overloaded. Exercise 3-5: White sticks to his plan, though he could have won material after 25...Rf8. How?
(D)
Answer: White continues the king march with 26.Kg3, refusing to be distracted by the mere win of a pawn with 26.Nd7 Rf7 27.Nb6, forking rook and pawn. Alekhine - Yates 1922 (Queen's Gambit Declined)

LESSON 4
[diagram]
A REAL TOGETHER FEELING
awns have many functions, one of which is to provide shelter for one's pieces, particularly the king. A pawn structure that leaves your king unprotected on a set of adjoining squares of the same color, referred to as a weak color complex, can be fatal. To illustrate the danger, I will show you a game I once played in the U.S. Open. This is an unusual game to teach because there are no forcing moves, but it offers an excellent example of exploiting the opponent's errors. Chess players need to be alert as opportunities present themselves.
M. LAMON - S. WEERAMANTRY
Jacksonville (Florida) 1990
1.e4 d6 2.d4 g6 (D)
The Modern Defense, also known as the King's Fianchetto Defense: this belongs to the family of openings known as hypermodern systems, which feature delaying center-pawn moves in favor of developing bishops on the flank (the fianchetto) in order to attack the center from a distance. Notice that the e7- and d6-pawns, by reinforcing dark squares, complement the bishop's control of the a1-h8 long diagonal. As the game progresses, Black will increase this influence by putting a pawn on c5.
3.Nc3 Bg7 4.Be2 (D)
After 4.Ne2 After 5...b5 Lamon - Weeramantry 1990 (Modern Defense) This is a good move, a flexible move. It is wise not to telegraph your intentions to your opponent. With this move order, White can direct his play in a number of ways: he can bring his knight to f3 (the Classical System), set up a broad pawn center with f2-f4 (the Pseudo-Austrian Attack), or start a flank attack with h2-h4-h5 or even g2-g4 (the Bayonet Attack).
4...c6
Black delays the development of his king's knight in favor of queenside play. This is a hallmark of the Modern Defense.
5.Nf3 b5 (D)
Black goes for immediate queenside expansion to counter White's space advantage in the center. Prior to this move, White's pieces occupied four ranks while Black's only occupied three.
6.a3 a6
Five pawn moves in the first six moves of the game! Should Black not develop some pieces instead? Well, in this opening, you stake out your territory first, then bring your pieces out later. The point of ...a7-a6 is to strengthen the pawn structure in order to prepare the subsequent advance of the c-pawn. The move ...c6-c5 will challenge more central dark squares and increase the influence of Black's dark-square bishop. Naturally, an immediate ...c6-c5 fails because the pawn on b5 would be left unprotected.
7.O-O Nd7 8.h3 Qc7
Black's last two moves provide further support for ...c6-c5.
9.Be3 Ngf6 10.Qd2 O-O (D)
White has moved all of his pieces off the back rank except for his king and two rooks. Development is not complete until the rooks are connected. Question: What must Black do to complete his development? Answer: Move out his light-square bishop. Question: Where should the bishop go? Answer: Put it on b7 to control the other long diagonal. Yes. This fits in with the hypermodern strategy.
11.Rfd1 Bb7 (D)
Each player has now completed his development. This is where chess becomes difficult. Black's bishops are both fianchettoed, and they are on the outside attacking in. White's bishops are in the center, on the inside attacking out. There is no contact between the two armies at the moment, and every piece is still on the board. Question: Whose bishops are stronger? Answer: Black's. They are attacking the whole center area. Excellent.
12.Ne1
Lamon - Weeramantry 1990 (Modern Defense) White moves his knight out of the way, hoping to expand on the kingside with f2-f4.
12...c5 (D)
Black makes pawn contact first. When all the pieces are still on the board, look for a pawn trade to open lines. Comment: Why did you break with ...c5 ? Why not with ...e5 ?
12...e5 helps White. He can capture on e5 forcing Black to recapture with his d6-pawn. This
will bury the g7-bishop, and surrender control of the d-file to White's heavy artillery. 12...c5, on the other hand, allows Black to recapture with the knight, keeping the long diagonal open for the dark-square bishop and retaining a better pawn structure. Question: After 12...c5, is Black threatening anything? Answer: The e4-pawn is threatened. Yes, a very serious threat. White can stop this attack by playing d5, but the presence of pawns on c5 and b5 creates dynamic attacking chances for Black on the queenside. Nevertheless, d5 was certainly better than what was played.
13.f3? (D)
Question: White protects e4 with his f-pawn. What is wrong with this strategy? Answer: It prevents the knight from coming back to f3. He wanted to play f4, then bring the knight back. Now he can't do that. After 13...c4 (variation) Good point. He appears to have given up on the f4 idea. But f3 is bad because it restricts the mobility of both the knight and the bishop. Question: There is another serious weakness with f3. What is it? Answer: The dark squares are weak. Very good. Some people look at a chessboard and see 64 squares, while others look at a chessboard and see 32 dark squares and 32 light squares. If you are strong enough to look at a position like this and say, "Aha, f3 is bad because it weakens the dark squares around the king," then you understand the position clearly. All the kingside pawns are on light squares, so Black will try to attack the weak color complex. Question: Black could now play 13...c4 (D) and keep White's knight out of d3. Is that a good idea? Answer: Yes. It stops the knight from moving in, and also shuts out the bishop on e2. The knight on c3 cannot move either. If it goes to d5, White will lose a pawn. Well, it does take several moves away from White. Question: Now give me a reason why Black would not play ...c4 ? Answer: It weakens the dark squares on the queenside. True. I guess you'll never forget color weaknesses again! I must, however, point out that a weak color complex presents greater danger when it is in the vicinity of the king. Answer: You are giving up some control in the center. That's the right idea! ...c4 is a bad move because Black can no longer force open the center. The reason you need to open the center is to activate the bishops. As we discussed, Black's bishops are stronger because they have potential targets. Advancing ...c4 closes the position, taking away these targets. What should happen is the center must be destroyed. Trade the pawns off and free the bishops. The position then has much more potential than it would have with ...c4. You really cannot let the two white pawns on d4 and e4 continue to sit there. If you do, then the entire hypermodern strategy of playing against the center with fianchettoed bishops is ruined. Not trading pawns now would be a serious strategic error.
13...cxd4 14.Bxd4 (D)
Lamon - Weeramantry 1990 (Modern Defense) Question: The opening that started off as a Modern has changed character. What does it now resemble? It is an opening that most players are familiar with. Answer: The Sicilian Dragon. This happens quite often. You take an opening system, play it in a certain move order and transpose into an entirely different system. The c5- and d4-pawns have been traded, and now we have a Sicilian Dragon. Normally, these pawns are traded on the third move. This time it is happening ten moves later. Question: If you compare this to a normal Sicilian Dragon, Black's pawn structure is the same, but some of his pieces are on different squares. Which ones? Answer: The knight on d7 and the bishop on b7. Question: What advantage does Black enjoy that he would not normally have? Answer: Black has more space on the queenside. Yes. This is something that Black prays for in the Dragon! Answer: And his light-square bishop is very active. Very good. Question: What is wrong with White's position? Answer: White looks cramped. The light-square bishop and the knight on e1 are both useless. Question: Where is that knight normally placed? Answer: On d4. Yes, that knight is normally on d4! Question: In that case, where should the dark-square bishop be? Answer: On e3. Correct. This bishop should be behind the knight so that it is less vulnerable to attack. Question: If the bishop on d4 is traded, what are the consequences for White? Answer: He will have trouble protecting his dark squares. After 15.b3
[diagram]
Yes. White will get killed on the dark squares! This sets the course for the rest of the game. Black will go after this bishop, trade it off, and infiltrate on the dark squares.
14...Nb6
Clearly, no good player would trade this bishop for a knight. Black is planning to play ...Nc4 and annoy White's queen. White decides not to let this happen.
15.b3? (D)
When my opponent made this move, I nearly fell out of my chair! This is such a short- sighted move. White is only thinking one move ahead. This does stop ...Nc4, but the long-term consequences are considerable. Question: This move creates weaknesses that will not go away. What are they? Answer: The bishop on g7 is much stronger now. True. That bishop would be a monster if White did not have his own bishop on d4, as it would bear down on the diagonal unopposed and exploit the pinned knight on c3. Answer: You can set up a queen-rook battery along the c-file, and get more pressure on c3. Excellent. The c3 square is where the c-file intersects with the long diagonal. It is therefore a critical square. Removing its protection by advancing the b-pawn weakens both the file and the diagonal. The knight coming into c4 would have been annoying, but weakening c3 is much worse. This kind of mistake is common. Do not sacrifice long-term interests for short-term gain. Black is winning, but there is still some work to do.

[diagram]
18...Nh5 19.Kh2
White is worried about the knight's jumping into g3.
19...Nf4 (D)
Question: What is the value of bringing this knight into f4? Answer: To play ...Qf2, attacking g2. It is still too soon to bring the queen in. Besides, g2 is already protected. Answer: To attack the bishop on e2. I did not move the knight here to capture his bishop. Sometimes you may have friends in the enemy camp. At the moment, the bishop on e2 is my greatest friend - it gets in White's way. Right now, you could not pay me to take that bishop! Do not trade active pieces for inactive pieces. Question: What did we say Black is trying to do? Lamon - Weeramantry 1990 (Modern Defense) Answer: Get the bishop on g7 into the game. Question: Now make the connection: why ...Nf4 ? Answer: To bring the bishop to h6. Of course! We are setting up a screen so the bishop can move safely to h6. Look at which of White's pieces are on the c1-h6 diagonal. They make great targets.
20.Bf1 Bh6 21.Nd5 (D)
Question: White's last move simply delays the inevitable. How does Black reply? Answer: Bishop takes knight. Question: Excellent!...Bxd5 is absolutely the best move in the position. Why? Answer: It removes the centralized knight. Black's light-square bishop isn't doing much. Right! This bishop is not participating in the attack, so use him to remove the troublesome knight. We just said, "Do not trade active pieces for inactive pieces." The flip side is that you want to trade inactive pieces for active ones.
21...Bxd5 22.exd5 (D)
Everything appears in place for the attack, but there is one final preparation to be made. Question: What is the final piece to this puzzle? Answer: The bishop on h6 must be protected so the knight can set up a discovered attack. Question: So, what should Black play? Answer: ...Kg7. Now you are talking chess! Look how easy it is. Black wants to move his knight, so what does he do? He plays this quiet little king move which turns out to be the best attacking move in the entire game. Even the king has joined in the attack!
22...Kg7! 23.Rb1 (D)
White moves one of his major pieces off the c1-h6 diagonal, but it is too late. Question: Now we are ready for the final assault. What is the best move? Answer: ...Nxh3, with a discovered attack on White's queen. Correct.
23...Nxh3 24.Qd3 Qg1+
Black is not afraid to sacrifice the knight.
25.Kxh3 Bf4 (D)
This creates a mating net. If the opponent has an escape route, do not keep checking. Seal off the escape route first. Unable to avoid mate, White resigns. 0-1 Lamon - Weeramantry 1990 (Modern Defense) Just a glance at the final diagram should make it clear that Black's control of the dark squares around White's king was the critical factor in the game. After 18.Qhl

ANSWERS
Exercise 4-1: How could White avoid the trade 17.Bxb6 and not lose a piece? Answer: After 16...e5 (D), Black threatens the bishop on d4, which protects the knight on c3. In the game, White played
17.Bxb6 to avoid losing a piece. He could have done so without making this trade.
White just retreats the bishop to e3. After 17.Be3 Qxc3 18.Qxc3 Rxc3, the b6-knight is no longer protected, so White restores material equality with 19.Bxb6, retaining the protector of the dark squares. Exercise 4-2: Using the position after 18.Kh1 (D), determine who controls more space. Answer: For each side, we count the squares attacked in the opponent's half of the board. We count d4 twice, as it is attacked twice. So we have thirteen attacks by Black, and nine by White. That's a big difference. Black's attacking chances are better.

LESSON 5
[diagram]
ONE TO REMEMBER
am going to show a game I played during an event held in England back in 1972. This is another illustration of how to exploit aweak color complex. In the game featured in our previous lesson, Iwas able to take advantage of a weakness my opponent created. This time I had to induce the weakness. To do this, I sacrificed a rook to decoy the dark-square bishop, which is the natural protector of the weakened squares. Then I built an attack which delivered victory.
R. HARRIS - S. WEERAMANTRY
London, 1972
1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6
This introduces the Pirc Defense, popularized by the Yugoslav grandmaster Vasja Pirc. The essential difference between the Modern Defense and the Pirc is that in the former, Black fianchettoes his king's bishop before developing the knight.
4.f4 (D)
White chooses the Austrian Attack, an aggressive response to the Pirc. He is following classical principles of development by setting up a broad pawn center, while Black uses the hypermodern concept of challenging the center from afar. Harris - Weeramantry 1972 (Pirc Austrian Attack) I happen to like playing against the broad center. King's Fianchetto players get energized when they see a wall of pawns that they can target. True, the center is very strong, but so is the fianchetto. This is like two gladiators of old fighting with different weapons - one with a sword and shield, the other with a net and trident.
4...Bg7 5.Nf3 O-O (D)
There is an important alternative here. Black can hit back at the center immediately with
5...c5. This move was made popular after it was employed by Bobby Fischer in his celebrated
1972 World Championship match against Boris Spassky. It led to a hard-fought draw.
Question: After ...O-O, White has a choice of how to proceed. What moves can he play? Answer: f5. Notice that f5 would lose a pawn. Some people may argue that it is worth a pawn to break up Black's fianchetto structure. I disagree. Black can take the pawn safely with 6...gxf5 7.exf5 Bxf5 and retreat the bishop, ifnecessary, to g6 to strengthen the castled position. If White wants to play f5, the proper way to do it is to play Bd3 first to give f5 more support. Answer: e5. (D) Now, there is an interesting move. In fact, I have played this position from both sides. Black can trade pawns immediately with 6...dxe5, but this leads to a space advantage for White after 7.dxe5 Qxd1+ 8.Kxd1. The balanced pawn structure makes it difficult for Black to After 7,h4 (6.e5 variation)
[diagram]
After 5...O-O counter White's control of the center. The fact that White's king has moved does not present any danger, as queens have been traded and Black is not fully developed. The other option is for Black to accept the challenge with 6...Nfd7 7.h4. (D) Question: What is the best way to answer an attack on the flank? Answer: With a counterattack in the center. Right! The most effective way to handle a flank attack is to strike back in the center. Do you understand why? The attacker must have unimpeded movement of his pieces from one sector of the board to the other in order to reinforce the attack. If the enemy breaks through the middle, he will break the coordination of the attacking pieces. Question: Now that you understand the idea, what should Black play? Answer: ...c5. Yes. This is a very clever move. You are attacking the base of White's pawn chain and placing pawns in contact at two different points. If White takes the c5-pawn, Black takes the e5-pawn. If White takes the d6-pawn, Black takes the d4-pawn. If White does not take either, then Black takes both! First take the d4-pawn, then the e5-pawn. If both of White's pawns disappear, so does his center. To break a pawn chain, undermine the base and simultaneously put pressure at other points along the chain. Back to the game after 5...O-O: (D) After 7...Ka5 (6.±e2 variation) After 6,Jld3 Harris - Weeramantry 1972 (Pirc Austrian Attack) Question: So far, we have examined pawn advances. What else should we consider? Answer: Be2. Yes, it is time to consider some piece moves. Black now strikes at the center with 6...c5. White's best response is 7.dxc5. In this position, Black should not recapture, as moving his d6- pawn will allow White to expand in the center. Question: If Black will not recapture with 7...dxc5, how can he justify giving up a pawn? Answer: 7...Qa5 (D) pins the knight on c3 and threatens the center pawn. Excellent. 7...Qa5 is a very powerful move. Once White protects e4, Black has time to capture on c5 with the queen and maintain his d6-pawn. Most inexperienced players will respond by capturing the entire black pawn chain, continuing with 8.cxd6 Nxe4 9.dxe7 Re8. This, however, works out very well for Black. White's king is still in the center, the attack on the pinned knight on c3 is very strong, and once Black opens up the center, the influence of the fianchettoed bishop increases. Best for White after
7...Qa5 is8.O-O Qxc5+ 9.Kh1.
There is one other bishop move White might try. Answer: Bd3. By process of elimination, we have arrived at the move that was played in this game.
6.Bd3 (D)
After 7.O-O
[diagram]
Question: We have seen how 6...c5 is a good idea in response to 6.Be2. Does the same idea work against 6.Bd3 ? Answer: No, because the e4-pawn is now protected for a second time. Bravo! Once you start making these connections, you are on your way to becoming a better player. You must be able to determine if an idea is still applicable when the position has changed. Learn to appreciate subtle differences. Question: How does Black continue his development after Bd3 ? Answer: Black can play ...c6 followed by ...b5. There is a drawback to this plan. Queenside expansion is too slow. It allows White uncontested play in the center. I played...
6...Nc6
There have been more recent developments in this line, in particular 6...Na6. You may wish to examine them yourself. The point behind 6... Nc6 is to put pressure on the central dark squares, and to prepare a pawn break on e5.
7.O-O (D)
Question: What should Black play next? Answer: ...e5. Good idea. This is consistent with the idea of striking in the center.
7...Bg4
Black pursues the same idea in a different way. Pinning the knight threatens the pawn on d4.
8.Be3
White protects d4 and completes his development at the same time. Another good option is
8.e5, which appears to give White a slight edge.
Question: Now, what must Black do, before it is too late? Answer: Push the e-pawn. Push the pawn and hit the center before White plays to e5 himself! Notice how Black's last two moves (6...Nc6 and 7...Bg4) each support ...e7-e5. The knight move adds a defender, and After 8"*e5 After 10,,.£jxe5 (10,fxe5 variation) Harris - Weeramantry 1972 (Pirc Austrian Attack) the bishop move subtracts an attacker. You can already see that the battle will be over who controls the dark squares.
8...e5 (D)
A good way to break up a three-pawn center is to push the pawn that is on the same file as the middle pawn in your opponent's formation. In this way, you are attacking each of his outside pawns, setting up two trading options to break his structure. Should the opponent initiate the trade, he should capture from one side and then advance the pawn on the other side. He should not capture twice so as to ensure he is not left with an isolated pawn. Look at what happens to his center if he captures twice after 9.dxe5 dxe5: 10.fxe5 Nxe5: (D) His once-proud center is reduced to rubble. Furthermore, Black's knight on e5 is very strong because it occupies the square in front of the isolated pawn.
9.dxe5 dxe5 10.h3
White took once, but did not push the other pawn. Instead, he attacked the bishop.
10...Bxf3 (D)
After 10...±xf3 After 12, c5
[diagram]
This is not the most accurate move order. Black should have played 10...exf4 isolating White's e4-pawn. The best play would then be 11.Bxf4 Be6, with play for both sides. Note that if White first played 11.Bc5, we would transpose back into this game with 11...Bxf3 12.Qxf3 Nh5.
11.Qxf3 exf4 12.Bc5 (D)
White hopes to chase Black's rook out of f8 in order to create pressure along the f-file and particularly on f7.
12...Nh5
Surprise! Realizing that the dark squares around White's king are weak, Black protects his f4- pawn and offers to give up the exchange in order to eliminate White's key defender of those dark squares.
13.Bxf8 (D)
Harris - Weeramantry 1972 (Pirc Austrian Attack) This identical position was reached by transposition in the 1988 correspondence game N. Carlsson-M. Carlsson. In that game, Black recaptured on f8 immediately. Ichose to delay the recapture in favor of two intermediate moves that bring two black pieces into attacking position. Question: What is the first of these intermediate moves? Answer: ...Bd4+. Correct. This brings Black's bishop to a critical diagonal.
13...Bd4+ 14.Kh2 (D)
White moves his king to h2, as 14.Kh1 would allow Black's knight into g3 with check. Question: Black still does not have all of his pieces in the best attacking positions. More preparation is required. What is the next intermediate move? Answer: ...Qh4. ...Qh4 could be an important part of the attack, but, ifplayed immediately, White would try to force a trade of queens with Qg4. As a general principle, when you are defending, trade queens; when attacking, keep them on. Answer: ...Ne5. Yes. The c6-knight now joins the attack.
14...Ne5 (D)
After 16dLe7! (variation) Look at what has happened - in just a few moves, Black's pieces have taken total control of the dark squares. We could make a movie out of this - Invasion of the Dark Squares. Notice where White's dark-square bishop is while all this is going on - conveniently out of the picture. White's queen must move. If it goes to e2, Black plays ...Ng3, and the other knight comes dancing in with tempo!
15.Qd1
Black is down a rook at present. Does he have enough compensation? I spent a good half- hour trying to decide whether to take the bishop or keep on attacking. Ifelt that the attack had enough momentum and did not want to waste a tempo recapturing the bishop.
15...Qh4
Computer analysis suggests that 15...Kxf8 is stronger. Now White gets greedy and tries to hang on to all his material. Instead, he could have played the remarkably annoying 16.Be7! (D), which was pointed out in annotations to the correspondence game referred to earlier. White attempts to draw Black's queen away from its attacking position. After 16...Qxe7, White will gain time to reorganize his defense with 17.Be2. Though Black still has the advantage, the crisis is forestalled. When ahead in material, do not hesitate to give back all or part of it as needed. In the game, White did not find 16.Be7, but instead played After 16.1h6?
[diagram]
Harris - Weeramantry 1972 (Pirc Austrian Attack)
16.Bh6? (D)
Now White has serious problems. See how strong the f4-pawn is? It is controlling g3, a key square. The bishop on d4 is patrolling the g1-h7 diagonal, preventing White's king from moving back there. The two knights are ready to jump into the fray. All this highlights Black's complete control of the dark squares around White's king. Meanwhile, what is White doing? The bishop on d3 isnothing but an overgrown pawn. The rook on f1 has little mobility. The bishop on h6 is still out of the game. White has no influence over the dark squares at all. When all the pawns around the enemy king are on the same color, the opposite color squares become weak. Attack on the weak color. Question: Everything is ready for the final attack. What does Black do? Answer: Play ...f5; then the knight can come to g4 with check. Your idea of protecting g4 to set up ...Ng4+ is good. However, White can simply take that pawn and refute your plan. Show me another way to get in ...Ng4+. Answer: Black can play ...f3. Excellent! This is an interference move. It interferes with the queen's protection of g4 and attempts to destroy the pawn cover in front of White's king.
16...f3! (D)
After 19,Sxg3 Black's leapfrogging knights now threaten ...Ng4+ followed by ...Ng3#. Exercise 5-1: If White plays 17.gxf3, show how Black wins.
17.Rxf3
White is still up a rook, but with Black's pieces swarming around his king, it certainly does not appear that way. Inactive or underdeveloped pieces have a way of blending inconspicuously into the background, while active pieces seem to jump right at you! Question: What should Black play now? Answer: ...Ng4+. Yes, taking the rook would be a mistake. Black's knights are much stronger.
17...Ng4+ 18.Kh1 Ng3+ 19.Rxg3 (D)
White has no choice but to take the knight. Question: What does Black do now? Answer: ...Qxg3. No. That is precisely what White is wishing for; he can then continue with Qxg4. Black has something much better. Answer: ...Nf2+ forking the king and the queen. Harris - Weeramantry 1972 (Pirc Austrian Attack) That's it. Here I was feeling quite satisfied, but White has one final trick left.
19...Nf2+ 20.Kh2 Nxd1 21.Bg5 (D)
Question: White moves his bishop out of danger and gains a tempo by attacking Black's queen. Does the queen have a safe move? Answer: No. h5 is the only square not being attacked, but 22.Be2 would trap the queen. Indeed. White thought he had caught me. It would have been a shame to ruin the game, when I was on the brink of victory, by making a careless move. Question: So, what is the winning move? Answer: ...Bg1+. Excellent. This is an intermediate move that draws the king away from the rook. It is important to not always just respond to an attack, but to look for counterattacks. My opponent's face fell a mile when he saw this!
21...Bg1+ 22.Kxg1 Qxg3 23.Rxd1 Qxg5 (D)
White resigns. 0-1 Less-experienced players should not resign at this stage; there is still some play left. However, we are both strong masters, and evidently my opponent felt that he had no real chances. White's bishop and knight are powerless against the queen. Even if White sets up a fortress, there will come a point when something will have to move and the fortress will crumble. After IZgxfj (variation)

White is threatening Kf7 and Bg7#. Exercise B1-1: If Black tries to defend with 40...Kg8, how does White finish the game? (B2) Alekhine - Yates, Carlsbad 1923 [E62] Yates avenges his 1922 loss to Alekhine. Ironically, it is once again dark-square control that guarantees victory.

28...Be5 29.Re2 Rdf6 30.Nd1 Rf4 31.Ne3 Rh4 32.Qe6 (D)
White is unable to challenge Black's dominance on the dark squares. Black now begins a long sequence of forcing moves.
32...Qh5 33.Ng4 Rxg4 34.fxg4 Rxf1+ 35.Kg2 Qxh2+
Black is prepared to give up his rook, as he has concluded that his queen and bishop are sufficient to continue the attack.
36.Kxf1 Qh1+ 37.Kf2 Bd4+ 38.Kg3 Qg1+ 39.Kh3
Interposing with 39.Rg2 is met with 39...Qe1+ 40.Kh3 g5, transposing into the game position after Black's 42nd move.

This quiet move controls another key dark square and threatens mate on h4.
43.Rc2 Qf1+
Or 43...Qd1 immediately.
44.Kh2 Qg1+ 45.Kh3 Qh1+ 46.Kg3 (D)
White is unable to stop Black's attack, as his pieces are not in position to protect his king.

Black threatens White's rook. Exercise B2-1: Find a forced mate after 47.Rh2.
47.Rc3
This does not save Black. It, too, leads to a forced mate.

Bh6 Bh8 24.Rd8 Bb7 25.Rad1 Bg7 26.R8d7 Rf8 27.Bxg7 Kxg7 28.R1d4 Rae8 (D) White has total control of the d-file and a firm grip on the kingside dark squares. Black's pieces cannot access the kingside, so White can maneuver his pieces freely.
29.Qf6+ Kg8 30.h4 h5 (D)
With the pawn structure now fixed, White begins the winning maneuver.
31.Kh2!
White's king marches out to help his queen with the mating attack. The king is headed for h6!
31...Rc8
Black can mount a better defense with 31...Bc8. However, White's stranglehold on the kingside enables him to give up a rook for the attack: 32.Ng5 Bxd7 33.g4 and Black is helpless to keep his king position from being forced open.
32.Kg3 Rce8 33.Kf4 Bc8 34.Kg5 1-0
Black resigns in light of 35.Kh6 threatening mate on g7. Exercise B3-1: Against 34...Kh7, what is the most efficient win? After 12...Bb7 (B4) Dobiáš - Podgorný 1952 (B4) Dobiáš - Podgorný, Prague 1952 [C10]

Both sides have completed their development and Black is threatening to disrupt White's pawn structure with ...Bxf3. White's reply addresses this threat while also initiating a diabolical plan.
13.d5 exd5?
Black cannot resist accepting this pawn sacrifice.
14.Rfe1
This move exploits the dark-square weaknesses created by 11...g6. It threatens to remove Black's dark-square bishop, which is the key defender of the kingside.
14...h6
An unusual defense. Black prevents Rxe7 by breaking up White's battery.
15.Qxh6 Ng4 16.Qh4 Bxg5 17.Nxg5 Nf6 18.Qh6
This creates a mating net around Black's king.
18...d4 (D)
Black prevents White's intended rook maneuver Re1-e3-h3, with a devastating attack along the h-file. However, White has a stunning reply.
19.Re6!

22.Bd3 h6
This further weakens the light squares. Black's best chance to blunt White's attack is 22...f5, clearing apath for his queen to return to the kingside. On the other hand, 22...g6 fails against the sacrificial attack with 23.Bxg6 hxg6 24.Qxg6+ Kh8 25.Qh6+ Kg8 26.Nh5.
23.Bg6 Rf8 24.Nf5 c5? (D)

White leaves his a7-rook hanging. Exercise B5-1: If Black captures the offered rook with 29...Rxa7, what does White do?
29...Qc6
Black moves out of the pin and attempts to exert pressure on White's position by targeting g2 with the queen-and-bishop battery.

Black's king is not vulnerable despite his pawn advances because White's pieces are massed on the queenside.
19...g3!
Black sacrifices a pawn to access the dark squares around White's king.
20.hxg3 fxg3 21.Bxg3 Nh5 22.Bh2
The bishop could cover more dark squares from f2.

This takes away the possibility of Nd2-c4.

After 43.Sg5 (B7) R.Byrne - Fischer 1963 White sealed this move and resigned without resuming the game. Black would win with

b6 10.b3 Ba6 11.Ba3 Re8 12.Qd2 e5 13. dxe5 Nxe5 14.Rfd1 (D) White anticipates Black's occupation of the weak d3 square and moves his rook into defensive position. Unfortunately, he moves the wrong rook and fatally weakens f2.

A destructive sacrifice.
16.Kxf2 Ng4+ 17.Kg1 Nxe3 18.Qd2 (D)
After 18.Sd2
[diagram]
White had to move to safety. Black has two pawns for the sacrificed piece and must decide how to continue his attack.
18...Nxg2
Rather than capturing the rook, Black removes the one piece that is defending his kingside, and further weakens White's light squares.
19.Kxg2 d4
It is important to open the long diagonal immediately, or else White will blockade the pawn with Ne2-d4.
20.Nxd4 Bb7+ 21.Kf1 (D)
Some observers actually thought Fischer was losing, but he surprises everyone with a "quiet" move. Watch those light squares!
21...Qd7!
Black's queen takes one step forward and transfers to the light squares. White resigns. 0-1 Exercise B7-1: If White plays on with 22.Qf2, how does Black conclude the game? (B8) Fischer - Myagmarsuren, Sousse Interzonal 1967 [C00] After 22...&C3 (B8) Fischer - Myagmarsuren 1967

18.Ng5 Nd5 19.Bd2 Bxg5 20.Bxg5 Qd7 21.Qh5 Rfc8 22.Nd2 Nc3 (D)
It is striking that all of Black's pieces, with the exception of his king, are on the queenside. The position cries out for a kingside attack.
23.Bf6!
In the previous illustrative game, Fischer sacrificed his knight for a pawn. This time, he simply puts his bishop en prise and invites Black to capture it. This, too, qualifies as a destructive sacrifice.
23...Qe8
Exercise B8-1: After 23...gxf6 24.exf6 Kh8, how does White continue?
24.Ne4 g6 25.Qg5 Nxe4 26.Rxe4 c4 27.h5 cxd3 28.Rh4 Ra7 29.Bg2
White redeploys his bishop for the final assault.
29...dxc2 (D)
Too little, too late. Winning the battle on the queenside is no use when the king's defense collapses. White has a forced mate.
30.Qh6 Qf8 31.Qxh7+! 1-0

12.Bh6 Bf8 13.Bxf8 Kxf8 14.Qd2
White transfers his queen to the diagonal of the opposite color and connects his rooks. Black's lack of development becomes critical.
14...Ne8 15.Rad1 Kg7 16.f4 Qc8 17.Nd5 Rf8
Black completes castling by hand, but the extra moves give White the time to build a powerful attack.
18.e5 dxe5 19.f5! Qd8 (D)
Black returns to the dark squares, indicating that the earlier 16...Qc8 was strategically incorrect.
20.f6+
This dual-purpose move clears f5 and initiates a dark-square attack.
20...Nxf6 21.Nf5+
After 22...gg8 (B10) Weeramantry - Kumar 2004 The knight cannot be captured, for 21...gxf5 leads to a winning attack after 22.Qg5+ Kh8
23.Nxf6 Nd7 24.Rxf5.
21...Kh8 22.Qh6 Rg8 (D)
Black moves his rook to guard against the mate on g7. He cannot do this with 22...Nh5 because 23.Nf6 Qxf6 24.Qxf8 is mate.
23.Nxf6 1-0
If Black plays on with 23...Qxf6, White replies 24.Nd6, with a decisive attack on the f7 square. Black must give up the queen to avoid mate. (B10) Weeramantry - Kumar, Mallorca Olympiad 2004 [C54]

16.Qh6 Ne6 17.h4 Qe7 (D)
White has more space in the center and is ready to launch an attack on the weakened dark squares on the kingside.
18.h5 Bd7 19.g3 b6?
This is too slow. Black must challenge White's queen without delay by playing 19...Rfe8 followed by ...Qf8.
20.Kg2 c5 21.Rh1 Be8 22.Rae1?!
After 17...dxe4 Moving his h-rook up the file allows White to double rooks faster.
22...Rc8 23.Rh4 Rc7 24.Reh1 c4? (D)
Black overlooks White's threat. Clearing his second rank with 24...f5 is essential. If you have been playing over these games in sequence, you already know what is coming next... White now wins as in Fischer-Myagmarsuren (Game B8): 25.Qxh7+! Kxh7 26.hxg6+ and there is no way to avoid mate: 26...Kg7 27.Rh7+ Kg8 28.Rh8+ Kg7 29.R1h7#. 1-0 (B11) Kramnik - Van Wely, Dortmund 2008 [D30]

On the other hand, White's minor pieces have the potential to support a kingside attack.
18.c5!
This pawn advance cuts the a3-f8 diagonal and threatens to trap Black's bishop.
18...bxc5 19.a3 Ba5 20.dxc5 Qxc5?
Accepting the pawn sacrifice allows White to open the d-file and the long diagonal for his dark-square bishop. After 21...Sfb5 (B11) Kramnik - Van Wely 2008
21.b4 Qb5 (D)
The only way for Black to avoid losing a piece is to pin the b4-pawn. However, both Black's queen and his dark-square bishop have now drifted to the wrong side of the board, leaving Black's king defenseless.
22.Qg3
As Black's key defenders are now out of position, White choses to apply pressure on the dark squares. An alternative approach is to open the kingside with 22.f5.
22...Bb6
Black need not move his bishop back immediately as White's b4-pawn is still pinned. However, he does not have a good alternative. For instance, if Black attempts to protect his g7- pawn with 22...f5, White will plant his queen on g6 and Black will be unable to chase it out of this outpost.
23.Nd7
White threatens mate on g7. The attack on the dark squares has begun.
23...g6 24.Nf6+ Kf8 (D)
Black's king must abandon the kingside as he no longer has any pawn shelter on the dark squares inside the castled position. After 28.Nd6
[diagram]
25.Be5
White continues his offensive on the dark squares. He could, however, achieve the same goal with even greater effect by advancing his f-pawn to f5, opening the h2-b8 diagonal for his queen.
25...Rcc8 26.Qh4 h5
If Black plays ...Bxe3+ here, he loses any possibility of a later defense with ...Bd8.
27.Nh7+ Ke8 28.Bd6 (D)
White's queen and bishop have cleverly switched their diagonals while maintaining the dark- square attack. The new focal point ise7.
28...Rc7
Black has no choice. Unfortunately, the attempt to defend against the mate threat on e7 with
28...Bd8 fails to 29.Nf6+ Bxf6 30.Qxf6.
29.Rfd1 1-0
The threat of Nf6+ followed by the discovered attack along the d-file is too much for Black to handle. (B12) Graif - Can, Chicago 2019 [B42] This game was played by one of Sunil's longtime students, William Graif, who has been a national scholastic champion twice in the United States and twice in Canada. Even though he was on the losing end, William sent this game to Sunil as an example of enterprising play against a weak color complex.

9.a4 b6 10.f4 Be7 11.Bd2 O-O 12.Rae1 g6 13.Bc4 Bb7 14.Ba2 Rfe8 (D)
After 2O.Bf3? (B12) Graif - Ali Maranda 2019 Black has adopted a "Hedgehog" formation where none of his pawns have advanced beyond the third rank. Despite the relative lack of space, Black's position is very solid and there are no clear targets for White to attack. Black's last move anticipates White's pawn break with f4-f5, and places the f8-rook on the e- file as a deterrent. It also frees the f8 square to enable the transfer of his bishop to g7.
15.f5 exf5 16.exf5 d5
Black shuts down the a2-g8 diagonal and gives his dark-square bishop other options for deployment.
17.fxg6 hxg6
The trade of pawns created opportunities for both sides. White's rooks are well placed on the e- and f-files and he has pressure on Black's isolated d-pawn. Black has play on the dark squares.
18.Bf4 Qc5 19.Be3 Bd6
Black chooses the sharpest continuation, leaving his queen in a potential discovered attack. His bishop, for the moment, is in a far better spot than it would be on g7, and is eyeing the h2- pawn.
20.Qf3? (D)
White moves his queen out of the pin but misses Black's threat. To keep the balance, White must play 20.h3. After 25.£rf5
[diagram]
20...Rxe3!
This powerful exchange sacrifice eliminates the key defender of White's dark squares and sets up a winning attack.
21.Qxe3 Ng4 22.Qd2 Bxh2+ 23.Kh1 Bg3 24.Re2 Nde5
Black has played a series of forcing moves since the exchange sacrifice and completely dominates the dark squares around White's king. Not only does 24...Nde5 move the second knight into attacking position, it also shields the e7 square, enabling Black's queen to relocate to the kingside.
25.Nf5 (D)
White must rely on drastic measures to survive, and sacrifices a knight in search of counterplay. The alternative 25.Nf3 is met by 25...Kg7 threatening ...Rh8+, after which Black will win material.
25...gxf5 26.Qg5+ Kf8
While this move is strong enough to win, Black also has a most unusual way of securing victory with 26...Ng6 27.Qxf5 Nh6 28.Qg5 Kg7! 29.Qxg3 Rh8 and White is helpless against the discovered check.
27.Rxf5 Qd6?
This gives back most of Black's advantage. Instead he should play 27...Re8, when 28.Rfxe5 Rxe5 29.Qxg4 is met by a crushing reply. (D) (B12) Graif - Ali Maranda 2019 Exercise B12-1: In the position after 27...Re8 28.Rfxe5 Rxe5 29.Qxg4, find a crushing move for Black.
28.Rexe5 Bxe5 29.Qxg4
White recoups his material, and even boxes in Black's king. However, Black's control of the dark squares gives him greater attacking chances.
29...Re8 30.Rg5? (D)
Just when it appears that White is back in the game, he makes a decisive mistake. He is hoping to play Rg8 and trade rooks, but he never gets the chance. The only way to put up further resistance is to play 30.Qh5 instead.
30...Qh6+!
Black's complete domination of the dark squares, coupled with his deep tactical awareness, brings the game to a sudden close.
31.Qh5
White has two other ways to meet this check: 1) If he runs away with 31.Kg1, Black creates deadly threats down the e-file with 31...Bh2+
32.Kf1 Qf6+ 33.Rf5 Qe6, winning material by force.
2) If he blocks with 31.Rh5, Black has the spectacular 31...Bg3! threatening a back-rank mate. After 32.Qxg3 Qxh5+, Black has a comfortably winning position. (31...Bd6 also wins.)
31...Qf6!
Black once again threatens a back-rank mate. Now that White's queen is on h5, White no longer has the resource ...Rg8+. Now if White brings the knight back to block a back-rank check, he runs into a problem along the h-file: 32.Ne2 Bd6 33.Ng1 is met by 33... Ke7! with the threat of ...Rh8.
32.Rf5 (D)
White blocks Black's queen, but does not succeed in eliminating all back-rank threats. After 32.2f5 abcdetgh

(D) Answer: White concludes with 30.Qe6+ Kf8 31.Qe8#. The elegant maneuver of White's queen from d1 to g4 to e6 to e8 is striking. Exercise B5-2: If Black tries 32 ...Qa6, how does White conclude the game? (D) Answer: White plays 33.Ng6+ Kh7 34.Ne5+ Kh8 35.Nf7+ Kg8. (D)
36.Nxh6+ Kh8 37.Qg8+ Rxg8 38.Nf7 with an unusual smothered mate. Though there is no
pawn at h7, White's bishop covers the square. Taimanov-Najdorf 1953 Exercise B6-1: After 33.Rc2, find a quicker win than 33...Bh3. (D) Answer: Black missed an immediate win with 33...Rxf3!. If 34.gxf3, then 34...Qg1+ 35.Bxg1 Rxg1+ 36.Kh2 Nxf3#. If White declines the sacrifice with 34.Ra1 for instance, Black wins with 34...Ng3+ 35.Bxg3 Rxg3, threatening ...Rh3+ followed by ...Qg1#. R. Byrne-Fischer 1963 Exercise B7-1: If White plays on with 22.Qf2, how does Black finish the game? Answer: Black continues 22...Qh3+, forcing 23.Kg1. (D) The game now concludes with two deflections, one immediately following the other:
23...Re1+ 24.Rxe1 Bxd4, and 25.Qxd4 allows 25...Qg2#.

PART C
THE INITIATIVE
he games in this section emphasize the dynamic elements of an attacking game. The dynamic player strives to seize and maintain the initiative, and to deploy his pieces so that they are active and work well together in attack and defense. Critical elements of these games include time, space, and understanding why and when to sacrifice material. Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano)
LESSON 6
[diagram]
"SAW IT - WENT HOME"
here are two ways to play chess: you can take control yourself, or you can sit back and wait for the play to come to you. The attacking player always strives for the initiative. To gain the initiative, you make a threat that your opponent must meet. To retain the initiative, you continue to operate with threats. This game was played in 1895 by the first official World Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz. Considered the first great master of positional play, Steinitz stressed concepts such as strong squares, weak pawns, and the importance of good technique. In this game, you will see Steinitz build an initiative in the center through a series of trades, then translate it into control of a strong square. Once he establishes that control, he dominates the board. A famous story is told about this game. Steinitz was out of the room when von Bardeleben realized he was lost. He left a note saying "Saw it - went home." What made von Bardeleben give up without formally resigning was something truly amazing, as you will see. The final combination is so stunning that Steinitz is said to have been very upset when he realized he would not get a chance to play it. His only satisfaction was to show it to the spectators after the game.
W. STEINITZ - C. VON BARDELEBEN
Hastings (England) 1895
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5
The Italian Game, commonly referred to as the Giuoco Piano, is one of the oldest known openings and was played as far back as the early 1500s.
4.c3 (D)
After 4.c3
[diagram]
After 6,e5! (4...Bf6 variation)
[diagram]
White plans to extend his pawn chain with 5.d4 in an effort to seize control of the center. Black cannot do anything to stop this. Question: Even 4...Qf6, adding another attacker, is insufficient. Why? Answer: Because the queen is coming out too early and will get chased around. Yes. That's the idea. Black's queen placement can be exploited with a clever pawn sacrifice:
4...Qf6 5.d4 exd4 6.e5!. (D)
Black does not have a good answer to the attack on his queen. Any queen move that does not create an immediate threat simply allows White to gain a tempo and keep the initiative. On the other hand, if Black captures the attacking pawn with 6...Nxe5, White, with 7.Qe2, pins the knight and wins a piece. Neither active defense (7...dxc3 8.Nxe5 Bxf2+ 9.Kd1) nor passive defense (7...d6 8.cxd4) will save the piece. Black has a third option in 6...Qg6, attacking the g2-pawn. Exercise 6-1: After 4...Qf6 5.d4 exd4 6.e5! Qg6, how should White proceed? Black can also try to suppress d2-d4 with 4...Qe7 in the hope of capturing the e4-pawn with check after 5.d4 exd4 6.cxd4. Question: How would you respond to ...Qe7 ? Answer: I would castle. After Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano) Very good. After you castle, the threat of d4 is renewed. Black has to be careful because his king and queen are lined up on the same file. After 4...Qe7 5.O-O d6 6.d4, Black must not surrender the center with 6...exd4. Instead, he should hold the center with 6...Bb6.
4...Nf6 (D)
The best move for Black.
5.d4
The popularity of this move has declined in recent years. The quieter alternative 5.d3 is now preferred by leading grandmasters.
5...exd4
Question: What happens if Black chooses not to capture, and plays ...Bb6 ? Answer: White plays d5 attacking the knight, hoping to pick up a pawn. No. That move is bad on two counts. If White tries to win a pawn with 6.d5 Ne7 7.Nxe5, Black does not play 7...Nxe4, as it allows
8.Qg4. Instead Black regains the pawn with 7...d6 8.Nf3 Nxe4. (D)
The second reason d5 does not work is that it opens a diagonal for Black's dark-square bishop and blocks in White's light-square bishop. The variation diagram shows the effect d5 has on the two bishops; Black clearly comes out ahead. After 6...£jxe4 (5...Nb6 variation)
[diagram]
Short-term attacks can have undesirable long-term consequences. Question: Is there a better way to answer ...Bb6 ? Answer: Just play dxe5. Question: Of course! Can you show how White gains a clear advantage after 6.dxe5 Nxe4 ?
(D)
Answer: Qd5 threatens mate on f7 and attacks the knight on e4. Excellent! If Black now plays 7...Bxf2+, 8.Ke2 will win material and Black cannot defend both threats at the same time.
6.cxd4 Bb4+ (D)
This active bishop move is the right choice. White has two reasonable moves to block the check: 7.Bd2 and 7.Nc3. Question: After 7.Bd2 Bxd2+ 8.Nbxd2, it is extremely important for Black to find the right move. What is it? Answer: Pawn to d5. Yes. Two unopposed center pawns can advance with devastating effect. Trying to contain them with 8...d6 is too slow, and leaves White in firm control of the center. Black must break up White's connected center pawns immediately. It would have been a mistake for Black to reply to 7.Bd2 with 7...Nxe4. (D) After 7.,.Nxe4 (7.i,d2 variation) After 10...d5 (7.Ad2 variation) Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano) White now has a forcing sequence which regains the pawn: 8.Bxb4 Nxb4 9.Bxf7+ Kxf7
10.Qb3+. Black will now play 10...d5 to block the check. (D)
Question: Does White have a stronger move than capturing the knight immediately with Qxb4 ? Answer: White can play Ne5+ and get his knight to a strong square. Yes, the intermediate move Ne5+ centralizes the knight and forces Black's king to a worse square. Without this move, Black will be able to castle by hand2 by bringing his rook to e8 and then retreating his king to g8. Look for ways to prevent your opponent's king from reaching safety. One of my students was practicing this position after 11.Ne5+ against a computer, and encountered the following variation: 11... Ke8 12.Qxb4 Qg5. (D) After 12...Bg5 (7.Nd2 variation) g h After 7.Nc3
[diagram]
Exercise 6-2: In the position after 12...Qg5 in the 7.Bd2 variation, Black is threatening ...Qc1+ as well as the capture of the g2-pawn. How should White handle these threats? In the game, Steinitz played the other move.
7.Nc3 (D)
This line is now referred to as the Møller Attack, named for the Danish chess theorist Jørgen Møller who, in 1898, published an extensive analysis. White offers to sacrifice his e4-pawn; if Black accepts (7...Nxe4), White castles and gets active play against Black's uncastled king. The line is very complex, but modern theory finds that should both sides play the best moves, the fireworks will fizzle out and leave Black in a better position.
7...d5
Black declines the sacrifice.
8.exd5 Nxd5 9.O-O (D)
After ll.Qb3 (9... xc3 variation) Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano) Question: Does Black have time to win White's c3-pawn? Answer: No, it is too dangerous to grab pawns when your king is exposed. Agreed. Going for the pawn is ill-advised. 9...Bxc3 10.bxc3 Nxc3? loses the knight to
11.Qe1+. Of course, Black does not have to take twice on c3. But even a move such as 10...O-O
would give White a clear advantage due to his bishop pair and better control of the center. The other way of trying to win the pawn is even worse. 9...Nxc3 10.bxc3 Bxc3 gives White a chance to unleash a powerful attack with 11.Qb3. (D) Exercise 6-3: After 9...Nxc3 10.bxc3 Bxc3 11.Qb3, if Black takes the rook with 11...Bxa1, how does White win? Mobility generally triumphs over material when the defending king is weakened. In any event, von Bardeleben played more cautiously.
9...Be6 10.Bg5 Be7 (D)
This leads to a series of trades that enables White to create pressure along the open e-file and keep Black from castling. 10...Qd7 would have been safer.
11.Bxd5 Bxd5 12.Nxd5 Qxd5 13.Bxe7 Nxe7 (D)
Failing to castle compromises the safety of the king, especially when the e-file is open. Look at how lonely Black's king is. The piece trades have removed his defenders, one by one, and left him exposed in the center. Question: It is clear that White's pieces are more active, but what about his d-pawn - is it strong or weak? Answer: Weak, because it is isolated. Isolated pawns generally are weak because they cannot be protected by another pawn. On the other hand, if the pawn advances to the fifth rank or further, then the space advantage you obtain will give you more room to maneuver in the middlegame and compensate for the inherent weakness of the pawn. Here the isolated pawn is only on the fourth rank, but it is the only center pawn. As such, itstrengthens White's position by controlling key central squares. For the moment, the d4-pawn is strong, but it could become weak as the game continues. White needs to keep this in mind. Question: What is White's next move? Answer: Rook to e1. There is no question about that. After 14.Sei After 14...f6
[diagram]
Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano)
14.Re1 (D)
White pins the e7-knight and keeps Black's king from castling. This presents serious difficulties for Black which must be addressed immediately. Do not ignore a problem. It will not go away by itself. Question: Black must find a way to release the pin and get his king to safety. How can he do it? Answer: Play ...f6 and ...Kf7. Correct.
14...f6 (D)
15.Qe2
White increases the pressure along the e-file and threatens mate.
15...Qd7
Black defends the mate. Question: How should White continue? Answer: Rad1, supporting the isolated pawn. (D) A very good suggestion. This will help advance the pawn and create more space. After 16, adl (variation) After 16,Sacl abode fgh After 19 xc7+ (16>.Af7 variation) Exercise 6-4: After 16.Rad1, if Black continues with 16...Kf7, what should White do? Steinitz did develop his other rook, but to a different square.
16.Rac1 (D)
White chooses to exert pressure along the c-file and target the c7-pawn. Black should stay with his original plan and play 16...Kf7. Then, 17.Qc4+ could be easily handled with 17...Nd5. An intriguing option for White after 16...Kf7 is the exchange sacrifice 17.Qxe7+ Qxe7
18.Rxe7+ Kxe7 19.Rxc7+. (D)
After 16."c6?
[diagram]
Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano) Black should now centralize his king with 19...Kd6, after which White can pick up a second pawn, giving him a knight and two pawns for the rook. While this represents the same point value, it is a risky proposition. Black's king is well placed for the endgame and his rook can wreak havoc in an open position.
16...c6? (D)
Black gets distracted by the pressure on c7, and reacts with an overabundance of caution which leads to his downfall. From this point on, the game is beautifully played. Steinitz finds the right plan and executes it with astounding clarity and precision. He focuses on a weak square in Black's position, realizing that posting a knight to this square will dominate the entire board. Question: Which is the weak square? Answer: c5. A good square, but not sufficiently deep in Black's territory to cause trouble. Answer: d6. Much better, but White would have trouble supporting a knight on this square. Answer: e6. This is a lovely square; can the knight get there? You are now playing fantasy chess - pick a square and dream! So long as it is not totally unrealistic, you may have a chance. Question: Is getting the knight to e6 an impossible dream? Answer: No. Play 17.Rcd1 and 18.d5 to create a path for the knight. Steinitz goes one better. He realizes he can play d4-d5 right away. Black cannot take the pawn with the knight or the queen, so he must capture with his pawn. By sacrificing the pawn, White clears the d4 square which his knight will use on its way to e6. This kind of sacrifice is called aclearance sacrifice.
17.d5! cxd5
There is another purpose to sacrificing the pawn. Once Black captures with his pawn, d5 is no longer available as an outpost for his knight. After 18...Nf7
[diagram]
After 19., hc8
[diagram]
Look for sacrifices that improve your position while simultaneously depriving your opponent of key squares.
18.Nd4
The fantasy is becoming reality.
18...Kf7 (D)
This is the first step towards untangling himself. Black will next move the h-rook and slide his king behind it. White must attack now!
19.Ne6
Question: What is White's threat? Answer: Penetrate to the seventh rank with Rc7. Good. The knight is beginning to orchestrate the attack from its advanced outpost by supporting the rook invasion.
19...Rhc8 (D)
Black now moves his h-rook to cover the c-file so that it will not be boxed in when the king retreats. However, moving this rook over to the queenside leaves the kingside unprotected. Question: White has a move that sets up two different threats. Can you find it? Answer: Qh5+. After 20...g6
[diagram]
After 22JSxe7+!
[diagram]
Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano) This does look attractive because if Black goes wrong with 20...g6, White can take the pawn on h7. However, Black just retreats his king to g8 and he will have castled by hand! Answer: Nc5. The knight is well placed as it is. There is no reason to back it out. Answer: Qg4. Excellent! The immediate threat is to capture the g7-pawn with check.
20.Qg4 g6 (D)
Black stops the attack on g7.
21.Ng5+
White now carries out the second threat with a discovered attack on Black's queen.
21...Ke8 22.Rxe7+! (D)
This is the first move of a fascinating sequence. White makes this destructive sacrifice to strip away the last defenses around Black's king. Black cannot recapture with his queen because
23.Rxc8+ wins easily.
Exercise 6-5: After 22.Rxe7+, what happens if Black recaptures with the king?
22...Kf8
After 26...Nh8 (25...Ng8 variation) abcdefqh The only alternative. Incredibly, all four of White's pieces are threatened, and one of the threatened captures leads to a back-rank mate! White has no time to waste. He has to keep on checking. There are two distinct parts to Steinitz's combination. The key to the first part is to recognize the strength of the pin along the h3-c8 diagonal. Black's queen is pinned to the rook on c8. It can be difficult to see pins when both the pinned piece and the piece executing the pin are the same; in this case, aqueen is pinning a queen. The pin allows White's rook to walk arrogantly along the seventh rank without fear of capture!
23.Rf7+ Kg8 24.Rg7+ Kh8 (D)
Black's king can never move up a rank because White's queen will capture on d7 with check. Capturing the rook is therefore out of the question. Exercise 6-6: If Black's king moves back with 24...Kf8?, how does White respond?
25.Rxh7+
This is the point when von Bardeleben left the room, never to return! When Steinitz returned to the board, he could not contain his disappointment at being unable to complete the game. His only comfort was in demonstrating to the spectators this dazzling win:
25...Kg8 26.Rg7+ Kh8 (D)
After 29...Ne7 (25...Ng8 variation)
[diagram]
After 33.&fi8+ (25... g8 variation) Steinitz - von Bardeleben 1895 (Giuoco Piano) We have entered the second stage of the combination. The rook has done its job in clearing the seventh rank; it is now expendable.
27.Qh4+
White's queen takes over.
27...Kxg7 28.Qh7+ Kf8 29.Qh8+ Ke7 (D)
White's queen is inching towards Black's king.
30.Qg7+ Ke8 31.Qg8+ Ke7 32.Qf7+ Kd8 33.Qf8+: (D)
Typically, amating attack involving aqueen would include sweeping moves that emphasize the long-range power of the piece. In this game, however, the queen has moved just one square at a time for six consecutive moves, squeezing Black's king to a slow and painful death.
33...Qe8 34.Nf7+
Finally, the knight springs into action setting up a forced mate.

The bishop cannot be captured because White will fork Black's king and queen with 11.Ng5+. Exercise 6-2: In the position after 12...Qg5 in the 7.Bd2 variation, Black is threatening ...Qc1+ as well as the capture of the g2-pawn. How should White handle these threats?

White's best way to retain an advantage is 13.Nd2 Nxd2 14.Qxd2 Qxd2+ 15.Kxd2, steering the game into a favorable knight-versus-bishop ending. There is no need for White to fear losing the g2-pawn (13...Qxg2) as 14.O-O-O! Nxf2 15.Rhg1 leads to a crushing attack.

REVIEW
Themes Control of the center with pawns (4.c3, 5.d4). King in the center (10...d5 11.Ne5+ variation; 13...Nxe7; 14.Re1). Isolated center pawn (discussion after 13...Nxe7). Exchange sacrifice (16...Kf7 17.Qxe7+ variation). Clearance sacrifice (17.d5). Destructive sacrifice (22.Rxe7+). Queen and knight coordination (28.Qh7+ through 35.Qd6+ mate). Advice Short-term attacks can have undesirable long-term consequences. Look for ways to prevent your opponent's king reaching safety. Mobility generally triumphs over material when the defending king is weakened. Do not ignore a problem. It will not go away by itself. Look for sacrifices that improve your position while simultaneously depriving your opponent of key squares. __________ 2 "Castling by hand" means placing a king and rook where they achieve the effect of castling even though castling itself is no longer legal. The rook can choose any square that allows the king to move towards the corner without impeding the rook's development. Weeramantry - Goldberg 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack)
LESSON 7
[diagram]
STRIKE WHILE THE KNIGHT IS COLD
n order to become a good chess player, you must above all understand the idea of compensation. You may sacrifice material or structure in return for time and space, with the idea of gaining the initiative. Many intermediate players are reluctant to sacrifice something of value unless they can see an immediate return, but learning to make concessions for dynamic play is part of modern chess. Even though I had not calculated each and every variation to a definite conclusion, Igave up a pawn very early in this game judging that my sacrifice would generate sufficient practical chances. As you will see, it was a matter of seizing the initiative at the proper time. My opponent, Mitchell Goldberg, is a FIDE Master.
S. WEERAMANTRY - M. GOLDBERG
New York, 1991
1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4
White plays the Grand Prix Attack, one of the so-called Anti-Sicilians which refrain from opening the center as in the Open Sicilian (2.Nf3 and 3.d4).3 This system was introduced to me during my early chess-playing days at the Geneva Chess Club. I used it for the first time, with success, against IM Werner Hug in a four-way playoff for the final qualifying spot in the 1967 Under-20 Championship of Switzerland. I was ecstatic when I won the game and the playoffs along with it. This has been one of my favorite openings ever since.
3...e6 4.Nf3 d5 (D)
After 4,..d5 Strong Weaker c d Black immediately contests the center. Instead of 4...d5, his alternatives are 4...Nge7 and
4...a6, after which White's best plan may well be to turn this into an Open Sicilian with 5.d4
cxd4 6.Nxd4. Transpositions are valuable tools for taking your opponent out of his chosen system and compelling him to play yours.
5.Bb5
This is one of the main ideas of the system. White would like to play Bxc6, doubling Black's c-pawns and hoping to use them as targets. The strategy is similar to that used by Black in the Nimzo-Indian Defense, where Black plays ...Bb4 and doubles White's pawns by taking the knight on c3. Black cannot play 5...Bd7 to avoid the doubled pawns, because this would mask the queen's protection of his d5-pawn. Learning to play against doubled pawns is important. Let's look at some typical structures. If you have a three-pawn island that includes a set of doubled pawns, the strongest formation is this: As the single pawn advances, the doubled pawns get weaker because they lose support. This is the weakest formation. Notice how a single opposing pawn cripples all three of Black's pawns. Weakest c d After 7. e2 (5...d4 variation) Weeramantry - Goldberg 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) I have enjoyed tremendous success over the years playing against this particular pawn formation in the Grand Prix. When your opponent has virtually no pawn play, it is easy to predict his plans and keep the game under control. A fluid pawn structure complicates the game and makes long-term planning more difficult. Fixed structures are easier to play against.
5...Nf6 (D)
Other moves are inferior. 5...a6 is a wasted move that simply encourages White to do what he planned in the first place. If 5...d4 or 5...dxe4, White still gets to capture on c6, weakening Black's pawn structure. As we have already examined the pawn-structure weaknesses resulting from the doubled c- pawns, let us look at the position that would have arisen after 5...d4 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Ne2. (D) After 6.d3
[diagram]
After 9.&xdl (6...dxe4 variation)
[diagram]
If White is given the opportunity, he will cripple Black's c- and d-pawns with 8.d3 and further strengthen his hold over the c4 square with 9.b3. To avoid this, Black could try 7...d3. However, after 8.cxd3 Qxd3 9.Qa4 Qb5 10.Nc3, White has excellent play against Black's weakened pawn structure.
6.d3 (D)
The common move order, which I have frequently employed, is 6.Bxc6 bxc6 7.e5. However, after 7...Nd7 8.d3 Ba6, I have had trouble with the ...c5-c4 pawn thrust. The move 6.d3 is an attempt on my part to delay Black's counterplay. After all, the c8-bishop cannot go to a6 until Black's b-pawn has moved. The only drawback to 6.d3 would be if Black decided to trade queens with 6...dxe4, a move played against me in 1992 by National Master Ralph Zimmer at a tournament in Somerset, New Jersey. Although I lost that game, Iwas quite happy with my position after 7.Bxc6+ bxc6
8.dxe4 Qxd1+ 9.Kxd1 (D) and would not mind tackling this sequence again.
Black's structural weaknesses and lack of space in the center present him with some difficulties. White should be able to exploit this despite the fact that his king is uncastled. If the above variation holds up to closer scrutiny, my move order with 6.d3 would represent an improvement. In this game, Goldberg opts not to trade queens and plays a routine developing move.
6...Be7 7.O-O (D)
Weeramantry - Goldberg 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Should Black now castle, White will continue with 8.Bxc6 bxc6 9.e5. By delaying the capture on c6, White makes the ...Ba6 and ...c5-c4 idea less effective. He would have time to play b2-b3 and better control c4.
7...Bd7
Black seeks to avoid the doubled pawns. While this position is assessed as equal, Iwas now in unfamiliar territory. This was the first time I had encountered this exact sequence. When you find yourself in a new position, you must remember to take your time and consider how the position differs from what you already know. Do not rush your reply.
8.e5 Ng8? (D)
Black should have tried 8...Ng4. Retreating the knight to the first rank should be a last resort because it will take time to get it back into the game. By inducing Black's knight to go back to its starting square, White gained a lead in development. Indeed, White has gained two tempi. But remember, an advantage in development/mobility is temporary. Given sufficient time, Black will recover. The best way to exploit the advantage in development is to immediately force open the position. Look for a central pawn advance - even a sacrifice - that changes the pawn structure. This game reminded me of one played by one of my students at the 1987 World Youth Championships in Puerto Rico. White tried to relocate the c3-knight to the kingside by moving back to d1. The moment the knight hit d1, Black advanced a center pawn. Suddenly White's After 9.f5 After 9...exf5
[diagram]
entire position disintegrated, just in the space of that one move. You will not always have a center pawn to advance, but that is what you should look for. Question: So, what's the best move? Answer: White should play 9.d4. Then, if9...cxd4, 10.Nxd4 opens the center. Yes, it does trade pawns, but does not radically change the pawn structure. Answer: Play g4 and prepare f5. You are getting close, but this does not force open the position. If the other player has already castled on the kingside, you might consider this plan. For now, it is too slow. A loss in time must be exploited immediately. Answer: Play f5 right away.
9.f5 (D)
Good timing! If White does not play f4-f5 immediately, Black will stop it with 9...Nh6 and be ready to get his king out of the center. The f4-pawn was hindering the mobility of White's c1-bishop and fl-rook. Get rid of the f4- pawn and see how these two pieces come alive! New lines of attack will open up immediately.
9...exf5 (D)
10.Nxd5 Nxe5 11.Nxe5 Bxb5
Question: After 11...Bxb5, what should White play? After 12.c4
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Goldberg 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Answer: Play 12.c4, protecting the knight and attacking the b5-bishop.
12.c4 (D)
White is still down a pawn but has two strong centralized knights and pressure on the f5- pawn. He is castled and has better development. This is the position I had envisioned when I decided to play 9.f5. I had not analyzed beyond this point because I had judged that I had ample compensation for the pawn. When analyzing long variations, understanding where to pause your analysis is important. Save time on your clock and think on your opponent's time. Now, Black must move the bishop before he can free his position. Attempting to complete his development with 12...Nf6 leads to disaster. Exercise 7-1: Find White's best reply against 12...Nf6. If instead Black plays 12...Bc6, White gains a clear advantage with 13.Rxf5 Bxd5 14.cxd5 Nf6 15.Qa4+ forcing Black to move his king and depriving him of the right to castle. So the bishop goes back to d7.
12...Bd7 13.Bf4 Be6
Question: This threatens ...Bxd5. How does White proceed? Answer: Qa4+. Good. Look for forcing moves. Black's knight and rook are never going to get out.
14.Qa4+ Kf8 (D)
After 14...Qf8
[diagram]
After 15.Nc7
[diagram]
Black has no choice but to move the king. 14...Bd7, blocking the check, loses. Exercise 7-2: If 14...Bd7, how does White win material? Black's best hope is to continue with ...g7-g6 in order to sneak his king to safety on g7. Question: How does White keep his attack going? Answer: 15.Nc7. If 15...Qxc7, 16.Ng6+ wins the queen. A pretty move. You definitely have a good tactical sense. White tempts Black's queen to capture on c7 in order to set up a discovered attack. This is referred to as a magnet combination, or combination of attraction.
15.Nc7 (D)
This is a difficult position for Black to defend. Sometimes, it may be wise to give up a little material to secure active counterplay. This is one of those positions. Black's best defense would be to abandon the exchange and create much needed space for his king with 15...g5 16.Bg3 f4.
(D)
After 16...Rd8
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Goldberg 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) White now has two choices. He can take the rook with Nxa8, or the bishop with Nxe6+. Question: Which plan would you choose? Answer: Nxa8 wins material. Your move does win the exchange, but it gives Black good compensation. After 17.Nxa8 fxg3
18.Qxa7 Bd6, Black's bishop pair becomes very active. White's knight is stuck in the corner and
his queen is out of play. Answer: Nxe6+. Yes. Taking the bishop eliminates a key defender and weakens Black's king.
15...Qd4+
Black does not find the above defense.
16.Kh1 Rd8 (D)
Question: Find the best way to continue the attack. Answer: Qd1, then move over to h5, setting up Ng6+. Redeploying pieces is often an important concept. Here it is not warranted. Look at Black's pieces: most of his army is on the kingside. Why move the queen over to the side of the board where Black's pieces are concentrated? Attack where the enemy is weak. Answer: Qb3 attacks the b7-pawn. After 18.aael After 19...Nc8
[diagram]
Excellent. This is even stronger than what I played. The point, however, is not the pawn; it is that White now threatens Nb5 trapping Black's queen. Answer: Qxa7. You would go pawn hunting in this position? This is also a strong move, and is indeed what I played.
17.Qxa7
We have already observed that Black's pieces are huddled on the kingside. The queenside pawns are left defenseless. Who says you always need a combination to win? Just queen the a- pawn!
17...Bf6 18.Rae1 (D)
This brings the last piece into the game. Unlike Black, White has achieved full development. He is getting ready to capture the b-pawn and Black cannot protect it. Exercise 7-3: If Black responds with 18...Bxe5 19.Bxe5 Qxd3, what does White do?
18...Ne7 19.Qxb7 Bc8 (D)
Question: Where should White's queen go? Answer: b6. An excellent square. Weeramantry - Goldberg 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack)
20.Qb6
The queen is perfectly placed on b6, where it applies pressure on the f6-bishop and prevents the freeing move ...g7-g6. Black cannot play 20... Rd6, as 21.Ng6+ sets up a discovered attack on the rook. At this point, the game is essentially over. Black offers no resistance.

Now Black must play 18...Bd6 to gain back a knight for the lost rook, but White wins two pawns for it: 19.Bxd6 Kxd6 20.Rxf5 Nf6 (20...b6 21.Rd5+) 21.Nc7 Kxc7 22.Rxc5+.

REVIEW
Themes Weaknesses of doubled pawn formations (5...d4 6.Bxc6+ variation). Surrendering the right to castle to secure an advantage in structure and space (9.Kxd1 variation). Incurring a loss of time by retreating a knight to the first rank (discussion after 8...Ng8). Opening the position to exploit an advantage in mobility (9.f5). Supporting the center (12.c4).

LESSON 8

A MISSED OPPORTUNITY
his is one of the most memorable games I ever played. At one point I came up with a theoretical novelty in a seldom played variation of the Max Lange Attack. This game has been published all over the world. My opponent was the reigning champion of Germany, IM Hans-Joachim Hecht, who was awarded the GM title three years later. As a young untested player, I was terrified to face him. Even so, Iwas able to play aggressively and create good winning chances.
S. WEERAMANTRY - H. HECHT
Bagneux Open (France) 1970
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4
This game begins as a Scotch Gambit. White refrains from recapturing the pawn in order to develop more quickly.
4...Nf6 (D)
Black adopts the Two Knights' Defense. A good alternative is4...Bc5. If White then plays 5.c3, Black can reply 5...Nf6. After 5...Sf6 (4... ,c5 variation) 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 abode fgh After 5."Nc5

5.O-O Bc5 (D)
Black invites the Max Lange Attack. Instead, Black could have played 5...Nxe4, the main line of the Two Knights' Defense. White can pin this knight with 6.Re1, but Black defends with 6...d5. Black's two extra pawns appear to give him the advantage. However, White now has a powerful sequence with a temporary piece sacrifice: 7.Bxd5! Qxd5 8.Nc3. (D) After 6.e5 After 7,*,dxc4 Weeramantry - Hecht 1970 (Max Lange Attack) An unusual sight: Black's knight and pawn are both pinned. Now, after 8...Qa5 9.Nxe4 Be6
10.Bd2, White will regain his sacrificed material with correct play.
6.e5 (D)
The Max Lange Attack. White has accepted the challenge. Question: What should Black do now? Answer: ...Ne4. This will run into a very uncomfortable pin after 7.Qe2 d5 8.exd6 f5 9.Bg5 Qxd6 10.Nbd2. Black's king is unable to get out of the center. Answer: ...Ng4. This move enjoyed a bad reputation for many years, but has now been rehabilitated. It is worth closer study, but that will be for another time. Answer: ...d5.
6...d5
The most reliable move. Establishing the d-pawn in the center neutralizes the attacking potential of White's c4-bishop.
7.exf6 dxc4 (D)
Both sides have just captured a piece: White has taken the f6-knight, Black the bishop on c4. After 9...mf6 (variation)
[diagram]
Question: This is trade for equal value. Has either side gained an advantage in position? Answer: Yes. Black. The c4- and d4-pawns are very strong. True, they work very well together. The d4-pawn is well protected and the c4-pawn is easily defended with ...Be6. Black's plan would be to castle queenside and eventually create a passed pawn with ...d3. Question: And, what about White's f6-pawn? Answer: It can capture on g7 and attack the rook. Yes, but Black will reply with ...Rg8 and use the g-file to attack White's king. If White keeps this pawn on f6, it will prevent Black from blocking a check along the e-file by moving a piece to e7.
8.Re1+ Be6 9.Ng5
White piles the pressure on the pinned piece. It appears that Black can defend the bishop for a second time with 9...Qxf6 (D) and eliminate White's dangerous f6-pawn at the same time. Question: Is this a good idea for Black? Answer: No. White can keep increasing the pressure on e6 with Qg4. Be careful - that exposes the queen. Black would castle kingside, breaking the pin on the e6- bishop, and if White continued with 11.Nxe6, Black would recapture with the f-pawn and open up a powerful attack along the f-file. Answer: No. After 9...Qxf6, Black loses a piece to 10.Nxe6 fxe6 11.Qh5+, winning the c5- bishop by force. Excellent. Always examine forcing moves. It will help avoid blunders.
9...Qd5 10.Nc3 (D)
After 10-Nc3 8 6 5 3 2
[diagram]
After 12.g4 (ll. ce4 variation)
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Hecht 1970 (Max Lange Attack) White brings his c3-knight into action with tempo. Of course, Black cannot capture this knight as it would cost him his queen. Black must now move his queen and keep his e6-bishop protected. The only squares that allow this are d7, d6, and f5. If Black plays 10...Qd6 or 10...Qd7, White replies with 11.Nce4, threatening the c5-bishop. Once the bishop moves, White continues with a strong attack featuring moves like fxg7, Nxe6, and Qh5+.
10...Qf5 11.g4 (D)
An obscure move that had only been played a handful of times before this game; the more established line is11.Nce4 O-O-O 12.g4. (D) In this position, Black has three choices. The first, 12...Qxg4+, loses material. Exercise 8-1: After 11.Nce4 O-O-O 12.g4 Qxg4+, how does White win material? Question: What else can the queen do? Answer: Move to d5. No, that also loses the exchange: 13.fxg7 Rhg8 14.Nf6 with a double attack on the queen and rook. Answer: ...Qe5. This is the best square. You do not have to fear a discovered attack because the e4-knight cannot cause immediate damage. After 13.fxg7 Rhg8 14.Nxe6 fxe6, White should protect his g7- After 15.i,h6 (11.&ce4 variation) After ll."@xf6

After 12,"$d8
[diagram]
pawn with 15.Bh6. (D) There is a dynamic balance to this position. Each side has plenty to play for.
11...Qxf6 (D)
Now Black's queen can safely capture the pawn on f6. Instead of taking the pawn, the preferred move is 11...Qg6 as in Black-burne - Teichmann, Nuremberg 1896. I had come across that game in Modern Chess Openings 10th edition, which was the only book on opening theory I owned at that time.
12.Nd5 Qd8 (D)
After 14...Bh4? (variation) Weeramantry - Hecht 1970 (Max Lange Attack) It is amusing to note that Black's queen made a loop going from d8 to d5 to f5 to f6 and back to d8.
13.Rxe6+
This enterprising exchange sacrifice offers ample compensation.
13...fxe6 14.Nxe6 (D)
While Black's rooks are standing idly in the corners, White's knights have taken up menacing positions in the center. The e6-knight, in particular, is attacking Black's queen. The knights are positioned in such a way that should the queen capture one of them, the other knight will take on c7 forking Black's king and queen. Question: Where can the queen go? Answer: ...Qh4. That would be a disaster for Black. Iactually reached this position once and my opponent resigned two moves later. (D) Question: What made him resign? Answer: Play the bishop to g5. That chases the queen to h3, where it can be trapped by moving a knight to f4. Precisely. It is amazing that the queen cannot go anywhere safe, even though the entire third rank is open. After 15>Nh6 Question: Where else can the queen go, besides h4? Answer: ...Qd6. This only helps White to develop more quickly after Bf4. Exercise 8-2: After 14...Qd6 15.Bf4 Qd7, how does White continue the attack? As his queen cannot capture either knight, Black has nothing better than to retreat to d7 and concede a valuable tempo.
14...Qd7
White now plays a surprising move.
15.Bh6 (D)
This move was an over-the-board inspiration and not the result of home preparation. Remarkably, all three of White's minor pieces are hanging, yet none can be captured without Black's losing his queen to a knight fork. Although this move had never been played before, at least according to ChessBase, it turns out 15.Bh6 had been suggested by Staunton in his analysis of Steinitz - Meitner, Vienna 1860. Such chess information was not readily available to the average player back in 1970. Today, chess engines recommend 15.Ndxc7+ Kf7 16.Ng5+ Kg8 17.Nxa8 with a winning advantage.
15...Bd6
Black decides to abandon the immediate point of attack (g7) and chooses to defend c7 instead. There is a common military tactic in which an army is sometimes forced to abandon an outer area in order to fall back and regroup around a more defensible position.
16.Nxg7+
Question: How would Black have replied if White had played Bxg7 instead? Answer: ...Qxe6. Yes. Now that c7 is defended, the knight can be captured. 17.Nf6+ can be met with 17...Kf7, and Black gets two pieces for the rook.
16...Kd8 17.Nf6 (D)
After 18.Qf3 Weeramantry - Hecht 1970 (Max Lange Attack) White's knights are still in attacking positions, but they are not as well coordinated as earlier.
17...Qe7
Black attacks the f6-knight, but it is better to attack it from f7. Then, if 18.Qf3, White's f6- knight will be pinned to his queen and his overall mobility hindered.
18.Qf3 (D)
[diagram]
Question: White has an unusual move to stop that threat. What is it? Answer: Bf4. Yes. The bishop cannot be taken because Ne6+ would fork Black's king and queen. Question: What if he takes the f6-knight instead? Answer: Offer the bishop again with Bg5. Exactly. The pin and fork sequence again wins Black's queen. Unfortunately, Black does not have to capture the bishop or the knight. He can retreat his queen to e7 and White will have nothing better than to repeat the position with Bh6. Therefore, Bf4 is good enough for a draw by repetition, but White can play for more. Exercise 8-3: After 18...Qe5, what should White play? After thinking for about 40 minutes, Hecht came up with a simple but effective plan that did not involve moving his queen, rook, or knight.
18...Kc8 (D)
Black quietly walks his king away from the action. His intention is to play ...a7-a6 at the first opportunity and shelter his king on a7. Once there, his rooks will be connected and his extra material will prevail.
19.Qf5+ Kb8 20.Nd7+
After 2CL.&C8
[diagram]
After 23.>.Ne7 (2L?bc5+ variation)
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Hecht 1970 (Max Lange Attack) Visions of smothered mates were dancing around in my head. Sadly, Black's queen is ideally placed to prevent it.
20...Kc8 (D)
21.Nb6+
I played the standard pattern for a smothered mate and did not consider the option of
21.Nc5+. I failed to realize the importance of keeping pressure on b7 so that Black would not
have the defensive resource that he gets later, on move 23. After 21.Nc5+ Kb8 22.Bg5 Qxg7
23.Bf6, Black will have to retreat his queen to g8. The counterattack with 23...Ne7 does not
work here. (D) White wins with the intermediate move 24.Qe4, threatening mate on b7 while still attacking Black's queen. Black cannot defend both threats.
21...Kb8 22.Bg5
22.Nd7+ would have given White the chance to get back into the 21.Nc5+ variation we just
discussed.
22...Qxg7 23.Bf6 (D)
23...Qg8?
Retreating the queen keeps the threat of smothered mate under control. However, Black misses the powerful defensive resource 23...Ne7. The counterattack works here because, without a knight on c5, White cannot play Qe4 to generate a mate threat on b7.
24.Nd7+ Kc8 (D)
25.Bxh8?
A horrendous move. Why trade an active piece for one that absolutely has no influence on the position? Indeed, White misses his final chance to secure a winning position. The correct move is 25.Re1. White is threatening to mate with Nf8+ followed by Re8. Black must create an escape square for his king by moving either his a- or b-pawn. Exercise 8-4: After 25.Re1 a6, what is White's best move? Black can put up more resistance with 25...b6, but White still retains the advantage after
26.Nxb6+ Kb7 27.Nxa8 (D)
After 27.&Bxa8 (25.Sei variation) After 26...-Se? Weeramantry - Hecht 1970 (Max Lange Attack)

in the center. White is winning.
25...Qxh8 26.Re1 Ne7 (D)
Black attacks White's queen, but White has one final trick up his sleeve.
27.Nf8+
Black cannot capture the queen as he would blunder into mate with 28.Re8#. Hecht, who had been looking intently at the board, raised his head and smiled. Realizing he was not about to fall for this, I extended my hand to offer a draw. After 27...Kb8, the game will end in a perpetual check. We shook hands and thus ended a game I would remember for the rest of my life. After 12...9xg4+ (ll.ftce4 variation)

Although at first glance 14.Nxc5 looks more appealing, that move creates a complex position where Black's pawns provide ample compensation for the piece. Exercise 8-2: After 14...Qd6 15.Bf4 Qd7 (D), how does White continue the attack? Answer: White wins material with a series of forcing moves: 16.Ndxc7+ Kf7 17.Nxc5 Qe7 18.Qf3 Kg8 19.Nxa8 Qxc5 20.Re1.

REVIEW
Themes Sacrifice of the exchange for positional compensation (introduction). Opening move transpositions and choices - Scotch Opening, Scotch Gambit, Giuoco Piano, Max Lange Attack (moves 1-5). Fighting for the center (6...d5). Attack and counterattack: piece values and the initiative (6...d5). "Monster" black pawns on c4 and d4 (7...dxc4). Doubled pawns can be strong (10.Nc3 comment). The theoretical line 11.Nce4 in the Max Lange Attack. Pseudo- (or sham) versus real sacrifices (13.Rxe6+). Strong centralized knights (14.Nxe6). The more practical approach (15.Ndxc7+ variation). Pulling the trigger too soon (25.Bxh8). Maintaining the threat versus choosing the execution (game conclusion). Advice Always examine forcing moves. It will help avoid blunders. As Black, you should always take the Scotch Gambit pawn, but you must know all the traps and gambits. In many openings, the move ...d5 can be a demanding answer for Black in the fight for the center. When you counterattack, you generally want the threat to be against a piece of greater value than the one that was attacked, else the first player to capture gets the initiative. Be alert to the common motif of a queen check on one side of the board to pick up a piece on the other side. To evaluate pawn structure, not only must you look at individual pawns and squares, but also at the pawn structure as a whole. To decide when to "pull the trigger," first examine lines thoroughly, then make a decision based on your experience and intuition. __________

25.Nb5 (D)
White is pinning his hopes on a queenside breakthrough. Anticipating this shift of White's forces, Black prepares an invasion on the opposite wing.
25...Nexd5
The point of this sacrifice is to begin clearing the h4-d8 diagonal.
26.cxd5
Capturing with the other pawn makes Black's task easier: 26.exd5 Nxg4 27.fxg4 Qg5.
26...Rxb5!
This exchange sacrifice removes the threat on c7.
27.Qxb5 (D)
After 31.Bxf3 (C4) Tal - Smyslov 1959 In capturing the rook, White's queen has to abandon the kingside. White's pieces can no longer rush over to help his king.

Even though no pawns have been traded, Black's rooks are far more active than White's. Black already controls the d-file, and now threatens to open the h-file by further advancing the h-pawn. If White locks the position by playing 12.h4 himself, Black can paralyze White's pieces by offering the exchange with 12...Rd3. This rook cannot be captured because 13.Bxd3 is met with

Tripled isolated f-pawns should generally be avoided. However, in this case Black's open lines offer ample compensation against White's uncastled king.
10.Qb4
White attempts to generate queenside counterplay. Ironically, the safer course is to retreat his king to d1 and give up a pawn: 10...Bxf3 11.gxf3 Qxf3 12.Be2 blunts Black's attack.

It is finally time to take care of the rook.
17.c3 (D)
White's king is in a precarious position but he is hanging on. By attacking Black's knight, he hopes to secure the b5 square.
17...Qb6!
It is usually the defender who likes to trade queens. However, Black has correctly calculated that his attack will prove even stronger once White's only defender has been removed.
18.Qxb6

17.Qh5 (D)
White's king is better protected than Black's, because the h7-pawn is hard to defend. White's queen has inched its way to h5 (f2-g3-g4-h5) to target this weak pawn.
17...Qe8
Black plans to challenge White's queen by opening the h5-e8 diagonal with ...f7-f5. However, it is better to move the d4-knight away first, thus preventing White from trading on d4 and opening the d3-h7 diagonal.
18.Bxd4 exd4 19.Rf6!! (D)
After 11...e6 White finds an ingenious way to block the freeing move ...f7-f5. This rook cannot be taken because White will free his light-square bishop with 20.e5 and set up an unstoppable mate on h7.
19...Kg8 20.e5 h6
This defensive resource is available only because Black's bishop has remained on g7.
21.Ne2
White calmly moves his knight out of danger. Now if the attacked black knight moves from d6, White plays Qf5 and mate on h7 cannot be stopped. The rook on f6 paralyzes Black's defenses. 1-0 (C9) Shirazi - Weeramantry, New York 1988 [B09]
1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.f4 Bg7 5.Nf3 O-O 6.e5 Nfd7 7.h4 c5 8.h5 cxd4 9.hxg6
dxc3 10.gxf7+ Rxf7 11.Bc4 e6 (D) The position is complex and double-edged. White has sacrificed a piece for a powerful flank attack, but Black has actively countered in the center. White's best play at this point is to continue his kingside activity with 12.Ng5, attacking the rook and opening the d1-h5 diagonal for his queen.
12.Qxd6?!
White loses a valuable tempo by capturing Black's d6-pawn. This slows his queen down from getting over to the kingside.
12...Qb6
Black offers a queen trade while attacking b2 a second time.
13.Qd3?
White should capture on e6, allowing the trade, but shies away from it in the mistaken belief that his kingside attack will prevail.
13...cxb2 14.Bxb2 Qxb2 15.Ke2
White moves his king to protect his a1-rook, but refrains from castling as he needs the h1- rook to press his kingside attack. After 18.Radl (C9) Shirazi - Weeramantry 1988
15...Nc5
Black correctly calculates that White's threat of Qxh7+ is not dangerous and moves his knight into attacking position.
16.Qxh7+ Kf8
Both kings are vulnerable, but Black's king has better protection as his dark-square bishop protects key squares.
17.Nh4 Nc6 18.Rad1 (D)
White's rook occupies the open d-file, hoping to penetrate to d8 and create complications.
18...Nd4+
Black adopts a practical approach, blocking the d-file while attacking White's king.
19.Ke3 Qc3+ 20.Bd3
Black's double attack forces White to block the check with his bishop. Now that the d-file is no longer in play for White, Black seizes the initiative.
20...Nf5+ 21.Ke2
White chooses not to trade knights because he wants to keep Ng6+ in reserve.
21...Nxd3 22.Ng6+ Ke8 23.cxd3 Qc2+ 24.Rd2

After 24.Ng4 (C10) Krasenkow - Nakamura 2007 Both sides have completed their development. White has just played a discovered attack which appears to win material, as Black's queen, c6-rook, and e7-bishop are all under attack.
21...Qxf2+!!
A bolt from the blue. Why defend when you can attack?
22.Kxf2
White accepts the queen sacrifice because walking away with 22.Kh1 simply loses a piece to

15.exd4?!
There is no reason not to take the rook, after which White can maintain the balance.
15...Bc5!
Black is threatening to take the d4-pawn with check. If the bishop is captured, Black will recapture with his knight, attacking White's bishop and giving his queen access to d4.
16.Be2 (D)
After 19.Nxf8 (C11) Aronian - Anand 2013 White threatens to take the g4-knight, removing the threats against f2 and h2, but his move also blocks the queen from protecting f2. Instead, 16.dxc5 Nxc5 17.Nxf8 offers better chances. In this variation, 17.Be2 would be disastrous. Exercise C11-1: After 16.dxc5 Nxc5, show how Black would refute 17.Be2.
16...Nde5!
Fantastic! According to Anand, the sequence 16...Bxd4+ 17.Kh1 Nxh2 is refuted by 18.Ng5 preventing Black's queen from reaching h4.
17.Bxg4
If White takes the other knight with 17.fxe5, Black has a forced mate starting with
17...Qxd4+.
17...Bxd4+ 18.Kh1 Nxg4 19.Nxf8 (D)
White finally takes the rook, but it is too late.

Black prevents White's queen from invading his position and creating counterplay.

After 22...Sh5 If White moves his knight to safety, Black captures the h2-pawn with his knight, exposing White's king to an attack along the h-file.
21...Qxg6 22.Qe2 Qh5 (D)
Black is threatening to exploit the pin on the g2-pawn by playing ...Qxh3#.
23.Qd3
White chooses to protect h3 with his queen. The alternative is to protect h3 with the rook. However, this will result in a highly favorable endgame for Black: 23.Rf3 Nf2+ 24.Kh2 Bxf3
25.Qxf3 Qxf3 26.gxf3 Nd3.
Exercise C11-2: In the variation 23.Rf3 Nf2+ 24.Rxf2, how does Black win?
23...Be3!
Black finds a clever tactic to disrupt the defense of h3 by White's queen. Such moves, known as "interference" moves, provide a powerful means to pursue an attack. The threat on h3 is renewed and White has no satisfactory defense. 0-1 (C12) Adhiban - Dreev, Wijk aan Zee 2016 [D45]

White preserves his light-square bishop to be able to access c4 and b5 for a direct assault on Black's uncastled king.

Black's king is unable to reach safety by castling because the pinned knight on d7 will be lost:

(D) Answer: The natural capture 23...Rxf6+ isa mistake here, as White blocks the check with 24.Bf3, freeing up g2 for his king. Instead, Black plays the deadly discovered check 23...c3+. After 24.Re2, Black's most accurate continuation is 24...c2 25.Qxc2 Bxe2+ 26.Ke1 Bd3+. Black recovers the sacrificed queen and ends up a rook ahead. Aronian-Anand 2013 Exercise C11-1: After 16.dxc5 Nxc5, show how Black would refute 17.Be2. (D) After 17,le2 (16.dxc5 variation) After 24. xf2 (23, f3 variation) After 28.Sd5+ (24...Ac5 variation)
[diagram]
(C13) Carlsen - Nakamura 2011 Answer: Black responds with 17...Qd4+ 18.Kh1 Nf2+ 19.Rxf2 Qxf2, with unstoppable mate threats. If 19.Kg1 instead, Black employs the standard smothered mate combination with 19...Nh3+
20.Kh1 Qg1+ 21.Rxg1 Nf2#.
Exercise C11-2: In the variation with 23.Rf3 Nf2+ 24.Rxf2, how does Black win? (D) Answer: Black has a forced mate in 2 moves: 24...Qxh3+ 25.Kg1 Qxg2#. Adhiban-Dreev 2016 Exercise C12-1: From the diagram position after 24...Bc5 25.Ne5 Bxf2+ 26.Kxf2 Ke7 27.Qxf7+ Kd6 28.Qd5+, show checkmate in five moves or less. (D) After 29...Rxd4 (variation)
[diagram]
Answer: 28...Ke7 29.Qd7+ Kf6 30.Qd6+ Kg5 31.Nf7+. Depending where Black's king goes, White's queen will now access the most direct route to deliver mate on g5: 1) If 31...Kg4 or ...Kh4, then 32.Qg3+ followed by 33.Qg5#; 2) If 31...Kh5, then 32.Qd5+ Kh4 (32...Kg6 33.Qf5#) 33.Qg5#. From the diagram position, ifBlack runs to the queenside with 28... Kc7, then 29.Qc6+ Kb8
30.Nd7#.
Carlsen-Nakamura 2011 Exercise C13-1: If Black plays 29...Qxd4, what does White do? (D) Answer: White first clears the h-file with tempo, enabling a standard mating attack that features a magnet combination: 30.Be3 Qe4 31.Rh8+ Kxh8 32.Qh2+ Kg8 33.Qh7#. Part D: Coordination and Control
PART D
COORDINATION AND CONTROL
he games in this final section illustrate the establishment of positional advantages that allow a player to control the course of the game, and the placement and coordination of pieces to support attack and defense. You will see the use of many of the positional and dynamic elements embodied in earlier lessons. Critical elements of these games include material imbalances, superior pawn structure, controlling lines of attack, and restricting the opponent's activity. After 3...Qf6

PLAYING WITH A FULL DECK
aul Morphy is regarded as one of the greatest chess players in history. This memorable game was played at the American Chess Congress in 1857 at the beginning of his illustrious career. His opponent was Louis Paulsen, who was already established as a world-class player. In the game, Morphy seizes the opportunity to cripple Paulsen's pieces by taking absolute control of the center and preventing his opponent from coordinating his pieces effectively. This control ultimately translates into a decisive kingside attack.
L. PAULSEN - P. MORPHY
New York 1857
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 (D)
This is the Four Knights Game. There are three good moves for White in this position. However, 4.Bc4 is not one of them. Even though c4 is a natural developing square for the bishop, especially in double king-pawn openings, it does not work here. Question: Why isBc4 a bad move? Answer: Black's knight can take the e4-pawn. If White accepts the sacrifice, Black can regain the piece with ...d5. After 6-.,Bxd5 (4jg,c4 variation) After 6...d5 (4,jLc4 variation)
[diagram]
Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) That is correct. The key move is 4...Nxe4, a move that gives Black better control of the center in all variations. This is called the center fork trick. For example, after 4.Bc4 Nxe4 5.Nxe4 d5 6.Bxd5 Qxd5 (D), material is even, and Black has an established center pawn, while White does not. The presence of the center pawn is very important; it controls key squares and gives Black a space advantage. Black also has better mobility as both bishops have open diagonals and the queen is centralized. Alternatively, White could play 5.Bxf7+, electing to expose Black's king by sacrificing his bishop before capturing on e4. However, after 5... Kxf7 6.Nxe4 d5 (D), Black's powerful center more than compensates for losing his right to castle. Remember the center fork trick. While it does not win material, it does give you a powerful position. White chooses one of the three reliable moves. The others are 4.d4 and 4.g3.
4.Bb5 (D)
After 6.£jxe5 (5Jbcc6 variation)
[diagram]
Black's most popular reply here is 4...Bb4, which sets up a symmetrical position. If I fold the board in the center, all the opposing pieces will overlap, one on one. Symmetrical positions, if they stay that way, tend to lead to quiet games because they contain balanced pawn structures. On the other hand, assymetrical structures allow more pawn contact and thus create more dynamic play. An attempt by Black to create more active play is 4...Nd4, the Rubinstein Variation. I do not recommend this move to intermediate-level players because it moves the same piece twice in the opening. It is better to concentrate on normal piece development and to observe basic opening principles. Morphy chose a different move entirely.
4...Bc5
Question: How can White now win a pawn? Answer: 5.Bxc6 dxc6 6.Nxe5. (D) Question: Should White go for the pawn? Answer: No, because Black then has 6...Qd4, threatening both the knight and mate on f2. True, but after 6...Qd4, White can protect against both threats with 7.Nd3 (D). White would be in an awkward position because the knight on d3 blocks his d-pawn, but he would be holding on to his extra pawn. After 7.Nd3 (5JLxc6 variation) Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) Exercise 9-1: After 5.Bxc6 dxc6 6.Nxe5 Qd4 7.Nd3, if Black now tries to regain the pawn with 7...Nxe4, what will happen? Instead of 6...Qd4, Black can gain the advantage by first sacrificing the bishop: 6...Bxf2+
7.Kxf2 Qd4+ 8.Ke1 Qxe5. Black wins back the piece and also stops White from castling.
5.O-O
The better move for White appears to be the immediate 5.Nxe5.
5...O-O (D)
6.Nxe5
Question: Why is White taking a pawn that is defended? Answer: White now has the same center fork trick that we saw earlier for Black. You recognized it! Paulsen is trying the center fork trick on Morphy. It is important to recognize a pattern even when colors are reversed. If Black plays 6...Nxe5, White replies 7.d4 Bd6 8.f4!, getting his piece back with a strong center. Morphy has other ideas. Rather than take the time to capture the knight, he plays a move that furthers his development.
6...Re8 7.Nxc6 (D)
After 7/dxc6
[diagram]
After 8.Ac4 a b ed e t g h This plays into Black's hands. White should give the pawn back immediately with 7.Nf3 Nxe4. After 8.Nxe4 Rxe4 9.c3, White retains a slight advantage.
7...dxc6
This is the correct way to recapture. Question: Why is it better to take with the d-pawn? Answer: To open the d-file. You get more mobility and faster development. Question: True, but is there something else that should be noted about this move? Answer: The pawn is not capturing towards the center. Good. There is a general principle which states that pawns should capture towards the center. This helps strengthen the central pawn structure. However, there is an important lesson here: do not blindly follow general principles. There are often exceptions. Morphy recognizes that, in this position, it is more important to open up lines as quickly as possible.
8.Bc4 (D)
8.Be2 immediately would have been a better choice.
8...b5
8...Ng4 is an interesting alternative first suggested by the British chess historian Philip
Sergeant in 1916. The idea is to target f2 and h2 at the same time. The immediate threat is to Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) capture twice on f2, then pick up the c4-bishop with...Qd4+. White should counter with 9.g3, leading to a complex position. Exercise 9-2: If instead 8...Nxe4, find the best continuation for White.
9.Be2
White chooses e2 for his bishop, rather than b3, in order to add more defense to the kingside. Notice how Black's bishops are pointing toward White's king, the knight is eyeballing g4, the rook is on the e-file, and the queen is only one move away from joining the other attackers. Do you see that? White needs more resources to counter Black's pressure.
9...Nxe4
Now that White has strengthened his control of g4, Black takes back his pawn. Otherwise, White will simply protect it with d3.
10.Nxe4 Rxe4 (D)
An unusual picture. Although ten moves have been completed, it looks as though White has not made any moves. All of his pieces are still on the first two ranks. Question: How should White continue his development? Answer: Pawn to d3. A solid developing move. The simplest solutions are often the best.
11.Bf3 (D)
After
[diagram]
After 12x3?!
[diagram]
Question: White sets up a skewer. Where should Black move his rook? Answer: ...Re6, to protect the c6-pawn.
11...Re6
It is ironic that the bishop's attack forces Black's rook to a good square. Usually you do not get the chance to carry out a rook lift this early in the game, because rooks have trouble coming out safely with so many minor pieces still on the board. At the appropriate time, Black can swing this rook over to the g- or h-files to set up a direct attack on the king.
12.c3?! (D)
Question: Why does White play his pawn to c3? Answer: So he can play d4 next. Yes, this is White's plan. If he succeeds in extending his pawn chain to d4, he will take over the center. However, this move is too ambitious. White's priority should be to activate his c1- bishop with d3. In this position, the attempt to build the longer pawn chain is seriously flawed. Question: How does Black take advantage of White's inaccurate move? Answer: ...Qd3 stops the d-pawn from advancing. Excellent. We have already spoken about not spearheading an attack with the queen. Here, the queen's function is not one of attack; it is one of restriction. You may sometimes hear the After 12,"$d3 After 14.14?
[diagram]
Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) word prophylactic used to refer to a move like this. It is a move that is designed to prevent your opponent's intended move.
12...Qd3 (D)
This move is not a check. It is not a capture. It is not even attacking an unprotected piece, yet it is such a powerful move! It blocks the d-pawn, buries the c1-bishop, and paralyzes the queenside. Black's queen cannot easily be dislodged from d3, because Black is controlling the central light squares.
13.b4
Rather than playing on the queenside, White could have tried 13.Re1 seeking to free his position by trading rooks.
13....Bb6 14.a4? (D)
Continuing his queenside expansion, White threatens to trap Black's bishop with 15.a5. Again, it would be better to offer a trade of rooks with 14.Re1. White misses his last chance to challenge the center.
14...bxa4 15.Qxa4 (D)
After 15.Bxa4 After 16,Sa2? When you drive a wedge down the middle of the enemy position, his right and left flanks cannot communicate easily as the space available to shift pieces from one side of the board to the other is very narrow. Black's queen on d3 dominates this position. While White continues to expand, it is not happening in the center. Question: How should Black continue? Answer: 15...Rg6, pinning the g-pawn and threatening to capture the bishop. Not a bad move, but Morphy did not do that. The threat is too simple. There is a lesson you should learn from Morphy's games: a great attacker never attacks without getting all of his pieces out first.
15...Bd7
A simple developing move that gets the bishop out and frees the rook. However, it would have been better to play ...Bb7 to keep White's queen out of a6.
16.Ra2? (D)
What a strange square for the rook! White likely intends to challenge Black's queen with
17.Qc2. If so, he is taking far too long. He has just missed a great chance to drive Black's queen
out of d3 immediately with 16.Qa6. Question: How should Black continue? Answer: Double the rooks. After 17,Qa6 abcdefgn Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) Now you are playing like Morphy!
16...Rae8
I cannot stress this enough: attacks are much more successful with full development. Black's rooks are connected while White's are not. White is wishing that his a-rook had never left the back rank. Question: What is Black's threat? Answer: Sacrifice the queen with ...Qxf1+, and then ...Re1#. Excellent. This is aforcing sequence, and therefore clearer than playing ...Re1 first. Creating an escape square does not save White: h3 does not prevent ...Qxf1+, while g3 leaves the f3- bishop hanging.
17.Qa6 (D)
This is referred to as an X-ray defense. Like an X-ray passing through a body, its line of defense passes through an enemy piece to protect a square further along that line. Thus, White's queen on a6 is defending the f1-rook despite the presence of Black's queen on d3. Now 17...Qxf1+ 18.Qxf1 Re1 19.Bb2 is just a fancy trade. Question: Qd1 would also defend against mate. Why did White choose Qa6 instead? Answer: Because he wants to trade off queens. Yes. Qd1 does not break the bind. Unfortunately, Qa6 has come too late to be effective. This is the critical position. White is on the verge of driving Black's pieces back, but Morphy finds a brilliant move to keep his attack alive.
17...Qxf3!! (D)
After 19.&hl
[diagram]
A stunning and unexpected sacrifice! Black shatters White's castled position in one tremendous blow. When playing a destructive sacrifice, it is important to ensure there are sufficient resources remaining after the sacrifice to complete the attack.
18.gxf3 Rg6+ 19.Kh1 (D)
The concluding sequence of this combination contains a valuable lesson. When executing a mating attack, whenever possible, limit the movement of the defending king. Even though Morphy does miss a quicker win on two separate occasions, he does not let White's king slither out of the mating net. Question: How does Black continue the attack? Answer: Open the long diagonal with...c5. No, that is too slow. Remember, once you sacrifice material, it is important to pursue the attack actively and aggressively. You do not always have to capture or deliver check, but you must make moves that threaten. In order to justify a queen sacrifice, the threat must be powerful. It should be equal to or greater than the value of the sacrificed piece. Question: How can Black create a serious threat? Answer: ...Bh3. Question: That's the move. What is the threat? After ZO.Edl
[diagram]
Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) Answer: 20...Bg2+ 21.Kg1 Bxf3#. Good. That is the real threat - Black is not interested in capturing the f1-rook. He did not sacrifice his queen to win back an exchange.
19...Bh3 (D)
Attempts by White to avert mate by guarding critical squares or returning material will not work. Exercise 9-3: If White protects the g2 square with 20.Rg1, Black has two different ways to checkmate. Can you show them? Since the g2 square cannot be defended adequately, White could instead try removing a key attacker. He can afford to sacrifice the queen for the rook on g6 because he is ahead in material. Unfortunately, this attempt at defense also fails: 20.Qd3 would be met by 20...f5 re-establishing the original threat. Now 21.Qc4+ is met by 21...Kf8, after which White cannot defend against all threats. The only way for White to avert mate is to move the f1-rook and create an escape square for his king.
20.Rd1 (D)
Black now initiates a forcing sequence.
20...Bg2+ 21.Kg1 Bxf3+ 22.Kf1 (D)
22...Bg2+
Exercise 9-4: Find a quicker win for Black after 22.Kf1.
23.Kg1
Now that the f3-pawn is no longer there, Black has another chance to close out the game with 23...Be4+ 24.Kf1 Bf5!, threatening an unstoppable mate. This line provides an excellent illustration of the concept of redeployment. Black brings his bishop back along the h1-a8 diagonal to keep White's king out of h1. He then switches to a different diagonal to attack from another angle and force mate. White has no defense (25.Qe2 Bh3+ 26.Ke1 Rg1#).
23...Bh3+ 24.Kh1 Bxf2 (D)
In return for the sacrificed queen, look at the havoc Morphy is causing with his rooks and bishops! Even a cursory glance at the board shows that White's poor king has been abandoned by his army. Black's pieces are all working together in harmony and are moving in for the kill. Question: What is Black threatening? Answer: ...Bg2#. There is only one way to stop it. White has to give back the queen.
25.Qf1 Bxf1 26.Rxf1
After 26..,Re2
[diagram]
After 28...Ne3 Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) The smoke has cleared. Black is up two pawns and retains the attacking position. White's king is still in a mating net. Question: What should Black do next? Answer: 26...Re1, forcing a trade of rooks. Exchanging when ahead in material is often the winning technique, but is not always the best option. Sometimes you can win more efficiently by retaining more active pieces. Black's rooks are clearly more active. The best plan in this position is for the e8-rook to penetrate to the seventh rank.
26...Re2 (D)
A rook on the seventh rank traps a king that is on its back rank. This game is now over.
27.Ra1 Rh6 28.d4 Be3 (D) 0-1
White can no longer stop checkmate, for instance 29.Bxe3 Rhxh2+ 30.Kg1 Reg2#. It is amazing to see that, after 28 moves, White's c1-bishop is still sitting on its starting square! After 8...Nxe4 (variation)
ANSWERS
Exercise 9-1: After 5.Bxc6 dxc6 6.Nxe5 Qd4 7.Nd3, if Black now tried to regain the pawn with
7...Nxe4, what would happen? (D)
Answer: Black's attempt fails: 8.Qe2 O-O (8...f5 9.f3) 9.Nxe4 Re8? 10.Nf6+. (D) White wins the rook on e8. Exercise 9-2: If instead 8...Nxe4, find the best continuation for White. (D) Answer: White's best continuation is 9.Bxf7+ Kxf7 10.Nxe4, winning apawn. Moreover, Black's king will have to waste time getting back to safety. Black cannot play 10...Rxe4 because 11.Qf3+ After ZO.Sgl (variation)
[diagram]
After 22.dbfl Paulsen - Morphy 1857 (Four Knights Game) forks the king and rook and wins the exchange. Exercise 9-3: If White protects the g2 square with 20.Rg1, Black has two different ways to checkmate. Can you show them? (D) Answer: 1) The simplest sequence is20...Rxg1+ 21.Kxg1 Re1+ 22.Qf1 Rxf1#; 2) There is a more complex pattern which leads to mate: 20...Bg2+ 21.Rxg2 Re1+ 22.Rg1 Rexg1#. If we were to change the position in the diagram by removing the f2-pawn and the b6- bishop, Black would have to employ the second of these patterns; 20...Rxg1+ would not work because White would have an escape square on f2. It is important to learn a variety of mating patterns; they will give you the ability to close out a game successfully. Exercise 9-4: Find a quicker win for Black after 22.Kf1. (D) Answer: 22...Rg2 23.Qd3 Rxf2+ 24.Kg1 Rg2+ 25.Kf1 (or Kh1) 25...Rg1#. Perfect coordination of rooks and bishops!

THREE FOR THE LADY
n important chess concept ismaterial imbalance. Some examples are rook and pawn versus bishop and knight, or (as in the following game) three minor pieces versus a queen. In both scenarios, the point count is even, but one must consider the relative values of all the pieces involved. This judgment may change at different stages of the game.
S. WEERAMANTRY - M. SCHLAGENHAUF
Harrisburg (Pennsylvania), 1977
1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 (D)
Question: We have already discussed the Pirc Austrian Attack formation with 4.f4.6 What are some other systems that White can employ against the Pirc? Answer: 4.Nf3. The Classical System. This is the most solid formation for White, quite unlike the unbridled aggression of the Austrian Attack. White is content with a modest two-pawn center (e4, d4). He places his knights on c3 and f3, his light-square bishop on e2, and castles kingside: 4...Bg7 5.Be2
O-O 6.O-O. (D)
After 6.O-O (4.?rf3 variation) After 5.Ne3 (4.f3 variation)
[diagram]
This system is a favorite of conservative players who prefer a quiet opening. Question: What other systems can White use? Answer: Be3 and Qd2 to attack the fianchettoed bishop. The Be3/Qd2 battery is a popular attacking formation against Black's fianchettoed bishop on g7. If White wishes to employ this setup, he must play f2-f3 before bringing his bishop to e3. Otherwise Black could harass the bishop with ...Ng4. After the moves 4.f3 Bg7 5.Be3 (D), Black should hold off castling in favor of immediate queenside expansion. If not, he will be subjected to a dangerous attack similar to the St. George (or Yugoslav) Attack against the Sicilian Dragon. Black has less counterplay than in the Sicilian because the c-file is closed. His best play at this point is5...c6 6.Qd2 b5 with a complex game. I chose a less popular but equally aggressive line.
4.Bc4 Bg7 5.Qe2 (D)
Question: This is an unusual move. Why does White play Qe2 ? (D) What is going on here? After 5?Ne2 After 8 h8 (5...00 variation)
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Schlagenhauf 1977 (Pirc Defense) Answer: I think White wants to push the e-pawn. Very good. There is no other reason for Qe2 except to support the advance of the e-pawn. The intent is to push the pawn to e5 without allowing a queen trade on dl should Black exchange pawns on e5. This idea works particularly well against players who blindly follow the first five moves of the Pirc formation and castle as a matter of course. Qe2 allows White to continue advancing the pawn with e6, driving a wedge into the heart of Black's position. Let me show you briefly what could happen. Iwon a sharp game against 5...O-O at the 1978 Chess Olympiad in Buenos Aires, where I played first board for Sri Lanka, my native country. This game was one of the shortest in the entire Olympiad - it lasted only twelve moves! My opponent was National Master Miguel Clua Ballague who was playing board one for Andorra. The game continued 6.e5 Nfd7 7.e6 fxe6 8.Bxe6+ (not 8.Qxe6+ as Black can free himself later with a counterattack on the queen) 8...Kh8. (D) Question: White has destroyed part of Black's kingside pawn structure. How can he destroy the rest of it? Answer: Play pawn to h4. That is what I played, but 9.Nf3 is stronger. In our game, Black did not find the best defense and collapsed quickly. After 9.h4 Nc6 10.h5, my idea was to play hxg6 and open the h-file. At the time, neither of us realized that Black could have avoided this with 10...g5!. The game continued with 10...Nxd4? 11.hxg6. Clearly, Black cannot capture White's queen with 11...Nxe2, as 12.Rxh7 is mate. Black had anticipated this line and put his faith in 11...Nf6 After 13.W15 (5.,.O-O variation1
[diagram]
After 5 .Qc6
[diagram]
to defend h7. Unfortunately for him, White continued with 12.Rxh7+ regardless. Black resigned because 12...Nxh7 would be met by 13.Qh5. (D) Black can delay mate by giving away several of his pieces, but in the end mate is unstoppable. Let us return to the original game. Black plays one of the two moves that are generally recommended.
5...Nc6 (D)
Black attacks the d4-pawn. This is the most challenging move against Qe2. The other move is 5...c6, when after 6.e5 dxe5 7.dxe5 Nd5 8.Bd2 White still enjoys a slight advantage. Question: After ...Nc6, what is White's best move? Answer: d5. Does that really make sense? You just put your bishop on c4. Why? To attack f7, right? Why do you then want to play d5 ? You are pushing apawn for no other reason than to attack a piece. The long-term consequence of this move is you shut your bishop out of the game. Before making such a move, ask yourself, "Where can the piece go?" If it can move to a better square, a centralized square, do not attack it. In this position, the knight has a good square on e5, so you do not want to attack it. Answer: Nf3. After 6...€jxd4
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Schlagenhauf 1977 (Pirc Defense) Yes, this is perhaps the most natural developing move, but Black has a strong reply in
6...Bg4. After 7.Be3 e5, Black would stop White's intended expansion and establish equality in
the center. Question: Is there a more aggressive sixth move for White? Answer: Attack the knight with e5. Good. That is the most aggressive move, and is precisely what White intended when playing Qe2.
6.e5
White attacks Black's f6-knight.
6...Nxd4 (D)
Rather than moving this knight to a safe square, such as g4 or d7, Black takes the d-pawn and counterattacks White's queen. Question: How does White continue? Answer: Ignore the attack on the queen and keep on capturing. Yes!
7.exf6
This move brings about a wild series of captures leading to an unusual material imbalance. This is a line I like to play as it involves giving up the queen for active play.
7...Nxe2
Black takes the queen.
8.fxg7 Rg8 9.Ngxe2
White has obtained three minor pieces for the queen. The point value is the same, 9 points for 9 points.
9...Rxg7 (D)
After 9...Sxg7
[diagram]
After 11.O-O-O
[diagram]
Black removes the g7-pawn because it could become a real annoyance later. At the same time, he picks up a second pawn.
10.Bh6
White needs to complete his development quickly. The bishop move gains a valuable tempo.
10...Rg8
Question: What must White do to complete his development? Answer: Castle queenside. Right. You want that rook on d1.
11.O-O-O (D)
The smoke has cleared and it is time to take stock of the position. Question: Which side do you prefer, and why? Answer: I like Black. He has two extra pawns to go along with his queen. Answer: I prefer White. His pieces are more active. Black's rooks are out of the game. There is no definitive answer. The first reaction most people have is to favor the queen. After all, it is the most powerful piece. On the other hand, three minor pieces could run rings around the queen so long as they are well coordinated. One problem is that White cannot anchor these pieces on strong central squares, as Black's pawns can chase them away. If Black succeeds in getting his king out of the center by castling long, itwill allow him to centralize his rooks. Then After 11.. .c6 After 13...Nf5?
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Schlagenhauf 1977 (Pirc Defense) the rooks will support an avalanche of center pawns, forcing White's minor pieces to retreat in total confusion. White's current edge in development gives him the initiative, but the initiative is not apermanent advantage - it does not last forever.
11...c6 (D)
Black gets ready to castle long and makes a little extra space for the queen. This move also takes away an important central square from White's minor pieces.
12.Rhe1 Qc7 13.Nd4
White's knight inches closer to Black's king. All of White's pieces are now within striking range.
13...Bf5? (D)
Black is anxious to castle and moves his bishop to clear the way. This is a mistake. The correct defense is extremely difficult for a human to find. Black should play 13...d5, and if White chooses to sacrifice his bishop with 14.Bxd5, he must not recapture: 14...cxd5? 15.Nxd5 Qd6 16.Nb5 with a crushing attack. Instead 14...g5, threatening to trap the h6-bishop with ...Rg6, lets Black maintain the balance. Without question, this is the critical position. Black is now one move away from castling. If he succeeds, he will take over the initiative. Ifelt that the weakness of the f7-pawn would buy me more time to develop my attack. However, Black's king can reach safety if he is willing to give back a little material. My instinct was that now was the right moment to strike, and I kept After 14. db5 searching for a way to break into Black's position. The winning idea hit me like a bolt from the blue! I blinked and looked again, amazed that I was staring at a forced win. Question: What is the move that, after ...Bf5, launches the winning plan? Answer: Bg5, threatening the e7-pawn. You have identified a good point of attack. Losing the e7-pawn would cause Black's defenses to crumble. Moving this pawn opens the diagonal to d8, thus preventing him from castling. Exercise 10-1: If Black meets 14.Bg5 with 14...e6, how should White proceed? So Bg5 works, but there is something more direct, more forceful, and definitely more convincing. Answer: Nd5, sacrificing a knight. Definitely direct and forceful, but is it any good? After 14...cxd5 15.Bxd5, Black seizes the initiative with 15...Qc5. Answer: Wait! After 14...cxd5, 15.Nb5 is better. Then if 15...Qxc4, White wins back the queen and comes out a piece ahead with 16.Nxd6+ Kd7 17.Nxc4. That is clever. Unfortunately, Black can refuse the second sacrifice and play 15...Qd7 instead. Sacrifices that involve non-forcing moves are difficult to calculate because they allow your opponent a wide choice of replies. A defender is not compelled to accept every piece he is offered. After 15...Qd7, White has little to show for the sacrificed knight. 14.Nd5 is incorrect. Both of your answers have focused on attacking the pawn on e7. Look for another point of attack; e7 is not the only vulnerable square. Answer: 14.Ndb5. Yes!
14.Ndb5! (D)
Using a different knight sacrifice wins by force! Now that the d-file is clear, White has a powerful attack against d6. Now we will see pins, forks, skewers, and discovered checks all rolled into one mouth-watering combination.
14...cxb5 15.Nxb5 Qb6 16.Nxd6+
After 19.Sd6+ Weeramantry - Schlagenhauf 1977 (Pirc Defense) The knight cannot be captured because the e7-pawn is pinned.
16...Kd8 17.Nxf5+
Now that Black's king has been forced to the d-file, White takes the bishop with a discovered check.
17...Kc7 18.Rxe7+ (D)
This is the third consecutive capture with check. This is the position I visualized when I played 14.Ndb5!. I did not analyze any further because I judged this as a winning position. Visualizing a sequence of moves is not as difficult as it seems. Your ability will improve with practice. Remember to pay particular attention to pieces that have been captured and to pieces that have changed position. Exercise 10-2: If Black retreats his king with 18...Kb8, what is White's best continuation?
18...Kc6 19.Rd6+ (D)
The rook skewers the king and queen. Black's king is forced to march further up the board.
19...Kc5 20.Re5+
After some thought, I opted to pursue a mating attack rather than winning back the queen. It is unusual to see elements of a ladder-mate pattern with so many pieces still on the board. Realizing that his position was hopeless, Black resigned. 1-0 Exercise 10-3: After 20.Re5+, checkmate is forced. Can you find the mating sequence after
20...Kxc4 and after 20...Kb4 ?
What is striking about this game is that Black did not appear to be in imminent danger. Suddenly there was this one little knight move and the entire position exploded. This shows how powerful three well-coordinated minor pieces can be against a queen. After 14...e6 (14.Ag5 variation) After 18.Rf6+ (14dLg5 variation)

Exercise 10-1: If Black meets 14.Bg5 with 14...e6, how should White proceed? (D) Answer: White wins by using adestructive sacrifice: 15.Bxe6! Bxe6 16.Nxe6 fxe6 17.Rxe6+ Kf7
18.Rf6+. (D)
Black cannot save himself despite having more material. For example: 1) 18...Kg7 19.Rfxd6 Kf8 20.Ne4 Re8 21.f3. White's minor pieces are stronger than Black's rooks. 2) 18...Ke8 19.Re1+ Kd7 20.Rf7+ Kc8 21.Rxc7+ Kxc7 22.Re7+ with a winning position. Exercise 10-2: If Black retreats his king with 18...Kb8, what is White's best continuation? (D) After 18*..Nb8 (variation) Answer: If 18...Kb8, White has a forced mate in six moves with 19.Bf4+ Kc8 20.Rxf7 gxf5
21.Be6+ Qxe6 22.Rc7+ Kb8 23.Rc3+ Qd6 24.Bxd6#.
Exercise 10-3: After 20.Re5+, mate is forced. Can you find the mating sequence after 20...Kxc4 and after 20...Kb4 ? (D) Answer: 1) 20...Kxc4 is met with 21.b3+ Kb4 22.Kb2 - a "quiet move" that seals Black's fate:
22...Qc5 23.Bd2+ Kb5 24.Nd4#.
2) 20...Kb4 is met with 21.Bd2+ Ka4 22.Bb3+ Qxb3. (D) Whichever pawn captures the queen, it is mate in one move: 23.axb3# (or 23.cxb3#). There is also an esthetic mate with 23.Ra5, eschewing the queen capture. Weeramantry - Schlagenhauf 1977 (Pirc Defense)

Themes Systems against the Pirc (discussion after 3...g6). Material imbalances and compensation (6.e5; discussion after 11.O-O-O). Pawn roller as an offensive weapon (11.O-O-O). Disadvantage of too many pawns (11.O-O-O). Temporary nature of the initiative (11.O-O-O; discussion after 13... Bf5). Pins, forks, and discovered checks (14.Ndb5). Advice Do not chase a knight with a center pawn if the knight can go to a better central square. Minor pieces are effective against the queen when they are coordinated. Pawns are an asset when they can drive your opponent's pieces back or control key squares. They are a liability when they inhibit your development. To strengthen an attack, bring in a new piece, preferably with check. The initiative is a temporary advantage. Do not waste it. Remember, not every sacrifice must be accepted. __________

CONNECT-THE-DOTS
better pawn structure can give you a lasting initiative and dictate the course of action. In this game, once his pawns are doubled on the g-file, Black's kingside pawns lose their flexibility. White's control of the ...e7-e5 break makes it impossible for his kingside initiative to be challenged and makes the flank attack more powerful. The outcome of this game, played against National Master Larry Tamarkin, is a reminder that chess is not just a cerebral activity, but a sporting contest as well. Iwas in a clearly winning position, but drifted into time pressure and lost on time.

New York, 1991
1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5
This is the Exchange Variation of the Caro-Kann. There are many different variations, but you do not need to study them all just yet. You need only one line against each opening. You can always add others later.
4.Bd3 (D)
White positions his bishop on the long diagonal to h7, with an eye towards a future kingside attack. White's queen and bishop now control g4 and f5 respectively, taking away the natural After 6.Nf4 Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann) developing squares from Black's light-square bishop.
4...Nc6
Question: What is the obvious threat? Answer: To take the pawn on d4. Question: Of course. There is also a less obvious threat. What is that? Answer: Play ...Nb4 and trade the knight for White's bishop. Good. Black would love to trade off this powerful bishop. Question: Does White have a move to handle both threats? Answer: Push his pawn to c3. Correct. This builds a pawn chain and stops ...Nb4. Question: Now that we have seen the strength of c3, is there any disadvantage to this move? Answer: Yes. It takes away the c3 square from White's knight. Right. However, the positive outweighs the negative. Moves are seldom totally good or totally bad. You have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages.
5.c3 Nf6 6.Bf4 (D)
White prevents the ...e7-e5 break. Question: A general opening principle states: develop knights before bishops. Can you think of any reason why this principle is widely followed? Answer: Knights are short-range pieces, so they should be moved out early. Is it not true that you would get the knights out soon enough even if you took an extra move or two to first develop the bishops? Answer: Knights can attack center pawns. Bishops cannot. I must admit, I never thought of it that way. I suppose a bishop would have trouble attacking acenter pawn without getting captured itself! However, that is not the reason for the principle. There is one logical square for each knight in the opening - on the third rank and towards the center. Other squares are less desirable. The reason for the principle "knights before bishops" is that it is generally clear where the knight should go. It is not always clear which square is best for a bishop - it has more choices. Therefore, it would make more sense to wait and see how your opponent develops his pieces before deciding where to place your bishop. In playing Bf4, White is clearly violating this principle. Do not take any principles for granted. Examine each and every position on its own merits. There are two words that you should be wary of - one is ALWAYS, and the other is NEVER. Knowing when a principle does not apply is the mark of a good player. Here the justification for moving the dark-square bishop before either knight is quite clear.
6.Nd2 would simply block in that bishop which is needed to guard e5. The immediate 6.Nf3
would also not be successful as it allows Black to set up an annoying pin with ...Bg4.
6...Bg4 (D)
Black decides to play ...Bg4 anyway, in order to attack White's queen. An interesting alternative is to fianchetto the king's bishop with 6...g6 and 7...Bg7. Question: Blocking the attack on his queen with Nf3 would clearly ruin White's earlier strategy. How else can he handle the attack? Answer: Be2. No. There is no logic behind this move. Question: There is one overpowering reason why White should not play Be2. What is it? Answer: You have already developed the bishop to d3. Why move it back? Exactly. This bishop is on a great square. Do not retreat a developed piece without good reason. Question: Give me another suggestion that handles Black's attack. Answer: f3. Question: There is a drawback to this move. What is it? Answer: It takes the f3 square away from the knight. Question: Yes. Can you find a better move? After 10.Se5 (7".Qd7 variation) Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann) Answer: Qc2. Question: The queen-and-bishop battery on the long diagonal is strong. However, there is an even better move. What is it? Answer: Qb3. Finally!
7.Qb3 (D)
7.Qb3 seizes the initiative by threatening the b7-pawn. This is the square that was weakened
when Black's bishop went to g4 on the previous move. Black cannot ignore this attack. Question: How should Black handle the attack on the b7-pawn? Answer: Push it up to b6. No. That weakens the light squares unnecessarily. Answer: Defend it with ...Qd7. This is quite playable. However, Black has to be careful not to fall into a trap: 7...Qd7 8.Nd2 e6 9.Ngf3 Be7 (9...Bd6 is better) 10.Ne5. (D) Question: Now, should Black capture the knight or retreat his queen? Answer: Take the knight. Oops. You just fell into the trap. Exercise 11-1a: After 7...Qd7 8.Nd2 e6 9.Ngf3 Be7 10.Ne5 Nxe5, what is the trap that Black has fallen into? Exercise 11-1b: What should Black do instead? Back to the game. Defending the b7-pawn with the queen is the right idea, but not from d7.
7...Qc8 (D)
Question: Can you guess the next few moves for each side? Answer: White should bring out both knights and then castle. Black should play...e6 and ...Be7. Isn't this simple? Both sides are making natural developing moves. Chess is easy when you pay attention to the fundamentals! Your answer is exactly how the game proceeded:
8.Nd2 e6 9.Ngf3 Be7 10.O-O
To this point, both Tamarkin and I have been following a well-trodden path. The nature of chess competition has changed dramatically over the years. A sound knowledge of opening theory is essential if you are to succeed at the master level in modern tournament play. Much of the work is done before ever coming to the board.
10...Bh5 (D)
After 12.Ne5 (10...O-O variation) Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann) The idea behind playing ...Bh5 is to play ...Bg6 and neutralize White's pressure along the b1- h7 diagonal. Castling before playing ...Bh5 is less effective: 10...O-O 11.Qc2 Bh5 12.Ne5. (D) Taking the knight now would cost Black a pawn: 12...Nxe5 13.dxe5 Nd7 14.Bxh7+. With White's knight on e5, opposing bishops with 12... Bg6 will allow White to trade knight for bishop, rather than exchanging bishops. By playing ...Bh5 before castling, Black threatens to place his bishop on g6 before White plays Ne5. Should White attempt to rush Ne5, he would be saddled with an inferior pawn structure:
10...O-O 11.Ne5 Nxe5 12.dxe5 Nd7. (D)
Black now has c5 available for his knight, and he can still oppose bishops with ...Bh5-g6. Small differences in move order can have a profound effect on a position.
11.Qc2 Bg6 12.Bxg6 (D)
After 12...fxg6 (variation)
[diagram]
The trade of bishops cannot be avoided. White prefers to initiate the bishop trade in order to double Black's pawns. Question: Which way should Black recapture and why? Answer: With the h-pawn, to give the rook an open file. Question: Good. What about the other option? Answer: Capturing with the f-pawn will break up Black's pawn structure and leave him with a backward pawn on e6. Yes. It is a question of pawn structure. (D) Every time pawns break up into small groups, we refer to each group as a pawn island. The more pawn islands there are, the weaker the pawn structure. Certain squares become difficult to defend. If Black recaptures with the f-pawn, his pawns will break up into three islands. The base of the pawn chain will shift from f7 to e6, making the e6-pawn backward and vulnerable because it is situated on White's half-open e-file. On the other hand, ifBlack recaptures with the h-pawn, then f7 provides a solid foundation for the entire structure.
12...hxg6 13.Rae1 (D)
After 13.aael
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann) Question: Why should White play Rae1 when he could just as easily move the other rook over? How do you decide which rook to activate when there is only one open file? Answer: The a1-rook is not doing anything on the other side of the board. Question: True, but what about the other rook? Is it any better on f1? How is this rook going to participate in the game? Answer: You could double rooks on the e-file. If your intention is to double rooks, it makes no difference which rook you move first. Furthermore, doubling rooks is most effective when targeting a backward pawn. Doubling in this position is the wrong strategy because there is no target. Question: When I played 13.Rae1, I already had a plan for activating the f1-rook. What was my plan? Answer: To move your bishop and knight out of the way, and push the f-pawn. Excellent! Imagine for a moment that the bishop and knight have moved off the f-file and I have advanced my pawn to f4. Both rooks are now active. In the early middlegame, rooks belong on open files or behind advancing pawns.
13...O-O (D)
Now the opening is over. Both sides are fully developed. At this stage of the game, finding the appropriate long-term plan is critical. Plans do not just appear out of thin air - the pawn structure dictates the plan. Connect-the-dots The pawns establish the boundary of your territory. Your entire middlegame plan can be based upon how these boundaries are drawn. To illustrate this, let's play connect-the-dots. If these dots represent the pawns, you can see the board is divided into two triangles. White's pawn chain is pointing towards the kingside and he is clearly controlling more space in that sector. It will be difficult for Black to challenge this superiority without bringing more pieces over from his queenside. However, Black's pawn structure makes this difficult because the pawn on e6 restricts the flow from one side to the other. He has a very narrow funnel to move his pieces through. Build your attack in the sector where you have more space. If you understand this structure, you will appreciate that White has a natural kingside attack with a high probability of success. You will also realize the importance of preventing the move ...e6-e5. If Black cannot advance his pawn to e5, he will be unable to free his position. Look at the pieces White has concentrated on that square - a pawn, a rook, a knight, and a bishop. Black's pawn is not going anywhere! A remarkable feature about this position is that not one of Black's five kingside pawns can move without serious consequences. The g6-pawn cannot move without endangering the king; the pawn behind it cannot move at all; the e6-pawn is frozen in its tracks; the d5-pawn is blockaded; and if the f7-pawn moves, the entire kingside pawn structure will collapse! Once you determine that the pawn structure is not going to change, you can organize your attack more effectively. A methodical approach is essential. Start with a concept, then consider specifics. The danger of not following this order is that you will make random moves, and never put together an organized attack. First, decide which squares your pieces should occupy in order to maximize their attacking potential. Second, determine how to get your pieces to the ideal squares. Next, establish whether or not your opponent can prevent your pieces from reaching the preferred destinations. Finally, consider whether or not your opponent can ignore your plan completely and launch a counterattack of his own. If you think through these four steps and are satisfied that your ideas are valid, then go ahead with your plan. After 13...O-O
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann) Now, let's apply this process to the game position. (D) Step One... Question: Where should White place his pieces for an attack on the king? Answer: I like one knight on g5, and the other on f3. Question: That certainly brings the knights into the attack. What about the other pieces? Answer: I like a rook on h3 and the queen on h4, threatening mate on h8. Excellent. Even if this does not lead to mate, an invasion on the h-file will present many problems for Black. Question: How about the pawns? Will they be used in the attack? Answer: No. Do not push the h-pawn. It will only block the file for the queen and rook. Good. The h-file must be kept clear. What about the other kingside pawns? We have already noted that f4 is a desirable move. It not only frees the f1-rook, but also helps to control the e5 square. As for the g2-pawn, it could go to g4 to keep Black's knight out of h5. Step Two... Question: Do our pieces have a clear path to these squares? Answer: Yes. The f3-knight can go directly to g5 and the d2-knight can then go to f3. Answer: The e1-rook can go to e3, then h3. Answer: The queen can go to d3, then g3, then h4. Excellent. And we can play f4 once we move the bishop. That was easy! Step Three - can Black stop these moves? Obviously, he can try to keep the knight out of g5 by playing ...f6, but that would destroy his kingside pawn structure. He cannot prevent the d2-knight from going to f3. And, there is no reasonable way for him to attack the squares the rook will be using. That just leaves the queen. Question: Can Black stop the queen from occupying h4? Answer. Yes, because his bishop on e7 can attack h4. Question: True. Can we counter that? After 14...£sh5 Answer: Yes. That's why we want our knight on g5. Actually, the knight would be very useful on e5. We could put our bishop on g5 instead, and set up a trade of bishops to secure h4 for the queen. A key feature of this position is that Black's kingside pawn structure is fixed, thus closing the center. As a result, White's plan to move his pieces over to the flank cannot easily be disrupted. Finally, Step Four. Question: Can Black ignore White's plans and mount his own attack? Answer: Yes. He may be able to attack down the c-file. Thank you! This is his half-open file which is the logical place to look for play. Question: Which pieces are sitting on that file? Answer: The two opposing queens. Question: Right. If you see that, you will notice a tactic Black could use. Answer: He can play ...Nxd4 if White moves his f3-knight. Do you see the value of using this process? You need to follow all these steps. It is not enough to focus on your moves alone. When you play chess, you are playing two games in your head: the moves you can make, and the moves your opponent can make. Failing to anticipate your opponent's counterplay will ruin your own plans.
14.Qd3
White moves his queen off the c-file and inches it towards h4.
14...Nh5 (D)
Black is playing on the kingside, but this is not a good strategy. White's attack is too strong. Instead, Black should consider moving his f-rook away to create an escape route for his king. It is very hard to plan an active defense because Black's kingside pawns cannot move. In similar positions, acommon strategy is to expand on the queenside with ...b7-b5, ...a7- a5, and ...b5-b4, then initiate a trade of pawns on c3. This trade would saddle White with a backward pawn, which would then become a target for Black. This strategy is called a minority attack - two pawns are attacking three. Here, unfortunately, such a plan would be too slow compared to White's direct assault on the king. After 15±g5
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann)
15.Bg5 (D)
White moves his bishop out of danger and offers a trade of bishops. Should Black accept, White would recapture with his knight, paving the way for the pawn to advance to f4.
15...Qd8
Black sets up a battery attacking the bishop. Question: How should White handle the attack without changing his plan? Answer: Capture the bishop. No. It is better to support the bishop with Qe3 and let Black make the trade.
16.Qe3 Bxg5 17.Nxg5 (D)
White recaptures with his knight. By having Black initiate the trade, White has gained a tempo. Meanwhile, his queen keeps inching towards h4.
17...Qf6?
A careless move. Black probably intended 18...Qf4 to set up a queen trade, hoping to turn back the attack.
18.f4 (D)
After 18,f4 After 19.g4 Finally! So much for ...Qf4. White's pawns on d4 and f4 now have a stranglehold on the e5 square. With the center firmly under control, White's flank attack will be more difficult to repel. Question: What is the immediate threat? Answer: g4, trapping the knight. Yes. The only way to save it is to move the queen, creating a retreat for the knight.
18...Qe7 19.g4 (D)
This move appears to violate another important principle, in this case a middlegame principle: do not push the pawns in front of your castled king. Question: Under what circumstances might you be justified in ignoring this principle? Answer: When your opponent has no counterplay against your king. Question: Correct. But what would stop your opponent's counterplay? Answer: A closed center. Exactly. When the center is fluid, do not move the pawns in front of your castled king. When the center is closed, they are free to move.
19...Nf6 20.Qh3 Rfc8 (D)
After Z0,..Rfc8 After 21...Sd6 Weeramantry - Tamarkin 1991 (Caro-Kann) Black intends to run his king to f8 and block a back-rank check with ...Ng8.
21.Rf3
The f-rook is heading to the h-file. Using the e-rook would have been more accurate so that the f4-pawn would remain protected.
21...Qd6 (D)
This is where I lost the game. I took fifteen minutes to make my next move, even though the time control was game in thirty! There really was no need to spend so much time, because I had already seen a beautiful combination. Question: Do you see it? Answer: The queen checks on h8, setting up a knight fork on f7. Absolutely correct. Isn't this a pretty move? How many chances do you get to stick your queen right in front of the enemy king? This is an example of a magnet combination attracting Black's king into a fork. There was no need to look for something better, because this move leads to the win of a pawn and destroys Black's kingside pawn structure. Unfortunately, I was reluctant to trade queens and kept searching for a checkmate.
22.Qh8+ Kxh8 23.Nxf7+ Kg8 24.Nxd6 (D)
After 24.Nxd6 White is ahead in material and has the superior pawn structure.
24...Rc7 25.Rxe6 Rf8
Black decided not to take the g4-pawn because White would reply with Rg3, skewering the knight to the g6-pawn.
26.h3 (D)
White is up two pawns and should win easily. He simply has to consolidate by doubling his rooks and improving the position of his other knight. The wasted time on move 22 left me with only moments on the clock and we were playing without a delay. I did manage to make ten or more additional moves from this position, but my opponent hung on three pawns down in the endgame, and my flag fell! After this unhappy experience, I can give you the following advice: If you see a position where you are clearly winning, there is no need to search for the perfect move. After 10...Qxe5?

Black's knight is under attack, but should it take the time to move away, 12.Bb5 would pin Black's queen to his king. Exercise 11-1b: What should Black do instead?

[diagram]
IT'S NEVER OVER
ou may tend to think of drawn games as dull games, but this is not always the case. Iam going to show you a game I drew that was far from dull. It is a good example of "chess as a struggle." The initiative shifts back and forth between myself and my opponent, National Master Juan Carlos Urbaneja Navarro, a leading player from Venezuela.
WEERAMANTRY - URBANEJA
New York, 1991
1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4
Another Grand Prix Attack. We first looked at this opening in Lesson 7 in my game against Mitchell Goldberg. Do you know how this opening got its name? It was used frequently by British players in the Cutty Sark Grand Prix tournaments in England in the 1970s. The inspiration, however, were the games of the Danish GM Bent Larsen in the 1960s, but he liked to play f2-f4 on move 2.
3...g6
The fianchetto formation is a popular alternative to 3...e6.7
4.Nf3 (D)
After 4".e6 (variation) After 7.Qxd4 (4...e6 variation) A common mistake in this position is for Black to reply with 4...e6. (D) Question: Why is 4...e6 a mistake? You do not have to look for an exact sequence. Think back to previous lectures and give me a general answer. Answer: It leaves holes on the dark squares. Good. I am glad you remembered about color weaknesses. By playing both ...e7-e6 and ...g7- g6, Black opens up two diagonals, but has only one dark-square bishop. He is creating weaknesses that cannot be controlled. As the game goes on, and Black gets better piece development, he may be able to cover some of the weak squares with other pieces. At this stage of the game, however, he is not in a position to do that. Question: How do you prove that 4...e6 is bad? Answer: Play 5.d4 cxd4 6.Nxd4 Nxd4 7.Qxd4 (D), preventing Black's bishop from going to g7. Your analysis is correct. In order to take advantage of weaknesses like this, you must open the position, and thus be able to target the dark squares. Instead of trading knights, Black would do better to play 6... Bg7. (D) After 7.Ndb5 (4...e6 variation) Weeramantry - Urbaneja 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Question: How should White proceed? Answer: Push e5. That will help White control the dark squares. Good. e5 is definitely part of White's plan, but there is a more important move to be played first. Answer: Be3. This is a good developing move, but is too passive. Look for a more active move. Answer: Play Ndb5. (D) Yes! 7.Ndb5 is much stronger than 7.Be3. With Black's bishop already committed to the other diagonal, he cannot stop White's knight from jumping into d6. Then e5 makes a lot more sense because it anchors the knight on an advanced outpost square. Occupying d6 would also bury Black's c8-bishop, giving White a substantial lead in development. All things considered, Black cannot use the move order 4...e6 in this opening. Back to the actual game where Black played the correct move.
4...Bg7 5.Bc4
White's light-square bishop usually goes to c4 or b5. Both moves are reliable. In general, the bishop goes to b5 if Black has moved his d6-pawn, and to c4 if he has not.
5...e6
Now ...e7-e6 is quite playable as White cannot open the position with d2-d4. After 6,f5
[diagram]
After 7..,gxf5 (6,..exf5 variation)
[diagram]
After 7.d3 (6,..gxf5 variation)
[diagram]
6.f5 (D)
This pawn sacrifice is an attempt to seize the initiative by disrupting Black's pawn structure. If Black takes with his e-pawn, White can take back without losing control of the center (6...exf5
7.exf5). It is clear that Black should not capture again with 7...gxf5 (D), because he will be
saddled with doubled and isolated f-pawns where his extra pawn would be of little use. If Black takes with his g-pawn on move 6, then White must continue with 7.d3 (D), keeping his pawn on e4 to prevent Black from playing ...d7-d5. Of course, if Black takes on e4, White will take back with the pawn (7...fxe4 8.dxe4). So long as Black has a pawn on e6, White must maintain a pawn on e4. After 9...Na5 Weeramantry - Urbaneja 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Either way, White's superior development gives him excellent compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Back to the game. My opponent did not take the pawn and instead played the move recommended by theory.
6...Nge7 (D)
Black prepares to castle and puts more pressure on the f5 square.
7.fxe6 dxe6
While this move has been played by many grandmasters, playing 7... fxe6, keeping open the possibility of ...d7-d5, is the better move.
8.d3 O-O 9.O-O
We have reached the end of the opening. There are a few pieces left to be developed, but now the fun begins.
9...Na5 (D)
Black wants to trade off the c4-bishop and double White's c-pawns. This plan is inefficient because it involves three knight moves to capture a piece that has moved only once. The extra time needed to carry out this maneuver helps White to complete his development before Black does. Meanwhile, Black's bishop is still languishing on c8, impeding the coordination of his rooks. After 10,Qel
[diagram]
After ll.dxc4 (10,,,Sxc4 variation)
[diagram]
10.Qe1 (D)
White uses the dark squares to transfer his queen to the kingside, a common plan when attacking the fianchetto. This move also avoids a queen trade should White have to recapture on c4 with his pawn. Black could continue with his plan of trading knight for bishop, but, as we will see, the doubled c-pawns actually help White, for example 10...Nxc4 11.dxc4. (D) White's c4-pawn now controls d5. As a result, his e-pawn is free to advance to e5. This clears the e4 square for his knight and strengthens the kingside attack. In addition, White will be able to use the d-file for his rook and increase his control of the center. Question: What is the best placement for White's pieces to conduct a kingside attack? Answer: Play Qh4, then Bh6. Yes. The queen belongs on h4 from where it controls the key dark squares h6 and g5. White can decide whether to place his bishop on g5 or continue on to h6 keeping g5 open for the f3- knight.
10...h6 11.Qh4 Nec6 (D)
After ll... ec6
[diagram]
After 12.Ng5
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Urbaneja 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Black challenges White's queen, hoping to dislodge it from h4. White cannot retreat his queen because 12.Qh3 will be met with the discovered attack 12...e5. However, White has a surprising move. Question: Can you find it? Answer: Bg5. If Black takes the bishop, the knight will take back, threatening Qh7#. Bravo!
12.Bg5 (D)
Amazingly, the h6-pawn does not prevent White from playing this move. The first time I used this idea was against International Master Dr. Hans Berliner, in the
1975 Eastern Open. Dr. Berliner was a former World Correspondence Champion best known as
the programmer of HiTech, which was once the strongest computer chess program in the world. If the queen moves away, then Bxh6 shatters Black's defenses and opens g5 for White's knight. Remember the squares h4, h6, and g5. They are the key to the dark-square attack against Black's fianchetto. At this point, I was walking around confident that I had this game already won. The problem with chess is, it's never over! After forty-five minutes' thought, Urbaneja came up with an ingenious defense. Question: What is Black's clever defensive maneuver? After 13...*fd4+ Answer: ...f6. In some ways this does stop the attack, but it creates a new weakness on g6. After Bxh6, Black's position is collapsing. This is a tough sequence to find, so I will give you a clue. The only way to survive the attack is for Black to get his queen to g7. My opponent just sat there until he figured it out. Icould not believe it! Answer: 12...Bd4+ 13.Nxd4. Hold on. White is not going to take the bishop. He would just play Kh1 instead. But you are right that the d4 square has something to do with it. Time for another hint. Question: What is the one move we are all assuming Black cannot play? Answer: ...hxg5. Of course. But that is a wrong assumption!
12...hxg5! 13.Nxg5 Qd4+ (D)
14.Kh1
White can also get out of check with 14.Rf2. Exercise 12-1: Which move, 14.Kh1 or 14.Rf2, gives White better winning chances?
14...Bh6! (D)
After 16...fte5 (variation)
[diagram]
Weeramantry - Urbaneja 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack)
14...Bh6 saves the day. Unbelievable! Black sacrifices his bishop to open the long diagonal
for his queen.
15.Qxh6 Qg7
End of attack. Black suffered a little damage, but he was able to regroup and defend. Now the attacker must retreat and reorganize before starting again.
16.Qh4
White does not want the queen on h3 where it would be exposed to a discovered attack from the c8-bishop. Still, it is not clear how White should continue the attack. I have a sad story to tell. This is not the only time I have had this position. A little more than a year after this game was played, I got to the same position in a thirty-minute game against five- time U.S. champion Grandmaster Gata Kamsky. Kamsky played 16...Ne5. (D) I failed to find the best continuation and ended up losing. The consensus in the postmortem analysis was that I had excellent chances had I played Rf6!. Back to the game.
16...Nxc4 17.dxc4 Ne5 (D)
After 18... xc4 (variation)
[diagram]
Question: Why does ...Ne5 make sense? Answer: It attacks a pawn. It attacks the c4-pawn and centralizes the knight. What else can you tell me about the e5 square? Answer: It is an outpost. Remember, the square in front of an isolated pawn is a great outpost. Put a homing device on that square and jump right in there.
18.Rad1
White is answering the attack on the c4-pawn with a counterattack. This developing move sets up an indirect defense to the threat of ...Nxc4. (D) Exercise 12-2: If Black tries 18...Nxc4, how does White respond?
18...f6 19.Nf3 Nxc4
Black has re-established material equality, but here comes the second wave of the attack.
20.e5! (D)
After 21,£te4 Weeramantry - Urbaneja 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Advancing the pawn sets up a discovered attack on Black's knight. If Black accepts this pawn sacrifice with 20...Nxe5 21.Nxe5 fxe5, White will either win Black's queen or deliver a forced mate. Exercise 12-3: After 20...Nxe5 21.Nxe5 fxe5, how should White continue? Of course, Black did not take the pawn.
20...Ne3
A more challenging move, Black forks White's rooks. This was not unexpected.
21.Ne4 (D)
Now you see the real point of 20.e5. It is a clearance move. If the knight reaches f6, White's attack becomes unstoppable. His last piece will have entered the fray with devastating effect. Meanwhile, Black can take only one rook at a time. Why bother trying to save either one? Leave them there and let him have his pick! Question: If Black plays 21...Nxf1, how should White reply? Answer: Just play Nxf6+. Good. This is stronger than recapturing on f1. What happens now? Answer: Black plays ...Kf7, then White checks with the other knight. Yes. 22...Kf7 23.Ng5+ Ke7 24.Qc4 gives White an overwhelming attack. After 23,.. xf8
[diagram]
Question: But, what if Black decides to return material with 22...Rxf6 instead of moving his king? Answer: White will take back with his pawn, attacking the queen. Right. Question: After 23.exf6 Qc7, how does White continue? Answer: 24.Ng5. Excellent. Black cannot stop all of White's threats. Now if Black instead takes the other rook with 21...Nxd1, White will again play 22.Nxf6+ Rxf6 23.exf6. After 23...Qh7, White simply trades down into an endgame where he can force the promotion of his f-pawn: 24.Qxh7+ Kxh7 25.Rxd1 g5 26.Ne5. Black did not take either rook. Instead, he counterattacked with...
21...g5
Now both rooks are hanging, as is the queen! In situations like this, forget about retreating anything. Press on with the attack and sacrifice the next piece.
22.Nfxg5 fxg5 23.Rxf8+ Kxf8 (D)
Unfortunately, all these moves had taken me a very long time, and my flag was hanging! I had a minute left to get to move thirty. Back then, we did not have the luxury of increment or delay.
24.Qf2+ Nf5 25.Qxc5+ (D)
After 28*. c6 Weeramantry - Urbaneja 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Now I am winning. If Black's king runs to g8 or e8, 26.Nf6+ Kf7 27.Rd8 Ne7 28.Qb5 Nc6 29.Qf1 sets up a winning discovered attack along the f-file.
25...Ne7 26.Rd8+ Kf7 27.Nd6+
Other good alternatives are 27.Nf6 and 27.Qb5. However, the text move, if played correctly, leads to a forced win.
27...Kg6 28.Qc3 Nc6 (D)
In time trouble, I missed a forced win. Exercise 12-4: Find White's winning line after 28...Nc6.
29.g4
Expecting Black to capture my rook, Itried to set up a mating net. But Black cleverly stays away from 29...Nxd8? as 30.Qd3+ leads to a mate in three: 30...Kh6 31.Qh3+ Kg6 32.Qh5#.
29...Nxe5?
This is also a losing move. Black should play 29...Qxe5 instead.
30.Nxc8?
One mistake after another! 30.Qh3 wins easily. There is no excuse for trading this powerful knight for a bishop that has not even moved. But this was the last move before time control, and After 34...Qdl+ I just could not think of anything else.
30...Qf6 (D)
I was so relieved to have reached time control that at first I did not realize the danger I was in. The position has changed, and Black has taken over the initiative. White's king on h1 is in more danger than Black's king on g6. White can no longer protect the rook and f1 at the same time.
31.Qd4 Rxc8
This rook sacrifice deflects White's rook from guarding d1. Black can now force a perpetual check.
32.Rxc8 Qf1+ 33.Qg1 Qf3+ 34.Qg2 Qd1+ (D)
35.Qg1 Qd5+ 1⁄2-1⁄2
He offered a draw and I accepted. Exercise 12-5: Instead of offering a draw, Black could have met 36.Qg2 with 36...Nf3 threatening ...Qd1+. Why not? After 14.gf2! (variation)
[diagram]
After 16.Qh3 (14.gf2 variation) After 18..Axc4 (variation) Weeramantry - Urbaneja 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack)
ANSWERS
Exercise 12-1: Which move, 14.Kh1 or 14.Rf2, gives White better winning chances? Answer: White has better winning chances with 14.Rf2!. (D) This rook will not stay pinned once Black transfers his queen to g7 for defense: 14...Bh6
15.Qxh6 Qg7 16.Qh3. (D)
By playing 14.Rf2 instead of 14.Kh1, White saves a valuable tempo and can more quickly double his rooks on the f-file. Exercise 12-2: If Black tries 18...Nxc4, how does White respond? (D) After 23.e5 (18,..Cixc4 variation) Answer: White launches a counterattack with 19.Nxf7. Now 19...Rxf7 20.Rd8+ Rf8 21.Rfxf8+ Qxf8 22.Rxf8+ Kxf8 23.e5. (D) Black cannot capture this pawn, as 23...Nxe5 loses the knight to 24.Qh8+. White has a material advantage as well as a commanding lead in development. Exercise 12-3: After 20...Nxe5 21.Nxe5 fxe5 (D), how should White continue? Answer: White wins with 22.Rxf8+: 1) 22...Qxf8 is met by 23.Rd8 Bd7 24.Rxf8+ winning the queen. 2) 22...Kxf8 leads to a forced mate in 5: 23.Qd8+ Kf7 24.Rf1+ Qf6 25.Rxf6+ Kg7 26.Qf8+ Kh7 27.Rf7#. Exercise 12-4: Find White's winning line after 28...Nc6. (D) After 28...&C6
[diagram]
After 36...Sb£3 (36.@g2 variation) Weeramantry - Urbaneja 1991 (Sicilian Grand Prix Attack) Answer: White can win with 29.Qd3+: 1) If 29...Kh6, White has a forced mate in 5 or less. For example: 30.Nf7+ Kh5 31.Rh8+ Qxh8 32.Nxh8 g4 33.Qg6+ Kh4 34.Qh6#. 2) If 29...Kh5, then 30.Qh3+ Kg6 31.g4 Qh7 32.Qf3 Nxe5 33.Qe4+ Kh6 34.Qxe5 with a crushing attack. Exercise 12-5: Instead of offering a draw, Black could have met 36.Qg2 with 36...Nf3 (D) threatening ...Qd1+. Why not? Answer: White turns the game around with the surprising reply 37.Rd8!, after which 37...Qxd8
38.Qxf3 leaves White a pawn ahead.
REVIEW
Themes Weak color complex (4...e6 variation). Pawn sacrifice for initiative (6.f5 gxf5 7.d3). Pawn sacrifice for structural advantage (6.f5 exf5 7.exf5 gxf5). Attacking the dark squares around Black's castled king in a fianchetto formation (10.Qe1;
11.Qh4; 12.Bg5).
Accepting doubled pawns to control central squares (10...Nxc4 variation). Reorganizing the attack (16.Qh4 through 20.e5). Square clearance (20.e5). Advice Open the position to exploit weak squares. Advance a pawn to clear a square for a piece. Try approaching a target from different angles. Whenever possible, defend actively and counterattack. Sacrifice to gain the initiative. Sacrifice again to maintain it when necessary. When two pieces of the same value are attacked, it may be a waste of time to move either one - your opponent can only capture one piece at a time. Manage your time efficiently. Serious time trouble can spell disaster. __________

17.f4 Bc7 18.e4 Rac8 19.e5? (D)
White goes wrong by overextending his center. It is critical to maintain the pawn on e4 in order to keep the h1-a8 diagonal blocked. Advancing the e-pawn gives Black's bishops too much scope, with two adjacent diagonals aiming directly at White's king.
19...Bb6+ 20.Kh1 Ng4!
Black takes advantage of White's overloaded queen to move his knight into attacking position.
21.Be4 (D)
After 21.Be4
[diagram]
After 22.g3 White realizes the danger along the h1-a8 diagonal and attempts to neutralize Black's light- square bishop by blocking the diagonal with his own bishop. Capturing the knight with 21.Qxg4 is not a viable option, as it permits 21...Rxd3 with the twin threats of ...Rxc3, gaining two minor pieces for the rook, and ...Rd2, targeting White's g2- pawn. Exercise D1-1: If White chooses to block with 21.Ne4 instead, how does Black proceed?
21...Qh4 22.g3 (D)
Black's pieces are well coordinated and they are all participating in the attack. It appears at first that Black's strength lies along the h1-a8 diagonal, but the concluding combination takes an unexpected turn.
22...Rxc3!!
A brilliant move. Black removes one of the protectors of the e4-bishop. He now threatens to capture on e4 and deflect White's queen from its protection of h2. The true beauty of this move, however, is that it leaves the queen en prise!
23.gxh4
Can you really blame White for taking the queen?
23...Rd2!
After 25.Bg2 After llJtg5 (D2) D.Byrne - Fischer 1956 First the queen, now the rook! Black is intent on deflecting White's queen, removing the last defender of the e4-bishop.
24.Qxd2 Bxe4+ 25.Qg2 (D)
White is forced to give back the queen, but hopes that returning the material will help him survive.
25...Rh3! 0-1
An amazing sight! The attack along the h1-a8 diagonal was merely a distraction after all. Who needs to capture the queen? The true target is h2. Mate on h2 cannot be prevented. (D2) D. Byrne - Fischer, New York 1956 [D97]
1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.d4 O-O 5.Bf4 d5 6.Qb3 dxc4 7.Qxc4 c6 8.e4 Nbd7
9.Rd1 Nb6 10.Qc5 Bg4 11.Bg5 (D)
White needs to give priority to completing his development. Keeping the king in the center when the opponent is already castled and fully developed is inviting trouble. The safer course is to play 11.Be2 and prepare to castle.
11...Na4!
A very resourceful move. Black finds a way to seize the initiative by offering to sacrifice his knight in order to undermine the protection of e4.
12.Qa3
After 17...axb6 (15.Jtxf8 variation) After 17.&fl If White accepts the sacrifice with 12.Nxa4, then Black eliminates the key pawn on e4 with
12...Nxe4, forking White's queen and bishop. Now the only way for White not to return the
extra piece is to play 13.Bxe7 which leads to disaster on the e-file (13...Qc7 14.Qa3 Rfe8 15.Bb4 Ng3+).
12...Nxc3 13.bxc3 Nxe4 14.Bxe7
It is still a mistake to open the e-file. White can resist more strongly with 14.Be3. However, Black is already up a pawn and, ironically, retains his initiative by offering a queen trade, for example 14...Qd6 15.Qxd6 exd6 16.Rc1 Rae8 17.Bd3 f5.
14...Qb6 15.Bc4
White decides that it is better to castle as soon as possible and does not go for the exchange with 15.Bxf8 as Black would then increase his advantage by entering the queen trade: 15...Bxf8
16.Qb3 Nxc3 17.Qxb6 (17.Qxc3? Bb4 pins the queen) 17...axb6. (D)
Although down an exchange, Black is winning as White has two undeveloped pieces and his rook is under attack. For instance, 18.Ra1 meets with the powerful 18...Bb4.
15...Nxc3 16.Bc5
White pins his hopes of survival on attacking Black's queen. 16.Qxc3 does not help as the pin along the e-file with 16...Rae8 is crushing.
16...Rfe8+ 17.Kf1 (D)
[diagram]
17...Be6!!
The power of this move by the 13-year-old Fischer has resulted in this game being dubbed "The Game of the Century." Black gives up his queen for a spectacular finish.
18.Bxb6
White accepts the sacrifice. He is still losing after 18.Qxc3. Black can exploit the pin on White's d4-pawn and reply with 18...Qxc5. Exercise D2-1: Show how Black meets 18.Bxe6.
18...Bxc4+ 19.Kg1 Ne2+ 20.Kf1 Nxd4+ 21.Kg1 Ne2+
This tactical scenario, where a king is repeatedly exposed to a different discovered check while being forced to shuffle back and forth between two squares, is often referred as a "windmill."
22.Kf1 Nc3+ 23.Kg1 axb6 (D)
Black's compensation for the sacrificed queen is clear. His bishops and rooks coordinate beautifully and control important lines of attack, while one of White's rooks is incarcerated on h1.
24.Qb4 Ra4 25.Qxb6 Nxd1 26.h3 Rxa2 27.Kh2 Nxf2 28.Re1
Twenty-eight moves into the game, White finally brings his other rook out, but it is much too late. In the last four moves, Black has picked up even more material. He now has a rook, two minor pieces, and three pawns for the queen.
28...Rxe1 29.Qd8+ Bf8 30.Nxe1 Bd5 31.Nf3 Ne4 32.Qb8 b5
Every single piece and pawn in Black's position is protected. There is simply nothing for White to attack.
33.h4 h5 34.Ne5 Kg7 35.Kg1 Bc5+ 36.Kf1 Ng3+ 37.Ke1 (D)
Fischer now finishes with a mate in five moves. When it was pointed out to him that he had a faster mate, he replied that he simply played the win he found. Exercise D2-2: After 37.Ke1, find a mate in four moves for Black. There are two ways to do this.
37...Bb4+ 38.Kd1 Bb3+ 39.Kc1 Ne2+ 40.Kb1 Nc3+ 41.Kc1 Rc2# 0-1

Bf5 10.cxd5 Nxd5 (D) White has an isolated d-pawn. In general, the compensation for an isolated pawn lies in superior piece activity on one or both adjacent files. That is not the case here. In fact, White is slightly behind in development.
11.Qb3
White uses a double attack on the knight and the b7-pawn in an effort to force Black onto the defensive. Now 11...Nb6, retreating the knight from its blockading square on d5, would allow White to complete his development unchallenged.
11...Be6
Black elects to keep his knight centralized.
12.Qxb7 Nxd4 13.Nxd4 Bxd4
After 15...Sxb2 After 17...d?xf8 (D3) Bareev - Kasparov 1991 The previous captures have resulted in an indirect trade of Black's b7-pawn for White's d4- pawn. White has eliminated the potential weakness of the isolated d4-pawn, but only at the cost of giving Black greater piece play in the center.
14.Bh6 Rb8 15.Qa6 Rxb2 (D)
Surprise! Black concludes that his superior piece activity justifies giving up the exchange. It is precisely the creation of this type of imbalance that offers practical winning chances.
16.Nxd5 Qxd5 17.Bxf8 Kxf8 (D)
Black has a bishop and a pawn for the exchange. His pieces are exerting pressure on White's castled position and are poised to attack. He is also threatening to capture White's a2-pawn, which will further increase his compensation by giving him an outside passed pawn to go along with his bishop pair.
18.a4?
White moves his pawn to safety without realizing the serious consequences of this move.
18.Rad1 offers better defensive chances.
18...Rb3!
It is most unusual that a rook that has already penetrated to the seventh rank backs up a rank in order to create stronger threats. Indeed, switching the rook to the sixth rank proves decisive.
19.Rad1
After 12.. Axc4 This allows a quick mate, but White does not have any satisfactory alternatives. Exercise D3-1: If White tries to defend with 19.Bf3, how does Black win?

Nxg3 10.Qf2 Nxf1 11.Qxh4 Nxe3 12.Ke2 Nxc4 (D) This all-computer matchup features a most human queen sacrifice first introduced by world championship contender David Bronstein. Black has two bishops and a pair of pawns for the queen, as well as active play against White's exposed king.
13.Qe1 f5
Black opens the f-file in order to exploit the uncomfortable position of White's king, and immediately activates one of its rooks. Grabbing a pawn instead with 13...Nxb2? is ill-advised, as 14.Qc1! Nc4 15.Nb5 tips the balance in White's favor due to the threat of winning an exchange with Nxc7.
14.h4
Against the kingside fianchetto, the traditional attack involving the opening of the h-file is not as effective without a dark-square bishop.
14...fxe4 15.Nxe4 c6
Black attempts to open the center to gain immediate access to White's king.
16.Qd1
White dare not oblige, as 16.dxc6 Nxc6 17.Rc1 d5 18.Nc3 e4 completely shatters the center.
16...Bd7 17.Kf2 Bf5 18.Ng3 Nxb2
Taking the pawn is justified this time around: the knight can jump back with check when attacked.
19.Qb3 Nd3+ 20.Kg2 Nc5 21.Qd1 Bd7
After 22...&ba6
[diagram]
(D4) LCZero - Stockfish 2019 In anticipation of further opening the center, Black makes sure to preserve its bishop pair.
22.h5 Nba6 (D)
Black's minor pieces are working harmoniously, while White is unable to complete development because its king desperately needs to find shelter.
23.Rc1 Rf6 24.N1e2 Raf8
Black sets up a battery on the f-file and targets the f3-pawn.
25.h6
Should White play 25.hxg6, Black will capture back with the rook.
25...Bh8 26.Rf1 g5 27.Kg1 Rxh6
Black now has two bishops and four pawns for the queen. It is even ahead on the point count!
28.Ne4 Rf7 29.N2c3 Rg6 30.dxc6 Bxc6 31.Rc2
White moves its rook to a more active square and allows it to reposition itself along the second rank.
31...Bg7 32.Rd2
Exercise D4-1: If White plays 32.Nxd6, how should Black reply?
32...Bf8 33.Nxd6 Rf4 (D)
After 45.Sf2 Although White's knight is placed well on d6, Black finds an active plan to play around it. Indeed, it is critical for Black to keep generating threats against White's king so as to keep control of the position. The threat isnow 34...g4.
34.Ne2 Ba4
Another excellent example of active play. Rather than move the attacked rook, Black makes use of its control of the fourth rank to counterattack White's queen.
35.Qe1 Bxd6 36.Nxf4 gxf4+
This series of trades has increased Black's material advantage, netting two minor pieces for a rook.
37.Kh1 Bc7 38.Rh2 Nd7 39.Rg1 Bc6 40.Rxg6+ hxg6 41.Qh4
White must activate its queen and is willing to give up another pawn to achieve this.
41...Bxf3+ 42.Kg1 Bb6+ 43.Kf1 Bh5 44.Qe7 Nac5 45.Rf2 (D)
A most unusual material imbalance. White has 15 points versus 17 for Black, without either side having apiece in common except for a pawn. Although Black's king is exposed to checks by the white queen, its pieces are so well coordinated that they control critical squares and are able to contain the queen's attacks.
45...Nf8
Black gives up a pawn to improve the placement of the d7-knight. After 59.a? (D4) LCZero - Stockfish 2019
46.Qxe5
The pawn that White captures is the only unprotected piece on the board.
46...Nfe6
This knight moves into better attacking position while helping to shield Black's king from attack.
47.a4 Bc7 48.Qd5 Bg4
Black redeploys this bishop so that it has access to two different diagonals, greatly increasing its scope.
49.Rc2 Bh3+ 50.Ke2 b6 51.Qa8+ Kf7
It is amazing to see that the four minor pieces are preventing any effective coordination between White's queen and rook.
52.Qxa7 Kf6
Black moves out of the pin and frees the c7-bishop.
53.a5 Bf5 54.Rxc5
Faced with constant harassment by the bishops, White decides to give up the exchange. Moving the rook off the c-file would allow Black to capture the pawn on a5.
54...bxc5 55.Qa8 Bg4+ 56.Kf1 f3
This pawn joins in the attack and helps to weave a mating net around White's king.
57.Qh8+ Kg5 58.a6 Bg3 59.a7 (D)
White threatens to make a second queen, but it is too late. Black's pieces are poised for the final assault.
59...Bf5 60.Qh1
Promoting the pawn does not help, since the second queen is soon captured: 60.a8Q Bd3+
61.Kg1 f2+ 62.Kg2 f1Q+ 63.Kxg3 Qf4+ 64.Kg2 Be4+, after which Black will have a piece and
two pawns more.
60...Bd3+ 61.Kg1 Nd4
After Exercise D4-2: If White promotes the pawn after 61...Nd4, find a forced mate for Black.
62.Qh2
Desperation.

9.Bh4 d5 10.Rd1 g5 11.Bg3 Ne4 12.Nd2 Nc5 13.Qc2 d4 14.Nf3 (D)
The critical feature of this type of position is that one player is castled and the other is not. The uncastled player must make it a priority to get his king out of the center before the other player succeeds in blowing it open.
14...e5
Black frees his c8-bishop. He is more than happy to give up a pawn in return for active play against the uncastled king.
15.Nxe5 dxc3!
This is a long-term sacrifice of the queen. It does not lead to a forced win, but it does create a material imbalance that complicates the position and offers winning chances. Such sacrifices are extremely difficult to judge.
16.Rxd8 cxb2+ (D)
After 20.Nf3 (D5) Jinshin Bai - Ding Liren 2017 Black has achieved his goal of mounting a direct assault on White's uncastled king. The question is whether the attack is strong enough to justify giving up the queen.
17.Ke2?
White chooses to move his king. However, he should have considered giving back some material with 17.Rd2 to blunt Black's offensive.
17...Rxd8 18.Qxb2 Na4
Repositioning a knight with gain of time.
19.Qc2 Nc3+ 20.Kf3 (D)
White's king cannot safely retreat and is forced to venture out into the open. The king hunt begins.
20...Rd4!
An amazing move! Black's rook enters the attack with devastating effect. It cannot be captured, as 21.exd4 Nxd4+ falls into a knight fork. Meanwhile, there is an imminent mate threat beginning with ...g5-g4+.
21.h3
It is now too late to give back material. For example, 21.e4 Rxe4 22.Qxe4 Nxe4 23.Kxe4 f5+ still leaves White far behind in development and with a vulnerable king.
21...h5 22.Bh2 g4+ 23.Kg3 Rd2 (D)
After 26...Ng7 For the second time in the last few moves, Black's rook and knight coordinate perfectly to set up a knight fork: 24.Qxd2? Ne4+ wins the queen.
24.Qb3 Ne4+ 25.Kh4
Exercise D5-1: If 25.Kf4 Rxf2+ 26.Kxe4, can you find a mate?
25...Be7+ 26.Kxh5 Kg7 (D)
This quiet king move sets up a mating net. It takes away the last remaining safe square from White's king and gets ready to bring the a8-rook over to the kingside to deliver checkmate.
27.Bf4 Bf5 28.Bh6+
White makes a desperate attempt to block the h-file and avert mate.
28...Kh7 29.Qxb7
If White plays 29.hxg4 instead, he gets mated by a pawn! (29...Bg6+ 30.Nxg6 fxg6#.)
29...Rxf2 30.Bg5 Rh8
Plan realized! Black's pieces are swarming all over the white king.
31.Nxf7 Bg6+ 32.Kxg4 Ne5+ 0-1
It is mate in three: 33.Nxe5 Bf5+ 34.Kh5 Kg8+ 35.Bh6 Ng3#. (D6) Tseshkovsky - Kasparov, Tbilisi 1978 [B18] After 17...gxf6 After 23".Qb8

18.d5!
This is a multi-purpose clearance sacrifice. In one move, White takes away d5 from Black's knight and frees d4 for his own piece.
18...exd5 19.Nd4 Qa6 20.Kb1 Bd6 21.Qf3
Rather than trade on d6 himself, White protects his f4-bishop and invites Black to make the trade.
21...Bxf4 22.Qxf4 Ne5 23.Qf5+ Kb8 (D)
White is in complete control of the game, primarily because Black's pawns are fractured and lack mobility. The extent to which this affects the outcome becomes clearer as the game progresses.
24.f4
Although Black's knight is placed well on e5, he is unable to maintain its centralized position. White's knight, on the other hand, has a permanent home on d4. After 29...Bc5
24...Nd7 25.Qxd5 Ne5 26.Qe4 Ng4
Black threatens to fork all of White's major pieces with ...Ng4-f2, but the knight is unable to receive any assistance from the rest of Black's pieces.
27.Qe2 Qb6 28.c3 f5 29.Rhe1
There is no hurry to capture Black's weak pawn on f5. This structural weakness will not disappear. Activating one's pieces takes priority.
29...Qc5 (D)
Black momentarily protects his f5-pawn, but can do little to contest White's control of the e- file.
30.Qe7 Qxe7 31.Rxe7
The trade of queens further highlights Black's structural weaknesses.
31...Rhe8 32.Rde1 Rxe7 33.Rxe7 Nf6 34.Rxf7 Nxh5 35.Nxf5
The recent flurry of captures has clarified the position. White has an extra pawn and a clear 2-1 pawn majority on the kingside. His rook has penetrated to the seventh rank, and his knight is more centralized.
35...Rd3 36.Rf8+ Kc7 37.Rg8 Kd7 38.Rg6 b5 (D)
Black is helpless. He cannot dislodge either of White's pieces from their dominant positions. He therefore resorts to a desperate attempt for queenside play. After 13.Ne5 (D7) Weeramantry - Walton 1986
39.a3 Rd1+ 40.Ka2 Rg1 41.Rd6+
White finds a clever intermediate move that forces Black's king further away from the kingside.
41...Kc7 42.Rxh6 Nxg3 43.Nd4 Ne4 44.Nxb5+ Kd7 45.Rh7+ Ke6 46.Rxa7
Black's pawns are falling one after the other. His only hope is a mate on a1, but that is only a dream.
46...Nc5 47.Nd4+ Kd6 48.Nf5+ Kd5 49.Ne3+ Ke4 50.Rc7 Nd3 51.Re7+ 1-0

9.Ngf3 Bd6 10.Bxd6 Qxd6 11.O-O O-O 12.Rae1 Rab8 13.Ne5 (D)
White's knight occupies the strong square e5 and prevents Black from executing a central pawn break with ...e6-e5.
13...Bh5 14.f4
White strengthens his control of e5 and increases the mobility of his f1-rook.
14...Bg6 15.Nxg6 hxg6 16.Qd1 b5
Unable to create any play in the center, Black launches a minority attack on the queenside.
17.b4
This strategy of handling the minority attack was popularized by former world champion José Raúl Capablanca. It is effective as long as the weakness of the backward pawn on c3 cannot be exploited.
17...Rfc8 18.Nb3
White's knight heads for c5 to shield his c3-pawn from an attack along the c-file.
18...a5 19.a3 axb4 20.axb4
The trade of pawns on b4 leaves Black with an isolated pawn on b5, which will remain a prominent target for White's light-square bishop.
20...Ra8
After 29... e8?
[diagram]
Black seeks to use the open a-file as compensation.
21.Nc5 Qb8 (D)
Black defends his b5-pawn as a prelude to doubling rooks on the a-file. The stage is set for a kingside attack by White and a queenside invasion by Black.
22.Re3 Ne7 23.Qe1 Nf5 24.Rh3
White sets up for a direct attack on Black's castled king along the h-file.
24...Rc7 25.Be2 Rca7 26.g4 Nd6 27.Qh4
Mate is threatened on h8.
27...Kf8 28.Qh8+ Ng8 29.Rh7 Ne8 (D)
As Black cannot challenge White's control of the h-file, he uses his knights to hold White's queen and rook at bay. However, this move is a mistake. Instead, he could have shut White down with 29...Ke7 30.Qxg7 Nf6 31.Rh3 Qf8. Black's control of the a-file gives him adequate compensation for the pawn.
30.Rf3
This is a good idea, but the timing is wrong as it gives Black's a7-rook a chance to leave his second rank with check. White can maintain complete control by leaving this rook on f1 and playing 30.Rh3 instead.
30...Ra1+
After 33...Ne7 (31...Qd6 variation)
[diagram]
After 32.Rfh3 (D7) Weeramantry - Walton 1986 If this were not check, White would now fork Black's king and queen with Nd7+.
31.Kg2 R8a7?
The decisive mistake. Black must protect d7 with his queen, not his rook. The a8-rook must stay guarding his first rank. Instead, Black has a remarkable defense in 31...Qd6. If White pursues his idea of tripling on the h-file in order to threaten mate by sacrificing his queen on g8, Black will simply give up the knight and walk away: 32.Rfh3 Qxf4 33.Qxg8+ Ke7. (D) Although Black is down a piece, he has enough counterplay to hold the balance. If White continues his attack by doubling on the eighth rank, Black moves his knight to c7, protecting the a8-rook and discovering an attack on White's queen: 34.Rh8 Nc7. Once the queen moves away, Black's a8-rook pins the e2-bishop with ...R8a2 and helps recover the piece. Back to the game.
32.Rfh3 (D)
White triples on the h-file and threatens Qxg8+. Black is helpless.
32...Nef6 33.Qxg7+ Ke8 34.Qxf6
This pseudo-sacrifice of the queen seals the victory. If the queen is captured with 34...Nxf6, White skewers Black's king and queen with 35.Rh8+ and comes out ahead a piece.
34...R1a2
After ll.Bg5 A last desperate attempt at counterplay.
35.Rh8 Rxe2+ 36.Kf3 Mate is inevitable. 1-0
(D8) Adams - Torre, New Orleans 1920 [C62]
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 exd4 4.Qxd4 Nc6 5.Bb5 Bd7 6.Bxc6 Bxc6 7.Nc3 Nf6 8.O-O Be7
9.Nd5 Bxd5 10.exd5 O-O 11.Bg5 (D)
White has secured a considerable advantage in space. His pieces are occupying five ranks, while Black is confined to three. The extra space gives White's pieces greater mobility. The difference in the two bishops is particularly striking.
11...c6
Black attempts to break this stranglehold by changing the pawn structure. A better option is to attack the bishop with 11...h6, setting up a simple combination should the bishop retreat to h4: 12.Bh4 Nxd5, winning a pawn.
12.c4
White fully intends to maintain a pawn on d5, preventing Black from activating his bishop along the a3-f8 diagonal.
12...cxd5 13.cxd5 Re8 14.Rfe1
White takes the first step in activating his rooks: occupy an open file.
14...a5
Black moves the a-pawn to free his rook from defensive duty, but moving it one space forward to a6 is preferable as the pawns would stay connected.
15.Re2 Rc8?
A mistake. Black should remove any possibility of a back-rank mate by playing 15...h6.
16.Rae1
The second step is now complete: White doubles his rooks on the open file. Black is now in grave danger. If White captures on f6, Black will be forced to take back with his g-pawn, exposing his king.
16...Qd7 (D)
(D8) Adams - Torre 1920 Black moves the queen off the back rank to coordinate his rooks and guard against the immediate threat. However, Black's back-rank weakness still remains.
17.Bxf6
This initiates a winning combination featuring a series of queen offers based on the threat of a back-rank mate.
17...Bxf6
Black has an interesting alternative in 17...gxf6. Exercise D8-1: If 17...gxf6, White can try to win material with 18.Rxe7. Does this work?
18.Qg4!
White offers his queen in an attempt to deflect Black's queen away from its protection of e8.
18...Qb5
Naturally, 18...Qxg4 allows a forced mate: 19.Rxe8+ Rxe8 20.Rxe8#.
19.Qc4
A second attempt at deflection.
19...Qd7
Black must maintain his queen on the a4-e8 diagonal.
20.Qc7!
Yet another attempt to force Black's queen off the diagonal. This is the most striking of the three queen offers as White's queen plants itself directly in Black's face. Still, White's queen cannot be touched.
20...Qb5 (D)
Despite White's best efforts, Black's queen still occupies the a4-e8 diagonal. White must find a new idea to avoid repeating moves.
21.a4!
The key move. Exercise D8-2: What happens if White plays 21.Qxb7 in yet another attempt at deflecting Black's queen?
21...Qxa4 22.Re4
This follow-up move is essential. If White resumes his attempts at deflection with 22.Qxa5, Black simply plays 22...Qd7 23.Qc7 Qb5, repeating moves.
22...Qb5 23.Qxb7 (D)
Black's queen has run out of squares; it can no longer protect e8. 1-0 (D9) Nakamura - Fluviá Poyatos, Barcelona 2007 [D80]

30.Bg3 Bxf3+ 31.Kh3 Bg4+ 32.Kh4 Qxe3 (D)
(D9) Nakamura - Fluviá Poyatos 2007 The first impression is that White's king is in serious danger, but a closer examination reveals that Black's threat of ...Qg5+ can be easily parried. Black has three pawns for a bishop, but his pawns are on the queenside and are not useful in attacking White's king.
33.Qb5 Qxd4 34.Qe5
White centralizes his queen and offers a trade. Black has no immediate checks.
34...Qd8
A queen trade is out of the question, for White's bishop pair will easily dominate Black's pawns in an endgame.
35.Rd2
The rook cannot be captured because of White's mate threat on c7.
35...Bd7
Black's pieces are forced to retreat even further.
36.Rd4
This move keeps control of the game and guarantees equality. However, 36.Rxd7 would generate winning chances as White's bishop pair is superior to Black's rook.
36...e6+ (D)
After 39...JU7 Black finally gets in a check. White's king has the choice of advancing or retreating.
37.Kxh5
The king fights back. White is not afraid to capture this pawn; his pieces are well coordinated and can control Black's key attacking squares.
37...Be8+?
The fact that White's king is wide open with no pawn cover mesmerizes Black into believing that he is winning. The more realistic course is to settle for a repetition with 37...Qe8+ 38.Kh4 (38.Kh6 Qf8+) 38... Qd8+ 39.Kh5 Qe8+.
38.Kh6
White's king continues to move up the board. The lack of communication between Black's queen and rook, coupled with White's control of key lines of attack, ensures that the king will be safe.
38...Qe7
Black searches for a checking square...
39.Rf4
...and White calmly shuts him down.
39...Bf7 (D)
Black shields the f8 square and prepares to check White's king.
40.Qf6
With one final move to make before time control, White misses a clear win. Exercise D9-1: After 39...Bf7, find a winning continuation for White.
40...Qf8+ 41.Kh7 Kb8 42.Rf2 e5
Black is probably quite frustrated at not finding a way to checkmate a king that appears to be defenseless. He misses the opportunity to force a draw by repetition, here and on the previous move, with 42...Rg6 43.Bxg6 Bg8+ 44.Kh8 Bf7+. As a result, White now reaps a full point, an apt reward for coordinating his pieces well in defense.

(D10) Wang Hao - Timofeev 2007
43.Qxe5
Black's queen cannot defend the mate threat on c7 without surrendering the bishop on f7. 1- 0 (D10) Wang Hao - Timofeev, Moscow 2007 [B30]
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 d6 4.O-O Bd7 5.Re1 Nf6 6.c3 a6 7.Bf1 Bg4 8.d4 cxd4 9.cxd4
d5 10.e5 Ng8 11.e6 Bxe6 12.Rxe6 fxe6 (D) White has sacrificed an exchange and a pawn to disrupt Black's pawn structure. He still retains his bishop pair and can target the e6-pawn at the appropriate time. This square is difficult to defend as Black lacks a light-square bishop. The position is dynamically balanced: superior structure versus greater material.
13.Qb3
A multi-purpose move. The immediate point is to make Black choose how to defend the b7- pawn.
13...Na5
Black finds the best reply but has to decentralize his knight. Protecting the pawn with 13...Rb8 or 13...Qc7 gives White a powerful attack with 14.Bf4. As for 13...Qd7, White has the knight maneuver Nc3-a4-c5 which, together with Bf4, exploits Black's weak dark squares on the queenside. Exercise D10-1: In the variation 13...Qd7 14.Nc3, Black can stop Na4 with 14...b5. What then?
14.Qe3
White's queen has gained a tempo on its way to the e-file. With his queen on e3 and Black's knight no longer on c6, White controls the d4 square. If White had played directly to the e-file with 13.Qe2, Black could have put pressure on White's d-pawn with ...g7-g6 and ...Bf8-g7.
14...Rc8 15.Nc3 Qd6 16.g3 g6 17.Bh3
White carries out the most direct plan for applying pressure to e6.
17...Bh6 18.Qe2 Rc6? (D)
After 18...Ec6? Black chooses to defend e6 but places his rook on an awkward square. Black should abandon the pawn and focus on counterplay. To this end, trading bishops immediately with ...Bxc1 will make it easier to play natural developing moves.
19.Bg5!
This gives White a clear advantage, as it hampers the development of Black's g8-knight.
19...Kf8
Trading bishops on g5 will simply grant White quicker access to e6: 19...Bxg5 20.Nxg5 Nf6
21.Nxe6.
20.Re1 Kg7 21.Bxh6+ Nxh6 22.Bxe6
The e6-pawn falls as expected. Furthermore, both black knights are temporarily out of play.
22...Re8
Giving up the queen to break White's control of e6 is insufficient as White will come out a pawn ahead: 22...Qxe6 23.Qxe6 Rxe6 24.Rxe6 Nc6 25.Nxd5.
23.Nxd5
White is in firm control. His pieces are well centralized while Black's are not. Both of Black's knights are on the rim, while his e8-rook is stuck behind the e7-pawn.
23...Ng4 24.Qd2
White attacks the unprotected knight on a5.
24...Nf6?
Black attempts to make an indirect trade of the a5-knight for White's d5-knight. He should play 24...Nc4 instead, after which White's advantage would not be so great.
25.Qxa5 b6 (D)
After 16...g5 abed e 1 g h (D11) Aronian - Kamsky 2008 Black relies on chasing White's queen off the fifth rank in order to regain his piece with ...Nxd5. However, he misses White's reply.
26.Nxf6!
This intermediate move preserves the extra piece, as White is threatening to regain the queen with Nxe8+ forking Black's king and queen.

16.hxg3 g5 (D)
Control of the center is often established by occupying the center with pawns. White has achieved an ideal center with two pawns abreast on the fourth rank. These pawns are ready to advance further and gain even more space. Black, on the other hand, is reduced to token expansion on the flanks.
17.d5 Na5 18.Nd2 e6 19.c4
White strengthens his pawn structure and ensures that he retains control of the center. After 25.fxe5
19...e5 20.Bh5
By blockading Black's h-pawn, White restricts the number of pawn moves at Black's disposal. The pressure applied to f7 is an added benefit which will come into play when the f-file is opened.
20...O-O 21.f4
White attempts to force open the f-file and activate his rooks.
21...Kg7 22.Nf3 exf4 23.gxf4 g4
Black avoids opening the f-file, but surrenders a massive central pawn majority to White.
24.Ne5 Bxe5
This is the only way for Black to avoid losing his g4-pawn, but it allows White to open the f- file after all.
25.fxe5 (D)
White's center pawns look quite menacing. Even without advancing farther, they exert significant pressure on Black's position by controlling four squares on the sixth rank.
25...Rce8 26.Bf4 Bc8 27.Rc3
White executes a rook lift to enable a quick crossover to the kingside.
27...Kh7 28.Bh2
This clearance move is the logical sequel to the rook lift. White moves his bishop out of the way to allow both rooks to join the action.
28...Kg7 29.Rf6 Re7 30.Bf4 (D)
After 30.M4
[diagram]
(D12) Harper - Zuk 1971 White's control of the board is striking. He can continue to improve his position, while Black has no choice but to watch and wait. He is totally suffocated.
30...Rh8
The threat to h6 must be defended.
31.d6 Rb7 32.Rg3 Kf8 33.Bxh6+ (D)
Black resigns in view of 33...Ke8 34.e6 Rh7 35.Rxg4. 1-0 It is stunning to see the two center pawns still standing side by side, having worked their way two ranks further up the board. (D12) Harper - Zuk, Burnaby 1971 [E97]
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nf3 O-O 6.Be2 e5 7.O-O Nc6 8.d5 Ne7 9.Bd2
Nh5 10.Rc1 c5 11.g3 Nf6 12.a3 Ne8 13.Ne1 f5 14.exf5 Nxf5 15.Bf3 b6 16.Bg2 Nd4 17.f4 Bf5 18.fxe5 Bxe5 19.Bh6 Bg7 20.Bxg7 Nxg7 21.Nd3 (D) Although White's knight is centralized, it does not have much attacking potential. Black's d4-knight, on the other hand, is two ranks further up the board and within striking distance of White's king. A better alternative for White is21.Nf3, challenging Black's d4-knight.
21...Qg5
Black's queen threatens to dominate the dark squares. This is particularly effective now that the dark-square bishops have been traded.
22.Nf4 Rae8 23.Qa4
Unable to penetrate the kingside, White's queen attempts to infiltrate Black's position via the queenside. However, this queen is now separated from the rest of White's pieces.
23...Qe7 (D)
Black calmly retreats his queen to protect the a7-pawn without losing any of its influence on the kingside.
24.Nb5?
A second white piece moves over to the queenside, but this gives Black free rein on the opposite wing.
24...Nxb5
There is no need for Black to initiate the knight trade. He can start an immediate kingside expansion with ...g6-g5 instead. After 29".Ne4 After 35...h5 (D13) Karpov - Unzicker 1974
25.Qxb5 Qe3+ 26.Kh1 g5 27.Nh3 Bd3 28.Rxf8+ Rxf8 29.Rg1 Be4 (D)
This powerful pin severely restricts the mobility of White's pieces.
30.Qd7
White's queen attempts to rush over to defend.
30...Bxg2+ 31.Rxg2 Qe4
An even more powerful pin.
32.Ng1
White frees the h3 square for his queen. If the knight moves to f4 instead, hoping to open the g-file and threaten mate on g7, Black's queen can come to the rescue: 32.Nf4 gxf4 33.gxf4 Qb1+ 34.Rg1 Qxb2.
32...h6 33.h4 Rf2 34.Qh3 g4 35.Qh2 h5 (D)
Nothing can move; White's pieces are buried alive. White will soon run out of pawn moves and it will all be over.
36.b4 Rf1 37.b5 Kh8 38.a4 Kh7 39.a5 Kg8 0-1
(D13) Karpov - Unzicker, Nice Olympiad 1974 [C98]
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 8.c3 O-O 9.h3
Na5 10.Bc2 c5 11.d4 Qc7 12.Nbd2 Nc6 13. d5 Nd8 14.a4 Rb8 15.axb5 axb5 16.b4 (D) After 24.Ba7 White fixes the b5-pawn and prevents Black from gaining space on the queenside. Black's minor pieces appear to be tripping over themselves. They lack good squares and have no room to maneuver.
16...Nb7
This does not improve the position of the knight, as it has nowhere useful to go to from b7.
17.Nf1 Bd7 18.Be3 Ra8 19.Qd2 Rfc8 20.Bd3 g6 21.Ng3 Bf8 22.Ra2 c4
Black closes the position because he fears that a pawn trade will weaken the b5-pawn. However, if he wishes to adopt this strategy, it would be better to first trade a pair of rooks with
22...Rxa2 23.Qxa2 c4. With the queen as the lead piece on the a-file, Black's chances of
contesting the file are improved.
23.Bb1 Qd8 24.Ba7 (D)
It is extremely difficult for Black to dislodge this bishop. Although the bishop does not attack a specific target, it severely cramps Black's position.
24...Ne8 25.Bc2 Nc7 26.Rea1
White doubles on the a-file to ensure that his bishop can remain on a7. Having now closed down the queenside, White will turn his attention to the other side of the board.
26...Qe7 27.Bb1 Be8 28.Ne2 Nd8 29.Nh2
While Black shuffles his pieces without a clear plan, White prepares to open another front. (D13) Karpov - Unzicker 1974
29...Bg7 30.f4
White initiates the long-awaited kingside expansion.
30...f6
This dooms Black to total passivity. Although trading with 30...exf4 appears to open the position in White's favor, this trade would at least help Black to secure some active play.
31.f5 (D)
The pawn continues to advance and gain space on the kingside. The extra space allows White the luxury of maintaining tension until he can maneuver his pieces to their most effective squares.
31...g5?
Black tries to hold on by locking the pawns. As a result, he loses all flexibility and is still unable to prevent White from infiltrating his position.
32.Bc2
White realizes that the way into Black's position is along the h5-d8 diagonal, and starts maneuvering his bishop accordingly.
32...Bf7 33.Ng3 Nb7 34.Bd1 h6 35.Bh5 (D)
White hopes to make progress by removing one of the pieces that can protect Black's b5- pawn. White will then focus on the queenside again and target b5. After 43.Bg6
35...Qe8 36.Qd1 Nd8 37.Ra3 Kf8 38.R1a2 Kg8 39.Ng4 Kf8
Black avoids a trap: 39...Bxh5 40.Nxh5 Qxh5? 41.Nxf6+ loses the queen.
40.Ne3 Kg8 41.Bxf7+ Nxf7 42.Qh5 Nd8 43.Qg6 (D)
This queen penetration decides the game. White threatens to back his queen up with Ng4 and Nh5. The pressure on the f6- and h6-pawns will force Black to trade queens on g6, freeing the f5 outpost for a white knight.
43...Kf8 44.Nh5
If Black avoids trading queens with 44...Qe7, White will switch play over to the queenside again, starting with Bb6, and take control of the a-file. Exercise D13-1: After 44...Qe7 45.Bb6, Black can try to challenge the a-file with 45...Rxa3
46.Rxa3 Ra8. Does this work?
Black resigns, as he is being squeezed on both sides of the board. We are reminded of Dr. Tarrasch's famous saying that a cramped position contains the germ of defeat. 1-0 (D14) Artemiev - Hráček, Skopje 2019 [D32]
1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e3 e6 5.d4 d5 6.cxd5 exd5 7. Bb5 cxd4 8.exd4 Be7 9.0-
0 O-O 10.Ne5 Bd7 11.Bg5 Rc8 12.Re1 Re8 13.Rc1 a6 14.Bxc6 Bxc6 15.Qf3 Qd6 16.h3 (D)
White has a strong knight on e5 against a bad bishop on c6. He has good development and is exerting pressure on f7, preventing Black from moving his knight. After 21.jif4 (D14) Artemiev - Hráček 2019
16...Bd8?
Black wants to move his rook back to f8, but cannot do so immediately as 16...Rf8 loses the a6-pawn to 17.Nxc6 bxc6 18.Qe2 with a double attack on a6 and e7. However, this move is ill- advised as it breaks the communication between Black's rooks.
17.Re3 Rf8 18.Rce1 Qb4 19.Qf5
White improves the position of his queen with a tempo on Black's rook.
19...Ra8
Black's rooks are back on their previous squares. White's centralized rooks stand in stark contrast to their counterparts.
20.Rd1
White chooses to protect his d-pawn but misses an amazing destructive sacrifice: 20.Bh6 gxh6 21.Qf4. The weakness of Black's dark squares and the fact that his dark-square bishop is poorly placed give White an overwhelming advantage.
20...Ne8
Exercise D14-1: After 20.Rd1, how does White win if Black takes the b2-pawn?
21.Bf4 (D)
White retreats his bishop and regroups in preparation for the final attack. Black's lack of development is striking. Even Black's queen is on the wrong side of the board.
21...Nf6 22.Rg3 Kh8 23.Rdd3
White moves his second rook up to the third rank. It is not often that one sees two rook lifts in the same game!
23...Be8
Black is helpless. He has nothing better than to resort to passive defense.
24.a3
Once again, White misses a destructive sacrifice, this time featuring a direct capture. Exercise D14-2: After 23...Be8, what should White play?
24...Qxb2 (D)
This move gives White another chance to carry out the same destructive sacrifice, but this time in a more spectacular manner.
25.Rxg7! Kxg7 26.Rg3+ Kh8 27.Nxd5!
The point. White undermines the knight's protection of g8.
27...Nxd5
Exercise D14-3: After 27.Nxd5, Black can try to defend with 27... Ng8. How should White continue?
28.Bh6 Bf6 29.Qxf6+! 1-0

ANSWERS -COORDINATION/CONTROL
Rotlewi-Rubinstein 1907 Exercise D1-1: If White chooses to block with 21.Ne4 instead, how does Black proceed? (D) Answer: Black plays 21...Qh4, threatening mate on h2. White now has two choices: 1) 22.h3 Rxd3!, undermining the protection of the knight. After 23.Qxd3 Bxe4, White's queen cannot guard all the threats: a) 24.Qxe4 Qg3 25.hxg4 Qh4#; b) 24.Qb3 Be3 interferes with White's defense of the third rank and forces him to give up his queen in light of 24...Qxh3#. 2) 22.g3 Qh3 (threatens ...Rxd3) 23.Bc2 Rxc2 24.Qxc2 Bxe4+ with mate to follow. D. Byrne-Fischer 1956 Exercise D2-1: Show how Black meets 18.Bxe6. (D) Answer: This leads to a smothered mate with 18...Qb5+ 19.Kg1 Ne2+ 20.Kf1 Ng3+ 21.Kg1 Qf1+ 22.Rxf1 Ne2#. Exercise D2-2: After 37.Ke1 (D), find a mate in four moves for Black. There are two ways to do this. After 19.Bf3 (variation) Answer: 1) 37...Re2+ 38.Kd1 Bb3+ 39.Kc1 Ba3+ 40.Kb1 Re1#; 2) 37...Bb3 38.Qh8+ Kxh8 39.Nxg6+ Kg7 40.Nf8 Bf2#. Bareev-Kasparov 1991 Exercise D3-1: If White tries to defend with 19.Bf3, how does Black win? (D) Answer: Black sacrifices the exchange with 19...Rxf3 20.gxf3 Qg5+ 21.Kh1 Bxh3 22.Rg1 Qh4 (threatens ...Bf1#) 23.Rg2 Bxg2+ 24.Kxg2 Qxf2+ and the mating attack with queen and bishop cannot be stopped.

(D14) Artemiev - Hráček 2019 Answer: Amazingly, Black can trap White's queen with 32...Rxd6 33.Qxd6 Rd7. Note the importance of the g7-bishop, which takes away the e5, f6, and h6 squares from the queen. Exercise D4-2: If White promotes the pawn after 61...Nd4 (D), find a forced mate for Black. Answer: 62.a8Q Ne2+ 63.Kf1 Nf4+ 64.Kg1 f2#. Bai-Liren 2017 Exercise D5-1: If 25.Kf4 Rxf2+ 26.Kxe4, can you find a mate? (D) Answer: 26...Bf5+ 27.Kd5 Rd8+ 28.Nd7 Rxd7+ 29.Bd6 Rxd6#. Adams-Torre 1920 After 21.Bxb7? (variation) Exercise D8-1: If 17...gxf6, White can try to win material with 18.Rxe7. Does this work? (D) Answer: No. White is relying on Black's playing 18...Rxe7?, after which 19.Rxe7 Qxe7 20.Qg4+ would pick up the rook on c8. Instead, Black has a surprising reply in 18...Qxe7!. Now 19.Rxe7?? actually loses to 19...Rc1+
20.Ne1 Rxe1+ 21.Rxe1 Rxe1#.
Exercise D8-2: What happens if White plays 21.Qxb7 in yet another attempt at deflecting Black's queen? (D) Answer: 21...Qxe2! wins a rook. White cannot recapture. If 22.Rxe2, then 22...Rc1+ and the tables have been turned; it is now Black who delivers a back-rank mate, using an x-ray attack:
23.Ne1 Rxe1+ 24.Rxe1 Rxe1#.
Nakamura-Fluviá Poyatos 2007 Exercise D9-1: After 39...Bf7, find a winning continuation for White: (D) After 39..JU7
[diagram]
After 14...b5 (13...Bd7 variation)
[diagram]
(D14) Artemiev - Hráček 2019 Answer: White wins with 40.Rxc4, setting up a triple attack on the c7-pawn. If 40...c5 for example, then 41.Rc3 Rg4 42.Qb8+ Kd7 43.Rd3+ Rd4 44.Rxd4+ cxd4
45.Qxa7+ and White is a clear piece ahead.
Wang Hao-Timofeev 2007 Exercise D10-1: In the variation 13...Qd7 14.Nc3, Black can stop Nc3-a4 with 14...b5. What then? (D) Answer: White sacrifices his knight with 15.Nxb5. After 15...axb5 16.Bxb5, White threatens to attack the pinned piece with Ne5. Black's best defense is 16...Rb8, but 17.Bxc6 Rxb3 18.Bxd7+ Kxd7 19.axb3 leaves Black down a pawn and without any development. Exercise D10-2: Can Black regain the piece with 27...Rxe6 instead? (D) After 27...Exe6 (variation)
[diagram]
Answer: No. After 27...Rxe6, Black runs into a pawn fork: 28.Rxe6 Qxe6 29.d5. Black cannot escape with ...Rc1+ or ...Qe1+ because the white queen on d2 controls both squares. Nor does pinning the pawn along the d-file help, as White's knight protects his queen. Karpov-Unzicker 1974 Exercise D13-1: After 44...Qe7 45.Bb6, Black can try to challenge the a-file with 45...Rxa3
46.Rxa3 Ra8. (D) Does this work?
Answer: No. White wins a piece with 47.Rxa8 Nxa8 48.Bxd8. The black queen is overworked: it cannot recapture on d8 without abandoning the protection of g7. Artemiev-Hráček 2019 Exercise D14-1: After 20.Rd1 (D), how does White win if Black takes the b2-pawn? After 23...Be8 After 27...Ng8 (variation)
[diagram]
(D14) Artemiev - Hráček 2019 Answer: If Black plays 20...Qxb2, White wins with a long forcing sequence in which every one of his pieces is involved: 21.Rb1 Qa3 22.Nxc6 bxc6 23.Ne4 (discovering an attack on the queen)
23...Qxa2 24.Nxf6+ Bxf6 25.Bxf6 gxf6 26.Rg3+ Kh8 27.Qxf6#.
Exercise D14-2: After 23...Be8, what should White play? (D) Answer: The destructive sacrifice 24.Rxg7 is deadly. After 24...Kxg7 25.Nc6 Bxc6 26.Rg3+ Kh8
27.Be5, mate will soon follow, for example 27...Qe7 28.Qg5 Rg8 29.Qxg8#.
Exercise D14-3: After 27.Nxd5, Black can try to defend with 27...Ng8. How should White continue? (D) Answer: White sets up a bishop check on e5 by removing the f7-pawn as a potential blocker:
28.Nxf7+! Rxf7 29.Be5+ Nf6 30.Nxf6 Bxf6 31.Qxf6+ Rxf6 32.Bxf6#.
Glossary
GLOSSARY
Active defense: When the defender chooses to employ a counterattack as a defensive technique rather than set up passively and attempt to cover his weaknesses. Active piece: A piece that is developed and is actively participating in the conduct of the game. Active pieces provide the basis for attack. Advantage, material: A preponderance in piece value of one side over another. See point count. Advantage, permanent: An advantage in material or pawn structure. Such advantages tend to be lasting. Advantage, positional: An advantage in time, space, mobility, pawn structure, or the control of critical squares. Advantage, temporary: An advantage that may gradually disappear during the course of a game, such as a lead in development. Back rank: The first rank for each player. The back rank becomes vulnerable late in the game if the rooks do not provide adequate coverage. Backward pawn: A pawn that constitutes the base of a pawn chain and whose forward movement is controlled by one or more enemy pawns on adjacent files. It is weak because it cannot be protected by other pawns. The weakness is significant only when it is subject to a frontal assault. Bad bishop: A bishop that is hemmed in by its own pawns. This occurs as the result of pawns on the color of the bishop's diagonal being immobilized by enemy pawns or pieces. Base of a pawn chain: The rearmost pawn in a chain is referred to as the base. It is the weakest link because it is not defended by another pawn. Battery: A lineup (on a single file or diagonal) of two or more pieces that move the same way, usually directed at a critical point in the enemy position. For example, the battery Qc2/Bd3 directs a two-piece attack against the h7 square. Bind: If a player is so constrained by enemy pieces that he finds it difficult to make useful moves, he is said to be "in a bind." See squeeze. Blockading square: The square directly in front of an isolated or backward pawn. The blockading square can also serve as an outpost square because a piece on that square cannot be chased away by pawns. Break: A pawn move that offers to trade pawns in order to increase control of space or free a cramped position. Broad pawn center: Three or four center pawns abreast. Indicates very aggressive intentions. The player facing such a center must play to restrain it and break it up. Also called "the big center." Buried piece: A piece that is hemmed in by its own pieces and pawns, and will have trouble finding a way to play an active role. Such a piece can also hinder the development of other pieces. Castle long; castle short: Castling on the queenside; castling on the kingside. Center break: A situation in which two or more pawns abreast on the fourth rank are attacked by an enemy pawn that seeks to disrupt this formation. Center fork trick: A series of moves in which one sacrifices a knight for a center pawn, knowing that the sacrificed piece will be recovered by a pawn fork and the opponent's central pawn structure destroyed in the process. Clearance move: A move that frees an occupied square for use by another one of your pieces. The new piece can put the vacated square to better use. Closed center: A center which is locked or fixed. See locked center and fixed center. Closed game: A game in which the center is closed. The piece that has the best mobility in such positions is the knight. See closed center. Combination: A precisely calculated sequence of forcing moves that leads to a permanent advantage. Compensation: What one gets in return for giving up something of value. One may sacrifice material or accept a structural weakness such as doubled pawns. Compensation for such sacrifices consists of acquiring an advantage of a different nature. Connected rooks: Two rooks on the back rank are connected when there are no other pieces between them. The power of the rooks is greatly enhanced in such situations. Consolidate: Sometimes it is necessary to "put one's house in order" before continuing with active operations. Consolidation may consist of adding extra protection to critical pawns or squares, improving piece placement, or taking care of king safety. Coordinated pieces: Pieces are coordinated when they work in concert, either to defend or to attack. They may protect each other, complement each other in attack, or supplement each other by covering a large number of critical squares. Dark-square bishop: The white bishop that starts on cl, or the black bishop that starts on f8. They always travel on dark-colored squares. Decoy: An offer of material in order to induce an enemy piece to change position. Destructive sacrifice: A type of sacrifice where you destroy the pawn cover or other piece protection around the enemy king. It usually signifies a point of no return. Development: Moving a piece out early in the opening to a square where it will play a more active role. Discovered attack: When a piece moves out of the way to expose an attack by the piece it was masking. Discovered attacks are dangerous because the piece that moves away can do so with impunity. Double attack: When a player makes two simultaneous threats, it is referred to as a double attack. It should be distinguished from a fork in that both attacks need not threaten the immediate capture of material. See fork. Glossary Doubled pawns: When two pawns of the same color occupy squares on the same file, they are said to be doubled. They are generally weak because they lack mobility. However, they can also be useful because they permit the use of an adjacent file. Draw: A tie game (neither player wins). A draw awards a half-point to each player and is scored as such when (1) there is insufficient mating material; (2) there is a stalemate; (3) a three-fold repetition of position is claimed; or (4) there is mutual agreement. Draw offer: A offer which, if accepted, ends the game and splits the point. The proper way to offer a draw is to say "Draw?" and make your move before starting your opponent's clock. You should not make a draw offer when your opponent is on the move. Dynamic play: Play is said to be dynamic when there are frequent structural changes that require a continual revision of strategy. This is usually brought about by tactical threats or significant changes in pawn structure. Exchange, the: The trade of a minor piece for a rook. The player who trades the minor piece is said to "win the exchange." Exchange sacrifice: This occurs when a player willfully gives up a rook for a minor piece in return for some form of compensation. See compensation. Expansion: Expansion increases the space that is directly under one's control. It is achieved by pushing pawns forward in an attempt to enlarge the boundaries of your territory. Fianchetto: The development of a bishop to g2, b2, g7, or b7. An Italian term that means "on the flank." Fixed center: A center which is occupied by multiple pawns and where some opposing pawns block each other. Pawn movement ispossible but not without being subject to capture. See closed center. Fixed pawn structures: Pawn structures with little or no mobility. The lack of pawn play makes it easier to predict strategy. Flag, hanging: The red flag on an analog chess clock is lifted slowly by the minute hand when a player has three minutes left to complete the moves needed to reach time control. When it reaches the final seconds, it is said to be "hanging." When it falls, the game may be forfeited. Flank attack: An attack on either the kingside or queenside. A flank attack has a greater likelihood of success when the center is closed. Fluid pawn structure: Pawn structures where further pawn movement is likely. Strategy is difficult to predict because changes in pawn structure often entail changes in strategy. Focal point: A weak square in the vicinity of the king which is targeted by the attacker and which the defender will find difficult to protect. The presence of more than one focal point makes an attack stronger. Fork: A form of double attack whereby a single piece threatens two pieces simultaneously. Frontal assault: A direct assault on an enemy pawn located on the same half-open file as one's heavy pieces. GM; IM; FM: Grandmaster; International Master; FIDE Master. Titles awarded by the Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE), the governing body of international chess competition. Good bishop: A bishop that is not hemmed in by its own pawns; a bishop with adequate scope. Half-open file: A file on which only one side has pawns. Such a file is closed to one player, open to the other. The player to whom it is open can amass heavy pieces on it and attack the enemy pawns. Hanging piece: A piece that is left unprotected and is subject to immediate capture. Hanging pieces will ruin the best strategy! Heavy pieces: The rooks and queens; major pieces. Sometimes called heavy artillery. Hypermodern strategy: A system of development that concentrates on controlling the center from a distance, rather than occupying it early with pawns. Inactive piece: A piece that is not actively involved in the conduct of the game. Initiative, the: The prerogative to control the course of action. To gain the initiative, you make a threat that your opponent must meet. To retain the initiative, you continue to operate with threats. Interference move: A move that obstructs the line of attack of an enemy piece. Isolated pawn: A pawn that stands alone without friendly pawns on adjacent files. It is generally weak because, like the backward pawn, it cannot be protected by other pawns. It is particularly vulnerable if it is subject to a frontal assault. Knight on the rim: A knight that is placed on the a- or h- files, or on the back rank. Unless it is performing aspecific task, its future is "dim." It may get trapped, or have trouble getting back to a centralized position. Light-square bishop: The white bishop that starts on f1 or the black bishop that starts on c8. They always travel on light-colored squares. Locked center: A center which is occupied by multiple pawns and the opposing pawns are interlocked. No pawn movement is possible. Magnet combination: A sequence of moves in which a winning attack is set up by drawing a piece to a vulnerable square. This is often done with a sacrifice. Also known as a Combination of attraction. Major piece: A rook or a queen. See Heavy pieces. Maróczy Bind: When White sets up a formation with pawns on c4 and e4 against the Sicilian Defense, he is said to have a "Maróczy Bind." The pawns suppress Black's freeing maneuver ...d5. This formation was introduced by the Hungarian grandmaster Géza Maróczy. Mating pattern: A move sequence in the middlegame or endgame that contains a recognized pattern for executing checkmate. Minor piece: A bishop or a knight. Glossary Minority attack: Attack by a pawn minority against a pawn majority, usually on the queenside. The idea is to force a pawn trade that leaves the opponent with a weakened pawn structure. Mobility: Being able to move. Time and space are two essential components of mobility. Open file: A file that is not occupied by pawns of either color. Major pieces have good mobility when placed on open files. Open game: Positions that are characterized by few center pawns and many open lines. They usually arise from openings where White begins with 1.e4. Long-range pieces have good mobility in such positions. Outpost: A safe square near enemy territory that is protected by one's own pieces and is subject to effective occupation. Passed pawn: A pawn that is unopposed by enemy pawns on its own file and the two adjacent files. Such a pawn is a candidate for promotion. Pawn center: Commonly refers to pawns that may occupy any of the four central squares (d4, e4, d5, e5). Pawns on adjacent files are also considered to be part of the center if they are connected to pawns that occupy these squares. Pawn chain: Two or more pawns of the same color standing adjacent on a diagonal. Only the rearmost pawn in the chain is not protected by another pawn. See base of a pawn chain. Pawn contact: Opposing pawns are in contact when they can capture each other. Maintaining pawn contact maintains the tension in a position, keeping open more options. Capturing resolves the tension. Pawn island: A cluster of pawns of the same color that is separated from the next pawn by at least one open file. The more islands, the weaker the pawn structure. Pawn storm: The action of advancing one or more pawns against the enemy king with the intent of breaking up his pawn cover. It is commonly used when the two players are castled on opposite sides of the board. Pin, absolute: A tactic whereby a piece is attacked and rendered immobile because moving it would expose the king to check. Pin, relative: A pin wherein the pinned piece may elect to move but its movement would lead to a loss of material or other unfavorable outcome. Point count: The prescribed value of each piece: Q=9, R=5, B=3, N=3, R=1. An advantage in the point count denotes superiority in material. Position: The disposition of the pieces on the chessboard at any given time. Positional mistake: A mistake that has no direct tactical consequences but still leads to a disadvantage by surrendering control of critical squares, losing time or space, or incurring structural weaknesses. Positional sacrifice: A sacrifice that yields no immediate tactical gain but still leads to a positional advantage. Quiet move: Sometimes played during an attacking sequence, aquiet move does not contain an immediate threat but sets up another, more aggressive move. Quiet moves can be the most deadly moves of all. Rating: The measurement of a player's performance, calculated by a generally accepted formula administered by an official organization such as FIDE (the Fédération Internationale des Échecs) or the United States Chess Federation (USCF). The USCF rates its players on a scale from 0 to 3000 (or more). A typical novice rating is 1000; a master rating is 2200 and higher. Redeploy: To maneuver a piece so that it has access to another square, file, or diagonal where it will be more effective. Restrain: To control the movement of enemy pieces in order to prevent them from getting active play. Rook lift: A maneuver that involves moving the rook off the back rank and up a few squares. The intent is to swing the rook over to another file so that it may assist in an attack without being impeded by its own pawns. Running: Moving the king rapidly from one sector of the board to another in order to evade an attack. Scope: The scope of a piece refers to the number of squares it has access to. A piece hemmed in by its own pawns is said to have limited scope. Sector: One way to look at the board is to divide it into three sectors: the queenside (a-, b-, and c-files), the center (d- and e-files), and the kingside (f-, g-, and h-files). Learning to focus on each sector separately will help to formulate strategy. Skewer: A tactic whereby an enemy piece that stands in front of another along a rank, file, or diagonal is attacked and thereby compelled to move. This exposes the piece behind it to capture. Space count: A numerical system whereby the number of squares that each player attacks in the other player's half of the board is counted. A square may be attacked more than once. Each time it is attacked, one point is allocated. The player who is ahead in the space count has greater mobility. Squeeze: The exploitation of a bind by gradually increasing the pressure on an opponent's position. This is accomplished by creating new threats until the defender is unable to meet them all. Strategy: Formulation and execution of a long-term plan, designed to improve one's position. Symmetrical pawn position: A position in which the pawns on both sides are on the same files. Symmetrical position: A chess position in which, if the board were to be folded in the center, all opposing pieces of the same kind would overlap. Symmetrical positions tend to lead to equality, unless the player on the move can find a way to break the symmetry advantageously. Tactic(s): A mode of action characterized by the use of threats to win material or to checkmate the opposing king. They are said to be "the means to an end" - the means to realize the culmination of a strategy. Tempo: A unit of time in chess. The plural is "tempi." The best method for gaining time is to develop with a threat. Glossary Tension: A position in which pieces and/or pawns square off against each other without capturing. In such positions, good nerves and exact calculation are essential for survival. Theoretical move, or "theory": A move recommended by one or more authorities on the theory of best opening play. Transposition: A transposition occurs when a position (usually an opening position) is arrived at through a different order of moves than normal. The player who is alert to possibilities of transposing to favorable opening positions has an extra weapon at his disposal. Trap: A sequence of moves that relies solely on tactics and frequently disregards strategic considerations. Traps usually succeed when one is not alert. They seldom work against the more experienced player. Value, dynamic: The value of a piece in a given position. This may be lesser or greater than the static value. Value, static: The given value of a piece. See "point count." Zugzwang: A situation in which the requirement to move on a player's turn can only result in a worsening of the player's position.

ROUND ONE
1. Szabo-Geller
(Catalan Opening) I have long suspected, when ever the books I have read began discussing darksquare weaknesses or an attack on the dark squares, that the subject under discussion was not only beyond my understan ding, but beyond the author's as well. "Certainly,", I would say to myself, "it must be true that the enemy dark squares will be weak if his pawns stand on light squares and he loses his dark square bishop. But if he then removes all of his pieces from the dark squares, what will be left for me to attack?" Such was my line of reasoning, until the day I realized that a weakness of the dark squares is also a weakness of the pieces and pawns on the light squares. Light square weaknesses are also possi ble, resulting in a weakening of the enemy pieces and pawns on the dark squares ---as occurred, for example, in the Geller - Najdorf game in Round 13. The point of an attack on the dark squares is that, by placing my pawns and pieces on the dark, I attack my opponent's pieces and pawns on the light. The Szabo - Geller game pro vides a clear example of the me thod of exploiting a darksquare weakness; and the combination which was possible after Black's 24th fairly begs to be included in a textbook, taking place as it does entirely on light squares.

Ng8-f6 e7-e6 d7-d5 d5:c4 Nb8-d7 a7-a6 b7-b5 Having hatched a plan to weak en the enemy dark squares, Szabo undertakes a delicate maneuver aimed at bringing about the ex change of the darksquare bishops, which will further strengthen his grip on the dark squares. 8.

Bf8-e7 Qd8:e7 Bc8-b7 c7-c5 Nd7:c5 Rb8-c8 Nd5-f6 A small but serious inaccuracy: Black removes this piece from the main theater of operations. Addi tionally, the combination 17N:b5 ab 18 b4 now becomes possible, due to the insufficiently protected rook at c8. Szabo, however, con tinues with his plan, fixing the pawns at a6 and b5 on their light squares. 16 . • Nb6 would have been much better for Black: increasing his control of c4 would have made it more difficult for White to decide. on b2-b4.

22. a2-a3 Nf6-d5
Seeing that White's position al squeeze could become very dan gerous, should he succeed in oc cupying the seventh rank or in establishing his knight on c5, Geller decides to complicate (his move also stops both threats).

25. Qd4-c5
f7-f6 e6-e5 A consistent, though rather un inspired, continuation. 25 Qa7! would certainly have been much prettier, retaining his hold on the dark squares while attacking the enemy pieces and pawns on the light squares. Black would be un able to smoke the queen out, since 25 .. Ra8 would obviously fail ag ainst 26 B:d5+; while after 25 ..

d7-d5 Nimzovich never used to ad vance his c-pawn to cS without need; he hoped that, after he gave White doubled pawns by means of the exchange at c3, sooner or later he could induce White to play d4-d5, after which he could establish his knight at c5. A lot of water has gone un der the bridge since, and the modern master puts no great stock in that far-otf prospect of capi talizing on the doubled c-pawns. Instead, the immediate counter attack on the center with every means available has become one of the standard ideas for Black in the Nimzo-Indian.

Nb8-c6 Bb4:c3 d5:c4 Qd8-c7 Today, this position has been studied as thoroughly as were the Muzio and Evans Gambits a century ago. What are the basic features of this position, and how does the evaluation of those features give rise to the further plans for both sides? The placement of White's pieces radiates a great deal of poten tial energy, which ought to be [3] converted into kinetic-White must set his center pawns in motion, activating both his rooks and his deeply-buried darksquare bishop. The most logical plan would seem to be the advance of the e-pawn, first to e4, and then to eS, to drive Black's knight from f6 and lay the groundwork for a kingside attack. Black in turn must either pre vent the e-pawn's advance or counterattack the white pawn center, which will lose some of its solidity the moment the pawn advances from e3 to e4. In this game, Reshevsky com bines both of Black's ideas to achieve a favorable disposition of his forces, while Najdorf does not put nearly enough vig or into the execution of his plan.
11. a3-a4
Of all the possible continu ations that have been used here, this one may well be the least logical: it resolves only one minor problem, the development of the queen' s bishop- and to a poor square, at that. The pawn at cS will find defenders eas ily enough, and the bishop will find itself out of the action. That outflung pawn at a4 will not be a jewel in White's posi tion either. 11.

Qd8-a5 Nd7-b6 Bc8-d7 Stahlberg decides to rid his position once and for all of the threat of a black pawn advance to a3. This move deprives the square b3 of pawn protection, but it also strengthens the po sition of the pawn at b2 and generally of the whole constel lation a3-b2-c3. The next stage of the game - roughly to move 30- consists of skillful maneuvers from both sides, inducing weaknesses, White's preparation for e4-e5 and Black's for .. d7-d5 or • . f7- f5, and mutual prevention of these breaks. 18. 19 .

Ra8-d8 Bd7-c8 Nb6-d7 Nd7-f6 Rd8-d7 Rd7-e7 The next two moves are some what unusual, both for White and for Black: Black concen trates maximum firepower against the pawn at e4, an assault which White tries to divert by threat ening to take on d6. It is en tirely characteristic that, in order to carry out this idea, White can find no better re treat square for his central ized knight at d4, the pride of his position, than back to its original square g1, since all other retreat squares would in terfere, in one way or another, with the coordination between his pieces. This seems an appropriate time to impart to the reader the sec ret of the d6-pawn in the King's Indian Defense. This pawn, al though backward on an open file, proves nevertheless a tough lit- [12] tle nut to crack, because it is so hard to reach. It might seem that nothing could be simpler than dropping the knight back from d4, but the problem is that White needs his knight precisely on d4, where it observes the squares bS, c6, e6 and fS, and neutralizes the power of the bi shop at g7. Only after White has taken precautions against all of Black's possible attacks ( ..a4- a3, . • Bc8-e6, . • f7-f5) can his knight allow itself to leave the center; but meanwhile Black has time to regroup. So the weakness of the d6-pawn turns out to be largely fictive. Modern methods of opening play allow for many such fictive weak p,awns, but it was precisely this 'permanent" weakness at d6 which so long condemned the King's In dian to the list of dubious open ings.
24. Nf3-g1
The knight will return, five moves later, to help the pawn on e4 cross the Rubicon. The pawn could have been pushed at once, but that would have given up con trol of the fS square; Black's bishop could go there, and after 24 eS BfS, White would have had to sacrifice his queen by taking the knight at f6 with his pawn - but that would win for White . The simple 24 • • de, on the other hand, would give Black excellent play. White could have taken the a pawn here, but at too great a price: White needs his darksquare bishop as much as Black does. Boleslavsky's 24th move is an invitation to White's rook to cap ture that long-disputed point at last; after 25 • • Nb6, however, Black's knight enters c4. Stahl berg's decision is most probably the correct one: before proceed ing with the siege of the d-p,awn, he exchanges off the "Indian ' bi shops. 24.

9. Geller,_Euwe
{Nimzoindian Defense) One of the tournament's best games, and the recipient of a brilliancy prize. White initia ted a powerful attack on the king by sacrificing his c4-pawn. This attack gave Geller every hope of success, provided Black held to the traditional sort of queen side counterattack. Euwe, how ever, carried out two remarkable ideas: 1) utilizing his queen side lines of communication for an attack on the king's wing, and 2) decoying the enemy's forces deep into his own rear area, with the aim of cutting them off from the defense of their king. It's a most diverting specta cle to watch White' s pieces in their frontal assault on the king, burrowing further and further, while Black is transferring his forces by roundabout routes.

A small but significant opening subtlety: Black substituted .. b6 and . . Bb7 for the more usual . . Nc6 and .. O-O; and White, who failed to notice in time to react correctly with 7 Ne2, must now spend an extra tempo preparing e3-e4. Such details should never be underestimated, but neither should they be overvalued. Occa sionally it is said that White's advantage consists of his right to the first move: should he lose a tempo, then, the advantage must necessarily pass to Black. Prac tically speaking, however, the ad vantage of playing White boils down to greater freedom in selec ting a plan to suit one's tastes; once the game has settled into its ordained track, the loss of a single tempo is not always so serious. 8.

Nc6-a5 Nf6-e8 Black retreats his knight to forestall the pin with 12 Bg5, and to be able to answer f3-f4 with . . f7-f5, blockading the king's wing. White therefore secures fS before advancing his f-pawn. It would be senseless to defend the pawn at c4 now: that pawn was doomed by White's fifth move.

ter all, piling up on the king with the combined firepower of queen, rooks and three minor pieces. Even now, White needs only two moves to transfer his rook and queen to the h-file, and then it might appear that nothing could save the black king. Euwe, however, is not easily fl ustered. Remember that in his lifetime he played more than seventy games with Alekhine, the most feared attacking player of (17) our time.
16. b6-b5!
The beginning of a remarkable plan. Clearly, any defensive ma neuvers on the kingside are fore doomed, since they involve pieces with an inconsequential radius of activity ( .. Rf7, . . Qe7, etc. ) . But Black does have another de fensive resource, and that is counterattack! The bishop at b7, the rook at c8, and the knight at c4 are all well-based; all that remains is to bring up the queen. The basis for this counterattack is Black's preponderance on the central squares. With 16 .. b5, Black reinforces the knight on c4 and opens a path for the queen to b6 . Still, one cannot help feeling that his operations are too little and too late . ..
17. Rf4-h4 Qd8-b6
Pinning White's queen to the defense of the d-pawn, Black prevents the intended 18 QhS. After 17 QhS Qb6 18 Ne2 Ne5, we get the echo-variation, with the white rook unable to get to h4.

Kg8-f7 Rf8-h8 If Black' s 16th move was the beginning of his strategic plan of counterattack, then this rook sacrifice is its fundamental tac tical stroke, with the aim of drawing the white queen still further afield and decoying it away from the c2 square, mean while attacking the king. 23 . Qh7:h8 Rc8-c2 Threatening mate in a few moves: 24 . . R:g2+, 25 • . Qc4+, etc. De tailed analysis, requiring more than just one week's time, showed that White could have saved him self from mate by finding a few "only" and very difficult mov es. First, he has to play 24 d5; if then 24. . Qb6+ 25 Kh 1 Qf2 26 Rg1 B:d5, White saves himself with
27 Re4!; and on the immediate

26 Kf1 gh, neither 27 R:h6 nor
27 R:dS: once again, the only
move is 27 Q:h6. Black would still have bishop and two pawns for his rook then, which would leave him good winning chances, considering the open position of White' s king. It goes without saying that Geller had no prac tical chance to find all of these moves over the board. [18] The analysts also showed that the . . Rf8-h8 idea was actually a little premature, and that . . Rc4 first was better. However, those who love chess will find it dif ficult to agree with this. Moves like 22 . . Rh8 are not forgotten.

Having played 11 Bb2, however, White can go ahead with his c3-c4, either at once or after the pre liminary 12 de be; so Black's re ply is not merely useful, but al most obligatory. The next phase of the struggle is defined by the new pawn structure: already it has much less to do with the tastes and preferences of the two players than it has to do with their choice of opening. White will set his f- and e pawns in motion, creating a passed d-pawn and combining the advance of these central pawns with an attack on the f-file. Black, with three pawns to two on his right wing, cannot do too much with them for the moment, since he must first battle the white bishop pair and central preponderance. 11.

from doing so. The standard ex planation -- White would be left with the two bishops, a strong ****** pawn center, and the open g file -- could hardly have de terred him, since one bishop would be blocked by its own pawns, and the pawn center is not dangerous for the moment.

A direct attack on the king would be Black's only possible counter, and it would have had very small chances of success, considering his re stricted maneuvering space: the pawn barriers hamper the mobility of his knights. Petrosian continues following his own line, figuring that as long as he has made no unsound moves, nor upset the positional balance, he will not risk finding himself in a losing position. 14 .

Of course, Black gets good compensation for the exchange: h is knight is much stronger on d5, as is his bishop, which no longer has an opponent.

So he invites 12 . . h5 , and where is the p layer who could re s i s t such temptat ion? Taimanov saw j us t in time , however , that after 12 . . h5 ? 13 h4!, it i s not Black who has the attack , at any rate . So he increases the pres sure on e4 by means of the quiet maneuver Nb8- d7-f6 , which re sults in a s l ight advantage for Black . However , White might have cast doubt on Black ' s whole s yste m of deve lopment if he had p layed something more concret e than his c lever cas t l ing idea : that being
12 d5 , cutting communicati ons be-
tween the bi shop at b7 and the knight at e4 .

Thi s re l ieves White of his main headache in the Que en ' s Gam bit Accepted , name ly : the deve l opment o f h i s queen ' s bi shop ; it also opens up the e- f i le .

By this exchange in the cen ter, B lack has opened his bish op ' s d iagonal to attack the d4 square ; short ly , he wi l l a l s o attack the pawn at e4 with rook and knight . The knight ' s position ieMn'fMt on c5 wi l l be s ecured with . . aS , and this pawn may also be pushed further : to a4 , and even to a3 . For the moment , White attacks nothing , but he doe s d ispose of a s trong center and freedom to maneuver . Look at the board : White ' s piece s and pawns occupy four ranks , and Black ' s , three , with a "no-man ' s- land" between . The se geometrical features large ly reflect the character of the opening , as the oppos ing force s have not yet come into contact . White ' s further p lans are s imple : to deve lop the bishop and the queen, to connect his rooks , pre pare an attack on the weak pawn at d6 with which Black must even tua l ly sadd le himse lf in thi s de p loyment , and keep an eye on the defense of the e-pawn . The d if fer ing ways to defend thi s pawn lead to different sys tems of p lay . Qc2 would be a handy move , but this would leave the knight on d4 en prise for a moment , which Black might be able to exploit ; if Be 3 i s played f irs t , then Black has . . Ng4 . I t i s this s ort of tempo-p lay, with i t s many com b inat ive pos s ib i l i t ie s (due to the fact that a l l of the piece s and near ly a l l of the pawns are s t i l l on the board ) , that make s the King ' s Ind ian Defense such a de l ight to i t s adherents . 9 . 1 0 . f2-f3 Nd 7 -c5 Be fore leaving for thi s tourna ment , every one of it s partici pants prepared a few new sys tems , e spec ial ly in the popu lar openings such as the King ' s Ind ian, the S i c i l ian and the Nimzo- Ind ian .

However, White still has ways of peuxpshlo, iatnind g Black ' s early e-pawn the one Keres has in mind is 5 Bg5 , a rarely-played line which is nevertheless one of White ' s most solid pos itional ideas .

Black, of course, could play 5 . . Be7 , but that sort of development for this bishop grates on a King ' s Indian player. In that case , White would have a s im ple program: 6 e3, 7 Be2 and 8 O-O with no fear of . . e5-e4, s ince houits sqidueeenhi'ss bishop is already pawn chain. Boleslavsky, who has worked steadily and with immense suc cess at improving the King ' s In dian for Black, feels himself mor ally obligated to correct extant porpeipnaironeds ; a fdori ztzyhiis game , he has ng new line in volving the sacrifice of his queen' s rook. 5 . 6 .

This means that Black has achieved something, in removing White ' s bishop while retaining his own, even at the cost of shattering his own pawns . With his last move , Black initiates his previously prepared sharp attacking line , sacrificing a rook for the attack. The attack wil l be based on the fact that the centralized knight is out of play at a8 ; the whole question is whether Black can wshorokrt upt idecisive threat s in the me it will take White to develop his bishop and get his knight back to the center.

39. Bronstein-Euwe
(Nimzoindian Defense) Generally, it makes sense to sacrifice a pawn, sometimes even a piece , in order to keep the en emy king in the center and assail it with rooks and queen. However, two general classes of such at tacks must be distinguished : in the first category, the king is kept to the e ighth rank, hemmed in by its own pawns and pieces ; whi le in the second category, the king is driven out to the sixth rank -- somet imes even to the fifth -- and attempts to find shelter on one wing or the other. ofTheth e prlaetsetnert game is an example type . The defender ' s chief resource is a cool head , and my opponent made full use of his here . At one point , I had to break off my calculations in order to ask myself : Just who is attack ing whom here? During the game, and afterwards as wel l , I was unable to shake the feeling that somewhere I had had a win. Perhaps some concrete variation did flicker momentarily through my mind , but it tarried not . . . In any event , neither I , nor the commentators ( Euwe, Naj dorf and Stahlberg) have been able to find an improvement for White, which would mean that my promising piece sacrifice was not enough for a win. Perhaps the win may yet be found in analys is ; but even if I did not get the point , I did get a lively and interesting game . 1 . d2-d4 2 . c2-c4

Bg4-f5 Both s ides have played into this l ine, which involves the sacrifice of a piece . Black weakened the long diagonal by playing 18 . . g6 instead of the more natural 18 • . fS, because he wanted the fS square kept free for his bishop ; and White is giv ing up the piece in order to get the black king out to f6 and e6 , and then assail him with all his p ieces .

28 a4, to exploit his strate gic advantage {the darks quare bi shop) would have been stronger, and possibly decis ive : his oppo nent would have had to oppose his rook.

32 • . Qc6 . , this leads to a per petual .

peActt tthis point I began to sus hat Black had started to play for the win.

Rf1 : fS All of the commentators gave this move an exclamation mark, s ince it was by now White ' s only means of forcing a draw.

40. Gligoric-Szabo
(Ruy Lopez) The prime consideration in one ' s choice of an opening plan should be the harmonious devel opment of the pieces, but some times we forget about the devel opment of the queen. Since the queen is , after all , the most important and the most valuable of the pieces , the success of the whole piece configuration may depend on how well the queen plays its part . In some openings , the move a• . mcS is important not only as pawneances ntoef ra, ttacking the enemy but also in order to give the queen an exit to c 7 , b6 or aS . This applies es pecially to systems in which the bishop is developed to e7 , thus bgolnoackli:ngf ort heexaqumpeelne,' st hotehOerr tdhoia dox Queen' s Gambit , the Chigo rin Ruy Lopez, or the Class ical Variation of the French Defense . In the game Gligoric - Szabo, the development of Black' s queen became the central theme of the opening and middlegame struggle: White maintained a clear advan tage as long as the queen was relegated to the e ighth rank, and found his game s liding down hill as soon as the queen ob tained some lebensraum. 1 . e2-e4 2 .

Game 70, Averbakh - Szabo ) , s ince the bishop is more actively posted , and the queen retains the option of developing on the d8-h4 diagonal . 9 .

Szabo departs from the theo retical continuation 10 . . O-O Q11: dNS bd142 BBg:d4 S 12e fN1:e54Bd:ce 6 13fg Q1d6S Rfe1 , which would leave White with much the freer game. 11 . Bb3-c2 12 .

So he retreats the knight first . Now the e- pawn is really threatened ; but Gligoric proceeds to refute Black' s entire opening configu ration by means of a pretty and original queen maneuver, unpinning his knight and preventing Black from castling.
13. Qd1-b1
13. 14. a2-a4 Bgb45--hb45 Thus, Black has developed all of his minor pieces wel l , holds the advanced e-pawn under obser vation, and could now play 14 . . Bg6 and cast le without giv- ing himself any pawn weaknesse s . But there i s one s ignificant piece weakness in his pos ition, and that is the queen, which is not developed , and has no good prospect of ever doing so - something which White could have attempted to exploit with 15 c4 . Whether Black takes or pushes his pawn, 16 Be4 would be White ' s reply ; and on 15 . . Bg6 , White would have traded bishops and pro ceeded with 17 Rdl . Black would then have faced some difficult problems , but 16 Be4 would not have settled the outcome of the game : 15 • • d4 16 Be4 Qd7 would pose the dilemma f or White of whether to sell his fine game for a mere pawn.

In that event , the a-pawn would have been defended , and the reply 20 . . QbS , obviously, rendered im possible ; while Vukovic ' s recom mendation of 20 . .

After the trade , Black has the better of it , since the a-pawn is weak, and the pawns at eS and f4 hem in White ' s bi shop . Summarizing the course of the struggle through the opening and middlegame , we could say that White ' s powerful and consistent play netted him an advantage , which he might have exploited with 20 Rfb1 ; on the 21st move , White might have maintained ap proximate equality, or if Black were careless, a pretty combina tion could have been played .

Coldly accurate defense ! On any other retreat, as we shall see immediately, the c-pawn would not have been defended after move 16, and the king would have stood much worse bes ide s . 13. 14 . Nc6 :d8 15 . Nd8 :b7 16 . b2 : c3 Nd3 : c1+ Nc1 : e2 Ne2 : c3 Bc8-e6 This is the sort of pos ition in which White i s lost despite his being a pawn ahead . His minor pieces are scattered , his c-pawn is weak, and his rooks are subj ect to the harassment of the beauti fully coordinated black bishops . The proper move for Black here would appear to have been 16 . . Bf5 ! , keeping White ' s rooks from the b-file , and preventing them from doubling on the c-file ; he would also be threatening a check [76] from d8 at his earliest conven ience, driving White ' s king away from its pawn. White would have had to play 17 e4, shutting off his own bishop and making it that much eas ier for his opponent . After the text, Kotov manages to keep afloat with amazing skill : for many moves , he maintains his terminally ill pawn inter vivos , and eventually pulls himself nearly even. 17 . Rh1-c1 18 . Rc1-c2

After the extra rest day they gave themse lve s with this e ighth-round game , Petro s ian went on to win three straight game s in good style (an excep t ional achievement by any s tan dard in such a strong t ourney ) ; ******* while Averbakh, though perhaps not quite so for tunate, sti l l fought with great verve in the rounds that fol lowed . In maj or tournaments , one must ration one ' s strength, not for the individual game, but for the entire event, taken as a whole. The history of chess ev ents - and that of many other sports as we ll - contains many [87] cases in which one of the parti cipants forged ahead at the out set, only to lose game after game towards the end ( and not against his most powerful opponents, ei ther) , finishing far behind the winners . ****** ******

7 Bd3 and 7 Bc4 . The former ,
aiming at quick deve lopment and a p iece attack on the kings ide , was in vogue twenty or thirty years ago , up unt i l a game be tween Botvinnik and Alekhine , in which White p layed 7 Bc4 and won a beautiful endgame . With 7 Bc4 White emphas izes that a lthough the black knight on d 5 can con s ider i t s e l f safe from pawns af ter the exchange on d4 , it is not safe from p ieces , which means i t ' s not s o we l l p laced [100] on d5 , after a l l . However , the game Kotov-Leven f ish ( 1 6th USSR Champ ionship , Mos cow 1948 ) showed an ant idote t o
7 Bc4 as we l l : B lack immediately
retreated his knight to b6 , and s tubbornly refused to p lay • • c S : d4 , which would have a l lowed White to open the d iagonal c 1 -h6 for his bi shop with the recapture e3 : d4 ( this was the mistake Kot ov made in his game with Bo l e s lavsky ) . And , s ince Wh i t e ' s bi shop re ma ined on b3 , he c ould not play b2 -b3 , so that his queen ' s bishop remained a c ons tant s ource of worry.

S t i l l , not every player could a l l ow h imse l f such a style , and not every p layer would enj oy it so . I sha l l note r ight here that , despite the draw Re shevsky obtaine d in this game , he appears to have been d i s sati s f ied with the opening , s ince in the second hal f , against S zabo , he exchanged knight s on c3 in this posit ion , and then deve l oped his bishop to e 7 .

Nb8-c6 Nf6-g4 Boleslavsky repeats the l ine Najdorf so successfully employed against Taimanov (cf. Game 28 , Round Four) , but on this occasion Taimanov eschews 8 d5 , attempt ing instead to gain the upper hand by means of 8 Be3 . However , this move is so inoffensive as to place White in the defender ' s position. Further investigation of this system has shown that by playing 8 . . Re8 , Black can practical ly force a whole series of exchanges , thereby solving his defensive problem (cf . Game 107 , Reshevsky - Najdorf) . When this game was played , that im provement had not yet been dis covered. After 8 . . Ng4 9 Bg5 , Black could play 9 • • Bf6 , of fering to trade off the dark square bishops ; after the move he actually plays , White car ries out a plan which secures him control of dS and a def i nite advantage . So Black ' s 8 . . Ng4 maneuver must be con s idered not wholly satisfactory, inasmuch as he intends to con t inue with 9 • • f6 ; the same 8 . . Ng4 would be much better if Black played it in conjunction with 9 • • Bf6 . 9 . Be3-g5

White plans to strengthen his pos ition in ap proximate ly the following fash- [108] ion: Bc 1-e3-d4 , trading bishops , Nd5 , and the rooks to d1 and c1 or else to d1 and e1 . If he is allowed to carry out all this , sooner or later Black will be forced to advance the c-pawn, after which White can success fully assail the d-pawn. Black ' s counterplay is based, first and foremost , on his bi shop-pair, which enable one some times to hold a draw even in a pawn-down endgame ; and secondly , on the shaky status of the e pawn, s ince its defender will have to reckon with the pawn on g4. Let us watch now as the two plans collide , and what comes of it .

Be7 :d6 Nc6-e7 This looks aggressive , but it turns out to be a blunder that costs a pawn. Even blunders, how ever, have their reasons some times. For this encounter, Gli goric chose a cautious opening , in which it is usually difficult to secure an advantage ; he also went in for early s implifications , resulting in a completely draw ish position. At that moment , sud denly, White began playing for a win! The logic of chess does not ptermit such things : once a posi ion of clear equilibrium has been established , it takes more than simple will-power to tip the scales . And it was not yet too late to defend the c-pawn: 15 b3 Nf5

d7-d6 Nf5 : g3 d6 : e5 There exists a widespread , and therefore dangerous , misconcep tion that the win is automatic once you are a pawn ahead . As a matter of fact , Black ' s chief ad vantage in this pos it ion lies not so much in his plus pawn, which he is still far from exploiting, as in his control of most of the center squares : d4, d5 , c5 , f4 and f5 . White has his counterchances : a queenside pawn maj ority and the d-file . How many s imilar games have been drawn because of inexact play! Smys lov, however , manages such endings with an iron hand . His plan may be divided in to the following phase s : ****** 1 . The immediate exchange of one rook, leavin9 the other to re strain White s queenside pawns and attack the c- and e-pawns . 2 . Deflecting White ' s rook to the h-f ile by the threat to cre ate an outs ide passed pawn, and then occupying the ,d-file with his own rook. 3 . Advancing the g-pawn to g4, undermining the e-pawn ' s sup port , which is the f3-pawn. 4 . Tying up White ' s pieces by attacking the e-pawn. 5 . Sending his king in to pick off the weak pawns . As we shall see, a simple win ning plan -- for a Smyslov, nat urally ! 20.

80. Taimanov-Geller
(King 's Indian) Perusal of this meaty game will acquaint the reader with two strategic ideas . As a result of the opening Black obtains the pawn configuration c5-d6-e5 ver sus c4-d5-e4 ; this ensures White greater freedom to maneuver with in his own l ines , since he has three ranks , while Black has only two . This is an abstract advan tage , of course , but it is the master ' s task to render it con crete -- that is, to find a plan wherein this wil l prove useful. It is instructive to watch as Taimanov practically clears his first three ranks of pawns en tirely, enabling him to trans fer his forces easily from one wing to the other, while most of Black ' s pieces find themselves j ostling one another on the sev enth rank, and especially on the ****** easily while eighth. And the second idea: White doub les his rooks on the b-file , but cannot turn this to account , s ince al l the good invasion squares are covered by Black' s minor pieces . White therefore stirs up some play on the other wing; harmless in itself, this play leads to the exchange of a few pieces and draws the minor pieces away from the b-file , thus al lowing White ' s rooks to invade at b7 and con clude the game within a few moves . 1 . d2-d4 2 . c2-c4 3 .

Bc8-g4 This , with the fol lowing moves , is the Smyslov System of the Grunfeld . 8 . Bc1-e3 Nf6-d7 This apparently i llogical move has its own logic and its own history. When the system first began to be played , 8 . . Nc6 was usual here ; 9 d5 would be ans wered by the bishop capttlre at f3 , for example : 10 de b5 ! , or 10 gf Ne5 11 Qe2 c6 ! Eventually, White started to get the upper hand in this ; then Smys lov (and others) began introducing re finements . This process of "lab oratory testing" resulted in the move 8 • • Nfd7 , which combines two ideas : retaining the option of • . c7-c5, and putting pressure on the d-pawn. Now, for example , q9 u.. Nb6 is threatened , and if the een leaves the d-pawn' s pro tection, then 10 . . B : f3 followed by 11. . B : d4. There have been several tries here : 9 Nd2 , or 9 Be2 Nb6 10 Qd3 followed by long castling , which leads to a double-edged game ; or T9 hee5 , or 9 d5 , or 9 Rd1 Nb6 10 Qb3 . conclus ion was finally reached that it is better to retreat the queen to b3 before the knight chases it away.

White has final ly gotten what he was after : as soon as the knight reaches cS, Black ' s game wil l be nearly hopeles s , s ince White will have an extra king side pawn, practically speaking, and must eventually convert it into a win. Nevertheless, the move played gives Averbakh a problem- like save ! 40. b5-b4 41 . Rc3-c5 Once again the rook is forced to occupy the square cS where White had wanted to place his knight. 41 .

Of 43 R : c6 , of course , there follows 43 • . ba or 43 • . a3 ! , and suddenly it is Black who wins . 43 . a2-a3 Bf5-c2 The picture has suddenly al tered : the weak b-pawn has be come strong, and the "bad" bi shop now occupies a strong pos i tion. There would be no point for White in taking the c-pawn: 44 R:c6 Rhc8 45 R : c8 R : c8 threatens 46 . . Rc4, and if White brings his king up to defend with 46 Kf3 , then 46 . . Be4+ wins for Black. If the king were at f1, let ' s say, then White could get to e3 via e2 and win. Thus , the ability to note and exploit the tiniest of nuances sometimes dec ides the out come of a game . The following maneuvers can no longer alter the result . The question arises : was the win ever possible ? And if so, when did White let it slip? On move 40, instead of Nd3,
40 ReS ! should have been played ,
not allowing Black two tempi for . .b4 and . .BfS ; then, on 40 . .b4, he could have replied 41 RaS ; or if 40 • • Rhc8 41 Nd3 , and now if 41 • .

( See diagram, next page ) Occupying d5 will be favorable for White if he can secure his knight there or if a trade of mleinavore s pieces on that square him with a tangible ad vantage .

31 . Re1 : eS 32 . Nd2-f3 d6-d5 Re7 : e5 Re8 : e5 Now the bishop on b7 is firm ly entombed , and the two d-pawns turn out to be weaker than one . Black would be more than willing to remove either of them from the board. 32 . Re5-e4 Petrosian makes one last at• tempt : an exchange sacrifice , which Kotov of course declines . 33 . Qd1-d2 a6-a5
Black has difficulty activat ing his bishops , and White has counterchances , too : a poten tial passed pawn, and control of the c-file. Black had so good a position before his 29th move that one feels impel led to speculate as to whether or not he might have had a win.

Seeing that his queenside pieces have been hemmed in, he undertakes a kingside div ersion, aimed chief ly against the possibility of g2-g4. In a later game , he castled here and held the balance ---not because his game was good , but rather thanks to his tactical skill.

e6-f5 [152] 32 . Nc3-e4 White offers the e5-pawn. I was quite tempted to take it, meeting the obvious knight check by sacrificing my queen for rook, knight and pawn. Black ' s pieces would have acquired tremendous scope, with good prospects for the further strengthening of my position. However, Reshevsky had prepared a diabolical combination in ans wer to the pawn capture : 32 • • Q : e5? 33 R : f5 , and now: a) 33 • • Q : f5 34 Nf6+ B : f6 35 R : e8+ R : e8 36 Q : e8+ Kg7 37 gf+ bQ): e333 3• 6• gQf 34 Nf6+ B : f6 35 gf ! ! g2 -- check and mate.

The minority at tack is not just an opening idea mo st frequent ly employed in the Exchange Var ia t ion ( ac tua l ly the Car l sbad Var iat ion) of the Queen ' s Gambit De c l ined , but a genera l strategic idea , which under the right c ir cumstances may be emp loyed at any s tage of the game , and not just on the queens ide . The po int of this attack is to g ive the opponent weakne sses in the sec tor where he holds a quant ita t ive pawn maj ority , and then to attack the weak pawns with pieces .

Taimanov-Giigoric (Sicilian Defense) The sacrifice of a pawn for the init iat ive is one of the most comp lex prob lems of che s s strategy -- and perhaps of its psycho l ogy as we l l . The pos itions that occur as the re sul t o f a sacr if ice are s o var ied that no genera l izat ions can pos s ib ly be made . Some grandmasters , pos ses s ing the facu lty of quick cal cu lat ion, not infrequent ly give up a pawn or two s imp ly to al ter the nature and balance of a po s it ion , even if thi s is perhap s not in their favor . I don ' t think thi s manner of playing has much of a future . I myse l f have sacr ificed , al l to l d , several dozen pawns , but st i l l I think that the ma s ter who sacrifices a pawn ought to have at least a genera l idea of the nature of the ini t iat ive he wi l l thereby obtain , and what sort of game wi l l ensue . Once in a whi le , a pawn mus t be given up , or even an exchange or a p iece , against one ' s wi l l - the po int be ing that any other course leads to a difficu l t po s i t ion . Playing Whi te , Taimanov sacr if iced a pawn in the open ing , but obtained no more of an ini t iat ive thereby than he might have obtained by keeping the same number of pawns as his op ponent . Throughout the game , White put himse lf through ago nie s trying to regain his pawn , but never quite succeeded ; even tua l ly , B lack ' s extra pawn went on to queen . 1 . e2 -e4 2 . Ng 1 - f3 3 . Bf1 -b5+ c 7 -c5 d 7-d6 The exchange of l ight square bishop s on the fourth move is part of a far-seeing s trategic idea .

Of cour s e , Ta imanov sees that his strategic plans have come a cropper : Black ha s a pawn more , with the pos s ibil ity of sett ing [199] up a powerful center , Wh i l e the white knights have no points of support .

We shal l have occas ion to compare the re lat ive strengths of queen, rook and knight again in Game 186 , Ko tov - Naj dorf . Knight s and queens comp lement each other , knight s be ing s trong in the center and around enemy pawns ; while rooks come into the ir own in the endgame , where they f ind p lenty of space for the ir s traight forward maneuvers . Proceeding from the se ideas , White ought to ut i l ize his knight s on the king s ide , with out trad ing queens , trying for some thing such as the fo l lowing : 2 4 Qg4 Qf6 2 5 Rf1 Qg6 26 Ng5 Qc2 2 7 Qf 3 , or 24 Qg4 Qc 8 25 Nf5 Qc3 2 6 N3d4 . 2 4 . 2 5 .

Qd4 : f 6 2 8 . a2 -a4 29 . a4-a5 Qc 6-f6 g 7 : f6 Rb2 -b4 The knight ' s ac tive po sit ion on fS might have been exploited for an at tac k on f 7 . For thi s purpos e , the rook a t a l wou ld have to be brought to d 7 ; the lo s s of the a- pawn would be in consequent ial , s ince the b-pawn wou ld be recovered immediate ly :
29 Rd 1 R : a4 30 Rd7 , with the
double threat 31 Nh6+ and 3 1 R : b7 . White ' s actual move , powerful though it might appear , leads , amaz ingly enough, to a diffi cul t endgame for him. 2 9 . 3 0 . Nf5 -d6 3 1 . Ra1-b1 32 . Rb 1 : b7 33 . Nd6 : b7 Rb4-f4 Re 8-b8 Rf4-a4 Rb8 : b7 In the middle of the board , supported by a pawn , one knight may some t ime s be as s trong as a rook . Here , however , on the edge of the board , the knight s cannot work at fu l l s trength , and one rook can deal succe s sful ly with two knight s . B lack ' s p lan ---to br ing up his king , drive off the knight , or e l se force the trade of both knight s for his rook --- [206) looks very dangerous indeed . Kere s ' fo l lowing maneuvers , creat ing unbreachable de fens ive pos it ions with two knight s and a pawn , without the aid of the king , are beaut iful beyond com parison . 3 3 . 34 . Nf3-d2 35 .

(Sicilian Defense) Mutual forc ing at tacking play against oppos ite -wing cas t led pos it ions is one of the sharpe st forms of the che s s s truggle . In this it is equal ly important not to throw one se l f too has t i ly in to the at tack and not to be ex c e s s ive ly concerned with the de fense of one ' s own king . The harmonious blending of attack and de fens e , based upon exper ience , knowledge and intu i t ion , i s what we f ind in thi s game be tween two mas ters of the aggre s s ive s tyle . 1 . e 2 - e4 2 .

White has a powerful ly centra l ized knight , making a good counterwe ight to the bishop on d 7 and ready to meet a queen sort ie to aS by re treat ing to b3 . Wh ite s tarted his pawn s torm f ir st , and has a lready gotten in g3-g4 and h2 -h4 ; his own k ing pos i t ion has no weakne s se s , whi le B lack ' s pawn at g6 forms a hook for White ' s advancing army to se ize upon . Whi l e Black may be start ing h i s pawn advance later than Wh ite ' s , he a lready has a l ine open agains t the enemy king . H is central ized knight is very powerful too : it a ttacks the weak l ink in White ' s pawn chain the pawn which is , in fac t , the only support of White ' s who le chain ( and very shaky , too ! ) . Black contro l s , and may soon occupy , the important square c 4 , which carries about the s ame value as the fS s quare doe s for B lac k ; meanwhile , White st i l l does not contro l one square in the immediate area of B lack ' s king . F inal ly , the powerful bi shop at g 7 may g ive rise to dan gerous c ombinat ions on the long diagona l . As may be seen , a complex po s it ion ; at the moment , it l ie s in a s tate of dynami c equa l ity .

(King's Indian) Even among the s tronge st of the contemporary master s , we s t i l l f ind the sort o f p l ayer who i s far stronger with the white p ie ce s than with the b lack. With B lack , such a player thinks about gett ing a draw from the opening move s . When he has White , certain pos i t ions inspire in h im f l ight s of fancy , and a de s ire to win at any cost ; when he has Black , the same po s i t ions seem to ins p ire nothing but bore dom, and ca lcu lat i ons aimed at "equa l i z ing" .

For thi s game G l igoric came as c lo s e to the ma in l ine as he eve r did in the cour s e of the tournament , but he gave it a different trea t ment , more l ike a Queen ' s Gam bit : deve lop ing the bi shop at e2 , he traded o f f the center pawns so as to l eave Black an i s o lated dS-pawn .

Heavy-p iece f i ght ing fo r an i s o lated pawn is one o f the cen tra l e l ement s of pos it iona l p lay . Much more i s invo lved than the s imp le formula : "White at tack8 twice , Black defend s twice - and a draw is the outcome" . Woven int o the strugg le are such mo t i f s as : p inning the i so lated pawn ( should the heavy p ieces defend it from beh ind ) , a sud den switch t o an at tack on the king , or an at tempt to occupy the seventh rank at s ome point when the heavy p ieces are t ied to the de fense of the i s o l ated pawn . I s o lated pawn end ing s were p layed with great ski l l by the c la s s ic is t s Lasker , Capab lanca and Rubinstein.

172. Boleslavsky-Taimanov
(Queen's Indian Defense) Doe s White ge t the advantage from his right to the f irst move ? Every che s sp layer asks himself that que s t ion, and the answer i s not eas i ly discovered . One is forcefu l ly reminded in thi s connec tion of Vsevo lod Rau zer , one of our mo st noted mas ter- theore t ic ians , whose motto was , " 1 e2-e4 ! , and Whit e wins" . He was probab ly j oking when he said that , but every j oke con tains its share of truth . This conviction that moving the king ' s pawn f ir s t gave White the bet- ter of it , whi l e 1 d2-d4 led only to a draw , inspired Rauzer to work out amaz ing ly deep and forceful attacking systems in a number of openings : the S ic i lian , French, Ruy and Caro-Kann , and many others . Later , o f course , it deve l oped that many of his (291] wins owed le s s to the obj ec tive s trength of his 1 e2-e4 than to Rauzer ' s own creative talent , the except ional ly l ogical pat tern of h i s thinking , and the accuracy of his calculati ons . Rauzer ' s Attacks and Var iat ions l ive on, and are s t i l l emp loyed to this day , even though it i s po s s ible for B lack to defend him se l f succ e s s fu l ly agains t them. So working up forc ing l ines for use in the opening battle , a fear some weapon in the hand s o f such p layers as Morphy , Chigorin , Pi l l sbury , Alekhine , F ine and Botvinnik , i s a method that works equa l ly we l l f or White or B lack . The p layer who use s a prepared forc ing l ine may very we l l run into a f orced re futation, as in deed happened in some games from the pre sent t ournament . There i s n o playe r , pas t o r pre sent , who has never made a mis take - an axiom that ho lds j us t as true f or home analys i s as i t does for over- the -board play . Which , in turn , means that one cannot , as a ru l e , gain the advantage thi s way in the opening . S o there exi sts a d i fferent concept of opening s trat egy , which may briefly be summarized as f o l l ows : that it is not nec es sary to make the very be st move s - on ly good ones . This was the creat ive atti tude o f Lasker and Capab lanca , for examp le , and i t is Smys lov ' s too . The advantage o f the open ing , in this cas e , is unders t ood to be the right to choose a sys tem o f deve lopment more suited to the White p layer ' s taste , and which give s him the greatest pos s ible l iberty to express his creat ive abi l i ty . Stat i s tics - a sound approach to the s tudy of mas s phenomena - show that White ' s opening advan tage i s qui te real . In the var ious eras of his tory , in every strong tournament for which rec ord s were kept , White he ld a per s i s tent edge in the number of wins . Thi s advantage of White ' s should be cons idered as a ten dency , which manifests itself in the course o f dozens or hun dreds o f game s , but which has no bearing on the outcome o f any part icular game . I t wou ld be tremendous ly intere s t ing to ex- amine this tendency in hi stori cal cro s s - s ec t ion : has the per centage of games won by Wh ite increased or decreased by c om parison with what it was , say , 2 0 , 50 or 100 years ago ? One pecul iar feature should be noted : the stronger the tournament , the weaker the inf luence o f the ad vantage of the f irst move . As examp l es to demons trate this , one may c ite the 1948 Wor ld ' s Cham pionship Match-Tournament , the 1 9 5 1 World ' s Champ ionship Match ( in which White won f our game s and Black s ix ) , and a few other events . Does this mean that even tua l ly the right of the f irst move wi l l g ive no advantage at a l l ? Time wil l te l l . • • In thi s game , the reader wi l l f ind a sample of Bo les lavsky ' s we l l-prepared and accurate ly calculated opening play , f o l l owed by a natural trans it ion into a combinat ive midd l e s tage , and then an interest ing endgame which i s a win f or White . In conc lu s i on, we have a witty counter combination by Taimanov . 1 . d2-d4 2 . c2-c4 3 .

(Ruy Lopez) Why i s it that today - as com pared to ten years ago , let ' s say - s o few masters wi l l go in for f ierce combinat ive at tacks , with piece sacrifice s ? More than any other reason, it i s because the art of combinat ive defense the se days has reache d such a high leve l that in the he at of the bat t le it occas iona l ly become s d i f f icul t to determine who i s at tacking whom. Of course it ' s fun to crumble the defense s of an opponent ' s king move by move , to create irre s is t ib le threat s , and to wind up the game with a mat ing at tack . But how sad it can be to end up minus both piece and attack, to s it and wonder : "How d id a l l thi s happen? Where d id I go wrong ?" Thi s i s , roughly , the psycho log ical backdrop of the Ge l le r - Taimanov game ; but at the very end , fortune favored the brave . 1 . e2-e4 2 . Ng 1 - f 3 3 .

[323] In some openings - A lekh ine ' s De fense , f or examp l e , or the Grunfe ld - B lack moves an un protec ted p iece into the center to induce the hypertrophied ad vance of White ' s pawns , intend ing to attack them lat e r . Ge l ler here executes a s imi lar idea in the midd legame . He is trying to induce Wh ite ' s pawns to advance to f4 and t o b3 , which he soon acc omp l i she s . Later , he wi l l work up an attack against the pawn at b3 , f or which purpose he wi l l set h i s rooks on the b- f i le and his knight at c 5 , support ing the a pawn ' s advance to a4 . The reader should note that Petro s ian was unable t o carry out the same idea on ly because he had no p iece that cou ld contr o l the a4 square : the queen , of c our s e , is not a proper p iece for this purpo s e , and the knight need s the square c S - which , a s we saw , had be en oc cupied by his pawn . 1 5 . f 2 - f4 16 .

When champions meet Bobby Fischer's Tournament and Match Record Index to Openings List of Opponents Author's Preface The 60 games annotated in this volume were all played during 1957 through '67 and, with the exception of nos. 44 and 50, under strict tournament conditions. The notes frequently include references to additional games, occasionally presenting them in full. An interested reader will find 34 of my earlier efforts in Bobby Fischer's Games of Chess (Simon and Schuster, 1959). All of the 60 here offered contain, for me, something memorable and exciting - even the 3 losses. I have tried to be both candid and precise in my elucidations in the hope that they would offer insights into chess that will lead to fuller understanding and better play. Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to Larry Evans, friend and colleague, for his invaluable aid in the preparation of the text as well as for his lucid introductions.
ROBERT J. FISCHER
New York City

On the chessboard lies and hypocrisy do not survive long. The creative combination lays bare the presumption of a lie; the merciless fact, culminating in a checkmate, contradicts the hypocrite.
- EMANUEL LASKER
1 Fischer - Sherwin [ U.S.A. ]
NEW JERSEY OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP 1957
Too little, too late Although Sherwin makes no serious errors in the opening, he misses several equalizing opportunities. Demonstrating the technical virtuosity that is to become his hallmark, Fischer, with astonishing maturity, gradually strengthens his grip by accumulating small advantages: the better center and the two Bishops. Sherwin, meanwhile, attempts to consolidate his position - only to see his 14-year-old opponent shatter it with a thunderbolt (18 xh7). It brings to mind Alekhine's combinations, which also seemed to spring from nowhere. Sherwin, lashing back, refuses to fall. However, his defense finally disintegrates under a series of acute blows to his wobbly King.
[diagram]
3 d3 ...
This used to be my favorite. I thought it led to a favorable variation of the King's Indian reversed, particularly after Black has committed himself with ...e6. 3 ... c6
[diagram]
Fischer-Ivkov, Santa Monica 1966 continued 4...d5 5 bd2 d6 6 g2 ge7 7 O-O O-O 8 h4! with chances for initiative.
[diagram]
6 O-O O-O
More usual is 6...d5; but Black has purposely delayed placing his center Pawns. Has he a new idea in mind? 7 bd2 ... After 7 e5 d5 8 bd2 f6 9 exf6 xf6 10 e1 gives White an edge. 7 ... b8 Sherwin slid the Rook here with his pinky, as if to emphasize the cunning of this mysterious move. 7...d5 8 e1 b5 9 e5 d7 10 f1 b4
11 h4 a5 12 f4 a4 13 a3! Fischer-Mjagmasuren, Sousse Interzonal
1967, leads to double-edged play where Black's chances on the Q-side countervail White's K-side attack - but White usually comes first.
[diagram]
9 c3 b6
Not bad. But I had expected 9...b5 10 d4 cxd4! (if 10...b4 11 e5! bxc3? [11...dxe5 12 dxe5 d7 13 c4 holds the advantage] 12 exf6 cxd2 13 xd2! wins a piece) 11 cxd4 d5 with equality.
10 d4 c7?
This leads to trouble. Black should strive for counterplay by opening the c-file: 10...cxd4 11 cxd4 d5 12 e5 d7, etc. 11 e5! d5 Worse is 11... d7 12 exd6 xd6 13 e4 cxd4 14 xd6 xd6 15 f4 e5 16 xe5! dxe5 17 cxd4 winning a Pawn. The best try is 11...dxe5 12 dxe5 d7 13 e2 b7 14 h4 with a bind, but Black's game may be tenable. 12 exd6 xd6 13 e4! c4 An unpleasant choice, since it releases the pressure in the center and gives White a free hand to start operations on the K-side. However, other moves lose material: A] 13... e7 14 c4 f6 15 f4, etc. B] 13...cxd4 14 xd6 xd6 15 c4! f6 16 f4 and again the lineup on this diagonal is unfortunate. 14 xd6 xd6 15 g5! ce7? A bad mistake. Black's game is still tenable after 15...h6 16 e4 d8. 16 c2! g6 On 16...f5? 17 e2 picks off a Pawn. Had Sherwin seen what was coming, however, he might have chosen 16...g6 17 e4 c7 18 h6 d8, though 19 d2 prepares to exploit his weakened dark squares.
17 h4 f6
Apparently everything's defended now. Unappetizing is 17... d8 (17...h6 18 h5 hxg5 19 hxg6 f6? 20 e2-h5) 18 xh7! xh7 19 h5 f5 20 hxg6+ xg6 21 e5! with a bind. 18 xh7! ... Throwing a monkey wrench into Black's carefully contrived setup! As usual, tactics flow from a positionally superior game. 18 ... xh7 Not 18... xh7? 19 f4.
19 h5 h4!
The best fighting chance. Not 19... e7 20 f4 wins a clear exchange.
20 f4 d8
21 gxh4 ... 21 xb8? xg2 22 xg2 b7+ 23 f3 xb8. 21 ... b7! 22 h6! ... He's hoping for 22 xb7 xb7 and, suddenly, the initiative passes to Black despite his material deficit. 22 ... xh4 Once again, time-pressure had Sherwin burying his thumbs in his ears. Instead of trying to mix it up, Black should keep his King sheltered as long as possible with 22...g6 23 h5! g5 (if 23...gxh5 24 e2), but 24 e5 stays a Pawn ahead with two Bishops. It might still be a fight, though. 23 hxg7 xg7? Suicidal. The last hope would have been 23... d8 24 g3 h6, though 25 e2 is hard to meet (if 25...b5 26 a4 a6 27 axb5 axb5 28 a8). 24 e4! ... Threatening 25 e5+. 24 ... h5 25 e3! ... Now the Rook joins the King hunt - and it's murder. The immediate threat is 26 h3 g6 27 g3. 25 ... f5
26 h3 e8
26... g6? 27 g3.
27 e5+ ... White can pick off a couple of exchanges with 27 h6+ g8 28 xf8 xf8 29 xb7, etc. But by now I felt there was more in the offing. 27 ... f6
27... g8? 28 g3+ f7 29 g7 mate.
28 d2! f7
29 g5 e7
On 29... e7 30 h7+ is devastating. 30 xf6 xf6 31 h7+ e8 32 xf6 xh7 On 32... xf6 33 xb7 nets a whole Rook. 33 c6+ Black resigns If 33... d7 34 xe6+.
2 Fischer - Larsen [ Denmark ]
PORTOROZ 1958
Slaying the dragon Although the Sicilian, as a whole, is still the best fighting defense at Black's disposal, much of the steam has been taken out of the time-honored Dragon Variation. This is one of the key games which helped to batter its reputation. In a laudable attempt to create complications, Larsen deviates from the book on move 15. That proves to be disastrous, since his counterattack never gets started. Mechanically, routinely, Fischer pries open the h-file, sacrificing first a Pawn and then the exchange. There is an aura of the inevitable about the outcome. Here the notes are as instructive and lucid as the text, which is an object lesson in how to mount an assault against the fianchettoed King.
[diagram]
Larsen was one of the diehards who refused to abandon the Dragon until recently. White's attack almost plays itself ... weak players even beat Grandmasters with it. I once thumbed through several issues of Shakhmatny Bulletin, when the Yugoslav Attack was making its debut, and found the ratio was something like nine wins out of ten in White's favor. Will Black succeed in reinforcing the variation? Time will tell.
[diagram]
6... g4? still loses to 7 b5+.
7 f3 O-O
[diagram]
9 c4 ...
This refinement supersedes the old O-O-O. The idea is to prevent ...d5. 9 ... xd4 Just how Black can attempt to thread his way to equality is not clear. Interesting is Donald Byrne's 9...a5. The strongest reply is 10 g4 and if
10... e5 11 e2 d5? 12 g5! wins a Pawn.
10 xd4 e6
11 b3 a5
12 O-O-O b5
After 12... xb3 13 cxb3! Black cannot make any attacking headway against this particular Pawn configuration. White is lost in the King and Pawn ending, it's true, but Black usually gets mated long before then. As Tarrasch put it: "Before the endgame the gods have placed the middle game."
13 b1 b4
14 d5 ...
Weaker is 14 e2 xb3 15 cxb3 fd8. 14 ... xd5 Bad judgment is 14... xd5? 15 xg7 xg7 16 exd5 d7 17 de1 with a crushing bind. (Suetin-Korchnoi, USSR Championship prelims
1953.)
15 xd5 ... Stronger is 15 exd5! b5 16 he1 a5 17 e2! (Tal-Larsen, Zurich 1959) where White abandons the attack and plays for pressure along the e-file instead. 15 ... ac8? The losing move. After the game Larsen explained he was playing for a win, and therefore rejected the forced draw with 15... xd5 16 xg7 c3+ 17 bxc3 (17 xc3 bxc3 18 xc3 xc3 19 bxc3 fc8 renders White's extra Pawn useless.) 17... ab8! 18 cxb4 xb4+! 19 xb4 xb4+ 20 b2 fb8, etc. After 15... xd5, however, I intended simply 16 exd5 xd5 17 xb4, keeping the game alive. 16 b3! ... He won't get a second chance to snap off the Bishop! Now I felt the game was in the bag if I didn't botch it. I'd won dozens of skittles games in analogous positions and had it down to a science: pry open the h-file, sac, sac ... mate! 16 ... c7 This loss of time is unfortunately necessary if Black is ever to advance his a-Pawn. 16... b5? is refuted by 17 xa7.
17 h4 b5
There's no satisfactory way to impede White's attack. If 17...h5 18 g4! hxg4 (18... fc8 19 dg1 hxg4 20 h5! gxh5 21 fxg4 xe4 22 f4 e5 23 xe4 exd4 24 gxh5 h8 25 h6 f6 26 g7! wins) 19 h5! gxh5 (on 19... xh5 20 xg7 xg7 21 fxg4 f6 22 h6+ mates) 20 fxg4 xe4 (on
20...hxg4 21 dg1 e5 22 e3 d8 23 h6; or 20... xg4 21 dg1 xd4
22 xg4+! hxg4 23 h6 leads to mate) 21 e3 f6 (21... xd4 22 xe4 g7 23 xh5) 22 gxh5 e5 23 h6 wins. Now Black is threatening to get some counterplay with ...a5-a4. 18 h5! ... There's no need to lose a tempo with the old-fashioned g4. 18 ... fc8 On 18...gxh5 19 g4! hxg4 20 fxg4! xe4 21 h2 g5 22 xg7 xg7
23 d5 c5 24 h6+ g8 25 xg5+ xg5 26 xh7 mate.
19 hxg6 hxg6
20 g4 ...
Not the impatient 20 xf6? xf6 21 h6 e6! (threatening ... e5) and Black holds everything. 20 ... a5 Now Black needs just one more move to get his counterattack moving. But for the want of a nail the battle was lost...
21 g5 h5
Vasiukov suggests 21... e8 as a possible defense (not 21...a4? 22 gxf6 axb3 23 fxg7! bxc2+ 24 xc2! e5 25 h2 wins); but White crashes through with 22 xg7 xg7 (22... xg7? 23 h2) 23 h6! e6 (if 23...a4
24 h2 h5 25 xg6+) 24 h2 h5 25 xe6! fxe6 (25... xg5 26
xg6+! xg6 27 xc8, threatening g1) 26 xg6+ g7 27 h1, etc. 22 xh5! ... Fine wrote: "In such positions, combinations are as natural as a baby's smile." 22 ... gxh5 No better is 22... xd4 23 xd4 gxh5 24 g6 e5 (if 24...e6 25 xd6) 25 gxf7+ h7 (if 25... f8 26 xe5 dxe5 27 g1 e6 28 xe6 e7 29 xc8 xc8 30 g5 wins) 26 d3! (intending f4) should be decisive.
23 g6 e5
On 23. e6 24 gxf7+ xf7 25 xg7 xg7 26 g1+ h7 27 g2 e5 28 g6+ h8 29 g5 g7 30 xh5+ g8 31 xe6+ f8 32 f5+ ...
25 e3 d5!
A desperate bid for freedom. On 25...a4 (if 25... d8 26 h6) 26 xd6+ e7 27 d8+! xd8 28 xd8+ e8 29 c5+ mates. 26 exd5! ... Not 26 xd5 xc2! 26 ... xf7 On 26...a4 27 d6! axb3 28 dxc7 wins.
27 d6 f6
On 27... d7 White can either regain the exchange with 28 e6 or try for more with 28 h6. And on 27... xf3 28 d7, threatening d6 mate.
28 g5 b7
On 28... d7 29 d5! f7 (if 29... f7 30 e7+!) 30 xf6 wins material. 29 xf6 xf6
30 d7 d8
31 d6+ ... A mistake! 31 h6+! forces mate in three. 31 ... Black resigns
3 Petrosian [ U.S.S.R. ] - Fischer
PORTOROZ 1958
KING's INDIAN DEFENSE
Bear hug In what appear to be perfectly equal positions, Petrosian consistently finds seemingly innocuous moves which gradually overwhelm his opponent. He accomplishes his objective simply by exchanging pieces and maneuvering for victory without taking unnecessary risks. This essentially defensive technique has the virtue, when it doesn't utterly succeed, of producing a draw. Fischer, by contrast, generally chooses the sharpest course, however precipitous it may become. Occasionally he overreaches himself, but it makes for interesting chess. In this game, replete with errors on both sides, Petrosian succeeds in pinning his opponent for a time to a static endgame. But Fischer manages to burst his bonds, only to blunder on the very next move (51... d6). Petrosian, however, by blundering in his turn, restores the balance. The ensuing Rook and Pawn ending produces a thrilling draw.

7 d3 ...
On 7 d4 I intended 7...e5. Petrosian is striving for an English Opening formation, a slow system for which he is temperamentally suited. 7 ... h5
8 d4 ...
Reckoning he can afford this loss of time in view of Black's misplaced KN. On 8 b1 f5! 9 c2 a5 10 a3 f4 (Petrosian-Vasiukov, Moscow 1956) Black obtains an excellent aggressive setup. I was as impressed by that game as Petrosian must have been, since he got crushed. 8 ... e5

9 dxe5 dxe5 10 xd8 xd8 11 d5 d7 12 h3 f5 13 g4 f6! If 14 gxf5 (14 xf6+ xf6 15 gxf5 gxf5 16 xf5?? g7+ wins) 14... xd5 15 cxd5 xd5. 9 ... e7
10 e4 ...
This is the right time to get in 10...c5! Petrosian-Boleslavsky, USSR Championship prelims 1957, continued: 11 e1 h8 12 d3 f5 13 b1 f6=. 10 ... f5 11 exf5 gxf5 Tempting but unsound is 11... xf5 12 g4 d4 13 gxh5 g4 14 xd4! xd1 15 e6, etc. And on 11... xf5 12 g5 d7 13 e6! xe6 14 dxe6 xe6 15 xb7 ab8 16 g2 xc4 17 d5! White comes out on top. 12 xe5! xg3 A "desperado" combination: this Knight (which is doomed anyway) sells its life as dearly as possible. 13 hxg3 ... Simple and good. I had expected 13 fxg3, but Petrosian eschews the K- side attack and plays for control of the center squares instead. His judgment turns out to be right. 13 ... xe5?
13...dxe5, keeping a fluid Pawn center, offers more play. I was unduly
worried about White's passed d-Pawn after 14 c5. 14 f4! g7

Forcing the trade of Black's most active piece. White soon obtains a firm grip on the position. 16 ... g6 17 e1? ... A careless transposition. Now by 17... xd4+ 18 xd4 h5! followed by ...h4, Black could exchange his isolated h-Pawn for White's g-Pawn and the game would be dead equal. Correct was 17 f3. 17 ... f7? 18 f3! ...

Petrosian keeps building without getting sidetracked - even by good moves. I was more afraid of 25 h5! tying me up completely. Then the Rook can't move because of xg6 followed by a check on h8. 25 ... f7!

Feigning an invasion with h5 and e1 and e6. White has two wings to operate on: Black must be flexed to react appropriately, and this requires alertness. 36 ... g8? Panicking and giving him the opportunity he's been waiting for to sneak b4 in at a moment when Black can't counter with ...axb4 and ... a8. Petrosian likes to play cat-and-mouse, hoping that his opponents will go wrong in the absence of a direct threat. The amazing thing is - they usually do! Witness a case in point. I should just have ignored his "threat" with, say, 36... a8 37 h5 c8 38 e1 f6 and if 39 e6 c6. 37 b4! f6 38 d3! ... 38 bxa5 e4+ 39 g2 bxa5 40 b1 c5 holds. 38 ... axb4
38... e4+? 39 xe4 fxe4 40 bxa5 bxa5 (if 40... a8 41 axb6 cxb6 42

53 e3 e8+
On 53...c4 54 a6 wins. The idea is to force his King to the K-side, away from the passed c-Pawn.

Not 54 d3 g8. 54 ... d6 55 a6+ xd5 56 xh6 c4 57 h1? ... As Petrosian points out in the Russian bulletins of the tournament, White can win with the following line: "57 h7! c6 58 d7+ c5 59 d1 c3 60 g5 c4 61 g6 c2 62 c1 c3 63 f5 g8 64 f4 d2 65 xc2+ xc2 66 g5 c5 67 f6 c4 68 f7 xg6+ 69 xg6 c3 70 f8= ." White is a tempo ahead of the game, where Black's Pawn succeeds in reaching c2, instead of c3 (as here). What if Black tries to improve? For example, after 57 h7 c5 58 d7+ e6 59 d1 b8. Now there are two main lines: A] 60 g5? c3 61 g4 (if 61 c1 f5 62 xc3 c4! 63 xc4 b3+ with a draw by blockade although two Pawns down) 61... b4! 62 e1+ f7

64 g6 c2 65 g5 b1 66 f6+ wins) 62 g5 c3 63 f6 c2 64 c1! (64 f7?
b1! draws) 64... e5 65 g4! snuffs out Black's resistance. 57 ... c3
58 g5 c5
59 d1+ ... It's tough right down the line. After 59 g6 g8 60 f5 e5! 61 g4 f6
62 c1 c4! 63 xc3 c8! White can make no headway. Or on 59 g4
e2! 60 g6 e4! 61 g5 g2+ 62 f6 xf4, etc., as the Russian bulletins also point out. 59 ... c4
60 g6 c2
61 c1 ...
On 61 g1 d8! the threat of ... d1 forces 62 c1 (not 62 g7? g8! followed by ... xg7 and wins). 61 ... d3
62 f5 g8!
63 f4 d2
64 xc2+ xc2
65 g5 c4
66 f6 c3
67 f7 Drawn I offered the draw, not realizing it was bad etiquette. It was Petrosian's place to extend the offer after 67... xg6+ (if Black wants to get melodramatic 67... c8 68 g7 b1 69 f8= xf8 70 gxf8= c2 reaches the same position); 68 xg6 b1 69 f8= c2 with a book draw.
4 Pilnik [ Argentina ] - Fischer
MAR DEL PLATA 1959
Tact and tactics The presence in Argentina of Pilnik, Najdorf, and Eliskases, who chose to remain there after participating in the Buenos Aires chess Olympic of 1939, created a chess renaissance, as attested by the annual event at Mar del Plata which, though not lavish with prizes, offers an exotic vacation and attracts the world's best. Fischer tied for 3-4 with Ivkov, a mere half point behind Pachman and Najdorf in a strong field of fifteen. After a lackluster opening by both sides, and a middle game that, with the exception of 26... bxa3 can scarcely be described as more than routine, Fischer pilots the game into an even ending. Both he and Pilnik then proceed to complicate; but the latter is drawn into making a false lead, which Fischer exploits by obtaining a passed center Pawn. From this point on, although Pilnik does all that can be done to stave off the inevitable, Fischer is not gulled into making a single wrong step.

I figured if he didn't take it off last move he wouldn't take it now; so I wanted to build a little more and keep the option of moving the Knight to a4 as well as c4. But Black should pounce on the chance to play 14... c4! 15 xc4 bxc4 16 b6 (if 16 a1 ab8 17 b1 b7 is strong; or 16 c1 ab8 17 a4 c3! 18 bxc3? c6 19 b6 d8) 16... c8 17 a5 d7! and White's in trouble. E.g., 18 d5 (or if 18 e3 d8 19 d5 xd5 20 xd5 f6 winning at least the exchange) 18... xd5 19 xd5 (if 19 exd5 xb6 20 xb6 d8 21 b4 b8 22 a3 xa5 23 xa5 xb2)

Forced. On 37 g2 b1+ is decisive. 37 ... xf3! 38 xf3 e4 39 cxf7 f2 40 f8+ g7 White resigns After 41 8f7+ h6 wins. Or 41 8f4 d5 (41... xf3+ 42 g1 g2+ 43 f1 c6 44 c4 b5! also wins) cooks White's goose.
5 Fischer - Rossetto [ Argentina ]
MAR DEL PLATA 1959
The unpleasant obligation This game exemplifies most dramatically the German expression zugzwang. Unable to achieve any workable advantage from the opening or mid-game, Fischer embarks on an equally unpromising ending. He manages, however, after 19 d5, to acquire a Bishop against a Knight. Subsequently he employs an unusual Rook maneuver along the third rank (24 a3) in order to make spatial inroads. Rossetto unwittingly co-operates and soon is faced by a rare predicament: although material is equal, any move he makes must disturb the precarious balance and hasten his own disaster. That is zugzwang - and, appropriately, Rossetto resigns.

An unexpected reply which throws Black, unjustifiably, into a state of confusion. 19 ... xd5 Caught by surprise. Rossetto fails to find the most accurate reply: 19... e5!

Black should never allow c5 without first forcing White to make the concession of exchanging the Bishop for the Knight. 24 a3! ... The threat is simply 25 xd7. The veiled and seemingly insignificant attack on Black's a-Pawn is the means of forcing him to drop the protection of his c5 square. 24 ... b8 Forced. On 24... f6 25 c6 wins a Pawn.

6 Fischer - Shocron [ Argentina ]
MAR DEL PLATA 1959
RUY LOPEZ
A small oversight Fischer's opening repertoire has been less extensive than most practicing Grandmasters', yet his contributions to theory have been numerous. 20 g5!? is one of his innovations. However, it is not responsible for Shocron's defeat. Neither is Shocron's response; in retrospect, his system of defense seems surprisingly adequate. Nevertheless, after defending sensibly, Shocron outfoxes himself. Thinking he has seen one move further than his adversary, he provokes a combination. But his vision is one move short. In consequence, though otherwise it had withstood all of Fischer's assaults, his game crumbles.

14 e3 g6
The Yugoslav System, popularized by Gligorich and Matanovich. The idea is to strengthen the position, and transfer the Bishop to f8 while awaiting further developments. Black will undertake specific counteraction only after White commits himself. 15 dxe5 ... This positional approach bares the hole on d5, so that White may gain access to it with his Knight. Alternate plans ensue after 15 d2 f8 and now: A] The quiet 16 c1 g7? (after 16... c6 17 d5! a5 [on 17... d8 18 c4! robs Black of his normal counterplay with ...c4, Olafsson-Ivkov, Buenos Aires 1960, and now White can leisurely build up a strong attack with h2, g4, g1 and later the stock sac f5] 18 b4 b7 19 a4 with a slight advantage) 17 b4 c6 18 d5! xd5 19 exd5 e7 20 dxc5 xd5 (if 20...dxc5 21 e3 d6 22 xc5 xd5 23 b3!) 21 b3 f6 (if 21... c6 22 g5!) 22 cxd6 xd6 23 g5! f8 24 e3 xd1 25 exd1 h6 26 e4! xe4 27 xd7 ac8 28 c4 g5 29 xg5 hxg5 30 c5 Black resigns. (Fischer-Rinaldo, US Open 1957.) B] The sharp 16 b4 cxb4 17 cxb4 c4 18 xc4 bxc4 19 c1 exd4 20 xd4 d5 (not 20...c3 21 b3 xe4 22 xe4! xe4 23 f3 c6 24 xc3 wins) 21 exd5 xe1+? (better is 21... d6) 22 xe1 d6. (Fischer- Matanovich, Bled 1961.) And now, as Keres pointed out, White can retain his extra Pawn with 23 f3! Not 23... xd5? 24 c3! wins a piece. Or 23... xd5 24 e4. 15 ... dxe5

On 17...h5? 18 d5! xd5 19 exd5 Black's K-side is weakened. 18 hg4 xg4 19 hxg4 ... Black has a new burden: neutralizing the potential attack along the open h-file. 19 ... c6 20 g5!? ... The old line 20 g3 f6 (better is 20... f6) 21 g5! is good for White. (Boleslavsky-Tal, USSR 1957.) I'd always thought my line was an improvement (the idea is to clear g4 for the Knight before Black can force an exchange with ... c4) but a closer look at this game shows that Black may have resources. 20 ... c4
20... xg5 puts White's concept to the crucial test. After 21 d5! xc1
(21... xd5 22 xg5 wins the exchange) 22 f6+ h8! (if 22... f8 23 axc1 e7 24 xh7+ g8 25 cd1! a8 [25... xd1 26 f6+ g7 27 xd1 b7 28 g4! followed by g5 with a strong attack] 26 f6+ g7 27 d5 xd5 28 xd5 White's better) 23 axc1 (23 xe8 g5 24 f6 c4! Black has good play for the exchange) 23... f8 (not 23... e7 24 g3 threatening either xe5 or h4) 24 g3 c7! 25 g5 g7 and now White can force a draw with 26 h5+, etc., or try for more with either
26 f4 or e3.
21 g4 xg4
Black can't allow f6+. As a consequence, White obtains the Bishop pair and attacking prospects along the open h-file. 22 xg4 b6! To prevent a4 and, as will be seen, to swing the Knight to f8 in order to defend the vulnerable h7 Pawn. For Unzicker's 22...f6 see game 10.
23 g3 c4!
The right timing. He's careful to see that a4 is restrained. Wrong, for example, is 23... d7 24 a4 b4 25 cxb4 cxb4 26 b3! and this Bishop comes crashing back into the game via the open diagonal.

Up to here Shocron has defended coolly, but now he makes a fatal miscalculation. Correct is 38... d7! and it's not clear how White can improve his position any further. If 39 h2 (not 39 xc4 d3! 40 c6 b1 with a strong attack) 39... b1! 40 b6 (if 40 xc4 d3 41 c8+ g7 42 h4 xg5! 43 xg5 h1+! 44 xh1 f1+ with a perpetual)
40... d3 41 xb1 (not 41 xe6? f1!) 41... xb1 42 d7 c7! (on 42...
c5 43 c6 followed by d5 should win) 43 c6 d3! with drawing chances. 39 xe6! c8! Blow for blow! Apparently Shocron was prepared for this trick, having seen that 39...fxe6? 40 xe6+ f8 41 xe5 is crushing. Now how does White avoid losing material? 40 d7! Black resigns This is the shot he overlooked. On 40... xd7 41 xg6+ wins his Queen.
7 Olafsson [ Iceland ] - Fischer
ZURICH 1959
KING's INDIAN DEFENSE
Pride goeth Miscalculating, as he explains in his notes, Fischer rapidly gets into trouble and is thrown on the defensive. Olafsson quietly strengthens his attacking prospects and seems well on the road to victory. But he tries, prematurely, to force the issue (21 b1) and, as the game opens up, loses the initiative, although he seems to be blissfully unaware of it. He fails to foresee the power of the riposte to his 24 d2. Still blind to the danger, while seeking a forced win, he misses several opportunities to equalize. In extreme time pressure, he is compelled to exchange Queens under particularly unfavorable circumstances. The resulting endgame holds no further surprises.

Steinitz automatically gave this pin a question mark. Since there is no real threat involved (because the Bishop is worth more than the Knight) Black can now gain time by kicking it around.

8 Fischer - Keres [ U.S.S.R. ]
ZURICH 1959
RUY LOPEZ
Meat and potatoes Alekhine said, in his prime, that to wrest a point from him it was necessary to win the same game three times: once at the beginning, once in the middle, once at the end. No less a tribute may be paid to Keres. Each phase of this game is fascinating and hard-fought. Even the errors, and there are more than a few, contribute to making it an unusually complete exhibition of two master craftsmen using all the tools of their trade. While perhaps unglamorous, there is meat here, and potatoes too. And it is likely that as a result of this victory Fischer came to be regarded as a serious contender by the leading Soviet Grandmasters - this was the first time he had defeated one.

9 Walther [ Switzerland ] - Fischer
ZURICH 1959
Betwixt the cup and the lip Here, against a minor European master, Fischer appears to be busted after seventeen moves, and admits he was ready to resign on move 36. Nevertheless, he extracts a miraculous draw from a hopeless ending, two Pawns down. Time and again Walther fumbles, allowing Fischer to prolong the struggle until he gets his break on move 54. What makes this game memorable is the demonstration it affords of the way in which a Grandmaster redeems himself after having started like a duffer; and how a weaker opponent, after masterfully building a winning position, often lacks the technique required to administer the coup de grâce. As Capablanca remarked, "The good player is always lucky."

10 Fischer - Unzicker [ W. Germany ]
ZURICH 1959
RUY LOPEZ
Milking the cow The Ruy Lopez has been so extensively analyzed that often both players reel off their first twenty moves in two minutes flat. Nevertheless, it gives rise to situations that call for tact and patience. As Bronstein remarked, "When you play the Ruy, it's like milking a cow." Fischer, here, milks the cow to a fare-thee-well. The first twenty-two moves are identical with game number 6. Unzicker then varies with the dubious ...f6, which undermines his e-Pawn and leaves him with weak squares. Retribution, though not swift, is sure. Creating simultaneous threats on both wings, Fischer finally infiltrates on the a-file. Black is so tied up that he cannot defend one of his Pawns when attacked - making defeat imminent.

11 Fischer - Benko [ U.S.A. ]
CANDIDATES' TOURNAMENT 1959
Unheard melodies Paul Morphy is the idol of all the romantics who pine for the swashbuckling chess of yesteryear; but it is rarely possible to succeed with that kind of flamboyance any longer since players now are more evenly matched. A rise in the standard of defense has necessitated a corresponding adjustment in the character of attack. In modern chess most of the beauty resides in the annotations. Brilliancies often exist only as grace notes - because the opposition anticipates and thwarts them with appropriate rejoinders. To the uninitiated, some of the most hard-fought struggles seem devoid of all bravura. That is the situation in this game. Confronted with a dozen beautiful outlandish losing variations, Benko chooses what appears to be a prosaic one. Is this "ugliness" not a by-product of skill? Though the reader may feel cheated, and the winner frustrated, does it not argue for the perspicacity of the loser who sidestepped those seductive invitations?

For 6... d7 see game 13. By putting immediate pressure on the center, Black forces the Knight to a passive post. 7 de2 ... For 7 b3 see game 58, note to Black's sixth move. No good is 7 db5 a6 8 e3 a5 9 d4 xe4, etc. And 7 xc6!? bxc6 only helps Black strengthen his center, but after 8 O-O White has promising tactical chances. 7 ... e6

Gligorich suggests simply 13... b7. Also satisfactory is 13... xb3! 14 axb3 b7 (or 14...b4) 15 h5 h8=.

12 Gligorich [ Yugoslavia ] - Fischer
CANDIDATES' TOURNAMENT 1959
Castling into it Although not perfect, this is perhaps the most bitterly contested game in this book. Fischer chooses a difficult variation which requires Olympian judgment. He submits his King to an attack which, on the face of it, can only be described as irresistible. Why did he do it? Because, we are told, it was strategically justified. Gligorich, too, must be given equal credit for his courage and restraint. His continuation, despite intensive post-mortem analysis, has yet to be improved upon. The complexity of each phase of this tumultuous struggle must be studied to be believed. Curiously, in the "barren" Rook and Pawn ending, Gligorich somehow missed a win - a fact which he is probably unaware of to this day.
[diagram]

10 g4 b5
Gligorich and I have a standing feud with this position, which wes've reached no less than three times. I've lost twice and drawn once (this one). 11 xf6 ... Interesting is 11 g2 b7 12 he1 b4 13 d5!? exd5 14 exd5 f8 15 f5 e8 and Black won. (Bernstein-Fischer, US Championship 1957-8) 11 ... gxf6!? For 11... xf6 see game 9.
12 f5 ...
Giving up e5 in order to exert pressure on e6. Our game at Zurich 1959 continued: 12 g2 b7 13 he1 O-O-O 14 a3 b6=. In the US Championship 1959-60, Mednis played 12 a3 against me. The game went 12... b7 (12... b8 is sharper) 13 f5 e5 14 de2 b6 15 d5 xd5 16 exd5 c8 17 c3 c4 18 xc4 bxc4 19 b1 b8 20 a2 with a better game for White.

f8 18 xe4 xe4 19 xe4 xe4 20 e6+ xf7 21 xc7 a7 is exciting but equal. (Padevsky-Evans, Havana Olympic 1966.) 12 ... e5 Simagin gave this a "?" and proceeded to analyze the alternative 12... b4 13 fxe6 bxc3 (if 13... e5 14 d5!) 14 exd7+ xd7 15 e5, etc. By this logic, the whole variation is unsound for Black. We shall see.
13 h3 O-O!
Not 13... d7 14 g5! fxg5 (if 14...exf5 15 d5) 15 fxe6 fxe6 16 xe6 and Black's game collapses. Petrosian and Tal both happened to stroll by the board at this instant. Petrosian made a wry face which looked to me like "Can Black do this and live?" Black's "ugly" defense is based on sound positional considerations: once he can consolidate, there is a strong potential in the two Bishops coupled with his beautifully posted Knight and compact Pawn mass. These assets, in the long run, hopefully, should outweigh the temporary weakness of his King and the immobile target on e6. 14 ce2! ... The consistent strategical plan. Gligorich intends f4, bringing additional pressure to bear on e6. Simagin gave the offhand 14 h6 h8 15 g5! and "wins". It is incredibly naïve to imagine that a player of Gligorich's caliber could overlook such a simple refutation. In this line simply 15... g8! refutes White's strategy. 16 g6 (if 16 gxf6 g4 regains the Pawn with advantage) 16...fxg6 17 xe6 (weaker is 17 fxe6 b7)
17... xe6 18 fxe6 ac8 19 d2 (if 19 a3 d5! 20 exd5 xa3) 19... c4 20
xc4 (if 20 d4 a5) 20... xc4 21 d5 ge8 threatening ... f8 (or ... b4). In a sense my judgment was vindicated when Bronstein (as Black) reached the diagram against Kholmov in the 1964 USSR Championship. The continuation was 14 g5!? b4? (Kholmov gives the best defense: "14...fxg5! 15 fxe6 fxe6 16 xe6 d7 17 d5 xe6 18 xe6+ xe6 19 xe7+ f7 20 f5=") 15 gxf6 xf6 16 g1+ h8 17 h6 e7 18 c6!! xc6 19 e5!! and White won brilliantly. 14 ... h8
14... b7 also comes into serious consideration.
Unsound is 14... d7 15 f4 c8 16 h6 h8 17 h5 g8 18 xf6 g7 19 e2 d8 20 g5, etc.
15 f4 g8
16 g1 ...
Gligorich gives 16 e2 as correct. After 16... b7 17 fxe6 fxe6 it's anybody's game. On 16 fxe6 fxe6 17 dxe6 xe6 (or ... a5 or ... b7) 18 xe6 c8=. 16 ... d5! Suddenly the game opens up! But more prudent is 16... b7 and if 17 e1 b6! 17 fxe6 ... Weak is 17 exd5? exf5! and White can't recapture because of the pin on the g-file. 17 ... dxe4
18 d5 c5
Black's game hangs by a hair. 19 exf7 xf7 20 xe7 xe7 is roughly even. 19 xe7 ... Weird complications result from the key line 19 f5!: A) 19... d8 20 h6! (not 20 g3 fxe6 or 20 e7 xf5 21 exd8= axd8) 20... g6 21 f4! d3+ 22 xd3! wins. B) 19... xg1 20 fxe7 xe6 (if 20... xg4 21 xg4 xg4 22 c7 b8 23 d8+ g7 24 f5+ g6 25 e7 wins) 21 xg8 (if 21 xf6 g7)
21... xg4 22 h6 xd1 23 gxf6 g6 24 xg6 hxg6 25 xd1 with
winning chances. 19 ... xe7
20 f5 ...
If 20 e3 b7 21 exf7 xf7 Black wins a Pawn. 20 ... xe6
21 h6 ...
Possibly Gligorich had originally intended 21 d6? xa2 22 h6 overlooking that Black can win with 22... a1+ (if 22... xf5 23 xf6+ g7 24 d8+ leads to a draw by perpetual) 23 d2 f3+ 24 e3 (if 24 e2?? e1 mate; or 24 c3? a5+ 25 b3 a4+ 26 c3 b4+ 27 c4 e6+ leads to mate) 24... xb2! wins. 21 ... d7! Defending against the powerful threat of d8! Not 21... xg4? 22 xg4! xg4 23 d8+ g8 24 g7 mate.
22 d6 ...
White has no choice. Black threatened ... g6 followed by ... xa2. Or on 22 b1 xg4. 22 ... xg4! 23 xg4 ... Forced. 23 xe6? xh6 wins a piece. 23 ... xf5 24 xg8+? ... Handing Black the game on a silver platter. Correct is 24 f4 g5 25 xf6+ xf6 26 dxf6 e3! 27 xf7 g1! 28 xd7 e2 29 d1! exd1= + 30 xd1 g7 31 e1 f8 32 xf8 xf8 33 f2 with good drawing prospects. Black has two ways to recapture: which one is correct? 24 ... xg8? Returning the compliment! The winning line is 24... xg8! 25 xf6 e5 with an extra Pawn and a dominating position (if 26 xa6? xa6 27 xa6 f4+ wins a piece). 25 xf6 d5 26 d6! f5 On 26... b7? 27 f6+ g7 28 d8+ g8 29 xd7 wins.
27 f6 g5+
I should have contented myself with the draw now by 27... d5 28 d6, etc. 28 xg5 xg5 29 xf7 g4

Not 32 f2? h1. 32 ... e1+
33 f4 d1
Playing, as Dr. Tarrasch wryly put it, "for the loss." Nowadays I would know better than to try to squeeze a win out of such a simplified ending. 34 e5! ... Gligorich is also playing to win - by cashing in on my inexperience. Simply 34 e7 xc2 35 f5 holds the draw. But he is purposely inviting me to overextend myself. 34 ... e3
35 f5 g1

39 c3 e2
40 e3 g2
In my excitement I had originally intended 40... g7? overlooking the simple reply 41 d4 (among others). Fortunately, Black can still hold the draw.
41 d4 e1= !

Trying to finagle. 49 xb5 c7 leads to an easy book draw. 49 ... d6 Crisper is 49...b4 50 d1+ (on 50 b6 c8 the Black King gets in front of the Pawn) 50... e6 51 d3 e5 52 b6 e4 53 h3 d4 54 b5 a8 55 xb4 b8+ 56 a5 a8+ 57 b6 b8+ 58 c6 (if 58 a6 c5=) 58... b4 59 g3 b8 with an impenetrable blockade.

52 c1 h8?
After the game Olafsson scolded me: "How can you play an ending like this so fast?" (I'd only been taking a few seconds a move for the last dozen moves or so.) "Because there's no danger. It's a dead draw," I replied. Had I known then what I know now, I would have selected 52... h5 and if 53 c5 xc5 54 xc5 c7 55 xb5 b7 holding the opposition, with a book draw. 53 xb5? ... Now it's Gligorich's turn to let me out. As Olafsson showed me, White can win with 53 c7+! It's hard to believe. I stayed up all night analyzing, finally convincing myself and, incidentally, learning a lot about Rook and Pawn endings in the process. Gligorich failed to point it out in his notes to the Bled tournament book. The main point is Black cannot get his King in front of the Pawn. A sample line is 53 c7+! d6 (if 53... d8 54 c5 d7 55 b7! d6 56 xb5) 54 c6+ d7 (if 54... d5 55 xb5 b8+ 56 b6) 55 xb5 b8+ (if 55... h4 56 c1 h8 57 a6) 56 b6 h8 57 b7+ c8
58 a6 h6+ 59 a7 with a book win.
53 ... b8+
54 a4 a8+
The game was adjourned again. But the crisis has passed.
55 b3 c8

57 c4 b8!
Drawn Black holds the "distant opposition." For example, 58 c5 (or 58 d5 b7) 58... c7 59 b5 b7, etc.
13 Fischer - Gligorich [ Yugoslavia ]
CANDIDATES' TOURNAMENT 1959
Something new During the mid-fifties, Gligorich, Reshevsky, and Najdorf were considered the strongest non-Soviet Grandmasters. Within a few years Fischer managed to surpass them. However, in so doing, he succeeded in beating Gligorich only once - up to 1966 (see game 56). On the occasion of this first win, Fischer employs a novel attacking system (13 e2) against the Dragon Variation. Gligorich fails to react vigorously enough and makes the mistake of castling too soon, thereby exposing himself to the same type of sacrificial combination that demolished Larsen in game 2.
[diagram]
For Benko's 6... b6 see game 11. Recently in a skittles game someone tried 6...g6!? against me. The game continued: 7 xc6 bxc6 8 e5 h5? (correct is 8... g4.

The only other try for any advantage is 8 e3 g4 9 xc6 bxc6 (9... xe3? 10 xf7+!) 10 f3 (not 10 xa7? c5) 10... e5 11 g3. 8 ... a5 Releasing the central tension this way is wrong. Correct is 8... xd4 9 xd4 g7 but after 10 g5! White still keeps control.
9 g5 g7
10 d2 h6
A concession. But on 10...O-O 11 h6 followed by h4-h5 produces a strong and almost mechanical attack.
11 e3 c8
12 O-O-O c4
13 e2!? ... A totally new idea at the time. 13 xc4 xc4 14 g4 was the usual, and good, procedure. The text permits Black to capture what was considered, then, to be the more important of the White Bishops. Bronstein was so impressed with this concept that he enthusiastically gave my thirteenth move "!!" claiming it was virtually the winning line. Alexander Kotov, the commissar of chess criticism in the Soviet Union, wrote, with more sober restraint: "It is difficult to agree with this." 13 ... xe3 Not 13... c7? 14 db5. 14 xe3 O-O Reminiscent of game 12, it is now Gligorich who castles into it! At Mar del Plata 1960, Marini played against me the stronger 14... b6 (threatening ...e5) 15 d2 c5 16 f4 h5? (better is 16...b5 or ...O-O) 17 f3 h6 18 e5! with a powerful attack. Kotov recommends 14... a5 15 b1 (he gives only 15 g4? g5!) 15... c5 16 d3 a6 and Black's all right. So best is probably 15 f4 (after
14... a5) 15...O-O 16 h3 e6 but Black's two Bishops may offset the
weakness of the d-Pawn.
15 g4 ...
Timing is important. On 15 h4 h5 locks it up. 15 ... a5

22 f3 c5
23 d3! ... Several Yugoslav chess journalists scurried forward toward the analysis room, where Matanovich was explaining the game on a demonstration board. Apparently the feeling was that I had just blundered. The more obvious 23 f5 looks good, but Black still has defensive resources with 23...exf5 24 xh5 (if 24 d5 d8 25 exf5 xf5 26 xh5? xc2! wins for Black) 24...gxh5 25 f4 xc3 26 bxc3 xc3 27 xh5 xb3+ 28 cxb3 e3, etc. 23 ... xc3 The threat against the d-Pawn is awkward to meet. On 23... 5c6 24 f5! exf5 25 xh5! gxh5 26 exf5 is crushing. Or if 23... 8c6? 24 a4 wins the exchange. Finally on 23... f8 24 f5! exf5 25 d5 d8 (if 25... fxe4 26 xe4 f5 27 xf5 wins a piece) 26 xh5! gxh5 (26... xd5 27 xd5 gxh5 28 exf5) 27 f6+ g7 28 h3 releases an avalanche. 24 xc3 ... Not 24 bxc3? b5. 24 ... xf4 This is what the crowd thought I had overlooked.
25 f3 h5
On 25...e5 26 e2! is decisive. 26 xh5! ... I've made this sacrifice so often, I feel like applying for a patent! 26 ... gxh5 27 xh5 e8 The best defensive try On 27... f8 28 h8+ e7 29 f6+ e8 30 h1 b5 31 xe6! fxe6 32 xe6+ d8 (or 32... f8 33 h8+ g7 34 f6 mate) 33 h8+ c7 34 xc8 mate. 28 h6! xc3 29 bxc3 ...

14 Keres [ U.S.S.R. ] - Fischer
CANDIDATES' TOURNAMENT 1959
Too many cooks Professionals spend much of their spare time hunting for "cooks" with which they hope to surprise future opponents. It was rumored, for example, that Marshall waited for over ten years before springing his famous gambit on Capablanca, at New York, in 1918. But, as it happened, the wily Cuban refuted it over-the-board! Keres, in like manner, confronts Fischer with an innovation which the latter, in all innocence, proceeds to destroy. Rather than admit that his surprise Queen sacrifice is good for only a draw at best, Keres presses for more, offering material in order to sustain his initiative. Fischer continues to accept everything, but - at the very moment when victory is within his grasp (on move 31) - stumbles. Now he must win the game all over again; and he manages to do so, with an assist from Keres, in another twenty-two moves.

On 16 c6+ f8 17 ce2 e7 followed by ... c8. 16 ... xd4 Not 16... xf4+ 17 b1 xd4 18 c6+! e7 19 e2, etc. Larsen suggested 16...b4 17 c6+ e7 18 ce2 d8 but 19 d2! (19 g3? b6!) 19... xd4 20 xd4 xf4 21 b3 holds for the time being. 17 xd4 exd5 18 xd5 c5 19 e1+ f8
20 c3 ...
White seems to have fair prospects. But a Queen is a Queen! 20 ... h5! A hard move to find - even somewhat risky - over-the-board. Probably Keres had expected 20...g6 21 g4 g7 22 g5 h6 (if 22... d8 23 f6 xd4 24 e8 d8! 25 xd8 e3+ draws) 23 h4 hxg5 24 fxg5 d8 25 f6 xd4 26 e8 d8! 27 xd8 e3+ with a draw by perpetual.
21 f5 ...
To hinder ...g6. Kotov gives 21 b4 c8? (simply 21...g6 is more than sufficient; if then 22 xa6 c6) 22 c6! and wins. Zagoryansky also mistakenly thinks White has all the chances. He gives "21 e5! g6 (more passive is 21... c8 22 e7 a8 23 c6 f6 24 e6 f7 25 f5) 22 f5!" but 22... g7 23 f6+ h6 (if 24 g4 b4!) is quite satisfactory for Black. 21 ... h6! The key to Black's defense; now the Rook sneaks into play via the side exit. 22 f6? ... Throwing away a Pawn in an attempt to keep Black bottled up. Keres should just try to maintain the status quo with 22 ed1, although Black retains some slight winning chances. But he seems to labor under the delusion that White has the initiative. 22 de4 g8 23 e8+ h7 24 d8 d6 neutralizes all White's threats. 22 ... gxf6

28 g8+ h6 29 h8+ g5 gets White nowhere. 28 ... f5 29 g8+ f6 30 xg6+ ... Or 30 d6+ e7 31 dxg6 fxg6 32 xg6 h3 wins (ZAGORYANSKY). 30 ... fxg6 31 gxh4 ... 31 ... xh2? The winning method is 31... xh4! 32 d6+ f7 33 h3 h6+! (if
33... xh3 34 xg6! xg6?? 35 f4+) 34 d1 (if 34 e1 xh3 35

An even tighter defense is 34 c1! followed by d3+ with a probable draw. But not 34 f4? h2+! 35 d1 xf4! 36 xf4 xf4 with a won King and Pawn ending: e.g., 37 e2 (if 37 b3 e3!) 37... g3 38 b3 xh4 39 c4 bxc4 40 bxc4 g5 and the King is "in the square". 34 ... f1 Trying to capitalize on the disjointed state of White's minor pieces.
35 c1 ...
Forced. Not 35 d2? a1! 36 c2 bxa4, etc. 35 ... g2+ 36 b3? ... In time pressure, Keres creates new losing chances for himself. Also bad is 36 b1 bxa4 37 xa4 f1 38 c2 f6! followed by ...f4 (if 39 d3? e2+). The right defense is 36 d1! bxa4 (not 36... xb2?? 37 d3+) 37 d3+ f6 38 xa4 a5 39 d4 (not 39 xa5? g4+ and ... xh4) and Black can't make any headway. 36 ... bxa4+
37 a3 ...
On 37 xa4 (if 37 xa4 c2+ 38 b3 xb2) 37... d2! 38 a2 f4 is deadly. 37 ... c2 38 d3+ f6
39 c5 c1!

This makes it easy. I had expected 41 d4 f4 42 d3 f3. The win is hard, but eventually Black breaks through on a3. For example, 43 b3 (43 b4? f2 wins) 43... g7 44 a3 e2 45 b3 d1+ 46 c4 (if 46 a3 a5 47 a2 a4 48 f2 b3+ 49 a1 a3, etc.) 46...a5 47 b5 a4 48 a5 b3 49 a6 a3 50 bxa3 xa3+ 51 b5 xc3, etc. Maybe White can improve, but Black should win because the blockade is not airtight. 41 ... f4
42 d4 f5!
The move Keres missed when he sealed his forty-first. He had probably anticipated 42...f3 43 c5 f2 44 e4+ xe4 45 xe4 f1= with a dead draw since Black can't create another passed Pawn.
43 b4 ...
More resistance could have been offered by 43 c5 but it's still lost after 43... e7! 44 b4 xh4 45 b5 f6, etc. 43 ... e7! This temporary pin is decisive. Now Black wins the h-Pawn and his two passed Pawns become irresistible.

15 Smyslov [ U.S.S.R. ] - Fischer
CANDIDATES' TOURNAMENT 1959
A whopper Here is Fischer's first win against Vassily Smyslov; and it is hard to recall when the former world champion, conducting White, has been so badly outplayed. On move 13 of a crucial opening variation, Smyslov makes what appears to be a "lapsus manus." Rather than fight a prolonged uphill positional battle, he sacrifices a Pawn to try to regain the initiative. This proves to be a piece of bad judgment, since, basically, the loss of this Pawn alone brings about his demise. Defending with deadly precision, Fischer gradually consolidates - the shadow of his Pawn looming larger with each approach to the endgame. Smyslov thrashes about, striving desperately for complications, avoiding exchanges like the plague. But he is unable to get off the hook.

B] 14 h3 O-O-O 15 f5!? (interesting is 15 xe6!? fxe6 16 xe6 c4 [Keres recommends 16... b6] 17 d5 with unclear complications, though White won, Tal-Gligorich, Moscow 1963) 15... xg5+ 16 b1 e5 17 dxb5 axb5 18 xb5 b6! (better than 18... c5 which I played against Gligorich at the Candidates' 1959) 19 xd6+ c7 20 xf7 f6 is roughly equal. 13 ... b4! My game with Walther (game 9) had taught me this lesson well. 14 ce2 b7 15 b1? ... In this sharp variation, White has no time for such amenities. 15 g3 avoids incurring any severe disadvantage, while the speculative 15 xe6!? fxe6 16 xe6 c4 17 xg7+ (better is 17 2d4) 17... f8! favors Black. 15 ... c5

Smyslov's keen positional judgment tells him that such a course for White is lifeless. So he sacs a Pawn instead. 17 ... dxe4

19 dxf5 g6! Perhaps this simple retort escaped him. Was he hoping for 19...O-O? 20 h5! g6 21 g3! winning material (if 21... d8 22 xd8! xd8 23 f6+, etc.)? The rest of the game is, if one may use that hackneyed phrase, "a matter of technique." Black's a Pawn ahead with the better game to boot. 20 xe7 ... Not 20 h6? c8 21 h4 xh3 22 xh3 xg5. 20 ... xe7

16 Fischer - Petrosian [ U.S.S.R. ]
CANDIDATES' TOURNAMENT 1959
CARO-KANN DEFENSE
Four Queens Fischer extracted a slight minus score from the seven games in which he was called upon to face the Caro-Kann, prompting Botvinnik to note: "Fischer's both strong and weak point lies in that he is always true to himself and plays the same way regardless of his partners or any external factor." This variation is not only complex and critical - but perilous. After a single slip the edge passes to Black. But Petrosian overestimates his position and, somewhat recklessly, dissipates his advantage. In time-pressure he misses a forced draw and Fischer regains the upper hand. From this point on, with four marauding Queens roaming the board, the play becomes "rich and strange" - resulting in a tortuous draw.
[diagram]

The purpose of this line is to exclude the possibility of ... f5. For example, 3...dxe4 4 xe4 f5? 5 g3 g6 (if 5... g4 6 h3) 6 h4 h6 7 e5 h7 8 h5 g6 9 c4! e6 10 e2 (threatening xf7) and Black has a terrible game. 3 ... g4

In our first round game here, Smyslov played 4... h5 5 exd5 cxd5 6 b5+ c6 7 g4 g6 8 e5 c8 9 d4 e6 10 h4 (correct is 10 e2! to prevent ...f6) 10...f6 11 xg6 hxg6 12 d3 f7 13 h5 gxh5 14 gxh5 ge7=. 5 xf3 f6 The old 5...e6 6 d4 dxe4 7 xe4 xd4 8 d3 gives White a good attack for the Pawn. And on 5...dxe4 6 xe4 d7 7 g5!? (better is simply 7 d4) 7... gf6 8 b3 e6 9 xb7 d5! Black gets good play. (Fischer-Cardoso, Portoroz 1958.) Inferior is 6 d4 dxe4 7 xe4!? (7 e3 bd7 8 xe4 xe4 9 xe4 f6
10 d3 d5! is equal, Fischer-Keres, Bled 1961) 7... xd4 8 d3 bd7
threatening ... e5. On 6 e5 fd7 7 e6? (playable is 7 g3 e6 8 e2 Spassky-Reshko, Leningrad 1961) 7...fxe6 8 d4 e5! Finally on 6 g3 dxe4 7 xe4 xe4 8 xe4 d5! 9 xd5 cxd5 10 g2 e6 (if 11 c4 c6 12 cxd5 b4!) gives Black an even ending (SUETIN).

In this tournament Keres and Benko both tried 9... b6 forcing White to weaken the Q-side with 10 b3. But Black's Queen is slightly misplaced after 10... bd7 11 g2 a5 12 a3 xd2+ (the retreat 12... e7 seems illogical - even though Keres beat me with it) 13 xd2 c5 14 d1 h5 15 h4! with an edge.

13 e2 ...
The critical juncture. In our earlier game (round two) Petrosian continued with 13...g5 14 f3? (Simagin gives 14 f4 gxf4 15 gxf4 e7
16 c4 d7 17 g4 "with advantage" but after 17...O-O-O 18 fxe5 b8

16... xd4 17 xd4 cxd4 18 ac1. Or 16...cxd4 17 h4 g8 18 hxg5 hxg5
19 fc1 O-O-O 20 b4! b8 21 b5 a5 22 d2 wins a Pawn) 17 e5! O-O-O 18 fe1. Now the Bishop diagonal is unblocked and Black can't set up a blockade on his e5, as in our first game. After 13...O-O 14 f4 h8 15 f5 g8 16 g4 f6 White has a tough nut to crack, but his initiative is permanent. The text indicates Petrosian's intention to castle long without trying to prevent f4.

I had expected 17...bxa3 18 fxe5 transposing to "B" above. 18 fxe5 fxe5 19 axb4 c7 Black wants to secure a Q-side blockade. The b-Pawn won't run away.
20 a5 b5!
I already knew I'd been outplayed. Petrosian didn't even consider 20... xb4, opening up the lines. 21 xc6 bxc6
22 f2 g6
On 22... xb4? 23 g4+ d7 24 f7 hd8 25 xg7 regains the Pawn.
23 h4 b7
Ordinarily one would expect Petrosian to simplify and simplify in order to reach a winning ending. 23... hf8! is strong.

24... hf8 is still right. On 24...gxh5 25 xh5 hf8 26 f5!
25 f7+ b6 On 25... b8 26 f2 hf8 27 c4! c7 (if 27...dxc3 e.p.? 28 axa7! xf7 29 b6+) 28 f6 with good play. 26 f2! a5 Not 26... hf8? 27 c4! c3 28 axa7 wins.
27 c4 c3?
Continuing to underestimate the danger. Safer is 27... d6. 28 f1? ... Why didn't I play 28 f6! immediately? If then 28... df8 (28... hf8 29 f1! xf7 30 xd8+! c7 31 f7 wins) 29 xe5 xf7 30 xh8 c5
31 e5 - it's difficult for Black in view of his exposed King and White's
passed e-Pawn. Finally, after 28 f6! c5 29 g7! a6 (if 29...a4 30 a7! or 29... a8 30 b7+ a6 31 c7! hc8 32 b5! wins.

30 xh7! ... Now I decided to start playing for the win. On 30 g7 dg8! 31 b7+ a6 32 c7 c8! 33 g7 cg8! draws by a "perpetual check" on the Queen. 30 ... df8! Forcing what looks like a favorable ending. 31 xg6 xf1+ 32 xf1 xh7 33 xh7 a3 Petrosian had been banking on the speed of this Pawn.

38 g4 c5!
A good last-ditch try. Curiously, the King will be safer in White's territory where it obtains shelter from the cluster of Pawns. 39 f8? ... Right is 39 h2! immediately, preventing Black's King from reaching safety behind the lines. If then 39... f6 40 g5. Or 39... a1 (39... a2? 40 xa2 xa2 41 a8! wins a piece) 40 g7 wins the e-Pawn. Finally on 39... ae7 40 a8 renews the attack. 39 ... ae7 Forced, to defend against the threat of xe5+. Not 39... xf8 40 xf8+ b6 41 b4+ a6 (if 41... c7 42 e7+) 42 a3+ b7 43 xa7+ xa7 44 g5 and queens.
40 a8 ...
I thought this was it! The two Queens are closing in for the kill. 40 ... b4!
41 h2 b3!
Slippery as an eel! Now White sealed. It's fantastically complicated! The tournament bulletins suggest 42 c5 xc5 (if 42... g6 43 e2! gg5 44 d1+!) 43 g8+ a3 44 c2 b4 45 a8+ a4 (not 45... a4? 46 c1+ a2 47 g8+ b3 48 c2+! wins) 46 cxa4+ xa4 47 xc6 "with good winning chances," but after 47... c3 it's likely Black can draw.
42 a1 ...
After the game a kibitzer asked Petrosian if he thought 42 c5 would have won for White. Petrosian, who must have analyzed it for many hours (not knowing, of course, what my sealed move was), simply replied: "I don't know." 42 ... a3 The only move to stop mate on b2. 43 xa3+ xa3
44 h6 ...
Now White has to try to make do with the g-Pawn. 44 ... f7!

47 g3 ...
A gross oversight, but probably best anyway! White can't win anymore. If 47 g5 h4, etc. 47 ... xe4! 48 f2? ... Having overlooked Petrosian's last move, I was somewhat shaken! Not 48 dxe4? xe4+ 49 h4 xd2 50 g5 xf1 51 g6 d3 wins. Also on 48 d1+? (48 xc3+? dxc3 49 dxe4 c2 wins) 48... xd1 49 dxe4 e3 50 e2 xc4 51 g5 d6 52 g6 e8 and Black again wins. The right retort, however, is 48 g5! and it's still a hard fight. 48 ... h1! I offered a draw, afraid that he wouldn't accept. Black certainly has the edge now. If 49 g5 e4! Or if 49 g2 h6. After having fought so hard for the draw, however, Petrosian was obviously unprepared to readjust his frame of mind and start playing for a win. So... Drawn
17 Fischer - Tal [ U.S.S.R. ]
CANDIDATES' TOURNAMENT 1959
A very near miss This is one of the four games that Fischer lost to Tal who, in winning this tournament, earned the right to meet and trounce Botvinnik for the world championship. In jest the whimsical Tal signed Fischer's name, in addition to his own, when asked for an autograph. "Why not?" he quipped; "I've beaten Bobby so often ... that gives me the right to sign for him!" A careful reading of Fischer's notes will reveal a clear echo of the strong emotions that engulfed him during this tense encounter. He misses a win in the opening and several draws along the way, demonstrating dramatically how a continuously advantageous position can abruptly be turned into defeat by seemingly insignificant miscalculations.

Against Olafsson, at Buenos Aires 1960, I continued 8 O-O e7 (if 8... b4 9 a4 xe4 10 e1 f6 11 g5 with attack) 9 f3!? c7 (not 9... b7? 10 xe6!) 10 g3 b4 11 ce2 g6 12 c3? (12 h6! is very strong)
12... xe4 13 e3 f6 14 cxb4 O-O= with a double-edged position.

9 a4 xe4
9... b7 is also playable.
10 O-O g6?
Correct is 10... b7. 11 f5! ... This riposte caught Tal completely unaware. Black's King, trapped in the center, will soon be subject to mayhem. 11 ... gxf5 Not 11...exf5 12 d5 a7 13 xf5! gxf5 14 d4. 12 xf5! ... Panov, with typical iron curtain "objectivity" commented in the Soviet tournament bulletins: "Almost all game Fischer played in Tal style. But all his trouble was in vain because Tal did not defend in Fischer style - instead he found the one and only saving counterchance!" 12 ... g8 Woozy, Tal stumbles into a dubious defense. Better is 12...d5 (not
12...exf5? 13 d5 a7 14 d4 spearing a Rook) 13 h6 xh6 14 xh6.
13 d5! ... A shot! 13 ... a7 "13...exd5 14 xd5 xf5 15 xf5 a7 16 xe4+ e7 17 xb4 e2 18 g5! xg5 19 xg5 xg5 20 xb8+ wins." (PANOV.) 14 xe4? ... Correct is 14 e3! c5 15 h5! g6 (if 15... xa4 16 xa7 exd5 17 ae1+) 16 ae1! and White's every piece is bearing down on Black's King
(KEVITZ).
14 ... exf5 15 xf5 ... Probably it's better to avoid exchanges with 15 d5 or 15 f3. 15 ... e7! A unique way of shielding the e-file. 16 xc8 xc8 17 f4? ... The right move is simply 17 c3! (not 17 xd6? xg2+ 18 xg2 e2+
19 f3 xd6 20 xe2 xc2+ wins) and if 17... c6 18 f2.
17 ... c6!
18 f3 xa4!
Such a surprise that I didn't dare believe my eyes! I had expected 18... xf3 19 xf3 e2 20 f2 xf2 21 xf2 and White has a slight edge after a3 because of Black's disconnected Pawns. 19 xd6 c6! Tal finds an inspired defense. 20 xb8 b6+ White remains a clear Pawn ahead after 20... xf3 21 xf3 g7 22 c3.
21 h1 xb8
The crowd was shouting and whistling with each move. Later I was informed that many sport fans were in the audience. Maybe some soccer match had been canceled. As a consequence chess was the main attraction that day in Belgrade. 22 c6+ ... Many annotators believed that 22 ae1 was the winning move. Tal himself confessed he thought Black was lost after that. But 22... d8! holds in all lines (not 22... g6? 23 xf7+ d7 24 d1+! d6 25 xd6+ xd6 26 f6+! wins). I've studied this position for ages, it seems, and the best I can find is 23 d1+ c7! (23... c8? 24 c6+ wins) 24 f4+ (if 24 d4 b7!) 24... b7 25 d6 c7 26 xb4+ c8 27 xa6 b7! 28 xb7+ xb7 29 af6 g7=. 22 ... d7 23 ae1+ ...

Not 23... d8 24 xf7! e7 25 fxe7 xe7 26 d1+ wins. 24 xf7 xf7 25 e6+ f8! I thought he had to go to g7, whereupon 26 xd7 wins easily. 26 xd7 ... Not 26 f1+ g7 27 f7+ h8 and if 28 xd7 d8 29 g4 e5 wins. 26 ... d6
27 b7 g6
Within a handful of moves the game has changed its complexion. Now it is White who must fight for the draw! 28 c3! ... Black's extra piece means less with each Pawn that's exchanged. 28 ... a5 On 28...bxc3 29 c8+ d8 30 xc3=. 29 c8+ ... On the wrong track. Right is 29 cxb4! xb4 (if 29...axb4 30 a3! bxa3 31 bxa3 xa3 draws) 30 f3+ g7 31 e2 draws, since Black can't possibly build up a winning K-side attack and his own King is too exposed. 29 ... g7
30 c4 d8
31 cxb4 axb4 On 31... xb4 32 e2 White should draw with best play. 32 g3? ... Creating losing chances. I don't see how Black can make any progress after 32 e4. If 32... c7 33 e7+ g8 34 e8+ f8 35 e4, etc. 32 ... c6+
33 e4 xc4
34 xc4 b6! I overlooked this. Now Black has winning chances. I had planned on a draw after 34... e7? 35 a3! dissolving Black's b-Pawn (35...b3 is answered by 36 c7 followed by b7).
35 g2 f6
36 f3 e5

37 a3 is met, as always, by ...b3. Once White can eliminate Black's b-
Pawn it's a theoretical draw. 37 ... g5+
38 e2 d5
39 d3 f6
White might be able to draw this ending, but it's an ugly defensive chore. 40 c2? ... Too passive. I wanted to avoid immobilizing my Q-side Pawns with 40 b3, but it's the best hope now. On 40... e7 41 d4+ preserves drawing chances. 40 ... e5
41 e2 f6
42 c2 f3+
43 e2 f7
44 d3 d4!
Little by little Tal inches his way in.
45 a3 ...
On 45 b3 f3+ 46 e2 f2+ 47 d3 xc2 48 xc2 e4 wins. 45 ... b3

18 Spassky [ U.S.S.R. ] - Fischer
MAR DEL PLATA 1960
KING'S GAMBIT
Old wine in a new bottle Here is the second of the three losses contained in this volume. As in the previous example, Fischer misses a win by inches. Deviating from his cherished Sicilian, he enables Spassky to employ the King's Gambit - not quite believing he would. Spassky is one of the few Grandmasters who still does so in competition. Fischer promptly wins a Pawn and hangs on to it, but neglects to steer for a highly favorable ending (23... g3). Just four moves later, 27 e5! effects his undoing. Undaunted by this early setback, Fischer scored 121⁄2 out of his last 13, pulling neck and neck with Spassky for first.
[diagram]
This loss spurred me to look for a "refutation" of the King's Gambit, which I published in the American Chess Quarterly, Vol. 1 (1961), No. 1. The right move is 3...d6!
4 h4 ...
The only realistic try for any advantage. There is no longer anything "romantic" about the Muzio Gambit, which has been analyzed to a draw after 4 c4 g4 5 O-O (if 5 e5 h4+ 6 f1 c6!) 5...gxf3 6 xf3 f6, etc. 4 ... g4
[diagram]
On 5...h5 6 c4 h7 7 d4 d6 8 d3 f3 9 gxf3 e7 10 e3 xh4+ 11 d2 g5 12 f4 h6 13 c3 White has more than enough compensation for the Pawn. This is vintage analysis.
6 d4 ...
On 6 c4 d5 7 exd5 g7 (the old 7... d6 is also adequate) is the modern panacea. And on 6 xg4 xe4 7 d3 g3 8 xf4 xh1 9 e2+ (9 g5 e7 10 e2 h5 11 e5 f6! 12 xf6+ f7 wins - Steinitz) 9... e7 10 f6+ d8 11 xc7+ xc7 12 d5+ d8 13 xe7 xe7 and Black should win. Morphy-Anderssen, Paris 1858. 6 ... d6
[diagram]
10 e2 f5. At least White keeps a grip on his f4 - for what that's
worth. 9 ... xc3 10 bxc3 c5 Immediately nibbling at White's center. Keres gives 10...O-O first.
11 e2 ...
On 11 e2+ e6 (12 d5? xc3+). 11 ... cxd4
12 O-O c6
It doesn't pay to be greedy with 12...h5. After 13 g5 f6 14 c1 followed by f4 Black's K-side is all messed up. 13 xg4 O-O 14 xc8 xc8
15 g4 f5
Winning a second Pawn, but creating a K-side weakness. Simply 15... h8 is stronger.
16 g3 dxc3
17 ae1 ... Black snatches the initiative after 17 xd6 f6 18 f4 g6. 17 ... h8 Also good is 17... d7 18 xd6 fe8 and if 19 c5 f7 (KMOCH). 18 h1? ... More accurate is 18 xd6 f6 (if 18... g8 19 e5!) 19 e5 xe5 20 xe5 with a little play left for White. 18 ... g8 On 18...d5 19 c5 creates problems. 19 xd6 f8! The key! On 19... d4 20 h2 g4 21 e5+! (to prevent Black from doubling Rooks on the g-file), 21... g8 (if 21... xe5 22 xe5 xh4? 23 f7+) 22 g3 holds. 20 e5+ xe5 21 xe5+ g7! Now White's h-Pawn must fall. 22 xf5 ... What else? On 22 xf5 (not 22 f4? d6 or 22 f4? g4) 22... xh4+ 23 g1 g4 forces a favorable exchange of Queens (if 24 f2 d6 produces a strong attack). 22 ... xh4+
23 g1 ...
23 ... g4? Drifting. Not realizing the danger, I thought Black could whip up an attack along the g-file. But correct is 23... g3! 24 xg3 (if 24 e2 d6)
24... xg3 (threatening 25... xd3 followed by ...c2) and White, a Pawn
down, has a tough ending to hold - as Spassky pointed out in our post- mortem analysis.
24 f2 e7
Threatening ... h4
25 e4 g5
I started to feel uncomfortable, but little did I imagine that Black's game would collapse in four short moves! I should have taken a draw by repetition with 25... d1+ 26 e1 g4 27 e4 d1+, etc. And if 28 h2 c6 29 b8+ g8 30 e5+ g7. 26 d4! ... This powerful centralization completely paralyzes Black. 26 ... f8? Overlooking White's real threat. I was worried about e5, not realizing it could be met successfully with ... c5. The right defense is
26... f8! 27 xa7 (if 27 e5 c5 28 f7+ g8 29 xg5 xd4 30
xd4 xg5) 27... d6=. 27 e5! ... I had reckoned on 27 e5? xf2 28 xf2 c5! 29 xc5 xg2 mate. Incredibly, Black must lose a piece. While trying to figure out what was going on in Spassky's head, I blundered and lost the game! 27 ... d8 Trying to squirm out! The Queen has no shelter. On 27... g6 28 xe7 wins. Or 27... h4 28 xf8+. Or 27... f6 28 d6!
28 e4 h4
I knew I was losing a piece, but just couldn't believe it. I had to play one more move to see if it was really true!
29 f4 Black resigns
On 29... g3 30 xe7 is most efficient.
19 Gudmundsson [ Iceland ] - Fischer
REYKJAVIK 1960
GRUENFELD DEFENSE
A long voyage home Illustrating, rather subtly, how a weaker player may be lured to his own destruction, Fischer entices his opponent to abandon his passive though solid attempts to settle for a draw. Wrongly convinced that he holds an advantage, Gudmundsson, with 16 e4, gives Fischer the opportunity to launch a long, unclear sacrificial combination. Gudmundsson makes matters unexpectedly easy with 24 b1, but the analysis accompanying the text shows the sacrifice to be sound in all variations. Fischer's performance from here on is typical in its clarity and forcefulness.

[diagram]
8 c2 ...
Probably best (Black threatened ... a5 winning the two Bishops). As Evans pointed out in Trophy Chess (in an analogous position): "8 cxd5 exd5 permits Black to solve the problem of his QB. He has the semi-open e-file and good squares for his pieces. It is now White who must fight for equality!" 8 ... dxc4 9 xc4 e5! 10 dxe5 ... Also good is 10 xe5 (if 10 d5? a5) 10... xe5 11 dxe5 g4 12 e6! (not 12 f4? xe5! 13 fxe5? h4+ 14 g3 xc4, etc.) 12... xe6 13 xe6 fxe6 14 O-O=. 10 ... g4
11 O-O ...
Stronger is 11 e6! xe6 12 xe6 fxe6 13 O-O (13 e4? ce5! 14 xe5? xf2! 15 c4 xe5 16 xe6+ f7 17 xe5 d3+ wins), and Black seems to have nothing better than a draw by perpetual after 13... xf3 14 gxf3 h4 15 fxg4 xg4+ 16 h1 f3+, etc. 11 ... cxe5 12 xe5 xe5
13 e2 c6
The chances are now equal.

Apparently stronger is 14 e4 but after 14... h4! 15 h3 (if 15 f4 g4)
15...g5! 16 f4 (or 16 d1 f5 17 f4 g6 18 fxg5 f4!) 16...gxf4 17 xf4
(on 17 xf4 g3) 17... h8 gives Black good prospects along the ventilated g-file. 14 ... g4!
15 h3 f5!
White was doubtlessly expecting 15... f6 16 e4 with an ideal center. 16 e4? ... Provoking a powerful combination. White should abandon his hopes in the center and settle for 16 b3 f6 17 xb7 e4! 18 xc6 c8 19 a6 xc3 20 bxc3 xc3 21 a3 xa1 22 xf8 d4! 23 exd4 xd4+ 24 h1 xf8. Black is better, but White has excellent drawing chances. 16 ... d4+
17 h1 f2+
18 xf2 ... All forced. Not 18 h2 xe4. 18 ... xf2 19 exf5 xc3! This clean-cut line reduces White's options. Inexact would be 19... fe8 20 e4! e1+ 21 h2 gxf5 (if 21... d4 22 e3! xa1 23 xd4) 22 g3 and if 22... d4? 23 e3! 20 bxc3 ae8

(not 25... 8e2 26 xf7+ h8 27 f5 xg2+ 28 h4 f2+ 29 h5 f3+ 30 h6! and White wins!) 26 xf7+ h8 27 f5 xg2+ 28 h4 e1+ 29 h5 g7! (threatening 30... h8+) 30 xe8 xe8+ 31 h4 d8+ 32 g5+ xg5 33 fxg5 d1 with an easy win.

c1 [if 32 h4 xg4+ 33 hxg4 h2+ mates] 32... e3 wins), 28... xd3 (if 28... xh3!? 29 xg6! fxg6 30 h1! holds) 29 b2! (29 xb7 loses to
29... xh3! 30 b8+ h7 31 f5 h6!) 29... xc3 30 d2 and White has
drawing chances even though a Pawn behind. 24 ... gxf5 Threatening either .... h8 or .... 8e6 with a devastating check to follow on the g-file.
25 d2 ...
No better is 25 xf5 1e2 26 xh7+ h8 27 f5 xg2+ 28 h4 g7 (among others) wins. 25 ... xb1 26 xb1 xb1 27 xb1 e2 This is what Gudmundsson overlooked. If now 28 c1 e1 picks off one of the Bishops. So... White resigns
20 Fischer - Euwe [ Holland ]
LEIPZIG OLYMPIC 1960
CARO-KANN DEFENSE
Theoretical scuffle Former world champion, Dr. Max Euwe had for decades been considered one of the world's leading authorities on opening theory. His Chess Archives ranks with Modern Chess Openings as an indispensable source of reference. It is no small wonder, then, when he selects a risky but playable variation. Fischer, however, just a little better versed in its intricacies, introduces a nuance on move 15 which ruffles his opponent no end. Fischer's method of dispatching his veteran adversary - on home grounds, as it were - is deceptively simple. After a mere eighteen moves the opening has become an ending and the duel is over. Euwe fights on, but to no avail.

Months before the game I had shown this line to Benko and he suggested this innocent-looking move. Upon looking deeper I found that, horrible as White's Pawn structure may be, Black can't exploit it because he'll be unable to develop his K-side normally. It's the little quirks like this that could make life difficult for a chess machine. 15 ... d8? Also difficult is 15... xb5 16 xb5 d6! 17 b7 f6 18 e2 c6 19 f7 a5 20 e3 with an enduring pull.

21 Letelier [ Chile ] - Fischer
LEIPZIG OLYMPIC 1960
KING'S INDIAN DEFENSE
A Queen for the King Letelier transgresses opening principles by neglecting his development in order to win material. Pugnaciously, he mixes it up with the unorthodox 5 e5 and proceeds to snatch Pawns. But his judgment proves to be unwise. Striking from behind the lines, Fischer causes the overextended White center to crumble. Letelier, busily engaged on a material hunt, neglects to safeguard his rear, leaving his King marooned in the center. Fischer rapidly encircles the hapless monarch and, with a startling Queen sacrifice, induces abdication.
[diagram]
4 e4 O-O
5 e5 ...
Weak. Letelier snapped at the chance to take me "out of the book," but this premature advance leaves White with all the responsibility of holding his overextended center Pawns. 5 ... e8

Weaker is 6...c5 7 dxc5 a5 8 e3 f6? 9 f3 fxe5 10 fxe5 c6 11 e2 c7 12 O-O e6 13 d5 d8 14 d2 etc. (Koralev-Roshal, USSR
1962.)
7 e3 ...
7 f3 is safer, though White can no longer lay claim to any kind of
initiative. My game with Schoene in the US Junior Championship 1957 continued: 7...dxe5 8 fxe5 (better is 8 dxe5) 8... g4 9 e2 c5 10 f4 cxd4 11 xd4 c6 12 xd8 xd8 soon winning a Pawn. 7 ... c5! "Now the artificially constructed White center begins to crumble."
(LOMBARDY.)
[diagram]
10 e4 ...
"More realistic would have been 10 f3." (LOMBARDY.) I intended 10... g4. After the text White no longer has time to castle. 10 ... f5! 11 g3? ... A better chance is 11 xd6 xd6 12 xd6 xd6 13 exd6 xb2 14 d1 b4! (threatening ... c2) 15 f2 (if 15 e2 c2 16 d2 d3+)
15... xa2 16 e2 (if 16 d2? c3!) 16...a5. Black is better but White
may have drawing resources. 11 ... e6 I also considered 11... c7 12 xf5 gxf5. White's center must collapse.
12 f3 ...
By now White is more than willing to return the Pawn in order to catch up in development. 12 ... c7 Also playable is 12...dxe5 13 xd8 xd8 14 c5 exf4. But I wanted to fracture him in the middle game.
13 b1 ...
Continuing his "attack". On 13 e2 dxe5 14 c5 a5+ 15 b4 xb4 16 xf8 xf8! 17 O-O exf4 18 e4 f5 is overwhelming. And on 13 c2 (in order to prepare O-O-O) 13...dxe5 14 f5 gxf5 15 xf5 b4 16 b3 (if

22 Szabo [ Hungary ] - Fischer
LEIPZIG OLYMPIC 1960
KING'S INDIAN DEFENSE
Bad judgment Once a contender for the title, Szabo's performances nowadays are spotty and unpredictable. Here, with breathtaking bluntness, he attempts to wipe Fischer from the board. In the process he leaves himself wide open on the dark squares. Fischer promptly invades on the Q-side, by means of a curious Queen maneuver, while Szabo, preoccupied with his own K-side attack, fails to realize the danger in time. 21... e3! is the blow that ends all effective resistance. Rather than fight on against hopeless odds, Szabo resigns three moves later.

23 Fischer - Tal [ U.S.S.R. ]
LEIPZIG OLYMPIC 1960
FRENCH DEFENSE
No holds barred Their first encounter after Tal became world champion proves to be an old-fashioned slugfest. Typically aggressive, Fischer rapidly achieves a winning bind, but unwisely permits Tal to touch off "a dazzling array of fireworks" with 14... xe5! The struggle seesaws for seven moves before settling in a perpetual check. The quality of this confrontation left little doubt that, in time, Fischer would yet take Tal's measure. He did just that less than a year later, after Tal had lost his return match with Botvinnik (Game 32). Reading Tal's palm, Fischer predicted: "The next world champion will be ... Bobby Fischer!"

24 Fischer - Darga [ W.Germany ]
WEST BERLIN 1960
FRENCH DEFENSE
Asking for trouble The Winawer Variation has given Fischer consistent trouble. He has had the utmost difficulty cracking Black's tortoise-like shell; even his successes are unconvincing. Maintaining the same line of attack year after year has provided his opponents with ample opportunity to sharpen their defenses. Darga's 12...f6 obliges Fischer, in order to get something out of the opening, to speculate on a Pawn sacrifice (13 a3!?). Though Darga's reaction may not be ideal, he proceeds sensibly and equalizes. Underestimating Fischer's chances, however, he falls prey to a scintillating mid-game attack. And so, once again, by virtue of his native ability, Fischer avoids the retribution that is the usual price for failing to secure an advantage in the opening.

25 Lombardy [ U.S.A. ] - Fischer
USA CHAMPIONSHIP 1960-1
When the Maroczy didn't bind Geza Maroczy left a strange legacy: the discovery that a certain type of Pawn formation imposes a near-decisive cramp on the opponent. In this game, after Lombardy's sixth move, he obtains, with Fischer's consent, the dread "Maroczy bind." From here on, given a few developing moves, White's game almost plays itself - unless Black takes early and energetic counter-measures. This is easier said than done. The method that Fischer chooses to free himself (9...d5) involves the sacrifice of a Pawn. Lombardy reacts sluggishly, overlooking a neat tactical point (17... h4+) at the tail-end of a combination. Even so, he still has excellent drawing chances. But somewhat discouraged by the rapid turn of events, he indulges in a unique form of self-immolation. In short, Lombardy, not Maroczy, lost.
[diagram]
5 f3 ...
A passive, non-developing move which leads to nothing. White wants to gain control of d5, establishing a Maroczy bind with c4, c3 etc. But after going to all that trouble he can't prevent ...d5 after all.

26 Fischer - Reshevsky [ U.S.A. ]
NEW YORK 1961: 2nd Match Game
Time will tell The opening has always been regarded as the old warrior's weak point, and were it not for this handicap who knows how far Reshevsky might have gone toward the summit? Whatever the case, being familiar with the latest wrinkles does have the merit of saving time on the clock and, hopefully, of catching an opponent off guard. Although Reshevsky is bested in the theoretical duel (after 13 f3) his practical cunning enables him to extricate himself - at a great cost of time. In the end it is the clock, as much as Fischer's persistence, that causes his downfall.
[diagram]
4 xd4 g6 Allowing White the chance to get a Maroczy bind (with 5 c4). Apparently Reshevsky had booked up on this for the match. black's idea is to dispense with an early ...d6 and possibly strive for a later ...d5 (thereby saving a tempo).

In the 4th and 6th games of the match I continued with 7 c4 O-O 8 b3 g4 (8... a5? brought Reshevsky to grief against me in the US Championship 1958-9 after 9 e5 e8 10 xf7+! xf7 11 e6!! winning black's Queen) 9 xg4 xd4 and White got a clear advantage both with
10 h4 and 10 d1 respectively.
7 ... O-O
On 7...d5? 8 b5 wins a Pawn.

Despite his familiarity with the Dragon Variation, I felt Reshevsky really didn't know the latest wrinkles in Alekhine's Attack. The point of black's "accelerated fianchetto" becomes apparent after the indifferent 8 O-O? d5! 9 exd5 b4=. 8 ... d6 Now on 8...d5? 9 e5 e4 10 xe4 dxe4 11 xc6 bxc6 12 xd8 xd8

dislodged by a3; the best White has is 11 O-O c8=) 11... b6! 12 xe6 xe3 13 xf8 g4 with a strong attack. (Makievsky-Veresov, USSR

15 g2! ... On 15 axb4 gxf3 16 xf3 g4 followed by ... h5-g6. White's whole idea is to keep black's Qb restricted to the Q-side. 15 ... a6 16 d3! ... Ney's improvement over 16 e2 f5! and the bishop retreats to g6, when necessary, defending the K-side. 16 ... e6 The best choice in a difficult position. Up to here we had both played briskly, but now Reshevsky began to consume time on the clock. After
16... d7 17 O-O-O e5 18 e2 black's game is lifeless. White has h3 and
d4 in the offing.
17 O-O-O ...
black gets the initiative after 17 d6? d5! 18 xd5 exd5 19 xd5 e8, etc. 17 ... xd5 The lesser evil. On 17...exd5 18 h3 g3 19 d4 is strong. 18 h3! g3 19 hg1 d6! Reshevsky is putting up a first-rate defense. 20 xd5 exd5 Despite his material deficit, it is obvious White has a strong attack. His problem is how to land a haymaker. 21 xd5? ... This gives black a little breathing space. Nowadays I would have played 21 d4! without giving it a second thought. After 21... xd4 22 xg3+ g7 (22... h8 23 xd4+ f6 24 f3 leads to a bind) 23 dg1 h6+ 24 b1 e6 25 xg7+ xg7 26 xg7+ xg7 27 g3+ h8 (if 27... f6 28 d6 g7 29 xd5 wins) 28 e5+ g8 29 g5+ h8 30 f6+ g8 31 e2 with a winning bind. 21 ... h8
22 f4 ...
22 d4 is less convincing now after 22... xd4 (if 22...f6? 23 xg3
xd5 24 xf6!) 23 xd4+ f6 and White has no forced win. 22 ... g6
23 d2 ...
Overlooking his reply. Vukovich suggests 23 f3 but 23... f5! 24 xg3 c6 holds. 23 ... xh3! Reshevsky chopped it off fast - he doesn't wait to be asked twice. 24 xg3 g4 black has succeeded in transferring the bishop to the K-side and in sealing the g-file.

27 Reshevsky [ U.S.A. ] - Fischer
LOS ANGELES 1961: 5th Match Game
SEMI-TARRASCH DEFENSE
Sheer pyrotechnics Here, in probably the most exciting game of the match, Fischer, trying to win a Pawn, unwittingly triggers a series of "desperado" combinations which are brilliant and unorthodox. Pure tactics predominate for a period of ten moves (19 to 29). It is almost impossible to determine who is winning until Reshevsky emerges a clear exchange ahead. In the tricky ending that ensues Fischer obviously is fighting for a draw. But, once again, he has the clock as an ally. In time-pressure, trying to preserve his slim advantage, Reshevsky plays an aggressive line in which Fischer finds a hole - enabling him to reverse their roles. Conscious of his newly acquired advantage, Fischer storms down the board with his K-side Pawns and overwhelms his opponent.

28 Reshevsky [ U.S.A. ] - Fischer
LOS ANGELES 1961: 11th Match Game
KING'S INDIAN DEFENSE
A peccable draw What proved to be the last game of this ill-starred match is a good example of how Reshevsky, by virtue of pluck, stamina, and alertness, salvages a draw from a lost position. It exemplifies, too, the demoralizing effect that continuously strong resistance can have on even the most robust opponent. Fischer rapidly wrests the initiative and wins the exchange as the result of a pretty combination (28... xe4). However, he has difficulty gaining the offensive because Reshevsky throws obstacle after obstacle in his path. Nevertheless, Fischer's material advantage begins to make itself felt. He misses clear wins (on moves 38 and 42), whereupon his game deteriorates sufficiently to permit his stubborn opponent to set up an adequate defense. Still, there are several surprises in store just at the very end.

29 Fischer - Geller [ U.S.S.R. ]
BLED 1961
RUY LOPEZ
Hoist with his own petard As was his wont, Geller gambles with 7... f6 in an attempt to assume an early offense. To thwart this maneuver, part of a patently prepared variation, Fischer sacrifices a Pawn (9 d4). Undaunted, Geller tries to continue his attack. But it backfires. With a series of rapier-like thrusts, Fischer demolishes Black in a mere twenty-two moves. Subsequent attempts to improve on Geller's play have likewise failed. Thus, this fruitful encounter offers what has come to be accepted as the refutation of Black's ultra-aggressive system.

30 Gligorich [ Yugoslavia ] - Fischer
BLED 1961
KING'S INDIAN DEFENSE
A lyrical performance This draw has the charm of perfection. Each move is interesting and, to this day, appears flawless. With 17...c5 Fischer launches an intricate double-Pawn sacrifice which involves exact timing. Gligorich rises to the occasion, returning material in an attempt to wrest the advantage. The economy and ingenuity displayed by both players produces a harmonious flow of movement, remarkable in its esthetic appeal. The effect is of a pas de deux in which each partner contributes equally to the total symmetry.

31 Fischer - Petrosian [ U.S.S.R. ]
BLED 1961
CARO-KANN DEFENSE
The sincerest form of flattery This is Fischer's only win against Petrosian and it is achieved through an unconscious mimicry of the latter's style. Right up to the endgame Fischer seems content to return the ball without trying to force the issue. Each attempt to seize the initiative is meticulously rebuffed. Move by move, they seem to be drifting toward a draw. Petrosian offers one at move 27, but Fischer declines. Perhaps out of irritation, Petrosian immediately commits his first and only error. And Fischer, reverting to his normal style of play, takes full advantage of it.

So I refused - not because I thought White has anything in the position, but because I didn't want to give Tal the satisfaction! 27 ... d6? Serendipity.

32 Fischer - Tal [ U.S.S.R. ]
BLED 1961
The moral victor After an early lapse by Tal on move 6, Fischer relentlessly presses home his advantage. He misses several opportunities to shorten Tal's resistance, but the outcome is never really in doubt. "Finally, he has not escaped me!" exulted Fischer. "It is difficult to play against Einstein's theory," sighed Tal, who went on to capture first prize. But it was Fischer, finishing a strong second, who had the consolation of scoring 31⁄2 out of 4 against the Russian contingent, and of being the only player (in a field of twenty) to emerge undefeated.
[diagram]
5 c3 ...
No doubt Tal expected 5 b5 which I had played exclusively at Buenos Aires 1960. I still think that might be best (see game 54). 5 ... c7
6 g3 ...
A perfectly legitimate treatment which Botvinnik labeled a "very cunning and well-masked idea." Actually no trap is intended. It becomes one only by virtue of Tal's reply. 6 ... f6? Probably the losing move! Tal looked worried immediately after having made it, but I'm not sure he was convinced he had really been careless. Correct is 6...a6 7 g2 f6 8 O-O, etc. 7 db5! ... Curiously enough, Bisguier, who was present at Bled and witnessed the game, forgot this move when he reached the identical position against Benko at San Antonio 1962! 7 ... b8 On 7... a5 8 d2 d8 9 f4 e5 10 g5 is strong.

Tal took a long time on this risky reply. The alternative 8...e5 9 g5 a6 10 xf6 (not 10 a3 b5 11 xf6 b4!) 10...axb5 (not 10...gxf6 11 a3 b5 12 d5) 11 g5 gives a clear advantage. 9 e2! ... Perhaps Tal underestimated this simple move. It prepares d4 and keeps an eye on the b5 square. On 9...a6 10 d4 d6 11 d1 axb5 12 xe5 wins at least a Pawn. Or
9...d6 10 d4 c6 11 xd6+ (Tal pointed out 11 xd6! xd6 12
xd6) 11... d7 12 b5 xd6 13 O-O-O, etc. In the tournament book Tal suggested the rather startling 9... g8 to avoid material loss. After 10 d4 f6 11 O-O-O (if 11 xe5 fxe5 12 c4 d8! holds) 11...a6 12 d6+ xd6 13 xd6 xd6 14 xd6 leads to a promising endgame. 9 ... c5 10 xe5! xe5

33 Fischer - Trifunovich [ Yugoslavia ]
BLED 1961
RUY LOPEZ
The drawing master Trifunovich has earned the reputation of being a very hard man to beat, and the other Grandmasters have acquired a healthy respect for his technical skill. At Bled, for example, he lost only this one game. Trifunovich's experiment with a dubious line in the opening meets with an abrupt and effective antidote (13 xd4), saddling him with an isolated e-Pawn for the duration of the mid-game. He decides, perhaps unwisely, to sacrifice it at an appropriate moment to gain some counterplay. Although he succeeds in outplaying Fischer in the endgame, he cannot overcome his material deficit. What ultimately defeats him is force majeure.
[diagram]
7 b3 exd4?
Considered to be weak - and it is. But Trifunovich must have had some equalizing idea in mind, since he rarely chooses a genuinely risky line. The tried and tested 7...d5 must be played.
8 e1 ...
A reader of Tal's Latvian chess magazine (Shakhmaty) suggested 8 xd4 but 8... e7! seems to hold: e.g., 9 e1 (if 9 xf7+ xf7 10 f3+ g8 11 xe4 d5 is adequate) 9...d5 10 c6! xc6 11 xd5 b7! 12 xe4 e7 13 xc6+ xc6 14 e2 f8, etc. 8 ... d5 9 c3! ... 9 xd4? xd4 10 xd4 e6 (threatening ...c5) is better for Black. 9 ... e6 On 9...dxc3 10 xd5 b7 11 xe4 (not 11 xe4+? e7!) 11... e7 (11... xd1? loses to 12 xc6++) 12 e2 prevents Black from castling. 10 xe4 dxe4 11 xe4 e7 12 xe6 fxe6 13 xd4! ... An improvement over the "book" line. Trifunovich probably expected the usual 13 xe6 but after 13... d5! 14 e2 O-O 15 xe7 xe7 16 xe7 ae8 17 xc7 f7 18 g3 xf3! 19 gxf3 e1+ 20 g2 c4 21 h3 e6+ 22 g4 c6 and shortly drawn. (Dolodonov-Kicin, corres., USSR
1965.)
13 ... O-O
He thought quite a while on this. Weak is 13...e5? 14 h5+ g6 15 xc6, etc. On 13... d5 14 g4 O-O-O 15 e3 Black's e-Pawn is untenable. Finally the "simplifying combination" 13... xd4 14 xd4 xd4? 15 xd4 d8 falls short after 16 g4.

34 Bertok [ Yugoslavia ] - Fischer
STOCKHOLM 1962
QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECLINED
Hanging pawns unhung Classical theory expounds the danger of "hanging Pawns," but Fischer demonstrates here, in a revolutionary manner, that they are just as often an asset as a liability. Bertok's errors seem insignificant, yet he drifts into a passive position. On the verge of exploiting Black's loose center, he always lacks just the one tempo needed to do so. Meanwhile, using the open b-file as a base of operations, Fischer manages to force White into a defensive posture. In the midst of this Q-side tension, the winning move (21...g5) comes unexpectedly on the opposite wing.
[diagram]
A refinement attributed to Petrosian, but actually played by Charousek in the 'nineties - and probably dating back even farther.

8 ... xd5 Inferior here is 8...exd5 9 d3 and 10 e5! followed by f4 with a Pillsbury attacking formation: White has g4-g5 in the air - this line is playable for Black only with his pawn on h7 (instead of h6). 9 xe7 xe7 10 xd5 exd5 The text is drawish, but I had already clinched first prize.

35 Fischer - Julio Bolbochan [Argentina]
STOCKHOLM 1962
A brilliant cadenza Called upon to face his favorite defense, Fischer quickly obtains the advantage against Black's rather passive opening strategy. Bolbochan, burdened with a bad Bishop against a good Knight, defends with extreme care but is gradually forced to retreat behind his lines. Disdaining several opportunities to enter a favorable ending, Fischer presses for a quick decision in the mid-game. His judgment is rewarded when the pressure which he painstakingly has accumulated erupts in a violent attack, beginning with 34 hxg6. Fischer's invasion on the weakened squares is a model of accuracy. It culminates in a keen combination which, appropriately, earned a tie for the first brilliancy prize.
[diagram]

Black's loss of time with ...a6 may possibly justify this loss of time. The variation is specifically directed against the characteristic ...e5 of the Najdorf System. Thus if 6...e5 7 de2 e7 (or 7... e6 8 g4 d5 9 exd5 xd5 10 g2 with a comfortable edge) 8 g4 O-O 9 g3! g6 10 g5 e8 11 h4 with a powerful attack: e.g., 11...f6? 12 c4+ g7 13 h5 fxg5 14 hxg6 hxg6 15 h5+!. 6 ... c6 For 6...g6 see game 43.

36 Fischer - Korchnoi [ U.S.S.R. ]
STOCKHOLM 1962
RUY LOPEZ
Gaston and Alphonse "I like to coax my opponents into attacking, to let them taste the joy of the initiative, so that they may get carried away, become careless, and sacrifice material," wrote Korchnoi, whose comments are interwoven in the notes. Fischer needs no coaxing. He improves on a well-known Capablanca line (with 15 d5). Still, the advantage he derives, if any, is microscopic. Korchnoi seems to labor under the delusion that he has the worst of it, though Fischer keeps asserting that White has nothing. Nevertheless, he overreaches himself, giving Korchnoi a chance to assume the initiative. But Black falters and then cracks under the pressure of the clock.

Gligorich's 10...d5 is probably best. On the old 10... xe4!? 11 d5 d7 12 xe4 d5 13 xh7+! xh7 14 dxe5, White, according to Robert Byrne, can keep his extra Pawn and weather the attack. 11 cxd4 a5

17 b1 c4
Korchnoi considers this overambitious, believing that it creates too many Pawn weaknesses. He thinks Black ought to play 17... e5 18 h3 xf3+ 19 xf3 xf3 20 xf3 b4; but after 21 f4 e8 (too passive is
21... b7 22 d3, etc.) 22 g3 e5 23 xe5 xe5 (if 23...dxe5 24 d3)
24 f4 e7 25 bd1 (threatening e5) maintains the pressure.

"White does not fall for 18 b4? c3! 19 bxa5 cxd2 20 xd2 e5 when the ensuing break-up of the Pawn protection of White's King more than compensates for his extra doubled Pawn." (KORCHNOI.) 18 ... xf3 "Giving White the two Bishops, but if 18... h5 19 b4! is now strong:
19...c3 20 bxa5 cxd2 21 xd2 e5 22 g4." (KORCHNOI.)
In this line simply 19... b7 followed by ...a5 yields good counterplay. On 18... h5 I intended 19 g4! (deadening Black's Bishop is worth this weakness). 19... g6 20 f1-g3, etc. 19 xf3 cxb3
19... e8 20 b4 b7 21 d4 is strong. And 19...c3? 20 a3! leaves the
c-Pawn artificially isolated: White can encircle it by e3-d4, e3, etc. Black's Knight on a5 is stranded; should it retreat to b7, then b4 smothers its future. 20 axb3 c7
21 e3 ...
"Up to here, White has played in excellent style, but this inaccurate move considerably improves the Black position. White ought to play 21 d2 or, still better, 21 e2! protecting the KB and preparing the powerful maneuver d4." (KORCHNOI.) The truth is, White just doesn't have that much. After 21 d2 or e2 Black can still reply with ... c3. 21 ... c3!

However, Fischer soon demonstrates that the White Knight obtains splendid prospects on the King's side, hence 23...g6 is much better." (KORCHNOI.)

37 Keres [ U.S.S.R. ] - Fischer
CURAÇLAO 1962
Only a draw This contest brings to mind Emanuel Lasker's axiom: "When evenly matched opponents play 'correctly' the games seldom have any content and frequently end in draws." Here a little incorrect play provokes a series of brilliant moves leading to a most unusual draw. Employing a slow, closed system against the Sicilian, Keres is strategically outplayed. By adjournment, however, he manages to achieve equality. Fischer refuses a draw, and the struggle flares anew. Working with a Rook against two minor pieces, he makes steady inroads. Each serpentine twist in the endgame, including the double error on move 56, is a joy, a revelation, and a study in itself. Keres' saving resources smack of sheer wizardry.
[diagram]
Sharper is 3...d5! 4 g2 dxe4 5 xe4 (on Lombardy's 5 bc3 f6 equalizes - but not 5...f5 6 d3 exd3 7 cxd3 f6 8 O-O) and White's attack is worth more than a Pawn) 5... f6 6 g2 c6 7 O-O e6=.
[diagram]
5 O-O ...
Harmless. Correct is 5 c3 c6 6 d4 with a powerful center. If Black goes Pawn hunting now he gets shattered: 6...cxd4 7 cxd4 b6? 8 bc3 xd4? 9 d5 c5 10 xd4 xd4 11 e3! xe3 12 fxe3 a5+ 13 b4 d8 14 c1 b8 15 O-O d7 16 d4 f6 17 c7+ f7 18 e5! with a strong attack. (Samarian-Wesen, corres. 1958.) The sober 6...e5 7 dxc5 dxc5 8 xd8+ xd8 9 a3 allows White only a slightly better ending. 5 ... c6
6 c3 e5!
7 d3 ...
Now White has to regroup in order to get in d4. 7 ... ge7
8 a3 ...
A lemon, but already White must fight for equality. On 8 e3 O-O 9 d4 exd4 10 cxd4 (Pachman-Tal, Amsterdam 1964) 10...cxd4 (also good is
10...d5 11 bc3 g4!) 11 xd4 e5 Black captures the initiative.
8 ... O-O
Deciding to ignore the Q-side. Keres hoped for 8...a5 9 a4! and White has tricked Black into weakening his b5 square.
9 b4 ...
Probably played against Keres' better judgment, but I guess he wanted to justify his last move. One lemon leads to another. 9 ... b6
10 f4 exf4!
Abandoning the center to play against White's shaky Pawn structure. 11 gxf4 ... Not 11 xf4? (or 11 xf4 d5) 11...cxb4 12 axb4 xb4! 11 ... d5! Wrong is 11...cxb4 12 axb4 xb4? 13 f5! ec6 14 d4 a6 15 e5, etc.
12 e5 ...
Poker-faced, as always, Keres made this move as though it were the most natural one on the board. But it was the last thing he wanted to do, since it exposes the poverty of White's strategy. 12 ... g4 Not bad, but 12... f5 à la Nimzovich is even better. After 13 g3 ce7 maintains a solid blockade, and Black can break with ...f6 at his leisure.
13 h3 xe2
Even stronger is 13... e6 14 g3 d7 15 h2 f6. The absence of Black's QB makes it difficult to exploit the white square weaknesses. 14 xe2 f6
15 b5 ...
The only way to keep the center from crumbling. After 15 e6 f5 the advanced e-pawn becomes a target. 15 ... a5
16 d2 ...
Better is 16 a2. If then 16...fxe5 17 fxe5 xf1+ 18 xf1 xe5 19 g5! is strong. 16 ... fxe5 17 fxe5 xf1+ 18 xf1 ... Any recapture proves to be awkward. Also 18 xf1 c7! 19 f3 (not
19 d4 cxd4 20 cxd4 c3) 19... b3 is similar to the game.
18 ... b3
19 b1 xc1
20 xc1 c7!
21 e1 ...
Still impossible is 21 d4? cxd4 and White can't recapture because of the pin. Despite the drawing tendency of the opposite colored Bishops, White has a difficult game: he's weak on all the squares and his King is somewhat exposed. 21 ... d8
22 h2 ...
Black gets an iron grip after 22 d4 cxd4 23 cxd4 f5 followed by ... h6, etc. 22 ... d4 23 cxd4 cxd4 24 f3? ... A terrible boner, just when White could equalize with 24 g4! f8 25 f1. 24 ... h6! Keres probably underestimated the strength of this reply. 25 a2+ h8
26 e6 ...
26 ... d5? Tempting but wrong. Correct is 26... f5! 27 f6+ (if 27 h2? e3+ wins) 27... g7 28 e6 f8 followed by ... h6 again, and it's just a matter of time before Black invades on the weak dark squares. For example, 29 g5 (not 29 h2 c3!) 29... h6 30 e4 e3+ 31 h1 f4 32 f6 c3 33 d1 c2, etc. 27 h2! ... The saving clause. Not 27 xd4? c5. 27 ... e3 After 27... f4? 28 f6+ g8 29 g4 White wins! 28 c6! ... Now the Queen is hemmed in and Black has nothing. The Knight on e3 must coordinate with the heavy artillery to be really meaningful. 28 ... f8
29 f3 f4
On 29... d8 30 d6 holds. The chances are now even. 30 xd4 xe5
31 f3 d4!
32 xe3 ... Not 32 xd4?? g3+. 32 ... xe3+ On 32... f4 33 f2! holds. 33 xe3 g3+
34 f1 xh3+
35 e1 f5
36 d4 g7
36...h5? 37 h6+ g8 38 d5+ xd5 39 xg6+ draws.
37 f2! ... The right plan - the King must stay on the K-side to blockade Black's Pawns. Eventually Black, to make progress, must advance; but in so doing he will expose his King to perpetual check. Worse is 37 e5+ xe5+ 38 dxe5 f4 (intending a4). White's e- Pawn can always be stopped by the King. 37 ... h5
38 g3 g4+
39 h2 f4
On 39... f4+ 40 xf4 xf4 41 g3 holds. And not 39...h4? 40 e7+ f7 41 xf7+! 40 e7+ h6 The game was adjourned and Keres sealed his move. Upon resuming the next day, he offered me a draw, which I rejected. I knew Black no longer had a winning advantage, but felt no harm could come from continuing since there was little danger of losing. Besides, winning this game would still have put me in contention for first place even as late as round 14, the halfway mark.

38 Fischer - Keres [ U.S.S.R. ]
CURAÇAO 1962
RUY LOPEZ
Detective story Occasionally one comes across a miraculous victory in which, despite intensive post-mortems, there seems to be no losing move or pattern, no blunder on the part of the vanquished. But how can that be possible? A loser must make a mistake somewhere, however infinitesimal, however it may evade detection. Is it Keres' opening novelty which leads him to disaster? Could his defense have been improved afterward? If so: where? Whatever the answer, the reader is invited to share the magnifying glass with Fischer and hunt for that elusive error.

"Now it is not easy to find a satisfactory continuation for White."
(KERES.)
Keres' novelty, introduced on this occasion, has since become quite fashionable. I was - and still am - unimpressed. Black loses time redeveloping his knight to b6, but the K-side is weakened by its absence and it's questionable whether the Knight is not better where it stands originally. 12 dxc5! ... 12 bd2 was all the rage, but 12...cxd4 13 cxd4 c6 may equalize. But not 12 dxe5 xe5! with complete freedom. "In spite of having won this game, it is probable that Fischer is not very convinced of the correctness of this continuation, because in a later game he closed the center with 12 d5." (KERES.) According to that logic, Keres must not be convinced of the correctness of 11... d7 since he later varied with the old 11... c7 (against Gligorich at Hastings 1965). 12 ... dxc5 13 bd2 c7? This is supposed to lead to trouble. If such a natural developing move is bad, then what kind of a position is this for Black?

39 Botvinnik [ U.S.S.R. ] - Fischer
VARNA OLYMPIC 1962
GRUENFELD DEFENSE
The confrontation This dramatic meeting between the generations took place on board 1 after it was rumored that Botvinnik would be given a "rest day" against the American team. But it was fated that Fischer, at last, albeit with Black, would have a crack at the world champion. Walking into a prepared variation, Fischer promptly refutes it. "The reader can guess that my equanimity was wrecked," confesses Botvinnik, whose notes are incorporated here. Nervously, he proceeds to run his still tenable position downhill. But Fischer, instead of nursing his winning advantage, simplifies too quickly and reaches an adjournment where victory is problematical. After a sleepless night of analysis, Botvinnik finds a stunning defense. Fischer engages in a seemingly harmless transposition of moves (51...b5), and falls into a pit - throwing away the win he maintains was still there.

Botvinnik thinks 9... b6 first is more accurate.

Botvinnik is of the opinion that 13...e6 (FURMAN) gives Black an equal game. But I feel it is not in the hypermodern spirit, which is precisely to tempt White into advancing his center Pawns in the hope they will become overextended.
14 d5 ...
Opening the diagonal for Black's KB can't be right, but White is still striving for an opening advantage. On 14 e5 xc5 15 dxc5 xd1+ 16 xd1 d7 17 f4 g5! 18 fxg5 xe5=. Or 14 xd6 (if 14 b5 xc5 15 dxc5 a4!) 14...cxd6=. 14 ... e5

"At once 15 f4 is not good because of 15... ec4 16 xc4 xc5 17 xc5 xc4 18 e5 xb2 19 d4 f6! and White's central position breaks up." (BOTVINNIK.) On 15 f4 also playable is simply 15... ed7 16 b5 (16 xd6 cxd6 gives Black a comfortable ending) 16...e5! 17 f5 (17 dxe6 e.p. xc3+! 18 bxc3 xe6) with equal chances. 15 ... f6!

16 f4 ed7
17 e5 ...
On 17 xc7? xb2 White can't castle and 18... b4+ is threatened. "When I was preparing to meet Smyslov, I, of course, made a thorough analysis of the Smyslov System in general and of the position on the diagram in particular! Here I reckoned that whether the Black Queen went to h4 or f5, it would be in danger; for example, 17... f5 18 b4 a5
19 d4 threatening 20 g4 or 17... h4 18 c2 g5 19 d4!
Alas, my opponent found a third continuation!" (BOTVINNIK.) 17 ... xf4! "A very unpleasant surprise - now White really had to start playing. Up to here I had only had to remember my analysis, though that was not so easy. I had a recollection of the Black Queen being trapped somewhere on the K-side; and following this track I managed to recall the whole variation. At last everything was in order - on the board was the familiar position; then suddenly it was obvious that in my analysis I had missed what Fischer had found with the greatest of ease at the board. The reader can guess that my equanimity was wrecked. However, if you assess 17... xf4 from an objective point of view, then although it is the best way out for Black, as you will see from what comes later, his position is still difficult." (BOTVINNIK.) When I made this move, I felt sure he had overlooked it. 18 xf4 ... Black's last is tactically justified after 18 xb6 e4! 19 f3 h4+! 20 f2 b4+ followed by ...axb6! (toward the center). 18 ... xc5 19 xc7 ac8
20 d6 exd6
21 exd6 ... Not 21 xd6? cd7. 21 ... xb2 "So Black has won a Pawn; but the Knight on c7 and the Pawn on d6 confine his Rooks - and also, White has two Bishops. The first thing White must do is complete his development." (BOTVINNIK.)
22 O-O bd7
"A bad mistake; evidently, Black overestimated his possibilities. Of course, he had to prepare the move ... e5; the only way this could be done was by 22... cd7 and after 23 f3 e5 24 xe5 xe5 25 xb7 b8 White has no more than a minimal advantage. Now White has the two important squares d5 and c5 at his disposal and his spatial advantage becomes crushing." (BOTVINNIK.) Needless to add, I couldn't disagree more. Why should Black return the Pawn?
23 d5 ...
Archives recommends 23 d5 but after 23... g7 the burden of proof rests with White - he's a Pawn down. 23 ... b6 24 f3? ... "Feeble play. Actually, White had played quite consistently so far and here he could have deployed his force with maximum efficiency by 24 c4! with the threat of e1-e7. The bishop is out of it on f3 and merely becomes an object of attack. Black now frees himself, and a Pawn down White is in a critical position." (BOTVINNIK.) After 24 c4! it is true that White has a bind, but with 24... e6 Black can practically force a draw, if he wants it, after 25 h2 d4 (threatening ... f6) 26 b1 c3 27 c1 b2, etc. 24 ... e6! "Apparently, this forces the exchange of the Knight on c7, for 25 h2 d4 26 g2 f6 is very bad for White. In fact, even here 26 xd4! (pointed out by Geller) 26... xd4 27 e1 gave White a real chance to get out of all his troubles. A second error running makes his position hopeless." (BOTVINNIK.) The reader is invited to judge for himself whether, in Geller's line, White has any real compensation for the exchange and a Pawn. Here
27... c5 followed by ... f6 or ... f8 should extricate Black.
25 xe6? ... This really took me aback. After 25 e3 at least White's still in the game. 25 ... fxe6
26 d3 ...
On 26 dd1? (or 26 d2? c1 27 d4 e5) 26... f8! 27 g4 xf4 28 xe6+ f7 wins. 26 ... c5
27 e3 ...
Bad is 27 d2 f8 28 d7 cd8. 27 ... e5 "The simplest. If 27... d4 28 a3 e5 29 g5 xd6 30 e7 d7 31 g4 Black lost the exchange." (BOTVINNIK.) 28 xe5 ... Just leads to a dead lost ending. I expected 28 xe5!? (hopeless though it is) to try and keep a little "dynamic imbalance." 28 ... xe5 29 xe5 xd6
30 e7 d7
31 xd7 ... On 31 fe1 cc7! flushes White off the 7th rank. 31 ... xd7
32 g4 ...
"A pointless move, since White cannot go into the lost Rook and Pawn ending; he should have played at once 32 e1 f8 33 e3 (or 33 d5) - Black would still have had technical difficulties." (BOTVINNIK.) 32 ... c7
33 e1 f7
34 g2 ...
"And now 34 e6+ was preferable, as the Bishop is poorly posted at g4." (BOTVINNIK.) 34 ... c5
35 e3 e7
36 f3+ ... "White's best practical chance consisted in an exchange of Rooks and a position with his King on d4 (or e3), his Bishop on c2 and his f-Pawn at f4. But all that is impossible - 36 f3 h5! and White loses his Bishop."
(BOTVINNIK.)
36 ... g7
37 c3 e4
38 d1 d4
"Before this I considered the game completely hopeless for me, but the text move gave me new heart; why had my opponent allowed my Bishop to get to a good post (and the only good one!) at c2? Surely, by 38... e1! (39 c2 c1) White's defenses could have been completely disorganized." (BOTVINNIK.) After 38... e1 simply 39 f3 is more logical.
39 c2 f6
40 f3 g5
"In general terms, d6 is the best square for the King; for then the Knight would not need to defend the b-Pawn and Black would win by advancing his Q-side Pawns. But this maneuver is also not bad."
(BOTVINNIK.)
41 g3 ...
41 ... e4+ "Could have led to an immediate draw - and just at the very moment when Black was nearing his goal. You see, White was already in zugzwang: against a King move Black plays ... h4 and ... e6-f4(xh3); if b1, the reply ... d1 wins; and if the White Rook moves from its place, then ... c4 is decisive. So after, for instance, 41... b4 42 a3 d4 43 f3 a5 White would have had no satisfactory reply. It is psychologically understandable why Black decided on the Rook and Pawn ending - earlier (see White's 23rd move) White had avoided it. But there is a difference between these two endings - the Black King is in a bad position on g5." (BOTVINNIK.) Although I agree that Black can win by keeping the minor pieces and gradually improving his position, the text should also produce the same result, if only by a hair's breadth. 42 xe4 xe4
43 a3 ...
"Natural and bad. White is now in danger of defeat again. 43 c7!! was essential, and White gets a draw as in the game. The fact that his Pawn is on a2 and not a4 has no significance." (BOTVINNIK.) After 43 c7 a4 44 xh7 a3+! 45 f3 (if 45 g2 xa2 46 b7 a1
47 f3 f5 48 f7+ e5 49 g7 b5 gains a tempo over the game
because White's pawn is on h3 instead of h4) 45... xa2 46 h4+ leads to the same ending as the game, except White has already played f3 which Botvinnik, for some reason, carefully avoided. So the difference may be significant. 43 ... e7 "Perhaps 43...a5! 44 b3 b4 was better; Black obtained either a won Rook and Pawn ending or - after 45 xb4 axb4 46 f4+ f5 47 f3 e6
48 e4 (48 g4 h6) 48... d6 49 d4 b5 50 d3 d5 - a probably
won Pawn ending." (BOTVINNIK.)
44 f3 c7
"His last chance consisted in improving the position of his King by the maneuver ... h6-g7." (BOTVINNIK.)
45 a4 ...
"Here Black sealed a move. White's threat is to exchange a pair of Pawns on the Q-side by a5 (for example, 45... c4 46 a5 bxa5 [or 46...b5 47 f7] 47 f7 a6 48 h4+ h6 49 d7) after which the weakness of Black's h-Pawn together with the unfortunate position of his King would guarantee the draw. The most subtle move was 45... h6, although even then Black gets nowhere after 46 d3! c5 47 h4 a5 48 d4. What happened in the game is also most probably a draw."
(BOTVINNIK.)
The game was officially "drawn" at breakfast. The Russian team had a table near the American team. Someone inquired of Botvinnik what he thought of the adjourned position. Hardly looking up from his plate, the world champion shrugged, "Nichia" (draw). The word quickly spread, and I overheard someone at the English table saying: "The Russians said Fischer could have won before adjournment..." 45 ... c5
46 f7 a5
47 xh7! ... "A very fine idea, found during overnight analysis by Geller. Because of his bad King position Black finds it difficult to mobilize his connected passed Pawns." (BOTVINNIK.) This was the first defense I had considered! Passive play is hopeless: e.g., 47 f4 f5 48 c4 f7 followed by ... f5 and Black brings his King to the Q-side. 47 ... xa4 48 h4+! ... I had analyzed mainly 48 f4+ but Botvinnik's line is best and also contains a sly trap. 48 ... f5 "Or 48... f6 49 b7! a5 50 g4 b5 51 f4 a6 52 b6+ f7 53 b7+ and White is quite safe." (BOTVINNIK.) 49 f7+ e5
50 g7 ...
"The weakness of the g-Pawn and the a-Pawn gives White sufficient counterplay." (BOTVINNIK.) 50 ... a1
51 f3 ...
51 ... b5? Originally Botvinnik wrote in Chess Life: "This is a mistake in analysis. But even after 51... d5! 52 xg6 b5 53 e2 c4 54 h5 b4 55 g4+ b5 (if 55... c3 or 55... b3 then 56 h4 followed by h6-h7 is very strong) 56 d3 the White King reaches the Q-side and it is easy to credit the draw." Later in the 1962 Russian Yearbook, he analyzed the entire ending more exhaustively and came to the conclusion, after considerable soul- searching, that it was drawn even against the best line: 51... d4! The bracketed comments are mine. "52 xg6 b5 53 h5 b4 54 g2 b3 55 h6 b2 56 h7 h1! 57 xh1 b1= + 58 h2 b8+ 59 g1 h8 [59... e5! seems to do the trick: if 60 g8 e1+ 61 h2 xf2+ 62 h3 f3+! forces the win of the h-pawn or if 60 f1 h2 61 g7 a5 62 a7 d3!] 60 g4+ c3 61 h4 a5 62 g2 b3 63 h3+ c2 64 h4 a4 65 xa4 g7+! (if 65... xh7 66 g4-g3 and the Rook holds the third rank, shuttling to e3, if necessary, keeping Black's King out - with a draw); 66 f1 xh7 wins, since White can't get his Rook back to the third rank: e.g., 67 a2+ b3 [68 a5 seems to hold here] or 67 a3 h1+ 68 e2 d1+ 69 e3 c1+ wins the Rook. Or 67 g4 h1+ 68 g1 (if 68 e2 d1+ wins the Rook) 68... h3+ 69 g2 (if 69 e1 f3 forces mate) 69... d2 70 g1 e1 wins (71 g3 f1+). Was it really true that the adjourned position was lost? Was I mistaken?" (BOTVINNIK.) Botvinnik then went on to give a corrected analysis which, as we shall see, also falls short. 51... d4! 52 xg6 b5 53 h5 b4 54 h6! (instead of his previous 54 g2) 54...b3 (if 54... h1 55 g2! h5 56 a6 b3 57 xa7 xh6 58 b7 c4 59 f3 leads to a theoretical draw) 55 g4+ (if
55 h7 h1 56 g7 a5 wins) 55... c5! (not 55... c3? 56 h4 and White
queens with check; or 55... d3? 56 b4 c2 57 c4+ draws) 56 g5+ c6! [Here I break camp with Botvinnik, only to meet at the next diagram. He gives 56... b4 overlooking that White can obtain an immediate draw with 57 g7! b2 (57...a5? loses to 58 g2!) 58 h7 h1! 59 xa7 b3 60 b7+ c2 61 c7+ d2 62 b7, etc.] 57 g6+ b7! 58 g7+ (if 58 g4 a5 wins) 58... a6! (the idea is to keep the King off the b-file so that White's Rook can't check from behind) 59 g6+ (if 59 g2 b2 60 h7 b1= 61 h8= e4+! and White is bombarded with checks which lead to probable mate, certainly win of material) 59... a5! (not 59... b5? 60 g7 a5? 61 g2! wins) 60 g5+ (if 60 g7? b2 61 xa7+ b6 wins) 60... a4! (finally Black has crawled up along the a-file) 61 g4+ (61 g7 a5 62 b7 h1 is easy; or 61 h5 b2 62 h7 b1= 63 h8= d3+ 64 f4 e1! is the pause that refreshes - White is checkless - if 65 e5 d4+ 66 f5 xf2+ 67 e6 b6+ is decisive)
Botvinnik also reached this position in his analysis independently, and concluded that it was a draw. However, it is precisely here, in this barren wilderness, that Black can wend his way to a win. Correct is 64... b3+! 65 e2 (if 65 f4 f7+ or 65 g2 d5+ 66 f3 d2+) 65... d1+ 66 e3 b1!! 67 f8+ (not 67 c3+? b3 or 67 h3 a2! 68 g8+ b3+ wins) 67... a2 and White's King will be without shelter from the coming avalanche of checks. Now to return to the dreary (for me) game. 52 h5! ... "Now Black is left with two RP's and the draw becomes a question of theory." (BOTVINNIK.)

40 Fischer - Najdorf [ Argentina ]
VARNA OLYMPIC 1962
The Najdorf Variation The durable Najdorf Variation remains Fischer's favorite, and he constantly experiments when confronted with it. Here, against the originator of the defense, he employs an unorthodox continuation. Najdorf counters sharply, launching an early struggle. In order to preserve the initiative, Fischer gambits a Pawn with 7 d5. Najdorf unwisely declines, only to accept three moves later under more unfavorable circumstances. He loses his way in the complications, allowing a devastating sacrifice which pins his King in the center. Although Najdorf defends with precision, it is too late to compensate for his earlier dilatory tactics. He finds himself ensnarled in a mating net after twenty-four moves. Rather than prolong his agony, the grand old master tenders his resignation.

For 6 g5 see games 9 and 15. For 6 e2 see games 4 and 42. For 6 c4 see games 17, 55, 58. 6 ... b5!? The sharpest reply. For 6...g6 see game 43. For 6... c6 see game 35. 7 d5!? ... The idea is to exploit the hole on c6. Najdorf apparently underestimated the strength of this "eccentric" move which appears to violate principle by moving the same piece twice.

41 Fischer - Robatsch [ Austria ]
VARNA OLYMPIC 1962
CENTER COUNTER DEFENSE
A bright cameo Facing one of Robatsch's pet lines, Fischer proceeds to institute such a crisp attack that one is reminded of Morphy in his heyday. Noteworthy are White's 5th and 6th, practically refuting the whole variation. Seeking safety for his King, Robatsch makes the mistake of castling too early. Fischer, already castled on the opposite wing, incurs no risk advancing his K-side Pawns, using them as battering rams to pry open the g-file. Robatsch is unable to effect a closure and Fischer rushes into the breach - compelling resignation in only twenty moves.
[diagram]
2 exd5 xd5 This old move is considered weak but Black has a new twist in mind. The modern way is 2... f6. Then White has the choice of either 3 c4 or 3 b5+ to hold the Pawn, or simply 3 d4. Against Bergrasser at Monaco 1967, I chose 3 b5+ d7 4 c4 g4 5 f3 f5 (safer is 5... c8) 6 g4! c8 7 c3 bd7 8 g5 b6 9 b5+ fd7 10 f4 xd5 11 xd5 c6 12 c4 cxd5 13 xd5 and White's extra Pawn should prevail.
[diagram]
A hypermodern approach, championed by Bronstein. The idea is to give up the center and then play against it. Seidman, as Black, played the more traditional 3... a5 against me in the 1958-9 US Championship, which continued: 4 d4 f6 5 f3 c6 6 d5!? (possibly an improvement over the usual 6 b5) 6... b4 7 b5+ c6 (more crucial is 7... d7 8 xd7+ xd7 9 a3 f6 10 axb4 xa1 11 O-O a6 12 e1 with a terrific attack. Not 12...O-O-O? 13 e5) 8 dxc6 bxc6 9 a4 a6? (9... d7 is necessary) 10 a3! d8 11 d2 f5 12 axb4 d6 13 b3 e4 14 xa6 xd2 15 c1 xc3 16 bxc3 d6 17 O-O Black resigns.
4 d4 g6!?
The idea is to reserve the option of developing the KN to h6 followed by ... f5 with pressure on the d-Pawn. After the game Robatsch told me he'd enjoyed excellent results with this system. 5 f4! ... Against the pedestrian 5 f3 (or 5 c4 g7 6 f3 h6) 5... g7 6 h3 f6 (not 6... h6 7 g4! Sokolsky) White holds no more than a minimal edge. 5 ... g7 On 5... h6 6 e5! f6 7 f4 messes up Black's Pawns. 6 d2! ... Ignoring the "threat." Weak is 6 b5 a6 followed by ...c6, etc. (Bronstein-Kholmov, USSR 1959). And 6 f3 h6 would permit Black the setup he is striving for. 6 ... f6 Stymied, Black can no longer play ... h6. The main line is 6... xd4 7 xd4 xd4 8 b5 b6 (forced) 9 xc7+ xc7 10 xc7 with the two Bishops and all the chances. Another possibility is 6... xd4? 7 O-O-O c6 8 b5 d7 9 d5! (not 9 xc6? xc6 10 xd4? xd4 11 xd4 xg2) 9...e5 10 f3 and Black will never get out of the opening alive.
[diagram]
Better is 7... d5 8 e5 (8 h6!? xh6 9 xh6 xc3 ruptures White's Pawns) 8...O-O 9 h4 h5 10 ge2 with a clear advantage but no forced win.
8 h6 O-O?
Castling into it - with a vengeance. Black should strive to castle long with 8... xh6 9 xh6 f5.
9 h4 a5
10 h5! ... The attack plays itself. My experience with this line dates back to the Dragon-slaying days (see game 2). 10 ... gxh5 Horrible, but Black must keep the h-file closed one way or another. On
10... d8 11 hxg6 fxg6 12 xg7 xg7 13 h6+ g8 14 f3-g5 is
slaughter. Or 10... xh5 11 e2 f6 12 xg7 xg7 13 h6+ g8 14 g4! d8
15 g5 h5 16 xh5 gxh5 17 xh5 f5 (or 17... f5 18 g6! xg6 19

11 d3 ...
It's important to exclude Black's Bishop from f5. 11 ... bd7 Not 11... f5? 12 g5. 12 ge2 ... Taking advantage of the lull to bring out the reserves. 12 ... d8 13 g4! f8 On 13... xg4 14 dg1!

Now the open g-file becomes the new base of operations. 14 ... e6 15 dg1 h8 Also hopeless is 15... f8 16 xg7+ xg7 17 h6 g4 18 xh7. 16 xg7+ xg7
17 h6 g8

18 g5 d8
Or 18... f5 19 xg8+ xg8 20 f8 followed by g1 is tasty. 19 hg1 ... 19 ... f5 Blundering a piece. But Black is completely tied up, and it's a pity he didn't allow the prettier finish after 19... f8 20 d5! d7 (if 20...cxd5 21 xd5 xd5 22 xh7 mate) 21 d6! f5 22 xf8 axf8 (or 22... gxf8 23 xf5 h6 24 dxe7 fb8 25 g7 xf5 26 xf7, etc.) 23 xf5 xg5 24 xg5 h6 25 dxe7 b8 26 g3! xf5 27 f3 winning a piece. 20 xf5 Black resigns
42 Unzicker [ W.Germany ] - Fischer
VARNA OLYMPIC 1962
Playing by ear This game illustrates the hazard of trying to rely solely on natural talent, without detailed knowledge of the latest opening innovations. Seldom is a chess master so drastically punished, as is Unzicker here, for failing to do his homework. Disastrously pursuing a line with which Tal had just barely survived against Fischer, Unzicker blunders further through apparent unfamiliarity with Geller's improvement (15 h1!). That had previously defeated Fischer at Curaçao. Unzicker simply puts his trust in "natural moves" and drifts into a constrained position, allowing Fischer to penetrate neatly on the weakened squares. The early decision, on move 26, comes as a surprise only to Unzicker.
[diagram]
6 e2 ...
On and off, White resorts to this solid and still respected system (championed by Smyslov) whenever the sharper tries fail. 6 ... e5 Black's expectation in this Najdorf Variation is that his control of important squares, with possibilities of Q-side expansion, will more than compensate for the slight weakness of his backward d-Pawn.

A critical alternative is 13 g4 d5! 14 exd5 (if 14 g5 d4! or 14 xd5 xd5 15 exd5 f6 16 d6? xd6 17 xc4 xc4 18 xd6? xg4+ 19 h1 e4+) 14... b4 15 g5 xc3 16 gxf6 xb2 17 fxg7 fd8 18 b1 c3. White's Pawns are overextended and his King is exposed. 13 ... b5 Too passive is 13...h6 14 g4 h7 15 f2 followed by h4. 14 axb6 e.p. xb6 15 xb6? ... At Curaçao 1962, Geller had found the right line: 15 h1! fc8 16 xb6 xb6 17 xc4 xc4 18 e2 b4 19 a2! and Black is hard-pressed to defend his a-Pawn, but 19...h6! 20 fa1 f8 21 xa6 xa6 22 xa6 b7 23 a5 c7 24 b3 b7 (ZUCKERMAN) =. 15 ... xb6+

What else? On 26 xa2 xa2 27 e2 xc3! Now Black has a decisive shot. 26 ... xc3! White resigns 27 xa2 (27 bxc3? f2 mate) 27... f3+ 28 e2 f2+ 29 d3 xa2
30 a1 xb2 wins. Black's first rank is no longer vulnerable since the
King can escape to h7 on the check.
43 Fischer - Reshevsky [ U.S.A. ]
USA CHAMPIONSHIP 1962-3
The missing link Many critics have dubbed this the "12th game" of the unfinished match, which had ended in a 51⁄2-51⁄2 tie. It is as adventurous and as bitterly contested as their earlier ones. This time Reshevsky is well prepared for Fischer's opening, countering forcefully and equalizing without difficulty. However, instead of maintaining tension, he strives inconsistently for simplifications, forcing an exchange of Queens which leaves him with a strategically weak ending. Working with simultaneous threats on both wings, Fischer, despite the reduction in material, succeeds in exploiting several of his opponent's targets (backward Pawns on open files). Reshevsky defends this passive position with his usual tenacity, but is unable to prevent an eventual breakthrough.
[diagram]
A good reaction. So is 6...b5 (see game 40). By transposing into a Dragon Variation, Black hopes to render h3 useless, since in the normal Yugoslav Attack White will be forced to advance this Pawn again, thereby losing a tempo.
[diagram]
8 g5!? ... Consistent, but perhaps premature. However, no other method offers more: e.g., 8 e3 O-O 9 g5 e8! Or 8 g2 O-O 9 O-O c6=. 8 ... h5! On 8... fd7 9 e3 c6 10 d2 Black is slightly bottled up.
9 e2 e5
I had intended to answer 9... c6!? with 10 b3 (and not 10 xc6 bxc6 11 xh5 gxh5 12 xh5 b8 with good compensation for the Pawn).
10 b3 ...
Bad is 10 f5 gxf5 11 xh5 f4 shutting out White's QB. 10 ... f4
11 d5 ...
11 g4 c6 12 d5 might transpose to the game.
Objectively speaking, White has no opening advantage. 11 ... xd5 Instead of simplifying so readily, Black could try to exploit the weakened K-side. Tal says more "logical" is 11...O-O 12 h4 f5 (or the interesting Pawn sac 12... d7!? 13 xf4 exf4 14 xd6 e5). Another possibility is 11... xe2 (not 11... xh3? 12 e3 and the threat of 13 b6 wins material) 12 xe2 e6=. 12 xd5 c6 Tal gives the dubious sac 12... e6!? 13 xb7 d7 but 14 e3 keeps the upper hand. But there's no need for Black to gamble. His position is basically sound.
13 g4 xg4
Tal gives 13...f5 14 gxf6 e.p. (if 14 exf5 e7! 15 d3 gxf5 16 h5+ g6, etc.) 14... xf6 15 xc8 xc8 16 c3 c7, but after 17 e3 followed by O-O-O White stands better. 14 hxg4 c8! With the double threat of ... xg4 and/or ... b4.
15 d1 ...
On 15 xd6 xg4 16 d3 d8 17 e2 g2 18 f1 h6 Black wrests the initiative. 15 ... d4! Apparently intent on simplifying at all cost. Reshevsky steers for an inferior ending. Tal gives 15... e6 16 e3 O-O-O=. A Bulgarian magazine gives the sharp 15...d5!? as best, since it dissolves the backward d-Pawn immediately. The tactical justification shows up after 16 exd5 (if 16 e2 or 16 c3, ...d4) 16... b4 17 c3 (if 17 O-O xc2 18 b1 O-O foils White's strategy) 17... c4! and now there are two main lines: A] 18 cxb4? e4+ 19 d2 d8 20 c3 f8! 21 a3 (if 21 c5 xc5 22 bxc5 xd5 wins) 21... c8+ 22 d2 (not 22 c5? xc5 23 bxc5 xc5+ 24 b3 c4 mate) 22... e7! with a continuing attack. B] 18 h3 xd5 (if 18... e4+ 19 f1 c2? 20 d2 wins) 19 e2 c7=.
16 c3 xb3
17 axb3 e6 18 a5! f6? Leads to a lifeless ending. Better chances are offered by 18...O-O (or
18...b5 19 d5 xd5 20 exd5 d7) 19 d5 ad8 followed by ...f5.
19 d5! xd5 Not 19... xg4? 20 xb7 O-O 21 gxf6. 20 xd5 d7 21 gxf6 xf6
22 g5 e7

Now it's clear that Black's game is, at best, barely tenable. Both his d- Pawn and h-Pawn are ugly weaknesses exposed on open files. 23 ... af8
24 e3 c8
25 b4 ...
More accurate possibly is 25 c4 c7 26 b4 and Black has constantly to worry about breaks with c5, b5, or even f4. 25 ... b5!? Many annotators criticized this because it creates a fresh weakness (the a-Pawn). But if Black just waits he ultimately should get squeezed to death after d3 followed by c4, etc. Reshevsky apparently feels more comfortable living with his new weaknesses, rather than with the uncertainties which would be created after an eventual c4. 26 dd1 ... White cannot keep d5 under control indefinitely. In order to make progress, the Rooks must strike at the backward RPs. 26 ... e6
27 a1 c6

On 28 h4? h5! eliminates the weakness. 28 ... f8

34 f4 b3) 33... b3 34 d3 xb2 35 e4! f8 (if 35... xc3 36 d5
d6+ 37 xe5 f8 38 c7+! b3 39 c8 e7 40 e8 d7 41 e6 wins a piece) 36 h8 g7 37 g8 e7 38 c8! followed by c6 should win. 29 ah1 c7 Now on 29...d5? 30 exd5+ xd5 31 xh7 xh7 32 xh7 c4 33 f7 c8 34 f6 b3 35 xa6 xb2 36 d2, etc. 30 h4! ... The critical position. Black is virtually in zugzwang. The Rook on h4 serves a valuable function, as will become apparent. 30 ... d5 On 30... c4 (if 30... f7 31 a1) 31 f3 c7 32 f2! d5 33 a1 c6 34 exd5+ xd5 35 d1+ e6 36 d8 should win. 31 a1! ... Reshevsky doubtlessly underestimated this interpolation. He probably expected 31 exd5+ xd5 32 d1+ e6 33 d8 g7! 31 ... c6 Or 31...dxe4 32 xa6+ d5 33 b6 wins. 32 exd5+ xd5 33 d1+ e6 The merit of the Rook on h4 is that it prevents the King from entering at c4.
34 d8 f5
With Black's Rook on c6 (instead of c7, as before) he no longer has the reply ... g7. And on 34... c7 35 a8 is decisive.
35 a8 e6

37 xh8 xh8 38 xh7 e8 39 f7+ g4 Or 39... e4 40 f3+ d5 41 d3 wins. 40 f3+ g3 41 d3? ... A buzz began to circulate in the playing hall and I wondered what it was all about. Later they told me 41 f1! (threatening 42 f2+) forces at least the win of a piece. Of course the text move also wins, but it takes ten moves longer. 41 ... e4+ Throwing another Pawn to the winds in order to get the Bishop into play. On 41... c8 42 c5 also is easy. 42 fxe4 d8+

44 Fischer - Fine [ U.S.A. ]
NEW YORK 1963: Skittles Game
EVANS GAMBIT
Shock treatment Having become one of the leading players in the world, Fine quit chess at the height of his career (1945) to become a practising psychoanalyst; but he has lost none of his love for the game and little of his brilliance. The following is one of seven or eight offhand games played at his home in New York. As far as can be ascertained, Dr. Fine very nearly held his own. Here, departing for the first time from his beloved Ruy Lopez, Fischer employs the daring gambit introduced by Captain Evans a century ago. This ploy has all but disappeared from the arena. Fine, although the author of several opening manuals, is understandably rusty, and he gets caught in a vise from which he never escapes. Fischer uncorks a sparkling finish in seventeen moves.

45 Fischer - Bisguier [ U.S.A. ]
NEW YORK STATE CHAMPIONSHIP 1963
TWO KNIGHTS' DEFENSE
Ghosts Steinitz, nicknamed "the Austrian Morphy" (although two styles could hardly be more dissimilar), apparently exercises a great influence on Fischer, who has restored several of his pet lines to prominence. One of these is the bizarre 9 h3!?, found wanting at the turn of the century, and perhaps best left there. Bisguier appears unimpressed, regaining his gambit Pawn with a strong initiative. But he misses several opportunities to gain an advantage and is gradually outplayed. Just at the critical moment, when the chances are roughly equal, he commits the same kind of gross oversight that had doomed Fischer against Spassky (game 18). He suffers the same fate.
1 e4 ...

5... d4!? (FRITZ) and 5...b5!? (ULVESTAD) are both interesting but
unsound. On 5... xd5 6 d4! (6 xf7!? is the "Fried Liver Attack") is so strong that 5... xd5 is practically extinct. 6 b5+ c6 7 dxc6 bxc6
[diagram]
9 h3!? ... To my knowledge, this is the first time that this move had been employed in Grandmaster chess for over seventy years. It is one of Steinitz's many unique opening contributions. The famous cable match game in 1891 between Steinitz and Tchigorin, which ended in a victory for Black, apparently caused the chess world to shy away from this variation. 9 ... c5 A] 9... d6 (STEINITZ) might be worth investigating. If 10 d4 (TCHIGORIN) then 10...e4 (FISCHER). B] 9... f5 is too crude: 10 O-O d7 11 e1 xh3 12 gxh3 xh3 13 f1 and Black is busted, e.g., 13... g4+? 14 xg4 xg4 15 h3 wins a piece (STEINITZ). C] 9...g5 10 d3 g4 11 g1 c5 12 c3 effectively wards off the threats (12... b6 is answered by 13 a4!).
10 O-O ...
Played by Steinitz in the 6th game of his second match with Tchigorin in 1892. Better is 10 d3! O-O 11 c3 e8 12 O-O xh3 13 gxh3 d7 14 g4 xg4 15 hxg4, etc., as I played vs. Radoicich here in a later round.
10 ... O-O
Dr. Gottschall, in the 1892 Deutsche Schachzeitung, suggests 10...g5, remarking it strange that a player as aggressive as Tchigorin did not chance it. Gottschall gives 11 h1 g4 12 g1 e4 13 xg4! xf2+ 14 xf2 xf2 and, although Black has won the exchange, prefers White's practical chances. After 10...g5 11 h1 g4 12 g1 e4 let us suppose White tries to avert material loss with 13 b4 (of no avail is 13 e1 d4 14 d1 xf2+ 15 xf2 xf2 16 xe5+? e6) 13... xf2+ (or Gottschall's 13... xf2 14 d3 h4 15 dxe4 g3 16 h3 [if 16 h3 gxh3 17 gxh3 g8] 16... xh2! 17 xh2 g3+ 18 g1 xh3, etc.) 14 xf2 xf2 15 bxa5 h4! 16 f1 g3 17 h3 g8 with a crushing attack.
11 d3 xh3
This certainly seems an improvement over the aforementioned Steinitz-Tchigorin match game which continued: 11... d5 (Gottschall's
11... h7 also merits attention) 12 c4 e7 13 h1 xh3 14 gxh3 f5 15
f4 exf4 16 xf4 e3 17 xe3 xe3 18 c3 and White won easily with his Q-side majority. 12 gxh3 d7
13 f3 ...
A difficult choice. I rejected 13 g2 since this was the square I had reserved for my Bishop. On 13 g4 xg4 followed by ...f5 gives fair attacking chances. 13 ... xh3 So Black regains the Pawn, but I have faith in my two Bishops.
14 d2 ...
It would be a mistake to play for the win of a Pawn by 14 g2 h4!
15 e1 fe8! 16 xa5 g4 17 h3 xf2+ 18 xf2 (if 18 h1 g3) 18...
xf2+ 19 h1 e4! 20 hxg4 (if 20 dxe4 xe4) 20...exd3 with a winning attack. 14 ... ad8 Not 14...e4? 15 xe4 xe4 16 xe4 d6 17 f4, etc.
15 g2 f5
The Queen is forced off the h-file. On 15... h4? 16 f3 h5 17 e1 wins a Pawn.
16 e1 ...
Perhaps better is 16 f3 with possibilities of a slightly favorable ending. 16 ... fe8
17 e4 b6

19 h1 c5
Stronger is 19...g5 preventing White's break on f4 once and for all. Then by bringing his Knight to h4(!) Black could get a good game. 20 c3! ... Serves the double purpose of preventing ...c4 and of enforcing f4. For all the good it does, Black's Bishop on b6 might just as well be a Pawn for the rest of the game. 20 ... c6 Too late now is 20...g5? 21 f4!
21 f4 d4
22 c4 ...
To prepare c3, driving the Knight away from d4. I didn't like the looks of 22 fxe5 xe5 23 f4 e2, etc. 22 ... g6 Intending ... h5 followed by ... f5. (Not 22... e6 23 a4 d7? 24 xd7 xd7 25 c3 c2 26 c6!)
23 c3 ...
After the game a kibitzer suggested 23 e4 h5 24 f5 but this allows Black to turn the tables by 24... e2 25 g1 f3! 23 ... f5 On 23... e2 24 f5 f6 (24... h5? 25 f3!) 25 e3 f4 26 e4 is tremendous. 24 fxe5 ... After 24 e4 h5 just who has got the attack is not quite clear! 24 ... xe5
25 f4 ...
25 f4 turns out badly after 25... c7! 26 e4 h5!
25 ... e2 Black is playing for an advantage. 25... e3 26 xe3 xe3 is absolutely equal.
26 e4 ...
The critical position. 26 ... xb2? A pity that just when the game was getting interesting, Black has to make this terrible mistake. Correct is 26... e8! (threatening ... 8xe4). Bad would be 27 g1 h5 28 af1 e3! 29 b5 xe4 30 dxe4 xf1 31 e8+ (if 31 xf1 g4 wins) 31... h7 32 xg7+ xg7 33 e5+ xe5 34 xe5+ f6 35 e7+ g6 36 e8+ g5 escaping the perpetual and should win. After 26... e8! therefore, the best White has is 27 f3 (to prevent ... h5) 27... xb2 28 ae1 with even chances, owing to the Bishop pair. 27 e5! ... Bisguier slumped and his chest collapsed, as he saw that Black cannot avert the loss of a piece. 27 ... e8 28 xf5 xe5 29 xe5 Black resigns
46 Fischer - Benko [ U.S.A. ]
USA CHAMPIONSHIP 1963-4
PIRC-ROBATSCH DEFENSE
Romp Chess Life, January 1964, reported: "In the later stages of the tournament some of Fischer's opponents did almost as much to guarantee his 11-0 score as Bobby did. The building tension worked to Fischer's advantage...On Monday, December 30, Fischer won his last game of 1963 - defeating Pal Benko with a neat little combination, after Benko had shown some suicidal tendencies in the management of his defense." And so, in twenty-one moves, another Grandmaster is demolished. Benko misses a chance to simplify (on move 15) in order to reach an inferior but possibly tenable ending. This is fortunate for the reader, who otherwise would be cheated of White's scintillating 19th move. That alone is worth the price of admission!

Already threatening to obtain a winning bind with g4-g5. 11 ... gxf5 Best. My original note said: "If immediately 11... d4 12 f2 gxf5 13 exf5 with a quick crush in sight." This verdict was later confirmed in Bednarsky-Kraidman, Tel Aviv 1964, which continued: 13...b5 14 O-O c5

13 f2 ...
I was tempted to accept the dare with 13 xe5! g4 14 xg7+! xg7 15 hxg4 with threats all over the place. For example, if 15... e6 16 e5 h8 17 h6+ g8 18 e4 wins. But 15... c6 is hard to crack. 13 ... e8 More active than 13... d7 14 O-O-O c5 15 b1 followed by e2 and c3 driving out the Knight. Now with ... d6 pending, Black threatens either to break with ...f5 or, in some lines, to advance with ...c5-c4.
14 O-O ...
An alternative is 14 O-O-O d6 15 e2. I thought White's King would be safer after the text - the drawback is the K-side Pawns can no longer safely advance. 14 ... d6 Sharp! I had expected 14...c6 15 e2 after which Black must either exchange his only well-placed piece or allow White's Knight to scramble to g3 followed by h5 or f5.
15 g3 ...
The only way to sustain the initiative. On 15 d5 f5 16 xd4 xe4! 17 xe4 fxe4 wins a Pawn. And after 15 e2 f5 gives Black active counterchances. 15 ... h8 On 15...f5 16 h6 f6 17 xg7 xg7 18 xg7+ xg7 19 exf5 6xf5 20 ae1 ae8 21 e4 with a comfortable edge, but certainly no forced win.
16 g4 ...
To prevent ...f5. 16 ... c6 Too passive. Black should seize the opportunity for 16...c5!
17 h5 ...
Threatening 18 xd4 exd4 19 e5. 17 ... e8? Either 17... e6 or ...c5 is essential. 18 xd4 exd4 19 f6! ... The zwischenzug Benko missed. He had expected 19 e5 f5! A bolt from the blue! 19 ... g8 Forced. On 19...dxc3 (or 19... xf6) 20 e5 mates.
20 e5 h6
21 e2! ... Black was hoping for 21 xd6 xe5! and he survives to an ending. 21 ... Black resigns There is no defense to the threat of 22 xd6. On 21... b5 22 f5 wins. Or 21... xf6 22 xh6 forces mate.
47 Fischer - Bisguier [ U.S.A. ]
USA CHAMPIONSHIP 1963-4
RUY LOPEZ
The Indian sign? Bisguier is the one Grandmaster who consistently obtains decent positions against Fischer, only to throw them away for no apparent reason. Out of something like a dozen encounters, he has squeezed but a single draw. Here is the only game in which Bisguier is outplayed from the start. Still, he does catch Fischer napping and nearly escapes. Describing his sensations before the game, Bisguier wrote: "For the first time I was really in doubt as to what Bobby would play against me as White...I was hoping to play the Black side of the King's Gambit or the Two Knights' Defense, but he 'surprised' me with the Ruy Lopez...taken by surprise I was not so prepared or comfortable as I would like to have been. Now that Bobby has added psychology to his arsenal of weapons he is a much more dangerous opponent than ever before."

xg5 (19... xd5 20 f3! e6 21 xe6 fxe6 22 g4!) 20 xg5 xd5 21 ad1 with a plus (LIPNITZKY). 16 g3! ... Bronstein's move - after first interpolating 16 a4 b8. This idea bankrupts Black's strategy. The slight weakening of the K- side is inconsequential, but Black's loss of time with his KN is. Actually the sharpest continuation is 16 a4! as I played against Eliskases at Mar del Plata 1960 (I simply forgot to interpolate it here)
16... b8 17 axb5 axb5 18 g3! g6 19 h4! e6 20 e3 c4 21 g5 xg5
22 hxg5 a5 23 g4 xg4 24 xg4 b3 25 xb3 cxb3 26 e3 with a great advantage. 16 ... g6 Simply 16... f6 may be best. Then on 17 h4 h6 18 e3 e6.
16... xh3 is bad owing to 17 g5 xg5 (if 17... xf1 18 xh5 xg5
19 xg5 f6 20 xf6! gxf6 21 xf1 White's better) 18 xg5 f6 (not
18... xf1? 19 xd8) 19 xf6 gxf6 20 e3 White has more than enough
for the Pawn. 17 h4! ... Bronstein's 17 h2 and Weinstein's 17 g2 are time-consuming and hence weaker. When I told Bronstein (at Mar del Plata 1960) that the text was a tremendous improvement over his game with Reshevsky, he replied: "Of course. After seven years one must find an improvement." 17 ... e6
18 e3 f6
Probably best. 18...c4 19 g5! is similar to the quoted game with Eliskases. 19 d5! ... Of course! Chess is a matter of timing. Given another move or two Black would be able not only to defend himself against this invasion, but even try for the initiative. 19 ... b7 Prudent. "Winning" the Pawn would allow White's Bishop-pair to enter the game with powerful effect: e.g., 19... xd5 20 exd5 xd5 21 c4! d4 22 xd4 xd4 23 cxb5 axb5 24 xb5 and now Eliskases recommends 24...c4 but I fail to see how this improves matters since 25 e3 b8 26 a4 b4? is answered by 27 e8+. 20 xe7+ xe7 White has the two Bishops - or a "half point" advantage.
21 h2 ...
This Knight is also bound for d5. 21 ... g7
22 g4 c4
23 f3! ... Winning the second "minor exchange." On 23... f8 24 e3 the Knight is ready to pounce on d5, especially after Black's Rook has been deflected from the d-file. 23 ... xg4 24 xg4 e6 25 h5? ... More accurate is 25 e3 (25... c5? 26 xc5 xc5 27 e6+ g7 28 ad1 penetrates decisively). 25 ... h8! Alert. I had expected 25...g5 whereupon 26 e3 is even more devastating than before. 26 g2! ... On 26 hxg6 g8 White is in trouble! 26 ... g5 Forced - eventually. On 26... g8 27 h1 gxh5? (27...g5 is better) 28 xh5 f4+ 29 xf4 exf4 30 e5! g7 31 exf6 xf6 32 xh7 wins.
27 e3 f4+!
28 h2! ... 28 gxf4? gxf4 threatening 29... g8 as well as 29...fxe3 regains the piece advantageously. 28 ... d3 29 xd3 cxd3? Now the advanced soldier must fall. Exchanging a pair of Rooks would make it more difficult, but White still maintains his grip after 29... xd3 30 ed1 ad8 31 xd3 cxd3 (31... xd3? 32 c8+ d8 33 xa6) 32 d1 d7 33 d2 threatening a winning bind with 34 c5. 30 ed1 d7 On 30...b4 31 d2 bxc3 32 bxc3 a3 33 ad1 xc3 34 e6 g7 35 h6+! wins.
31 d2 a5
A useless excursion, but there was no good defense. Strangely enough, Black's difficulty stems from his third move and its consequent weakening on b6. If the pawn were still on a7 (preventing a later b6) he might well hold. On 31... ad8 32 ad1 f7 33 b6 b8 34 c5 bd8 35 f3 picks up the d-pawn at leisure.
32 b3 d6
Not 32... c8? 33 xd3! 33 ad1 e8 On 33... ad8 34 xd3 xd3 35 xd3 xd3 36 b6! 34 xd3 xd3 Black is braced to give up his Queen for two Rooks and keep control of the crucial d-file. 35 xd7! Black resigns A devastating X-ray. After 35... xd7 36 xd7 it's just a matter of time. E.g., 35... e6 37 h3 followed by g4-f5, etc.
48 R. Byrne [ U.S.A. ] - Fischer
USA CHAMPIONSHIP 1963-4
GRUENFELD DEFENSE
The brilliancy prize K. F. Kirby, editor of the South African Chess Quarterly, summed up the astonishment and admiration of the chess world when he wrote: "The Byrne game was quite fabulous, and I cannot call to mind anything to parallel it. After White's eleventh move I should adjudicate his position as slightly superior, and at worst completely safe. To turn this into a mating position in eleven more moves is more witchcraft than chess! Quite honestly, I do not see the man who can stop Bobby at this time..." And one can add nothing to Byrne's own words: "And as I sat pondering why Fischer would choose such a line, because it was so obviously lost for Black, there suddenly came 18... xg2. This dazzling move came as the shocker...The culminating combination is of such depth that, even at the very moment at which I resigned, both grandmasters who were commenting on the play for the spectators in a separate room believed that I had a won game!"

It's hard for either side to introduce an imbalance into this essentially symmetrical variation. Deadeye equality also ensues after 10 f4 e6 11 b3 a6 12 e1 c8

A good alternative is 12 c1. A kibitzer later suggested 12 f4?! to prevent...e5. But after 12...e6 followed by ... f8 and eventual doubling on the c-file, Black gets an advantage. 12 ... e5! I was a bit worried about weakening my d-pawn, but felt that the tremendous activity obtained by my minor pieces would permit White no time to exploit it. 12...e6 would probably lead to a draw. 13 dxe5 ... Passive is 13 ac1 exd4 (if 13... c8 14 fd1 e4 15 f3! is tenable) 14 exd4 c8 15 f3 although Black has difficulty breaking through. 13 ... xe5 14 fd1? ... Add another to those melancholy case histories entitled "the wrong Rook." Correct is 14 ad1! Originally I gave the following "refutation": "14... e4 15 xe4 dxe4 16 xe4 xd2 17 xd2 c4 18 xa8 xd2 19 d1 c4 20 bxc4 (best) 20... xa8 regaining the Pawn with a big endgame advantage." But Averbakh found a hole in my analysis with 20 c6! (instead of 20 bxc4 which I had carelessly given as "best"), 20... xa3 21 xe8 xe2 22 d7 and White is the one who wins instead of Black! I spent an evening just staring at the position after 14 ad1, trying everything, unwilling to let my brilliancy go down the drain. The more I looked, the more I liked White's game! For example, 14... c8 (14... d3 is refuted by 15 c2) 15 xd5 xd5 16 xd5 d3 17 g2 c2 18 xc2! kaput. No better is 14... d7 15 c2 followed by d2 and fd1 (if
15... ac8 16 b1!).
Another try which just falls short is 14 ad1 c7 15 c1! e4!? (otherwise 16 b1 consolidates) 16 xd5! xc1 17 xc1 xf1 18 xe4 h3 19 e7+ h8 20 xa8 xa8 21 f4 keeping the extra Pawn. Indeed, how does Black even equalize, let alone sustain the initiative? Finally I found 14... c8! - the only move to keep the pressure. Now on 15 xd5 xd5 16 xd5 d8 17 f4 xd5! 18 xd5 b7! 19 d8+ (if
19 d2 h3! 20 d4 g4 21 fe1 [or 21 c2 h5 with a strong attack]
21... xe3! should win) 19... xd8 20 xd8+ xd8 21 fxe5 xe5 with a
better ending. And on 15 c1 d7! 16 cd1 ad8 Black has finagled a precious tempo, since his Queen is on d7 instead of d8. After 14... c8! relatively best is 15 b2 (if 15 c1 e4 16 xd5 xe2 17 xe4 h8! wins the exchange. One possible line is 18 xc8 axc8 19 e7 c7 20 c1 d7 21 fe1 f3!) although Black keeps the initiative with 15... f5. 14 ... d3!
15 c2 ...
There is hardly any other defense to the threat of ... e4. A] 15 d4 e4 16 xe4 dxe4 17 b2 c8 with a powerful bind. B] 15 f4 e4 16 xe4 dxe4 (not 16... xa1? 17 d6) 17 ab1 c8 18 xd3 c3! 19 e2 xd3 20 g4 f5 21 h3 xb1! 22 xd8 exd8 23 f1 d1 24 g2 d3! 25 xd3 exd3 wins. C] 15 f3 h6 16 f4 (if 16 f4? d4!) 16... g7! resumes the threat of ... e4, only White has weakened himself in the interim. 15 ... xf2! The key to Black's previous play. The complete justification for this sac does not become apparent until White resigns! 16 xf2 g4+

49 Fischer - Steinmeyer [ U.S.A. ]
USA CHAMPIONSHIP 1963-4
CARO-KANN DEFENSE
A complex trap While generally thought of as "one movers," some opening traps are deeper and more beautiful than others because falling into them requires a certain degree of skill. They might not attract and, if they did, might work for an amateur! Steinmeyer's concept beginning with 13... f4+ is both subtle and novel. The only trouble is that it meets with a smashing refutation. Instead of simplifying, as Steinmeyer hopes, his variation enmeshes him in complications. The nail in the coffin is 16 e5, after which Black's Queen can no longer be extricated without fatal loss of material.

White has more space, but only experience can tell whether he has the edge; however the Knight on d3 discourages the normal freeing maneuver ...c5 and/or ...e5. At least it's something to break the monotony. 5 ... g6

White can try to exploit the order of Black's moves by 8 e5, but 8... h7 9 c4 e6 10 e2 d5! (not 10... xd4? 11 xf7!) followed by ... d7 equalizes.

The Queen's retreat is cut off and the ancient weakness on Black's f7 is etched more sharply than ever. Shamkovich- Goldberg, USSR 1961, continued with 16 a5? which won only against inferior defense. 16 ... xf2 What else? 16... xg3 loses to 17 fxg3 xg3 18 d3 f4 19 f3 e4 20 xf7. And 16... xc3+ is refuted by 17 bxc3! g8 (if 17... g4 18 h5! f5 19 xf5 exf5 20 xf7) 18 d3 h5 19 f3 h6 20 xf7, etc. 17 df1! Black resigns Probably what Steinmeyer overlooked when he went into this whole mess. On 17... xg3 18 xf2 e3 (otherwise f3) 19 e2 f4 20 xf7 wins at least the exchange. Motivated by my lopsided result (11-0!), Dr Kmoch congratulated Evans (the runner up) on "winning" the tournament ... and then he congratulated me on "winning the exhibition."
50 Fischer - Celle [ U.S.A. ]
CALIFORNIA 1964: Exhibition Tour
EVANS GAMBIT
Tour de force As one of ten simultaneous clock games played on tour, at Davis College, this is a perfect example of the precept that if White makes a slip in the opening he is punished by loss of the initiative, while if Black makes a slip (since he is skating on thin ice from the very start) it is likely to be fatal. 6...d6 is the offender. With 9 h5 Fischer assumes a commanding control of space, but faces a strong defense which compels him to offer a piece in order to maintain pressure. Continuing with restraint and circumspection, he builds up the attack with a series of quiet developing moves - reminiscent of Morphy's famous victory over the Duke of Brunswick at the Paris opera. When the time is ripe, Fischer throws everything at Black's King, including the proverbial kitchen sink. His show of brute force is handsomely rewarded.
[diagram]
Must be the trend. At least, on tour most players answered this way. For 5... a5 see game 44.
6 d4 d6?
A mistake is usually much more serious in these open games. Black must return the Pawn with 6... a5! 7 xe5 xc4 8 xc4 d5! 7 dxe5 xe5 On 7... a5? 8 xf7+! xf7 9 d5+ e6 10 xa5 wins a Pawn. 7... dxe5 8 b3 a5 9 xf7+ f8 10 a4 is strong. 8 xe5 dxe5 9 h5! ... In an earlier exhibition game I played 9 b3 but got nothing after 9... e6! 10 xe6 fxe6 11 a3!? (if 11 xe6 d6=) 11... d3! 9 ... g6 10 xe5 f6 On 10...f6 11 b5+! c6? 12 b3 f8 13 xg8! wins. 11 a3! ... Incredible how Black is so completely immobilized by this one move! 11 ... f8 The only way to get relief. 11... f8? works in all lines except 12 xf6!
12 O-O g4
12... d7 followed by ... b6 might be better, but this certainly looked
good at the time.
13 g3 xa3
14 xa3 e7! Apparently Black has freed his game. If now 15 c2 e5 virtually forces an exchange of Queens. 15 b5 is rendered harmless by ... e5. How's White to sustain the initiative? 15 b5+! ... That's how. This forces Black to weaken himself on d6, although White must sacrifice a piece to exploit it. 15 ... c6 On 15... d7 16 xc7 (not 16 xg4 c6!). 16 c4! e6! Some fascinating possibilities appear after 16...cxb5 17 d6+ d8 18 fd1 d7 19 xb7+ c8 20 d6+ d8 21 d4! e5 22 ad1 c7 (if

Black may not have seen the mate, but he suspected the worst! 17 ad1! ... Piling on the pressure. White mustn't amateurishly rush in with 17 c7 d7! forcing him to simplify by 18 d6+ e7 19 xc8+ axc8 20 xd7+ xd7, etc., and the advantage has evaporated. 17 ... cxb5 He might as well take it since after 17... d7 18 d6+ e7 19 c4 White wins a Pawn without any risk.
18 c7 d7
Forced. 19 d6+ e7 20 f5+! ... The attack needs fresh fuel. Material is not what counts now, but open lines. Black is forced to capture against his will. 20... e8 is out because of 21 g7+. And 20... f6 21 d6 gxf5 22 xd7! wins outright. 20 ... gxf5 21 exf5 ac8 On 21... xf5 22 d6+ d8 (22... e8 23 fe1+ e6 24 d7 mate) 23 xf8+ c7 24 xa8 wins. 22 xd7+! xd7 23 f6+! ... Originally I intended 23 e1+ e5 24 xe5+ f6 25 xd7 xe5 26 xb5+ with a won ending. But then I remembered Emanuel Lasker's maxim: "When you see a good move - wait - don't play it - you might find a better one." 23 ... xf6 Not 23... e8? 24 e1+ e6 25 xc8 mate. On 23... xf6 24 xd7. 24 e1+ ... Note the amusing piece configuration. All Black's pieces are stepping on each other's toes. 24 ... e4 The only legal move! 25 xe4+ f6 26 xd7 fd8

Here I forgot Lasker's maxim. 27 e7+ would have forced mate in four. 27 ... Black resigns
51 Fischer - Smyslov [ U.S.S.R. ]
HAVANA 1965
RUY LOPEZ
Squeeze play Fischer competed in this Capablanca Memorial Tournament by long-distance telephone, and his victory over the winner is reminiscent of the famous Lasker-Capablanca duel at St. Petersburg, 1914, where Black was also gradually constricted and strangled. Taken by surprise with an antiquated line (5 d3), Smyslov soon gets into trouble. He finds a way out, although it burdens him with doubled King Pawns. After the subsequent exchange of Queens he apparently underestimates White's winning chances and permits himself to drift into a cramped ending. Applying persistent pressure, Fischer makes gradual inroads; the defensive task eventually proves too great and Smyslov buckles under the strain.
[diagram]
5 d3 ...
Steinitz's favorite, long abandoned, and the first time I've employed it in a tournament game. 5 ... d6 A solid but passive reaction. An alternative is 5...b5 6 b3 e7 7 a4, etc. Anderssen-Morphy, match 1858(!) continued: 5... c5 6 c3 b5 7 c2 O-O 8 O-O d5 9 exd5 xd5 10 h3 h6 (Steinitz had a field day criticizing White's last two moves) 11 d4 exd4 with a satisfactory game for Black.
[diagram]
On 6...g6 7 bd2 (or Bronstein's 7 g5) 7... g7 8 f1 O-O 9 h4 opens fresh vistas. 7 bd2 O-O
8 f1 ...
One facet of White's strategy is to defer castling and possibly institute a K-side attack with h3, g4, etc. Furthermore, this Knight can be deployed to e3 or g3 immediately without having to waste a tempo (after having castled) with e1. 8 ... b5
9 b3 d5
Inconsistent, after having lost a tempo with ...d6. Right is 9... a5 10 c2 c5 11 e3 e8 12 O-O f8 with equal chances.
10 e2 dxe4
Opens the position prematurely. No better would be 10...d4 11 g3 dxc3 12 bxc3 b4 13 d2. Black should keep tension in the center with
10... e6 11 g3 (if 11 g5 g4 12 f3 c8! 13 exd5 a5!) 11...h6.
11 dxe4 e6! I was surprised that Smyslov was prepared to saddle himself with doubled King Pawns, but surmised that it must be all right since he doesn't do such things lightly. Anyway Black's game, without this exchange, would remain permanently cramped. 12 xe6 fxe6
13 g3 ...
This Knight is undeniably misplaced here, but White intends to castle and then regroup his pieces in order to bring maximum pressure to bear on the doubled Pawns. 13 ... d7 Some annotators suggested the obvious 13... d6 (followed by e7-g6, etc.) but Black has no time for such sophisticated strategy: e.g., 14 O-O e7 15 c4! c6 16 d1 winning material (if 16... c7 17 g5).
14 O-O ...
During the game I was kicking myself for allowing the subsequent exchange of Queens. Sharper is 14 a4 ad8 (if 14...bxa4 15 c4 a3 16 b4) 15 axb5 axb5 16 a6 b4 17 O-O and Black can no longer ease his burden with ... d3. So correct is 14...b4! 14 ... ad8 Suddenly Black's plan hit me! At first I thought he just wanted to control the d-file; but now I realized he was scheming to chop wood.
15 a4 d3!
Of course! With the Queens gone, it's that much harder to strike at Black's weaknesses. 16 xd3 xd3 17 axb5 axb5 18 a6! ... Forcing Black's reply, and thus preventing the freeing maneuver with ... c5. 18 e3 would be met by ... g4. 18 ... d6 19 h1! ... The threat was 19... d4 forcing a favorable series of exchanges. 19 ... d7
19...b4 20 cxb4 xb4 21 a7 c6 22 xe5 c2 would give Black
active play for the Pawn.
20 e3 d8
20...b4 is still playable. Neither of us realized at this stage how
essential this move was. I didn't want to weaken my c3 and c4 squares by playing b4 to prevent it; and Smyslov didn't want to commit himself yet.
21 h3 ...
More accurate is 21 b4, from which I abstained for the reasons already mentioned. 21 ... h6 22 fa1 db8
23 a8 d1+
24 h2 ...
On 24 xd1 xd1+ 25 h2 d6 holds (26 a7? a1!). 24 ... xa1 25 xa1 ... 25 ... d7? When I spoke to Smyslov on the direct phone line immediately after the game, he congratulated me on a beautiful performance and attributed his loss to his reluctance to play ...b4 at some point - and this is his last chance. After 25...b4 26 cxb4 xb4 27 f1 Black obtains much more freedom than in the actual game, and eliminates a weakness (his b-pawn) as well. Perhaps Smyslov feared that in this line White could maneuver his Knight to c4; even so, this is hardly fatal. 26 b4! ... Smyslov confessed that he felt Black was probably lost after this riposte. But the win is far from easy, and Black might later have improved upon his defense. 26 ... f7
27 f1 d6
28 g3 ...
Once and for all negating all possible combinations with ... d4. 28 ... f6 29 1d2 e7 30 a6! b8 Very uncomfortable is 30... d7 31 e1 b8 32 a5 c6. 31 a5! ... Now White strengthens his bind by forcing ...c6 which takes away another breathing space from Black's pieces. 31 ... c6
32 g2 bd7
33 f1 ...
Preparing to bring the King to e2 where it can support the e1-d3 maneuver. 33 ... c8? A surprise! I had expected the much stouter defense with 33... e8! (intending to exchange Rooks with ... c7 and ... a8). After 34 a6 c8
35 b3 c5 36 bxc5 xc5! Black can hold. And there is no time for 34
e1 c7 35 d3 a8 36 b3 xa5 37 xa5 b8 38 a7 ca6 39 c4 c7. The main line is 33... e8 34 b3! c7 35 a7 a8 36 a5 b8 37 xa8 (if 37 b7 d7) 37... xa8 38 a7 d7 39 b7. It looks bad, but Black has chances to survive in the absence of a forced win. 34 e1! e8 Too late now.
35 d3 c7
36 c4! bxc4
36... a8? is refuted by 37 c5! winning a piece.
37 xc4 ... The ideal position! Finally White has ganged up on Black's venerable weakness - his Pawn on e5. 37 ... b5 On 37... a8 38 xa8 xa8 39 a5 b8 40 a7 d7 41 c4 picks off the e-pawn.

White can win with 44 c1 d4 45 d7+ e7 (if 45... f7 46 xb8 xb8 47 xb8 b3 48 a3 c2 49 c6, etc.) 46 xb8 b3 47 b7+ d8 48 d7+ e8 49 xg7!
52 Fischer - Rossolimo [ U.S.A. ]
U.S.A. CHAMPIONSHIP 1965-6
FRENCH DEFENSE
Peekaboo strategy The McCutcheon Variation gives rise to unusual positions where White is frequently obliged to forfeit the privilege of castling in order to try and wrest an advantage. After some slight but instructive opening inexactitudes on both sides, Rossolimo appears to achieve equality. Indeed, he is constantly on the brink of crashing through with a counter-attack against White's vulnerable King, although his own monarch is also stranded in the center. After 13...f5, which shores up his fortress, it's not clear just whose attack will come first. In a theoretically important formation - a logical offshoot of this variation - Fischer unearths two fine moves (17 b5+ and 19 g1) to sustain his flagging initiative. Still, he is forced to wage a running battle, no sooner landing a blow than having to duck. Consequently, the outcome is in doubt until the very last punch.

12 f4 ...
Possibly better is 12 ab1, restraining the development of Black's Q- side. 12 ... c7 Better is the natural 12... a5 (if 12...g5 13 f6! xf6 14 exf6 g4 15 e5 cxd4 16 cxd4 xd4 17 h3 with a better ending) 13 ab1 (if 13 hb1 b6 14 a4 a6 15 b5 c8 16 dxc5 bxc5 17 xc6+ xc6 18 b8+ c8 holds) 13...b6 14 dxc5 xc5 15 d4 xd4 16 cxd4 a5+ with equality.

At least Black's King reaches safety in this line. 16 gxf5 exf5 17 b5+! ... 17 ... f8? On 17... c6 (if 17... d7 18 xd7+ xd7 19 e6!) 18 xc6+ bxc6 (18... xc6 is again met by 19 e6! xe6 20 e5 d6 21 xg6 xf4+ 22 xf4 and the Knight beats the Bishop in the ending) 19 hg1, etc. Black's best chance, however, is to try and reach sanctuary with 17... d8! 18 d3 e6. White undoubtedly has the initiative, but it's hard to get at the King.
18 d3 ...
Mission accomplished. Now Black's King is pinioned to the K-side. 18 ... e6 19 g1! ... The key move. This Knight is headed for f4 where it can exert maximum pressure on the g-Pawn. 19 ... f7
20 h3 ac8!?
Quite rightly. Rossolimo prefers active defense. After 20... ag8 White eventually triples on the g-file (bringing his Knight to f4) with a crushing bind. 21 hg1 ... 21 ... b6 This takes a5 away from the Queen, eliminating any possible defenses there with check.

53 Portisch [ Hungary ] - Fischer
SANTA MONICA 1966
NIMZO INDIAN DEFENSE
Black magic Here is one of the few instances when Fischer does not employ the fianchetto of his King's Bishop as a defense to the QP. By ignoring White's gambit on move nine he lays the groundwork for the positional trap (11... d7) into which Portisch falls (14 xa8). Normally, two Rooks for the Queen is a good trade - better than good when it produces a setting in which the scope and power of the Rooks may be formidable. But Portisch's judgment is faulty, he fails to take into account the weakness of his Pawns. This is one of the rare occasions when the Queen can run rampant, and she does. Still, the question remains: how did Black manage to weave his spell? To achieve a winning endgame within fifteen moves, against a specialist with White in this opening, is an almost unheard of feat.

This has been fashionable for some time. Spassky's offbeat 4 g5 leads to no advantage after 4...h6 5 h4 c5 6 d5 d6 7 e3 xc3+! 8 bxc3 e5, etc. The two Knights are better than the Bishops in such closed formations. 4 ... b6! Other moves have been analyzed to death. 5 ge2 ... Reshevsky-Fischer, US Championship 1966, continued: 5 d3 b7 6 f3 O-O (sharper is 6... e4! 7 O-O f5 [or 7... xc3! 8 bxc3 xc3 9 b1 c6! and White hasn't got enough for his Pawn] 8 xe4 fxe4 9 d2 xc3 10 bxc3 O-O 11 g4 f5!= Gligorich-Larsen, Havana 1967. Not 12 xe4? h5) 7 O-O xc3 (7...d5 is an alternative) 8 bxc3 e4 9 c2 and now 9... xf3! (instead of 9... xd3) 10 gxf3 c5 would lead to an exciting positional struggle - two Knights vs. two Bishops, but White's Pawn formation is shaky. 5 ... a6 Bronstein's active idea, trying to profit from White's last move. I had adopted it with success in the 1966 US Championship. A very interesting try is 5... e4!? as in the 1967 USSR Championship. Taimanov-Levin continued 6 c2 b7 7 f3 (7 a3 is better), and now instead of 7... xc3+ (as in the game) 7... xc3! 8 xc3 (8 bxc3 d6! 9 e4 c6 with good play against White's doubled c-pawn) 8... h4+ 9 f2 xc3+ 10 bxc3 xf2+ 11 xf2 a6! threatening... c6-a5 with at least equality.

Somewhat inconsistent. The whole point is to play 6 a3 so that after

White a slight edge, as demonstrated in the 1954 Botvinnik-Smyslov match) 7 xc3 White can avoid doubling his c-Pawn. After 7...d5 8 b3 O-O 9 a4 c6 I reached this position, as Black, twice in the 1966 US Championship. Addison played 10 b2? and got the worst of it after

The whole idea is dubious. No better is 8 a3 dxc4! 9 f3 d5 10 e4 c6 and White hasn't got enough for the Pawn. Simply 8 cxd5 leads to level play. It is White's insistence on seeking the initiative that lands him in trouble.
8 ... O-O
9 e4!? ... Right is 9 cxd5 exd5 (not 9... xf1? 10 dxe6!) 10 xa6 xa6 11 e2 c8 12 O-O c5 13 dxc5 xc5 14 c4=. The text involves a gambit which Portisch probably had expected me to accept. 9 ... dxe4! An improvement over 9...dxc4!? which I had played against Saidy in the 1966 US Championship: 10 g5 h6 11 d2? (right is 11 h4! b7! 12 xf6 xf6 13 xf6 gxf6 14 xc4 or White might try to continue the attack with 12 h5!? bd7! - but not 12...hxg5? 13 hxg5 xe4 14 f6+!! wins - Spassky) 11... bd7 12 e5 d5 13 f5 (if 13 h5 h4!)
13...exf5 14 xd5 e8! 15 xc4 (or 15 O-O-O c5) 15... xe5! 16 xd8
xc4+ 17 xe8+ xe8+ 18 d1 xd2 19 xd2 e2+ with an easily won endgame. 10 xe4 xe4 11 xe4 d7!! The finest move in the game, far superior to the "natural" 11... d7 12 d3 f6 13 h4 with two Bishops and a beautiful development despite the doubled Pawns. Black can well afford to give up two Rooks for a Queen (after 12 xa8? c6), as will soon become apparent. The text prepares... c6-a5 hitting the "weakling," as Alekhine used to call that kind of a target.
12 a3 ...
White gets the worst of it after 12 d3 f5 13 e2 c6, etc. Still, this was a prudent choice. 12 ... e8
13 d3 ...
13 O-O-O seems more consistent, making a real fight of it. Such double-
edged lines, however, are not to Portisch's taste. 13 ... f5 14 xa8? ... Very bad judgment, White should resist temptation and try to hold on with 14 e2. His doubled c-Pawn, though weak, is not fatal. As the game goes, however, it is. 14 ... c6 15 xe8+ xe8
16 O-O a5
17 ae1 xc4 Too routine. Crushing is 17... a4! E.g., 18 b4 (if 18 c1 xc4 19 xc4 xc4 should easily win) 18... xc4 19 xc4 xc4 20 xe6 a5 21 e7 d2! 22 fe1 e4 23 f3 xa2! Curtains. 18 xc4 ... If 18 xf5? a4 wins. 18 ... xc4
19 c1 c5
20 dxc5 ... White cannot hold the ending. If 20 d5? simply...e5. 20 ... bxc5
21 f4 h6!
Preparing to expand on the K-side, which cannot be prevented.
22 e2 ...
If 22 h4 e5! 23 xe5 xe5 24 f4 f3+! 25 gxf3 a4 and White's Pawns are too loose. 22 ... g5
23 e5 d8
24 fe1 ... On 24 f4 d2! 25 fe1 e4 ties White up. 24 ... f7
25 h3 f4
26 h2 a6
Taking care of details, so that the Pawn will not be within the Bishop's reach after 26... d5 27 b8, etc.
27 e4 d5!
The Queen is boss. Black's superiority is obvious. He has some minor threats, and a major one which cannot be met. To the surprise of no one, Sovietski Sport, a Soviet magazine, reported that Portisch had blundered and thrown away a perfectly even endgame.
28 h4 ...
After the comparatively better 28 4e2, Black wins more slowly with
28... f3! 29 gxf3 (or 29 e4 fxg2 followed by... d2 wins) 29... d2, etc.
28 ... e3! Wins the exchange, as 29 f3 fails against 29... d2 30 g1 f2. 29 1xe3 fxe3 30 xe3 xa2 31 f3+ e8
32 g7 c4
33 hxg5 hxg5 34 f8+ ... A check before dying. 34 ... d7
35 a8 c6
White resigns The ominous presence of Black's a-pawn is the deciding factor.
54 Fischer - Najdorf [ Argentina ]
SANTA MONICA 1966
Najdorf's night off from the Najdorf This game follows a loss (with Black) to Najdorf earlier in the tournament. Here, Najdorf adopts the Sicilian but not his Variation - perhaps because he had lost with it previously. (See game 40.) White soon launches a sharp line, a curious violation of principle involving three consecutive Bishop sorties before his other men have been developed. In relatively uncharted terrain, both players miss their way on move twelve. It then becomes a question of whether Najdorf's doubled center Pawns are a mass or a mess. Fischer proceeds to exploit his slight advantage with restraint, gradually building up pressure against Black's uncastled King. At the right moment he offers a stunning Pawn sacrifice (26 c5). Najdorf is compelled to decline, whereupon he lands in a hopeless endgame. This forceful and resourceful performance typified Fischer's surge throughout the last half of the 2nd Piatigorsky Cup.
[diagram]
Najdorf avoids the Najdorf Variation.
[diagram]
4... f6 obliges 5 c3, which precludes the Maroczy Bind by c4. Ever
since ways of combatting the "Bind" have been found, it has become almost an obsession to abstain from 4... f6, although the most that can be said for other moves is that some of them may be as good.
5 b5 ...
Alekhine was of the opinion that 5 c4 is best, but it has since been discovered that White cannot maintain any advantage after 5... f6 6 c3 b4, etc. 5 ... d6 6 f4!? ... Sharpest. Objectively speaking, it is probably best to establish an immediate Maroczy Bind with 6 c4. 6 ... e5 After 6... e5!? 7 1a3! (Bronstein's idea) is best. But not Euwe's suggestion to win a Pawn by 7 d4 a6 8 xd6+?? xd6 9 xe5 because of 9... a5+! (ZUCKERMAN).
[diagram]
Black can avoid the doubling of his Pawns by 7...a6 8 5c3 f6 9 g5 e7. However, Najdorf may have been worried about 9 c4! Fischer- Badilles, Manila 1967, then continued: 9... e7 10 d5! xd5 11 xd5 O-O 12 c3 with absolute control of d5. After the text, 8 c4 is met simply by 8... e6! (but not 8... xe4?? 9 d5 e6 10 xe4 d5 11 xd5! and wins) 9 xe6 fxe6 10 c4! e7= (not 10... xe4? 11 g4). 8 g5!? ... Another of Bronstein's ideas. The customary line was 8 1c3 and after
8...a6 9 a3 Black has 3 possibilities:
A] 9...b5 10 d5 xd5 (or 10... b8 11 xf6+ xf6 12 b1! with an edge for White) 11 exd5 e7 12 c4 with advantage. B] Simagin gives 9... e6 10 d5 xd5! 11 exd5 e7 12 c4 f5 with harmonious development for all of Black's pieces. Or 10 c4 b5 11 b6 b8 12 bd5 xd5 13 exd5 e7 with a good game. But 13 xd5!? (instead of 13 exd5) launches a promising gambit (13... xe4 14 f3 c5 15 O-O-O). C] Best is 9... b8! 10 g5 b5= Aronin-Taimanov, USSR Championship 1962. 11 d5 is met by 11... a5+ forcing 12 d2 then
12... d8 and White has made no progress. On 13 xf6+ xf6 14 b1
b4! and White must regroup his forces. The third consecutive Bishop sortie is well-motivated since White is threatening to double Black's f-Pawn. 8 ... e6? Also weak is 8...a6 9 xf6 gxf6 10 5c3 f5? 11 h5! d4 12 c4 c7 13 d2 xc2+ 14 e2 xa1 (Bronstein-Polugayevsky, USSR Championship 1964) and now simply 15 xa1! must win out. Another try is 11... g7!? (instead of 11... d4) 12 c4 O-O 13 exf5 d4 14 d3 e8 15 e4! (not 15 f6? as in Estrin-Tcherepkov, Leningrad 1964). For instance, 15...d5 16 xd5 xf5 17 xf5 xd5 18 c3 xg2? 19 e4 xc2+ 20 e2 d4+ 21 e3, etc. But Black could equalize immediately with 8... a5+! 9 d2 (or 9 d2 d8 draws) 9... xe4 10 xa5 xa5 11 e3 (R.Byrne suggests 11 c7+? d7 12 xa8 xg5 13 b5+, but after 13... d8! 14 c3 d7 15 O-O-O e7 White's straying Knight is soon lost) 11... d7 12 xa7 d5, etc. 9 1c3 ... After 9 c4 h6! 10 xf6 gxf6 Black's position is excellent. 9 ... a6 10 xf6 gxf6
11 a3 d4
Other possibilities (all favoring White) are: A] 11...b5 12 d5! B] 11... e7 12 c4! C] 11...f5? 12 c4 xc4 13 xc4 fxe4 14 xe4 d5 15 xd5! 12 c4? ... Correct is 12 c4 and if 12... c8 13 e3 h6 (if 13... b6 simply 14 b1) 14 d3 g8 15 h5! snuffs out Black's initiative. 12 ... b5 Sharper is 12...d5! 13 xd5 (if 13 exd5 xa3 14 bxa3 a5) 13... xa3 14 bxa3 a5+ 15 f1 (or 15 c3 xd5 16 xd5 xc3+ 17 f1 c8! with advantage) 15...O-O-O with active play: e.g., 16 c3, then... b5, etc. 13 xe6 ... Of course not the tempting 13 d5? b4. 13 ... fxe6 All in all this exchange benefits Black since it enables him to protect his weak squares (d5 and f5). However if (as in the sequence) his central Pawn mass can be restrained, then it becomes merely a fixed target subject to constant pressure.
14 e2 c6
Black should get some scope for his pieces by 14... xe2! 15 xe2 d5. The check looming on h5 is not to be feared.
15 g3 ...
15 c4 at once is met by 15... a5+
15 ... d7? Dr. Kmoch recommends 15...d5! Or 15... a5+! 16 c3 b4 and if 17 c4 c5.
16 c4 d4
17 O-O b4
"Castling Q-side is a risk Black's insurance company would not permit him to take." (R.Byrne) The text later enables White to use this b-Pawn to pry open the a-file (after a3). Better is 17... g7.
18 c2 xc2
19 xc2 h5 20 fd1 h4

Better is 21...h3 22 g3 c6 with reasonable play. 22 a3! h3

24 xa3 c6 25 e2! f5 Hoping to trade his h-Pawn for the e-Pawn in the event of 26 h5+. But White now is ready to exploit Black's poor development. 26 c5! ... More than a glancing blow. Black can know nothing about the imminent destruction of his compact mass of center Pawns. 26 ... xe4
26...dxc5 (if 26... xc5 27 h5+ followed by exf5, etc.) 27 h5+
e7 28 ad3 fxe4 29 3d2 is quite hopeless for Black. 27 xe4 fxe4 28 cxd6 ... Black's game is in ruins - note his pathetic triplets on the e-file. The rest is technique. 28 ... h6 To prevent e3-c4.

55 Fischer - Bednarsky [ Poland ]
HAVANA OLYMPIC 1966
The price of incaution Once more Fischer rehabilitates his pet move (6 c4) against his favorite Najdorf Variation, and it is remarkable that he should continue to win with such ease. In fact, his opponents do not seem to offer serious resistance. Young Bednarsky apparently is caught napping, improvises, and loses in just 22 moves! Seeking active counterplay, Bednarsky blunders through bravado. He takes a tainted Pawn (9... fxe4) and impetuously pursues the attack only to find himself in an ambush which, ironically, he had helped to construct. By move 12 Fischer obtains a formation at which he had had success even as a child. Naturally he wins, but the economy with which he does so is delightful.
[diagram]
6 c4 ...
Here we go again! 6 ... e6 Probably best. White's Bishop is made to "bite on granite."
7 b3 ...
Too slow is Bronstein's idea 7 a3. E.g., Robatsch-Fischer, Havana 1965: 7... e7 8 a2 O-O 9 O-O b5 10 f4 b7 11 f5 e5 (Black is healthy as long as White can't exploit his hole on d5) 12 de2 bd7 13 g3 c8
14 e3 (if 14 g5 xc3! 15 bxc3 xe4 with advantage - Gligorich) 14...
b6 15 xb6 xb6+ 16 h1 e3! (to prevent h5) with the better game for Black. White would of course like to get in f4-f5 as swiftly as possible, but he must exercise some caution. The text is essentially a waiting move which narrows Black's options. After 7 f4 Black has a choice of 7...d5, 7...b5, or 7... xe4 8 xe4 d5. 7 ... bd7 In order to reach c5 with an attack on the Bishop as well as the e- Pawn. But 7...b5! is better (see game 17). An example of static White play is Garcia-Fischer, Havana Olympic 1966: 8 a3 e7 9 e3 O-O 10 0-
0 b7 11 f3 bd7 12 d2 (12 xe6!? leads to rough equality) 12... e5
13 f2 c7 14 ac1 h8! 15 ce2 g8! 16 h1 g5! 17 h3 g6 18 g3
ag8 (White is curiously helpless against the threat of...h5 and...g4. His normal break with f4 is restrained by the silent Bishop on b7) 19 xe6? fxe6 20 xe6 xe4! 21 xe4 xe6 White resigns. After 7...b5 recent analysis indicates that Black's best plan is rapid development on the Q-side: 8 f4 b7 9 f5 e5 10 de2 bd7 11 g5 e7. Now on 12 g3? (Correct is 12 xf6 xf6 13 d3 c8 with even chances - Fischer-Zuckerman, US Championship 1966) 12... c8! 13 O-O h5! White's in trouble, as indicated by the following examples: A] 14 h4 b4 15 xf6 xf6 16 d5 xh4 17 xh5!? g5 18 f6 g6 19 g7+ d8 20 f3 g3 21 d3 h2+ 22 f1 c5 23 h3!? h4! 24 f3 xb3 25 axb3 xh3 26 xh3 xd5 27 exd5 xf6+ 28 e1 f4 and since there's nothing left - but emptiness - White resigns. (R.Byrne- Fischer, Tunisia Interzonal, 1967) B] 14 xf6 xf6 15 d5 h4 16 xf6+ gxf6 17 e2 xe4 18 d5 b6+ 19 h1 xd5 20 xd5 xc2 21 d3 c6 22 ac1 h3! (Ciocaltea- Gheorghiu, Bucharest 1967.) 8 f4! c5!? Too passive is 8... e7 9 f3 O-O 10 g4. Bad is 8...b5 9 f5! e5 10 c6! c7 11 b4! and White is ready to sit on Black once he occupies the hole on d5. 9 f5! ... Thematic. Bednarsky told me after the game he had reached this position before, as White, and he had continued 9 e5 dxe5 10 fxe5 fd7
11 f4 vs. Bogdanovich, East Germany 1964. Obviously that approach is
too tame. 9 ... fxe4!? Playing with fire. The question is whether 9...e5 is sufficient. Apparently not, after 10 de2 xb3 (not 10... cxe4? 11 xe4 xe4 12 d5 g5 13 h4) 11 axb3 h6 12 g3 followed by h5 with a bind. R.Byrne-Bogdanovich, Sarajevo 1967.
9... e7 is steadier than the text (for 9... xb3 10 axb3 see note to
White's 7th move in game 58). But White stays on top after 10 f3 O-O 11 e3. Now on 11...d5 12 exd5 xb3 13 xb3! exf5 (if 13... xd5? 14 O-O-O wins a Pawn) 14 O-O-O, etc. 10 fxe6! ... 10 ... h4+? Tempting, but suicidal. Black had two better tries: A] 10... xe6 11 xe4 xe4 12 xe6 fxe6 (not 12... h4+ 13 g3 xg3 14 g5! e4+ 15 d2 xh1 16 c7+ d7 17 xa8 wins) 13 g4 c5 14 e3! with a strong initiative. B] 10...fxe6! 11 xe4 xe4 12 O-O e7! (weaker is 12... c5 13 g4 - if 13... xb3 14 axb3 e5 15 f3). White has good play for the Pawn, but no forced win in view.
11 g3 xg3
12 f3! ... This twist is well known: e.g., from the Vienna 1 e4 e5 2 c3 f6 3 f4 d5 4 fxe5 xe4 5 d3 h4+ 6 g3 xg3 7 f3, etc. Only not 12 exf7+? d8 13 f3 e7+! 12 ... h5 13 exf7+ d8
14 g1 f5
15 d5! xf7 Black's attack has boomeranged. Now his King gets caught in a merciless crossfire. On 15...h6 16 f4! picks off the Queen. No better is 15... xb3 16 g5+ d7 (or 16... e7 17 xe7! xe7 18 xd6+) 17 e5+! 16 g5+ e8 17 e2+! ... By now I was hunting for bigger game than the paltry win of a Queen after 17 f6+ gxf6 18 xf7+. 17 ... e6
18 f4 d7
19 O-O-O ...
One threat of course is 20 e5+. 19 ... e8 Black is helpless. After 19... xb3+ 20 axb3 e8 21 ge1 g8 22 d3 it's also quits. The only way for Black to last is to give up his Queen with 19... xb3 20 e5+ c7 21 xf7 xf7. 20 xe6+ xe6 21 e4! ... Centralization with a vengeance! 21 ... g6 22 xe6 Black resigns On 22... xe6 23 xb7+ e8 24 ge1! wins everything.
56 Fischer - Gligorich [ Yugoslavia ]
HAVANA OLYMPIC 1966
RUY LOPEZ
The Fischer continuation Fischer's surprising 4 xc6, a revival of Emanuel Lasker's Exchange Variation - the one he used at St. Petersburg in 1914 to defeat Alekhine and Capablanca, but which subsequently fell into desuetude because ways to equalize were rapidly discovered - drew from his opponent the obligatory response. However, Fischer's next move, regarded as inferior, and his sixth (the customary follow-up) prepared no one for the gambit which he introduced on move seven. Gligorich reacted with innocent appropriateness until move seventeen, then made a startling blunder that met with speedy retribution. Because, in the course of the tournament, Fischer had played and won two other games with this very same line (demonstrating in each case White's hitherto unsuspected potential), it was promptly dubbed "The Fischer Variation." Of course, sticklers will insist that it should be called the Fischer continuation of the Barendregt Variation.
[diagram]
4 xc6! ... A surprise! I had introduced this in an earlier game against Portisch (see note to Black's 6th). After sizing up Gligorich over-the-board, I decided he was ripe for a repeat performance. 4 ... dxc6 This recapture is so automatic that most annotators fail to comment on it. After 4...bxc6 5 d4 exd4 6 xd4 White maintains an enduring initiative, If 6... f6 7 d3! (but not 7 e5 g6 8 O-O b7 9 e6? fxe6 10 e5 xg2+! 11 xg2 c5+ - an old trap.)
5 O-O! ...
"The text poses more problems for Black than does an immediate 5 d4 and Nimzovich is once more proved right in his pronouncement that the threat is stronger than its execution. Though White has sold his strong Bishop for a Knight, a Bishop which is usually Black's main strategical problem in many variations of the Lopez, there is no basic flaw in White's tactics. He has gained a tempo for development, somewhat spoiled Black's Pawn structure and revived the threat on Black's e- Pawn." (GLIGORICH). The text was favored by Emanuel Lasker, Bernstein and also, in recent years, by the Dutch master Barendregt. I had been pondering it for a long time before deciding to include it in my arsenal. 5 ... f6! "This position has not been seen frequently in the modern grandmaster praxis and, thanks to imaginative Fischer, we have to go back to the 19th century to find the alternatives for Black. It is not clear, however, that Black has any better way of defending the e-Pawn."
(GLIGORICH).
Black can defend his e-Pawn in numerous ways. Let's look at the lemons first. A] 5... e7? (played by Reshevsky) 6 xe5! d4 7 f3 xe4 8 e1 (instead of 8 d3? as in Malesich-Reshevsky, Maribor 1967) and it's doubtful Black can get out of the opening with equality. One example,
8... f5 9 b3! f6 10 a3 (or 10 e5!) 10... e6 11 d4, etc.
B] The ballet dancer Harmonist showed good sense by trying 5... f6 with the threat of... g4 (against Schallopp in Frankfurt 1887) but after
6 d4 exd4 7 g5! g6 8 xd4 White can get a clear initiative.
C] 5... d6? 6 d4 exd4 (not 6...f6? 7 dxe5 fxe5 8 xe5! - or 6... g4 7 dxe5 xf3 8 xf3 with a comfortable K-side Pawn majority, as in Schallopp-Blackburne, Frankfurt 1887) 7 xd4 f6 8 bd2! e7 9 c4, etc. D] A reasonable try is Bronstein's 5... d6!? 6 d3 (6 a3? works well against 6... e6? 7 g5 but 6...b5! strands the Knight) 6...f6 7 e3 c5 8 bd2 e6 9 e2 O-O-O=. White has possibilities of breaking on the Q- side after a3 followed by fb1 and b4, but Black can probably prevent this expansion. So best is 5... d6 6 d4 exd4 7 xd4, etc. E] The most ambitious continuation is 5... g4!? 6 h3 h5!? (Em. Lasker used to win such positions for White after 6... xf3 7 xf3. Hort- Kolarov, Poland 1967, continued: 7... f6 8 g3 d6 9 d3 g6 10 e3!? xg3 11 fxg3 and White managed to grind out a win in the ensuing endgame) 7 d3! (On 7 c3 d3! 8 hxg4 hxg4 9 xe5 d6! 10 xd3 h2+ draws. A fantasy variation occurs after 8 b3? xf3 9 xb7 d7 10 xa8 xg2! 11 xg2 h6! 12 g1 g6+ 13 h2 xg1 14 xg1 c5 with a winning attack) 7... f6 8 bd2! (Keres in his old book on the open games wrongly praises this whole line for Black, having considered only 8 hxg4? hxg4 9 g5 h6 10 h3 h4 11 h2 g6 12 c3 gxh3 13 g3 e7 with advantage) 8... e7 (now 8...g5 is met by 9 c4! xf3 10 xf3 xf3 11 gxf3 f6 12 h4! gxh4 13 f4 with promising play for the Pawn. But not 9 e1? e6 10 d4 g4 11 xe5 gxh3 12 g3 h2+ 13 g2 h4 with initiative) 9 e1! (or 9 c4! xf3 10 xf3 xf3 11 gxf3 g6 12 e3 c5 13 a4! White stands better and eventually won. Hort-Sliwa, Poland 1967) 9... g6 10 d4! d6 11 hxg4 hxg4 12 h2 xh2! 13 xg4! h4 14 f5 and White is slightly better.
6 d4 g4!
Best. In our earlier game Portisch had tried 6...exd4 7 xd4! c5 (Portisch played the more sensible 7... d6 in a subsequent event but it's still inferior after 8 h5+! g6 9 f3 xh2+? 10 xh2 xd4 11 d1!) 8 b3 xd1 (now 8... d6? is met by 9 xc5!) 9 xd1 d6 (the queer- looking 9...b6 as a defensive try scored an unmerited success in a Soviet women's tournament due to White's passive play. But 10 f4 a7! 11 c3 e7 12 a4! followed by a5 is almost decisive. (12...a5? is impossible because of 13 b5! Polugaievsky's 9... d7 offers defensive prospects) 10 a5! b5 (amusing is 10... g4? 11 f3 O-O-O?? 12 e5! and Black resigns. Hort-Zelandinow, Havana 1967. Keres tried 10... h6 but also failed to equalize after 11 xh6 gxh6 12 c4 e7 13 c3 e6 14 d5. Bagirov-Keres, Moscow 1967) 11 c4 e7 12 e3 f5 13 c3 f4 14 e5! xe5 15 xc5 and Black's disorganized position soon crumbled. 7 c3! ... The text involves a gambit. Curiously, this was Gligorich's own published suggestion when he annotated his game against Lee at Hastings 1965-6, which had continued 7 dxe5 xd1 8 xd1 xf3! (Fischer-Smyslov, Monaco 1967, went 8... fxe5? 9 d3! xf3 10 xf3 f6 11 c3 b4 12 g5! xc3 13 bxc3! [was Black playing for the cheap trap 13 xf6? xb2 14 xg7?? xa1 15 xh8 O-O-O!] 13... f8 14 xf6 xf6 15 xf6 gxf6 16 d1! and White should have won the ending) 9 gxf3 fxe5 10 f4 f6 and now 11 c3! (instead of 11 fxe5? xe4 12 e3 c5 13 d2 xd2 14 xc5 O-O-O as in the game) 11... d6 12 fxe5 xe5 13 a4! gives White the better of a probable draw. So the best is 7 dxe5! xd1 8 xd1 xf3! 9 gxf3 fxe5 10 e3! followed by d2-c4 with pressure. If 10... e7 11 f4! keeps the initiative. 7 ... exd4 An alternative is 7... d6 holding the center. 8 cxd4 d7 Black dares not accept the Pawn. 8... xf3 9 xf3 xd4 10 d1 c4 11 f4, etc. However, Gligorich said (in Chess Review) he had completely forgotten his Hastings analysis, which indicated Black's best as 8...c5! 9 d5 d6. 9 h3! ... "Putting the question to the Bishop." Nimzovich, Steinitz, Evans, and other theoreticians have pointed out the enormous value of kicking this Bishop before the pin becomes really troublesome. Here, White must exercise care since his h-Pawn could easily become a potential target. 9 ... e6 This natural retreat, which releases the tension, gives White too free a hand and is the subsequent cause of Gligorich's difficulties. Better is 9... h5! as played against me by Jimenez in a later round. After 10 e5! xd1 (bad is 10... xh3 11 gxh3 xd1 12 xd1 fxe5 13 dxe5 c5 14 g2 with a dangerous preponderance of center Pawns) 11 xd7 xd7 12 xd1 Black should hold the ending, although he found a way to lose: 12... e8 13 f3 (13 c3 is more accurate) 13... e7 14 c3 c8 15 e3 f5 16 ac1 fxe4 17 fxe4 g6? (17... g6 is correct) 18 f4! g7 19 d5! d8 20 a4! hf8 21 g3 g5? (cracking under the pressure - 21... f7 is more sensible) 22 xg5 f7 23 g2 cxd5 24 exd5 b8 25 e1 f8 26 f1! g7 27 f6 g8 28 ce1 d7 29 d6! cxd6 30 xe7 xe7 31 f7 resigns (if 31... e8 32 b6 c7 33 d5).
10 c3 O-O-O
11 f4! ... 11 ... e7? More solid is 11... d6! 12 xd6 xd6. The critical line is 11...g5!? 12 g3 h5 13 d5! cxd5 14 c1! and now: A] 14... d6 15 a4! b8 16 c5 e7 17 xa6+! bxa6 18 d4 d7 19 b3+ a7 20 xc7+!! xc7 21 xc7 b5 (if 21... c5 22 e3! is the simplest win) 22 c6+! (Palacio) 22... xc6 23 b6+ and mate next. B] The fantastic win is 14...dxe4 15 a4! b8 16 xc7!! xd1 17 c8+!!! a7 (or 17... xc8 18 b6 mate) 18 b8+ a8 19 b6 mate.
12 c1 g6
Black has lost time in order to reach this inferior square.
13 g3 d6
14 a4! xg3? Yielding his c5 permanently to the Knight. Correct is 14... b8 15 c5 e7. 15 fxg3 b8 Bad is 15...b6 16 d5! f7 (16...cxd5? 17 xb6+) 17 e2!, etc.
16 c5 d6
17 a4! ... 17 ... a7?? Catastrophic. After 17... c8 18 c3 (18... xg3? 19 e5 h4 20 xc6+), Black might have hung on with 18... f8! 18 xa6! ... The finishing stroke. 18 ... xh3 Desperation! 18...bxa6 19 xc6 costs Black's Queen to prevent mate. 19 e5! ... The most forceful method. 19 ... xe5 Sheer desperation!! After 19...fxe5 20 c5+ b8 21 c3! followed by a3 is most persuasive. 20 dxe5 fxe5 21 c5+ b8 22 gxh3 e4 Never say die! 23 xe4 e7
24 c3 b5
25 c2 ...
Time to consolidate. 25 a6 also does the trick. According to a Havana newspaper, some casual spectators who had just wandered in thought White had merely won two pieces for a Rook. Nobody could believe that Gligorich was playing on two pieces behind! The rude awakening came when - 25 ... Black resigns
57 Larsen [ Denmark ] - Fischer
MONACO 1967
KING'S INDIAN DEFENSE
Change of pace Larsen, uncharacteristically, forces an early exchange of Queens so that he can spring a surprise in the resulting endgame. Fischer beats him to it (13...b6) and proceeds to defend with meticulous care. It looks as if a draw must ensue, but Larsen presses. He is rebuffed, and again a draw seems imminent. Larsen senses no danger and, as if by inertia, continues to play for a win. As the game simplifies, the self-inflicted dark square weaknesses in the Dane's position gradually reveal themselves. By move thirty it becomes Fischer's turn to assume the initiative, and he probes these flaws judiciously. Thrown on the defensive, Larsen makes one or two reckless moves out of which Fischer constructs elegant combinations. Thus, what begins as a barren endgame is transformed into an exhibition of chess sensibility and virtuosity.
[diagram]
5 e2 ...
Larsen had won some good games with 5 f3 O-O 6 e3 but after 6... e5! (which no one seems to have played) White gets no advantage. 7 e2 c6 transposes into well-known modern lines. And 7 d5 g4 8 g5 f6 9 h4 e8 gives Black dynamic play. Now 10 h3 h6 11 g4!? f5 is too risky for White. Finally on 7 dxe5 dxe5 8 xd8 xd8 9 d5(?) a6! gives Black the better ending.
5 ... O-O
[diagram]
8 e3 ...
A bit of a surprise. I had expected 8 d5 e7 9 e1 d7 10 d3 f5 11 d2. Now I had in mind 11...c5! 12 f3 f4! (but not 12... f6? 13 g4! f4 14 h4! and Black's K-side counterplay is completely stymied) with active chances. Larsen-Najdorf, Santa Monica 1966, had continued 11... f6?
12 f3 f4 13 c5! g5 14 c1 g6 15 cxd6 cxd6 16 b5 f7 17 c2! e8
18 a4 and White came first on the Q-side since Black's attack never got
off the ground. 8 ... e8! The cleanest way to equalize. Najdorf found this move after some painful experiences with 8... g4 in his match vs. Reshevsky. The main point if that 9 d5 d4! levels. 9 dxe5 dxe5 10 xd8 xd8 A dubious improvement over 10... xd8! as played by Reshevsky in his match with Benko. After 11 g5 Black must not play 11... d7? (after which Benko's 12 d1!! followed by a4 was very strong) but 11... f8! solves all his problems.
11 b5 e6
12 g5 e7
13 fd1 ... Larsen is attempting to improve on Reshevsky-Fischer, Santa Monica 1966, which continued: 13 xe6 xe6 14 f3 c6 15 c3 d7 16 fd1 f8
17 f2 b6 18 b3 b7 19 a4 d7 20 b2 b5 with an eventual draw.
13 ... b6! In my 9th match game with Reshevsky, 1961, I tried 13...c6!? Larsen told me he had intended 14 xa7!? (instead of 14 xe6 xe6 15 c3 d7=) 14... d7 15 xe6 xe6 16 f3. But after 16... d7! (threatening... d4) Black has fair play for the Pawn, considering that the Knight is stranded on a7. The book text was an improvement that I had hatched some time ago. 14 c5!? ... Typically, Larsen adopts an enterprising continuation. He should settle for 14 xe6 xe6 15 f3 with a draw in view. By overestimating his chances, he gradually drifts into a losing position. 14 ... xc5 Naturally not 14...bxc5? 15 xe6 xe6 16 xc5 d7 17 f3 wins. 15 d8+ f8 No better is 15... e8 16 xe8+ xe8 17 xc5 bxc5 18 c4! Or 15... e8? 16 xc5 bxc5 17 xc7 xc7 18 xe8+ f8 19 xh7! 16 xa7 xa7 On 16... b7 17 xa8 xa8 18 f3 White has a slight pull despite his misplaced Knight. After 18...c6 19 c8 b7 20 d1 maintains some pressure. 17 xc8 ... White recovers his pawn with even chances. 17 ... g7 Black wisely resists the temptation of 17... cxe4?? 18 xe4 xe4 19 h6. But even more accurate than the text is 17...h6! 18 f3 g7 19 xc5 bxc5 20 d3 completely neutralizing any initiative for either side.
18 f3 e8
19 a3(?) ... Larsen's reluctance to simplify will soon backfire. Correct is 19 xc5! bxc5 20 b8 with theoretical winning chances because of the passed a- Pawn. But it would be difficult to make headway because of the opposite colored Bishops. 19 ... d6
20 d8 ...
Optimistic as ever! 20 b8 d7 21 d8 b7 22 c8 d6 would lead to a draw by repetition. 20 ... h6
21 h3 e6
22 b8 e8
23 xe8 xe8 "Now White's initiative is over and the position is even but by no means drawish. There is a lot of play." (KMOCH) White's dark squares, notably his d4, are weak. But it's still not too serious.
24 b5 ...
Pointless. White should start bringing his Knight into the game via f2. He can't prevent... c5, gaining control of the dark squares. Of course not 24 b4? xb4. 24 ... d6
25 f1 b7!
26 f2 c5!
27 xc5 bxc5
28 d1 h5!
To keep the Knight out of g4. This "prophylactic" thrust would have gladdened Nimzovich's heart. Not 28... d4? 29 g4 f6 30 f4!
29 d5 ...
Larsen still has illusions, but his game is fast deteriorating. More prudent is 29 d3 xd3 30 xd3 d4 31 f2. White probably should hold the ending despite Black's creeping pressure. 29 ... f6
30 h4 e7!
31 c4 ...
The Pawn is poisoned: 31 xe5? c6 followed by... d7 (or...f6). The mission of the Rook has failed, but no serious harm has been done. 31 ... c6
32 d2 d4!
Finally the Knight has gained this dominant outpost.
33 f1 ...
The more active 33 d3 is preferable. Now Black's tactical threats begin to proliferate. 33 ... f5!
34 b4 ...
Meets with a still sharper counter thrust. 34 d3 offered a better chance for survival. After the text White's a-Pawn is weakened. Not 34 exf5 xf5 with the double threat of... e3+ or xh4 (and if 35 e2? g3+). 34 ... b5!
35 g8 ...
35 bxc5 bxc4 clearly wins for Black. And 35 xb5? is refuted by 35... cb3. 35 ... fxe4! Fixing White with another weakness. 36 fxe4 ... Not 36 bxc5 e3 37 xd4 (if 37 d3 exf2 38 xf2 a8 39 a2 b4 - or 37 a2? exf2 38 xf2 f8!) 37...exd4 38 d3 xa3 39 e2 c3, etc. 36 ... d7
37 d3 a6!
Threatening c2 which, if played immediately, could have been met by 38 c3.
38 c3 c5!
This surprising combination apparently confused Larsen, who was in time-pressure. 39 g4? ... The last blunder. On 39 bxc5 b4! 40 c1! (not 40 axb4 a1+) there's still a lot of fight. If 40... xa3 (or 40...bxa3 41 a2) 41 c6 b6. 39 ... c4 This protected passed Pawn is just too strong. Not 39... f6 40 xc5! 40 gxh5 gxh5
41 d5 f6
42 g3 xd5
43 exd5 f6
44 g2 ...
The sealed move. White is completely tied up. On 44 g1? e2+ wins. Or if 44 e1 f4 mops up. 44 ... f5
45 h3 g6+
46 f3 d4+
47 e3 ...
On 47 e4 d6 White is in zugzwang. If 48 h2 (to prevent... g2)

58 Fischer - Geller [ U.S.S.R. ]
SKOPJE 1967
Flawed masterpiece After Fischer dropped this miniature (his third loss in a row to Geller) Kurajica concluded: "He just cannot play against Geller." Another Yugoslav, Trifunovich, opined at greater length: Geller is one of the best-prepared players in the world as to opening theory, and Fischer cannot be superior in that respect...Fischer [as White] chose a very sharp and modern variation...playing to win in the early stage of the game, as he usually does, and successfully, against weaker opponents. Fischer played better and attained a superior position, but it was very difficult to find the right solution over-the-board...There was his mistake...He has to impose a hard positional game, playing without pretensions for a win in the very opening. Nowhere but in the notes that follow have the above errors been answered. Were it not for a momentary lapse (a3?), Fischer would have won this little gem on move twenty - despite his critics.
[diagram]
There is no apparent refutation to Benko's roguish 6... b6!? Saidy ventured it against me in the 1967 US Championship. After 7 b3 e6 8 O-O e7 9 e3 c7 10 f4 O-O 11 d3 it's a mutually hard game. Also see game 11.

Finally, 11... c5+ 12 h1 O-O may be tenable) 10 xd4 d5 (10... c5 11 xc5 dxc5 12 a4! puts Black in an excruciating bind) 11 e3! xe4 (if 11... g4 12 h1! xe3 13 xe3 dxe4 14 xe4! e7 15 ae1 and mate is lurking in the wings: e.g.,
15...g6 16 d5! d8 17 e5 O-O 18 e7+! wins. Slightly more
accurate, but still bad, is 11...dxe4 12 xe4 e7 13 d6+, etc.) 12 xe4 dxe4 13 f5! b4 (if 13...exf5 14 g4! e6 [14... b4 15 a4+! b5 16 d5! wins] 15 gxf5 xb3 16 axb3 b4 17 a4! xd4 18 xd4 and Black is in a curiously hopeless predicament: e.g., 18... e7 19 xe4 f8 20 f6!! xf6 21 xf6! gxf6 22 h6+ and mates) 14 fxe6 xe6 15 xe6! fxe6 16 xf8+! xf8 17 a4+! resigns.

More reasonable is 7...a6 8 b3 c7 9 e2 (or 9 f4) 9...b5 10 O-O-O a5 (10... b7 is also possible, whereupon White might reply 11 f3).

10 O-O-O ...
10 O-O also comes into consideration.

But interesting is
12...e5 (instead of 12... xg2) 13 h4 xg2 14 dg1 g4 15 xg2! xe2
16 xe2 exd4 17 xd4 with advantage (if 17... xe4 18 f3! followed by f5).
12 b1 ...
A critical position. White's immediate threat is 13 xf6. 12 ... c6 In a later round Sofrevsky tried to improve against me with 12... ad8, but got into trouble after 13 e3! Black now rejected a dangerous Pawn sac which must be examined very carefully: 13...b5!? But 14 a3! (not 14 xa7 a8 with active play) 14...b4 15 axb4 xb4 16 xa7 b7 17 b6! a8 18 f3 and Black has no good way to prosecute his attack. Consequently, Sofrevsky chose 13...b6 14 xf6! gxf6? (Black should reconcile himself to the loss of a Pawn after 14... xf6 15 xd6 c8) 15 d5!! fe8 (if 15...exd5 16 xd5 a6 17 h5! wins - 17... g4 18 g3, etc.) 16 xe7+ (16 h6! is a quicker kill) 16... xe7 17 xd6 c8 18 d4 e8? 19 xf6 resigns.
13 f4 ad8
If 13...e5 14 e3! xe4 (not 14... xe4? 15 xe4 xe4 16 d2 wins) 15 xe4 xe4 16 f3 with advantage. 14 hf1 ... I already had in mind the ensuing sacrifice. Also strong is 14 g4 - not to mention Trifunovich's post-mortem suggestion 14 f5! exf5 (not 14...e5
15 f2 d5? 16 exd5 xd5 17 xd5 xd5 18 xe5 wins a piece) 15 exf5
fe8 16 f2 with positional pressure. 14 ... b5 On 14...d5 15 e5 e4 16 f5! maintains the initiative. 15 f5!! ... The die is cast. I didn't want to lose a tempo playing it safe with 15 a3. 15 ... b4 16 fxe6! bxc3 17 exf7+ h8 Not 17... xf7 18 xf7+ xf7 19 c4+ d5 20 xc6, etc. 18 f5! b4 On 18... c7 I had intended 19 df1 (threatening xf6). If then 19... d7 (or on 19... xe4 20 g4 is bitter) 20 h5! (threatening xh7+) is decisive. 19 f1! ... A hard move to find - it took around 45 minutes. The threat of xf6 must be attended to. 19 ... xe4 A fighting defense. 19... d7 loses immediately to 20 h5 e5 21 f5 h6 22 g6!! xf7 (22... xg6 allows 23 xh6 mate) 23 xe5, etc. On
19... xf7 20 xc3 wins. And 19... xe4 gives White the pleasant choice
of 20 xf6 or 20 b5. Objectively best is 19... g4. But after 20 xc3 (20 h5 d7! holds)
20... b7 (if 20... xe4 21 d4!) 21 f4 with three Pawns for the piece
and a winning attack in the offing. 20 a3? ... Losing! A couple of hours after the game it occurred to me that White has a problem-like win after 20 f4!! (with the threat of h5). Black has no adequate defense. A] 20...d5 21 e5 f6 22 xf6 xf6 23 xf6! B] 20... d2+ 21 xd2 cxd2 22 c3!! xb3 23 xg7+! xg7 24 g4+ h8 25 d4+ and mates. C] 20...cxb2 21 h5!

21 f4 a4!!
I didn't see it! Moreover, the strength of this resource didn't become fully apparent to me for another two moves.
22 g4 ...
Also futile is 22 h6 f6 23 xf6 xb3. 22 ... f6! 23 xf6 xb3! At long last I saw the point of Geller's clever defense. As I was studying 24 f4, it suddenly dawned on me that 24... a2+ was curtains. So - White resigns After 24 cxb3 xf6! is the quietus. It is not enough to be a good player, observed Dr Tarrasch; you must also play well.
59 Kholmov [ U.S.S.R. ] - Fischer
SKOPJE 1967
KING'S INDIAN DEFENSE
The erring Bishop In order to restrain Black from creating complications, Kholmov employs an unpretentious system. But he posts his Bishop prematurely on a3, then penetrates ambitiously with 11 d6. Fischer, with the routine 11... a5, promptly refutes. It is instructive to observe how, from now on, he creates an unhealthy climate wherever the Bishop seeks lodging. His Queen returns to a3 on no less than three separate occasions, prompting one annotator to inquire, dryly, whether he was perhaps inventing perpetual motion. As early as move twelve it became apparent to both players that White was lost. However, Kholmov did his best to avert the inevitable for another twenty moves. Fischer (with White) had lost to Kholmov in their only previous encounter, played via telephone to Havana in '65. Here, Fischer's victory brought him first place, a half point ahead of Geller.

6 c3 ...
A straightforward but essentially passive development. The idea is to avoid creating a weakness with c4; however, a drawback is White can no longer dominate the center with a Pawn-wedge. 6 ... bd7 More flexible than 6...d5 which I adopted against Ivkov at the Piatigorsky Cup, 1966. That game continued 7 e5 c6 8 e4 and now Black could have equalized easily with 8...dxe4 (instead of 8... e6?) 9 xe4 xe4 10 xe4 h3 (not 10...c5? 11 f3!) 11 e1 d7, etc.
7 b3 ...
A normal continuation, although it is dubious that White's Bishop is effective once posted on b2 or a3. This system is characterized by Pawn symmetry and quiet play with drawing tendencies. But a draw is precisely what I could not afford in this crucial encounter.
7 e4 e5 also presents Black with no opening problems.

"The turbulent complications of the normal K's Indian can hardly arise, and the position can already be evaluated as even." (TRIFUNOVICH). 9 ... e8
10 a3 ...
Better is 10 a4 a5 11 a3; whereupon the Bishop will be immune from eventual attack after... a5. "Even so early, White is on the wrong track. The Bishop has nothing to seek on the a3-f8 diagonal. Yet, while it is easy now to condemn this move, till now it has often been adopted by White with never a harsh word. The punishment which ensues, however... is more severe than any this commentator has observed hitherto. 10 b2 is correct." (TRIFUNOVICH). 10 ... c6 Black invites the Bishop to seize a strong position." (TRIFUNOVICH). 11 d6? ... Kholmov consumed over half an hour on this mistake. The idea is to keep Black bottled up while exerting pressure on the e-Pawn. The only trouble with the move, however, is that it loses. As Tarrasch wrote: "When you don't know what to do, wait for your opponent to get an idea - it's sure to be wrong!" 11 e2 was indicated. 11 ... a5! This normal freeing maneuver is now devastating.
12 d3 ...
What else? 12 b4 a3 leaves White in the same predicament. Black now has a shot which wins two pieces for a Rook; or, as it turns out, a lowly Pawn (which proves fatal). 12 ... e6! Springing the trap! White cannot avoid material loss. Geller, who was tied with me for the lead, had displayed great interest in my game - up to now. When he saw this position, he smiled wryly. I never noticed him looking at the game again.
13 b4 ...
No matter how White wriggles and squirms, he cannot escape the fate in store for him. After 13 e2 Black has the pleasant choice of either... xe4 or... e8 - both of which win a Pawn. After the game Kholmov told me he had originally intended 13 g5 xd6 14 xd6 xc3 15 e7 with active play. However, he saw (too late) that simply 14...h6! squelches all such illusions. 13 ... a3! Renewing the ancient threat of... xd6.
14 c7 ...
The wandering Bishop hopes to receive succor. But, in so doing, it must abandon protection of the b-pawn. 14 ... xb4 Perhaps White was hoping for 14... e8 15 a5 b6 16 ab1! bxa5 17 b3 c5! 18 bxc5 xc5 19 fb1 where Black's technical difficulties are great. 15 ab1 e7! A cute tactical point. 15... f8? loses the exchange after 16 g5 (if the Rook retreats, then White's Bishop returns to d6). Now 16 g5 is refuted by 16... c5. For all practical purposes the game is over. 16 fd1 e8

Afterwards, Geller tried to offer my opponent some sympathy. I overheard a dismayed Kholmov telling him that I had "seen everything!" This game was particularly sweet because it was my first win against a Russian in almost a dozen tries (since game 52) - and my first with Black since 1962 (Korchnoi at Curaçao).
60 Fischer - Stein [ U.S.S.R. ]
INTERZONAL, SOUSSE 1967
RUY LOPEZ
When champions meet On his ninth turn Black varies the routine sparring but the game proceeds innocuously until Fischer veers with 14 b4, intensifying the struggle. If, in the ensuing slugfest, Stein can be said to have made an error, it is the strategic one of so pressing on the Q-side as to allow White to become entrenched on the opposite wing. Fischer's prosecution of the attack is crowned by a brilliant offer of a piece (29 xf5) which the Soviet champion declines. Had Fischer then renewed the sacrifice, the end would have come sooner. In his detailed notes Fischer refers to this oversight, reveals some important thoughts on the Ruy, pinpoints "the losing move" (21... b6), criticizes a second subtle mistake of his own (26 f3), and offers a possible defense for Stein (28... f6), which other commentators have failed to note. It is unfortunate that this interesting and most instructive game was expunged from the official records due to Fischer's withdrawal before having completed half his playing schedule.
1 e4 ...
I have never opened with the d-pawn - on principle. 1 ... e5 I had expected the Sicilian, with Stein's favorite accelerated Dragon (2...g6). I suspect that the Russians "group-think" before important games to decide which openings will upset their opponents psychologically.
[diagram]
Possibly Stein was braced for 4 xc6, as in game 56.
4 a4 ...
Relieving the suspense. 4 ... f6
[diagram]
In the event the reader is interested in what I may have had in mind against the Marshall Attack, he is referred to my game against Spassky at the Piatigorsky Cup, 1966, which continued: 7...O-O 8 c3 d5 9 exd5 xd5 10 xe5 xe5 11 xe5 c6 12 g3!? d6 13 e1 f6 14 d4 g4 15 d3 (15 f3 might be better) 15...c5 and now 16 c2! (instead of 16 dxc5?) allows Black insufficient compensation for his Pawn.
8 c3 O-O
9 h3 ...
For 9 d4 see game 36. 9 ... b7 A rare side line. 9... a5 10 c2 c5 is a better-known sequence. The text is somewhat passive and commits the Bishop perhaps prematurely. Usually Stein continues 9... d7 10 d4 f6; then 11 a4 is slightly better for White. The line chosen in the game comes to resemble Breyer's Defense (9... b8 10 d4 bd7 11 bd2 b7 12 c2! e8 13 b4 exd4 14 cxd4 a5 15 bxa5 c5) - see note to White's 17th move.
10 d4 a5
Believe it or not, this Knight is headed for d7! Black may prefer the shorter route with 10... b8; but experience has shown that after 11 dxe5 dxe5 12 xd8, Black is obliged to recapture with his Bishop, which interferes with his development and produces endgame difficulties.
11 c2 c4
Unsound is 11...exd4 12 cxd4 d5 13 e5 e4 14 c3 f5 15 exf6 e.p. xf6 16 xe4 dxe4 17 xe4 xe4 18 xe4 c5 19 d5 and Black remains a Pawn down. Another possibility is 11...exd4 12 cxd4 c5 but White holds the edge with 13 bd2. On 11...c5 immediately, White replies 12 bd2, retaining the option of d5, locking in Black's Bishop on b7.
12 b3 b6
13 bd2 ... Not 13 dxe5 dxe5 14 xd8 axd8 15 xe5 xe4!=. 13 ... bd7 Black's 5th move with this Knight! 13...exd4 14 cxd4 c5 seems more active. Stein-Lutikov, Moscow 1966 continued 13... e8? 14 f1? and Black equalized easily. However, White should vary with 14 dxe5 dxe5 15 xe5 d6 16 ef3 xe4 (16... xe4 17 xe4 xe4 18 g5! busts Black) 17 xe4 xe4 18 d3! (White can't win a piece because his Queen hangs at the end after... h2+), with initiative. 14 b4! ... Prevents...c5 and prepares a dominating build-up with 15 b2 followed by c4. The routine continuation 14 b2 (Keres-Gligorich, Zurich 1959) gives nothing. 14 ... exd4 Stein makes his bid for active counterplay even though it involves abandoning his "strong point" (e5-Pawn). If 14...a5 15 b3! and Black might find himself in straightened circumstances after the Knight reaches a5. 15 cxd4 a5 On 15...c5 16 bxc5 dxc5 17 d5 White's steamroller in the center is more formidable than Black's Q-side majority. 16 bxa5 c5 Inferior would be 16... xa5 17 d5! c5 18 dxc6 e.p. xc6 19 d4, after which White, among other things, goes to work on the isolated b-Pawn. 17 e5! ... This identical position was reached by transposition, with Black's Rook on e8, in Cirich-Robatsch, Beverwijk 1967, which continued: 17 b2 xa5 18 a4 b4 19 c4 c7 20 e5 dxe5 21 dxe5 d5 22 fd2 7b6 and now Spassky's recommendation of 23 e6! is unpleasant for Black. (See note to Black's 9th move.) 17 ... dxe5 Another line of defense is 17... e8 with the idea of eliminating both of White's center Pawns. "The consequences are very ramified, and there is some danger that Black may fail to recover White's Pawn on its a5 or may lose his own on b5, or both. The text is more active but also more dangerous for Black's King." (KMOCH). 18 dxe5 d5
19 e4 b4!
The idea is to force the Bishop to retreat and thereby hem in White's QR. On 19... xa5 20 eg5! h6 21 d3! g6 22 e6! wins.
20 b1 xa5
21 e2! ... Increasing the pressure. Not 21 e6 fxe6 22 eg5? (or 22 fg5 d5 23 xh7 f5! holds) 22... xf3! 23 xf3 f6 wins. One can sense the storm looming against Black's King. 21 ... b6? Quite possibly "the losing move." It is better to reserve this Knight for the defense of the K-side. More prudent is 21... e8! with... f8 in the offing. 22 d1 c7 leads to nought. And 22 e6 leads to no demonstrable advantage after 22...fxe6 23 eg5 xg5 24 xg5 f8 25 h5 g6, etc. 22 fg5! ... Now the threats are beginning to jell. 22 ... xe4! Forced, because if 22...h6 23 h7!! stands Black up. On 23... e8 (23... xh7 24 xc5 dis.+ followed by xb7 leads to a small fork) 24 hf6+! xf6 (24...gxf6 25 g4+ h8 26 d6! xd6 27 f5! g7 28 xh6+ leads to mate) 25 xf6+ xf6 (again if 25...gxf6 26 g4+ f8 27 xh6+ e7 28 e6! d6 29 g3+ c6 30 e4+ 4d5 31 exf7 h8 32 xd5+ wins) 26 exf6 wins the exchange. Also insufficient is 22...g6 23 e6! f5 24 f7! followed by b2 with a crushing attack. 23 xe4 g6
24 h4 h5
25 g3! ... Now White threatens 26 e6! h4! 27 xd8 xg3 28 b7 a7 29 xc5. After Black's next move, this variation fails against 29... xe5. Impetuous would be 25 g4?? d4. 25 ... c4! 26 f3? ... More forcing is 26 e6! f5 27 f3 (not 27 f7 xf7! 28 exf7+ xf7 29 xf5! gxf5 30 f3 g6 31 g4 d5 and a draw appears likely) 27... g7
28 f4 h8 transposing into the game (but not 27... f6 28 g5 h7 29
xf6 xf6 30 xf5! gxf5 31 ad1 d5 32 e7! xe7 33 xd5 is decisive.). This order of moves would prohibit the defense mentioned in the note to Black's 28th; after being forced to play 26...f5, Black loses his options. At this stage the power failed. In the dark I began to worry about 26... d3! (if 27 d1 xc1! and White has nothing). Then the lights came on again and I saw clearly that 26... d3? was crushed by 27 xd3! xd3 28 g5! and White penetrates decisively on the weak dark squares. 26 ... g7
27 f4 h8
28 e6! ... "This blow rocks the remnants of the tower around the Black King."
(GLIGORICH).
28 ... f5 Much stiffer resistance (taking advantage of White's inaccurate 26th move) is offered by 28... f6! (not 28...f6 29 h4) 29 exf7 xa1 (29... d6? 30 f8= +! xf8 31 e4 d7 32 g5! a6 33 xf6 xf6 34 e5! winning a Pawn and eventually the game) 30 f8= +! xf8 31 c7+ g8 32 xg6 d5 (if 32... a6 33 e8!) 33 b7 f6 34 f4 (threatening 35 g5 and f7+) 34... h7! White now appears to have nothing better than 35 xh7+ xh7 36 d5+ f7 (worse is 36... h8? 37 xh5!) 37 xf7+ xf7 38 xa1 with chances by virtue of the extra Pawn. But this would be a tough ending to win! 29 xf5! f8 The only reasonable way to decline the sacrifice. On 29... d6 30 e7! xf4 (or 30... xe7 31 g3 a6 32 g5, etc.) 31 exd8= xd8 32 xf4 gxf5 33 c7! (R.Byrne). Kmoch suggests that "Leonidas might even have better taken a chance and faced the storm by playing 29...gxf5." But the Bishop is tabu, for White wins quickly with 30 g3+. Black now has two defenses which fail: A] 30... f8 31 g6 e8 (if 31... d6 32 e5!) 32 h6+ xh6 33 xh6+ g8 34 g5. B] 30... h7 31 g5+! xg5 32 xg5 d3 (if 32... b8 33 h4! g6

The main line is 30... xh4 31 xh4 xf5 (if 31... f6 32 g3! - or 31...gxf5 32 g5+ h7 33 e7 e8 34 e6!) 32 e7+ g8 33 d8+ g7 34 c7+ g8 35 e7, etc. 30 ... xf4 31 xf4 e8? Stein's post-mortem suggestion of 31... a6 is met by 32 ad1 xe6 33 d7 (threatening g5), etc. But the best try is 31... xa2! On 32 ad1 a7 holds. And if 32 xa2 xa2 33 e5 g5 34 g3 maintains the initiative, but Black has drawing chances. Black, however, was in extreme time-pressure. 32 ad1 a6

Even more convincing is 33 b7! a7 34 d7. 33 ... xe6

Foreword by Garry Kasparov Ask any chess fan to give a short list of his favourite games and it is sure to in clude games by Alekhine. Perhaps Reti-Alekhine, from Baden-Baden 1925, or Bogoljubow-Alekhine, Hastings 1922. These two games are generally reckoned to be amongst the most brilliant on record. But Alekhine's reputation was not built solely on the wonderful quality of his games, nor, simply, on his longevity as World Champion (he held the title from 1927-35 and again from 1937-46, when he died as World Champion, sadly destitute, in Portugal). It was also Alekhine's outstanding diligence as an annotator of his own masterpieces which has helped to establish his place in the history of chess. No serious student of chess can af ford to ignore Alekhine's notes to his games, and the most important of these are assembled here in this volume. Alekhine's games and writings exerted a great influence on me from a very early age. I wished to emulate the dynamic style of the first, great, Russian-born champion, who wrested the crown from Capablanca in 1927. I fell in love with the rich complexity of his ideas at the chessboard. Alekhine's attacks came sud denly, like destructive thunderstorms that erupted from a clear sky. Max Euwe , who briefly took the world title from Alekhine between 1935 and 1937, wrote of him: Alekhine is a poet, who creates a work of art out of something which would hardly inspire another man to send a picture postcard. The wilder and more in volved a position the more beautiful the conception he can evolve. A similar view was expressed by Dr. Emanuel Lasker: Alekhine loves making experiments ... delighted to think that his own skill and his own imagination are the cause of all that what happens on the board. This style of Alekhine's was what I admired and wanted to develop in my own games. I had a natural feeling for it. I hope readers of this book will feel similarly inspired by Alekhine's masterpieces. Garry Kasparov Baku 1989 Introduction by John Nunn I first came across Alekhine's collection of games when I was about 11 years old. Up to that point, I had been quite successful in junior events and I had the feeling that chess wasn't really a very difficult game. After playing over all 220 games in the first two volumes (covering the periods 1905-23 and 1924-37), I thought "How can anyone play like this? It's just impossible to see so much during a game". I was particularly struck by his game against Rubinstein from Semmer ing, 1926 (game 42 in this book), and the move IS. ..ltJx12! in particular. It seemed incredible that there might be a stronger move than the obvious recapture on c3, but after having checked the analysis several times, I had to admit that taking on 12 was a forced win. But how did this move even enter Alekhine's head? Today, finding this combination doesn't seem so totally impossible as it did then, but it remains an enormously impressive game. In my opinion Alekhine's special gen ius lay in his ability to discover unexpected twists in positions where a lesser player would have made an automatic, conventional move. Other examples of such twists, in addition to the IS ... .!bxf2 mentioned above, are the move 19 'fIc7! in game 31 and the idea of IS dxe5 and 19 'i'f4! in game 47. In view of my early acquaintance with Alekhine 's books, I was excited when the idea arose of producing an algebraic edition of the cream of Alekhine's games. This gradually became a major project. Apart from the conversion to alge braic, I have corrected a surprisingly large number of notational errors in the original books, rearranged the games in chronological order, edited the text and checked the analysis. I have not commented on minor flaws in the analysis, but major errors and omissions are pointed out in footnotes (except for game lIS, where the new analysis was so extensive that it had to be embedded in the text). These terse footnotes should be studied carefully, as in many cases they indicate fundamental reassessments of famous games, for example Reti-Alekhine, Baden-Baden 1925 and Alekhine-Bogoljubow, Nottingham 1936. Some readers may find it surprising that so many major analytical errors exist in Alekhine's notes-after having worked on this book, my respect for Alekhine's games has increased, but I have come to recognise that his annotations are influenced by the "I won the game, so I must have been winning all the way through" syndrome (which, it must be said, afflicts many annotators). A few additional points: games 1-109 were originally annotated by Alekhine himself-the remaining games were annotated by C.H.O'D. Alexander. All foot notes are mine, except where they are marked (GB), in which case they were writ ten by Graham Burgess. Alekhine uses the symbols '±' and '=F' to mean 'clear advantage for White' and 'clear advantage for Black' respectively. The games in this book represent the distillation of the life work of one of the greatest chess geniuses of all time. As I discovered myself, it is possible to learn a great deal from them.

This move, suggested in 1 908 by the Danish master MlIlller, is in my opinion much better than its reputa tion as, up to the present, it has in no way been refuted and the few games in which it has been adopted rather tend to militate in its favour. 6 lDxe5 White could also play 6 c3 to which the best reply is 6 ...J.a7 as in a game Yates-Alekhine (Hastings 1 922), which continued as follows: 7 d4 (interesting would be 7 Ite1 lDg4!

This new defence was played for the first time by myself in a consult ation game at Zurich (August 1 92 1 ), and was introduced into master prac tice shortly afterwards at the Buda pest Tournament in September of the same year. Its correctness now seems perfectly established. One of the most searching proofs of its vitality lies in the fact that Dr. Emanuel Lasker, ex-champion of the world, although openly opposed to this defence, successfully adopted it against Maroczy at the New York Tournament (March-April 1924), af ter having tried in vain to demolish it. In the course of an encounter be tween Dr. Lasker and Dr. Tarrasch, Black obtained a clearly superior, if not a winning, gamein the following way: 1 e4 lbf6 2 e5 lbd5 3 d4 d6 4 c4 lbb6 5 f4 dxe5 6 fxe5 lbc6 7 i.e3 Steiner - Alekhine 51 i.f5 8 lbc3 e6 9 lbf3 i.b4 10 i.d3 i.g4 ! 1 1 i.e2 i.xf3 12 gxf3 'iVh4+ 13 i.t2 'iVf4!. 2 e5 In a game Bogoljubow-Alekhine (Karlsbad 1 923), White tried 2 lbc3 upon which Black replied by 2 ...d5 (2 .. . e5, transposing into the Vienna Game, is also to be considered), leading to the continuation 3 e5 lbfd7! 4 d4 c5 ! 5 i.b5 lbc6 6 lbf3 and now Black could have reached a very advantageous variation of the French Defence by 6 ... e6 in place of the risky line 6 ...a6 7 i.xc6 bxc6 8 e6! . 2 ... lbd5 3 d4 In a game Slimisch-Alekhine from the same tournament, White continued by 3 lbc3 e6 ! 4 lbxd5 exd5 5 d4 d6 6 lbf3 lbc6 7 i.e2 i.e7 8 i.f4 O-O 9 O-O f6 10 exf6 i.xf6 and Black had a slightly superior game. 3 ... d6 4 i.g5 After this move, whose object is to hinder the advance of the hostile e-pawn, White loses his advantage, because of the difficulties he will ex perience in defending his own e pawn.

[diagram]
A move of Janowski's, which has been quite frequently played by Ru binstein in recent tournaments, but without appreciable success. Neces sary in the greater number of the variations of the Queen's Gambit Accepted, 3 ...a6 is here merely a loss of time, and in addition creates weaknesses on the queenside when White continues by 4 cxd5 or even 4 c5, as in the present game. 4 c5 4 cxd5 is quite sufficient to secure a slight superiority, as was shown by Johner-Rubinstein and Kostic-Ru binstein from the Teplitz-SchOnau Tournament of 1 922, among others. The former game continued 4 cxd5 exd5 5 lbc3 lbf6 6 .i.g5 .i.e7 7 e3 O-O 8 .i.d3 b6 (a little better, but also insufficient to equalise the game, was 8 ... lbbd7 9 'ifc2 !) 9 .i.xf6! .i.xf6 1 0 'ifc2 h6, and Johner could ha ve obtained a very strong attack against Black's weakened kingside by 1 1 h4, followed by 1 2 O-O-O and g4. In his game against Kostic, Ru binstein tried 5 ... .i.e7 in place of 5 ... lb f6, and the continuation was 6 .i.f4 lbf6 7 e3 O-O 8 .i.d3 lbbd7 9 O-O l:1e8 1 0 l:1c 1 b6, after which White could have obtained a distinctly su perior game by 1 1 h3 (in order to conserve his dark-squared bishop against the threat of exchange by ... lbh5). In the present game, the first that I played against Rubinstein after a seven-year interval, I voluntarily adopted a new line of play in order to avoid the variations resulting from 4 cxd5 (because I rightly thought them very familiar to Rubinstein), resol v ing that I would do or die! 4 ••• lbc6 Wishing to play 5 ...e5, which White must oppose by every means at his disposal. 5 .i.f4 0.ge7 6 0.c3 0.g6 7 .i.e3!

I learnt, some time after the game ended, that Rubin stein, in Collijn's Uirobok, ami ned 7 e3, a variation leading to equality. 7 ... b6 Black, giving up hope of breaking through in the centre, at least elimi nates the cramping white c-pawn, and reckons to secure an advantage in development, by reason of the un usual position of White's bishop at e3. 8 cxb6 cxb6 9 h4!

An extraordinary position after the 1 3th move of a Queen's Gambit! During the first thirteen moves White has played his c-pawn thrice, his h-pawn thrice and his dark squared bishop four times, after which he has obtained a position in sight of a win, if not actually a win ning one. It is especially with re spect to the original opening of this game that people often speak of a 'hyper-modern technique' , a 'neo romantic school' , etc. The question is, in reality, much simpler. Black has given himself over to several eccentricities in the opening (3 ... a6; 5 ...
0.ge7; 6 . . .
0.g6)
which, without the reaction of his opponent (for example, 7 e3 instead of 7 .i.e3 or 9 g3 instead of 9 h4) would in the end have given him a good game. It is, therefore, as a ne cessity, and not with a preconceived
56 The Hague 1921
idea, that I decided upon the advance of the h-pawn, preventing Black from securing an advantage in the centre. But, as a rule, in the opening stages of a game such eccentricities are in accordance neither with my temperament nor my style, as the reader can see from the perusal of this book. 14 e3 15 .td3 b5 .td7 ':'c8 Black dreams only of the possibil ity of an immediate attack by White (commencing by tDg5 or tDe5 fol lowed by 'i!i'f3), which he hopes to thwart by a demonstration on the queenside ( ... 'i!i'a5, ... .tb4). With this idea, the preparatory move 15 ... .:.c8 would have been very useful. But as White is not com pelled to bestir himself as long as the opponent does not trouble him seriously, it would have been better for Black to play at once 15 ... tDa5, followed by 1 6. .. .tb4, and thus force White, by this semblance of a counter-attack, to take some defen sive measures. 16 a4!

S ...c5 usually results in the isola tion of White's d-pawn. but on the other hand it allows White to under take a rather dangerous attack on the kingside. This variation admits of a complicated and very difficult game, with nearly equal chances. Concerning S ...dxc4, see game 25 (Alekhine-Yates). 9 a4 As this identical variation had yielded me a win the previous eve ning against Griinfeld, who played here 9 a3 (see Game 29), I wished to avoid fighting against the defence which I considered then, and still consider now, the best. This is the reason which decided me in favour of 9 a4, a move that Rubinstein, my present adversary, had employed against me, without conspicuous success, in a similar position in the Hastings Tournament of 1 922. That game continued as follows: S ...h6 9 i.h4 a6 10 a4 c5 1 1 i.d3 cxd4 1 2 exd4 dxc4 13 i.xc4 lDb6 1 4 i.a2 lDbd5 15 i.bl lDb4 16 'Be2 �.d7 1 7 O-O i.c6 I S lUdl l:tcS 1 9 lDe5 lDfdS 20 i.g3 i.g5 2 1 f4 ! i.h4 22 lDxc6 l:txc6 23 lDxd5 l:txcl 24 l:txc I lDxd5 25 'Be4 g6 26 i.xh4 'Bxh4 27 f5?

It is manifest that the move 9 a4 cannot pretend to yield any advan tage, since Black can answer it by 9 . . . lDe4 ! with greater force than on the preceding move, White's queen side being now slightly weak.

is at c2 and he can therefore gain a tempo by .td3, threatening the h pawn. In addition the move a4, unfa vourable in other cases, here affords him the possibility of .ta2 and .tb1 , a manoeuvre analogous t o the GrUn feld variation (9 a3), but still more effective here because of the opening of the e-file. We can therefore anticipate, after the ensuing exchange, a slight posi tional advantage for White. 12 ... lbxf4 13 exf4 c5 This move, which goes against the general principle of not opening up fresh lines to a better-developed opponent, is dictated by the wish to eliminate White's troublesome pawn on f4.

But its tactical realisation here lacks pre cision. It is on the 9th move, before 10 h3, that Black should have played 9 ...b5, if such was his intention, for in that case he could have answered 1 0 c5 by 1O ... e5 1 1 dxe5 lbg4 with a very promising position. On the other hand, should White, instead of 1 0 c5, open the c-file by 10 cxd5 or 10 cxb5, this would ultimately turn in Black's favour, White having to lose two moves to bring his king into safety. This example emphasises once again the numerous resources af forded by the defence 8 ... a6 ! in this variation. 11 cS! Whereas now Black will not suc ceed in breaking through in the cen tre, and the weakness of his c-pawn will make itself felt sooner or later.

have been reduced to vanishing point. In these circumstances White would have withdrawn his knight to f3, in tending to carry out in perfect safety the manoeuvre sketched above. 24 'iWxe5 This exchange, provoking the weakening of the dark squares in the hostile position, yields White new winning chances. 24 ••• 'iWc7 25 'iWf6! An excellent manoeuvre intended to create a new weakness at h7. 25 l:f7 26 'iWh4 'iWe7 27 hxg6! The right moment for this ex change has come at last, for Black cannot recapture with the pawn, which would allow him to oppose his rooks on the h-file. Now White has a strategic advantage sufficient for victory, but its tactical realisation is far from easy. 27 ••• lLlxg6 28 'iWh5 White must avoid every exchange which would simplify Black's de fence. 28 • • • 'iWf6 29 .i.e2 White's following moves are in tended to reduce to a minimum the mobility of the black pieces, in order to undertake a long range manoeuvre with his king. 30 'iWf3 31 'iWe3 32 lLlb4 l:ee7 .i.d7 33 .i.h5 (D) This move leads to a curious posi tion in which Black's queen, both rooks and the bishop are immobi lised. The problem of winning still needs to be solved, for at present the doubling and even the trebling of the white pieces on the h-file would lead to nothing. The rather compli cated plan which White will strive to pursue, which must, of course, be modified in accordance with Black's manoeuvres, can be summarised as follows: 1 st phase - Bringing the king to the centre where, after the later ex change of queens and rooks on the h-file, it will threaten a rapid pene tration of the hostile camp via as. These tactics will logically induce a corresponding displacement of the blackking, themore plausible since its presence in the centre will con solidate the weak points c6 and e6. 2nd phase - Compelling Black's pieces to remove themselves in suc cession from the kingside by tactical threats aimed either at the king him self or at the enemy pawns (39th and 4 1 st moves). The prospect of the oc cupation of the square e5 by a white knight, thereby immobilising the black knight at d7, increases still more the difficulty of concerted ac tion by the black pieces, which is al ready difficult enough on account of the limited space available to them 3rd phase - Finally, at an oppor tune moment, namely, when Black's pieces are at their greatest distance from the kingside, doubling rooks on the h-file. The rooks, after the forced exchange of queens and bishops, will penetrate into the heart of the hostile position. As we shall see by the sequel, the methodical execution of this strate gic plan requires no less than twenty eight moves! 33 • • • tbg6 34 tbd3 Not at once 34 'it>e2 on account of

Black's plan-which will prove a complete success-is di vided into the following parts: 1) Exchange one pair of rooks. 2) Bring the king to e6 where he will be protected from a frontal at tack by the e-pawn and can prevent the entrance of the remaining white rook at d7. 3) By operating with the rook on the open g-file and advancing the h pawn, force the opening of the h file. 4) After this the white king-and eventually also the bishop-will be kept busy in order to prevent the in trusion of the black rook at hI or h2. 5) In the meantime Black, by ad vancing his a- and b-pawns, will sooner or later succeed in opening one file on the queenside. 6) As, at that moment, the white king will still be on the other wing, White will not have sufficient force to prevent the final intrusion of the black rook on his first or second rank. Granted that if White had, from the beginning, realised that there ac tually existed a danger of losing this endgame, he probably would, by ex tremely careful defence, have saved it. But as it happened, Black played with a definite plan, and White only with the conviction that the game must be a draw. And the result was a very instructive series of typical stratagems much more useful for in experienced players than so-called 'brilliancies' .

It is in teresting that Bogoljubow is rather prone to make this mistake, for in stance, in the 1 1 th game of the same match, in the position reached after Black's 34th move, namely: Bogoljubow - Alekhine Here, instead of trying a counter attack, with an uncertain result, by 3 5 Ra6, he preferred to exchange queens: 35 'if c3?

About the same thing, if not in quite such typical form, occurred in the 5th and 22nd games of our first match. But also, strangely enough, my other match opponent, Dr. Euwe, has the same peculiar tendency to exchange queens at inappropriate moments: compare, for instance, the 7th and 24th games of the 1935 match, the second match game and especially the third exhibition game of 1 937. I am mentioning these coinci dences by no means in order to put undue blame on my opponents, but merely to remind the average ama teur how particularly difficult the question of an opportune queen ex change is, and how much attention this question deserves.

It becomes more and more diffi cult to find original combinations in chess, especially in the earlier stages of the game. This, I think, is one of them: although the bishop move has been made in analogous positions (for instance, with White's pawn on a2 and his bishop on c 1 ) it has not, to my knowledge, ever before been combined with the idea of trapping the rook after Axa3 'itxb2.

3 lbf3 a6 This move, in connection with the next, was introduced by me in the third game of the 1 934 Match with Bogoljubow. Even if it can be con vincingly proved (which has not been done) that the bishop develop ment at g4 is not good for Black, the text move will still be used by those who prefer to avoid the variations starting with White's 'i'a4+. 4 a4 White has no reason to prevent ...bS, since the variation 4 e3 bS S a4 .i.b7 6 axbS axbS 7 lIxaS i.xaS S b3 is to his advantage. The text move, besides losing time, also weakens b4 and, therefore, has to be decidedly condemned. The two following posi tional fights may give an idea as to Black's possibilities after 4 e3 i.g4. Ahues - Alekhine 227 The character of the ensuing conflict depends on whether White leaves the pawn structure intact in the cen tre (as in I), or tries to solve the prob lem of the centre in a dynamic way (as in II).

But as a draw meant the same as a loss to me, I did not even take this variation into serious consideration. 28 'iVa lLle6? From now on, Fine's resistance gradually begins to weaken.

In conjunction with ... h6, this flank development has often been rather successfully adopted by Dr. Tartakower. White has several plau sible ways of meeting it, not one being a convincing refutation. In the present game, I decided to allow Black to fulfil his plan of mobilisa tion or-to be more precise-the first part of it consisting of ... .i.b7, ... lbbd7, ... c5-and to try to take ad vantage only from one detail of the position, namely the fact that the black queen is deprived of the diago nal d8-a5 and will not easily find a good square.

It lacks tactical points, is emotionless-but by no means dull-and is of use to the student. 8 :c1 .i.b7 9 .i.e2 Inducing Black to win a tempo by the following pawn exchange.

Beginning a remarkable sacrifi cial attack. It is possible that B lack might theoretically have avoided loss but Spielmann's remark to Book after the game is the best comment on this, 'How can you play like that? Such sacrifices are always correct in over-the-board play ! ' Moreover, even an Alekhine will not normally analyse exhaustively such a sacri fice-he will examine as many vari ations as he can in the limited time available, and for the rest trust that, if his general judgement of the posi tion is correct, he will be able to find a reply to an unexpected counter stroke) .

15 1'r'e2 W'e8 The idea of this move is that after an eventual tLld5 by White and an ex change on that square the rook will be ready to protect the e-pawn.

Then 1 6 tLlg5 tLlb7 17 tLlxe6 fxe6 1 8 .i.d2 tLlc5 gives rise to an equal game, while 17 tLld5 .i.xd5 ! 1 8 exd5 .i.d6 is also satisfac- tory for Black. 16 tLlg5 c4

This would, however, be better than the text as it would leave B lack with fewer weaknesses. The poin t of b4 is that whether Black exchanges or not, the pressure on White's queenside is completely eliminated. 18 tLlxe6 19 axb3 20 cxb4! fxe6 b4 Not the obvious 20 c4, in reply to which Black can play ... tLlb7-c5 blockading the passed pawn, with a good game. 20 • • • .i.xb4 21 .i.d2 .i.xd2 If 2 1 . . .tLlc6 22 .i.xb4 tLlxb4, then 23 tLlc4 ! tLlxc2 24 'ti'xc2 followed by 'ti'c3 and l:ta5.

9 d3! An excellent reply, avoiding the complications arising from 9 exd5 and ensuring White a positional advantage since the opening of the d-file is in his favour (as he can im mediately occupy it). If 9 exd5 then B lack can either play 9 .. . tl:)xd5 or 9 ... J.g4 10 dxc6 e4. 9 • • . dxe4 If 9 . . . d4, then 10 cxd4 tl:)xd4 1 1 tl:)xd4 'fi'xd4 1 2 J.e3 'ikd6 1 3 f4 with rather the better game.

J.h5 1 1 J.g5 dxe4 transposes into the line played. Finally, 9 .. . 'fi'd6 is met by 10 J.g5. In every case Black will be forced, by the combined pressure on his e and d-pawns, to play . . . dxe4 or . . .d4 and both moves react against him. This position is worth considerable study, as it is an interesting example of a not uncommon type-where one player has a free and apparently very satisfactory game but where the fundamental insecurity of his pawn formation makes it difficult for him to maintain equality. 10 dxe4 1 1 h3

3 lbf3 lN6 This famous game has been analysed many times, for example by Alekhine himself, Fine (Chess Marches On!, 1 945), Pachman (Pachman's Decisive Games, 1975) and Dvoretsky and Yusupov (Secrets o/ Chess Tactics, 1 992). As the conclusions of modem analyses are totally different to those expressed by Alexander, I shall add some extra commentary at critical points. As this extra analysis is fairly extensive, it is embedded in the text.
300 Prague 1942
4 g3 5 'iWa4+ dxe4 iDbd7 In Junge-Alekhine, Munich 1943, Alekhine played ... i.d7-c6; the more usual plan, adopted here by Junge, of ... iDd7, aims at an early advance of the queenside pawns combined with . . .i.b7. The two lines are of about equal merit, and either should give equality with careful play by Black. 6 i.g2 a6 7 'iWxe4 b5 8 'iWe6 The immediate 'iWc2 is more com mon, but White has in view a con tinuation for which he wishes to drive the rook off the a-file. 8 ... :b8 8 . . . IZ.a7 is slightly better as the rook has little future on the b-file, and from a7 it can later play across to c7 or d7 if necessary. However, the text move is perfectly sound.
9 O-O i.b7
10 'iWe2 e5 11 a4! A far-sighted positional pawn sacrifice which B lack should de cline by 1 1 . ..b4, thereby maintain ing equality. After accepting the sacrifice, the best Black can hope for is to avoid disaster if he defends with absolute accuracy. 1 1 i.xf3 12 i.xf3 exd4 13 axb5 axb5 14 :dl 'iWb6 Not 14 ... i.cS IS i.f4 eS ( I S ...

(D) Overlooking White's forthcom ing sacrifice. Black's best line was 1 6. .. i.e7 1 7 e3 dxe3 1 8 i.xe3 'iWe6 when White has adequate posi tional compensation for his pawn, but nothing immediately decisive. w 17 iDxe5 i.xe5 (D) If 17 ... 'iWxcs, then 1 8 i.c6+ iDd7 (or 1 8 . . . <Bd8 19 'iWxcs i.xcs 20 i.xbS ! ) 19 'iWxcs i.xcs 20 IZ.aS re gaining the pawn with advantage. [IN: Neither of these lines is es pecially convincing, because once queens are exchanged White has no advantage-Black's active rooks and pressure against b2 easily bal ance White's two bishops. After 1 8 . . . �d8, Alekhine gave 1 9 'iWfS 'iWxc6 20 'iWxeS with two lines: 1 ) 20 ... i.d6 21 :xd4 :b6 22 i.f4 iDe8 23 IZ.a7 �c8 24 'iWfS+ �b8, and now the strongest line is 2S :xd6 ! iDxd6 26 :d7 ±. 2) 20 ... iDd7 21 :xd4 :c8 22 i.d2 b4 23 :c1 'iWxc l + (23 . . . 'iWb6 can be broken down by 24 l:td l l:tc7 25 .i.e3 ! �c6 26 .i.f4 ! l:tb7 27 l:tal ! ) 2 4 .i. x c 1 l:txc 1 + 2 5 'iti>g2 l:tc7 26 �d5 after which White wins the fl pawn at the very least. In view of the continuing exposure of Black's king, this position can be assessed as clearly better for White. Against I S. .. lL:Jd7, Dvoretsky and Yusupov give 19 �e4, which does indeed appear very good for White, e.g. 19 ... l:tcS 20 .i.xd7+ 'iti>xd7 21 e3 or 1 9. .. l:tdS 20 e3.] w 18 l:ta6!! A magnificent and most unex pected sacrifice, which is perfectly correct. 18 . • . 'i!t'xa6 19 'i!t'xc5 'i!t'e6 If 1 9. .. lL:Jd7, then 20 .i.c6 f6 2 1 �d6 with several threats: �xd7+, .i.xd7+ and �e6+. 20 .i.c6+ lL:Jd7 If 20 .. .

[IN: In this line the simple move 22 �a5+, given by Dvoretsky and Alekhine - Junge 301 Yusupov, wins easily after 22 ... 'iti>e7 23 �c7+ lL:Jd7 24 .i.xd7 �xd7 25 �xe5+ �e6 26 �xg7 and Black will lose at least two more pawns. Alexander's 22 l:tal is far less clear after the reply 22 ...�e7 ! .] 21 hd7+ <;j;>xd7 If 2 1 . ..�xd7, 22 �xe5+ wins the rook on bS.
22 'i!t'a7+ (D) 22 . . . 'iti>c6 If 22 ... 'iti>cS, 23 .i.d2 followed by l:tc 1 + is immediately decisive. [IN: This is a critical moment. Virtually all analysts have recom mended 22 ... 'iti>d6 as leading to a draw, starting with Alekhine him self. Summarising the various analy ses gives us the following lines: 1) 23 l:txd4+ exd4 24 .i.f4+ 'iti>d5 25 .i.x bS l:tcS ! is good for B lack, as Black's king can run away via c4 and b3. 2) 23 .i.d2 �d7 24 .i.b4+ 'iti>e6 25 �a6+ 'iti>f5 26 e4+ 'iti>xe4 27 f4 and Dvoretsky and Yusupov com ment (correctly) that 'the chances of such a speculative attack succeeding would be highly dubious' .
