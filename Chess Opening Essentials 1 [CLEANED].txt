The answer is that over a hundred years of tourna- ment experience has demonstrated that Introduction there is no single opening or variation that is able to magically give a clear ad- vantage to White, or easy equality to Black. Instead there are various systems that are more or less equal in terms of statistical success in tournaments, but that are very different indeed in terms of style and the type of positions they create. Some could say that the Sicilian is the best defence against 1.e4, given that Black wins 47% of the games, com- pared to 44% for the Open Games, or 45% for the Caro-Kann. But this begs the question why a player such as Kar- pov, who was World Champion for 10 years, virtually never plays the Sicilian.

For this reason it is important to know, at least in general terms, the characteristics of all the openings, so as to choose the one that is best suited to your own personal taste and style.

What is the best move in this position? Our great-grandparents would not have hesitated for a second: the move 1 .e4!.

Indeed, until that time the vast majority of games had begun with these two moves. Why then is it that today only 10% of games begin I .e4 eS, which are the moves that de- fine the branch of opening theory known as the Open Games? The answer is that over a hundred years of tourna- ment experience has demonstrated that Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1 ning expert John Nunn wrote that until recently the advantages and disadvan- tages of a limited opening repertoire balanced themselves out, but with the advent of the computer age the balance was now clearly in favour of the player with a large repertoire. Indeed, today it is very easy to familiarize yourself with a new system with the help of a book or DVD that explains the opening's general concepts, a good database, and a varia- tion table. This preparation allows you to surprise your opponent and to play the variation most suited to the occa- sion, and also perhaps to your mood at the time. It is no mere coincidence that a player like Karpov, with his highly limited opening repertoire, has diffi- culty in the opening phase when play- ing against the younger champions who were born in the computer age. Obviously, most of us are not champion players, and we have neither the time, nor the desire, to expand our opening repertoire. However, we would suggest - if possible - that you use a minimum of two opening systems for both White and Black. This will also enlarge your understanding of the game, and you will see the benefits of this in an im- proved performance in the middle- game. As the Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman wrote, 'A wide opening reper- toire keeps your thinking flexible'. It comes as no surprise that this great player knows, and plays, almost all of the openings. In these books we will discuss all of the openings, so as to give the reader a broad but not superficial overview. We will not only give you the specific moves played, but more importantly an understanding of the ideas behind each system. To help us with this goal we will observe the traditional division into open, semi-open and closed games; not only for clear organization but also because it makes learning about them easier.

1.e2-e4 e7-e5 2. f1-c4
With 2.8c4 White not only attacks £7, which is the weakest point in Black's de- fence, but also begins harmonious devel- opment, as suggested by Philidor in the 18th century, with the usual moves d3, c3, f4 or AE3, etc. - the sort of moves every beginner learns right from the start. The bishop on c4 also has the advantage of helping to prevent his opponent's pawn advance to d5, which generally frees Black's position in the Open Games. The only negative aspect is that Black, not having yet developed the b8-knight, can ambitiously plan to push the pawn to d5 by advancing his c7-pawn to c6. How- ever, this is a risky strategy and usually Black prefers to play ...Acé6, re-entering the typical set-up of the Giuoco Pianis- simo or Vienna Game.
2. g8-F6!
This is the most logical move, as it at- tacks the undefended e4-pawn. 2...2c5 is also playable. Make sure you avoid the Bishop's Opening beginner's mistake 2...8e7?, which loses a pawn after 3.°Rh5!. After 2...Af6, and 3.c3, you transpose into the Vienna Game. The alternative
3.d4!? can complicate play, as in the vari-
ation 3...exd4 4.0f3 Axes 5.Rxd4, which is known as the Urusov Gambit. It is perhaps unsound, but in practical play it proves to be highly dangerous. However, White's best option is
3. d2-d3
Now 3...d5?! would leave the e5-pawn very weak: 4.exd5 Axd5 5.Df3 Dc6 6.O-O and then Mel. If Black does not want to transpose to other systems with

White controls the d5-square and plans the advance of the f-pawn. The Vienna Game was developed in Vienna around 1850 by Carl Hamppe, as an attempt to play an improved version of the King's Gambit. However, in the modern approach the choice of 2.4c3 is not always made with the intention of advancing the f2-pawn, but rather as part of a more solid deployment with the move Qc4, or even g3, developing the f1 -bishop by way of a fianchetto.

Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1 King's Gambit 1,e2-e4 e7-e5 2.f2-f4 The King's Gambit is one of those ope- nings which have made chess history. It was enormously popular in the 19th century at the height of the Romantic era. However, it all but disappeared with the advent of the positional school at the beginning of the 20th century. In the 1930s there was a partial re-evaluation thanks to the Swedish grandmaster Gésta Stoltz, who highlighted the positional merits of this gambit. The King's Gambit was now no longer seen simply as a means of violently attacking the f7-square via the f-file and the usual Qc4, but as a way of conquering the centre, without ruling out the possibility of later simplification and an early end- game. Its occasional use by champion players such as Keres, Spassky, Bronstein, and even the great Bobby Fischer, and more recently Gallagher and Fedorov, has made the opening popular with lov- ers of sparkling and aggressive play. However, the King's Gambit is still viewed with a certain scepticism by top players; and indeed, if Black is well pre- pared, it is difficult for White to achieve an objective advantage.

This is the latest fashion, but it is still not clear how good it is. There are some who have opined that it represents the refutation of the King's Gambit! But even if this line were as strong for Black as has been suggested, it is worth re- membering that with 3.c3 instead of

Now the move ...h4+ is such a threat that White generally plays either 3.2c4 (freeing the fl-square for the king) or
3.Mf3 (controlling h4). Eccentric
moves such as 3.c3 or 3.44 - with the idea of moving the king to e2 after the queen check on h4 - would have some appeal to a player from the Romantic period, but are fundamentally ill ad- vised.
3.204, sometimes called the Bishop's
Gambit, is not to be underestimated. Evidence of this is its employment by Fischer on several occasions, admittedly against lesser players, but with a note- worthy performance of 100%. To continue with 3..Rh4+ 4.2f1 at this point would facilitate White's development, as he can play DF3 with tempo, followed by d2-d4.

Ha Wee2 The key position of the Classical Varia- tion of the King's Gambit Accepted. It seems to go against common sense to concede the e4-pawn for the one on f4: in addition Black has an extra pawn and an active knight on e4. Nonethe- less, White receives good compensa- tion: Black's kingside has many weak- nesses, the g4-pawn, even though a material advantage, has the negative quality of restricting black activity on that wing, and perhaps Black would be better off without it (as is the case in the 5...d6 variation). In addition, White's rooks on el and f1 will exert unpleasant and ongoing positional pressure. This is also the case in varia- tions in which the queens are ex- changed. Black almost always castles queenside. White sometimes castles queenside too, and on other occasions he moves the king to d2 or otherwise to f2. In conclusion, after 8...4e7 or

This is sometimes called the Greco Counter-Gambit, after the Calabrian Gioacchino Greco, who analysed a vari- ety of lines in the early part of the 17th century. It was later revived by the Lat- vian Karl Behting, who studied it at the beginning of the 20th century. To play a type of King's Gambit with a tempo less is certainly not a particularly appealing choice for Black: the only ad- vantage is that there is not the possibil- ity of a queen check on h5 and thus Black is genuinely threatening 3...fxe4, whereas fxe5 in the King's Gambit is only an illusory threat.

The Philidor Defence is named in hon- our of the famous 18th century chess theoretician-composer, who advocated this defence, albeit with the idea of pushing the pawn to f5 as early as the third move; a concept which today is viewed with great suspicion. Philidor's aggressive approach could have some validity after the moves 3.4c3 or
3.2c4, which is the very reason that
Morphy's favourite move 3.d4! is so ap- propriate. The modern treatment of this defence tends towards a more solid ap- proach, with Black developing his pieces on the back ranks, usually ..Dbd7, ... Agfo, ...@e7, ...c6, ...Re7.

Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1 Petroff Defence
1.e2-e4 e7-e5 2..Ag1-f3 Ag8-f6
With 2...2£6, Black does not defend the e5-pawn, but attacks the e4-pawn in- stead. We are therefore talking about a defence which is conceptually ambitious and ac- tive. However, in practice, the resulting variations tend to lead to symmetrical and quiet positions, and the number of drawn games is unusually high. If Black is looking for a win, other defences would be more suitable. On the other hand, it could be an excellent choice if you are black against a stron- ger player, or one who plays ambi- tiously: indeed, if White plays too ag- gressively he may find that the more tactical variations will backfire on him. The Petroff Defence is one of the most extraordinary examples of opening re- evaluation of all time: you only need to consult a 1970s opening book to realize how little it was appreciated then. The prospect of playing symmetrical posi- tions with one or two tempi less was sufficient for it to be considered un- playable. Only the Italo-Hungarian Bela Toth played it in those years, after which it began to appear in the reper toires of Yusupoy, Karpov, Hort, Hibner and other champions. From the beginning of the 1990s the Petroff Defence has been appreciated as one of the most effective means of drawing with the black pieces - espe- cially by top-level players. The Petroff is often called the Russian Defence. Alexander Petroff, who popu- larized it at the beginning of the 19th century, and Carl Jaenisch, who also contributed a great deal to its develop- ment, were both Russians. At the begin- ning of the 20th century the American Frank Marshall believed in the validity of several lines where Black plays very aggressively. Other very dynamic play- ers, such as Harry Nelson Pillsbury, have also used the Petroff Defence with success. This makes you reflect on the common notion that certain openings are always solid and passive by nature, whereas others are always dynamic and aggressive. Fortunately, the possibility of personal interpretation in so many openings is so great that there is always room for creative play. Now we will have a close look at some specific variations. After the defence of the e4-pawn with 3.4\c3, there is
3...2c6, and you transpose to the in-
nocuous Four Knights Opening. For this reason, if White wishes to travel along more promising paths, there re- main effectively two alternatives: either to take the pawn on e5 or to look for ac- tivity with 3.d4. Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1 Petroff Defence

Only the Italo-Hungarian Bela Toth played it in those years, after which it began to appear in the reper toires of Yusupov, Karpov, Hort, Hubner and other champions.

With 2...Nf6, Black docs not defend the e5-pawn, but attacks the e4-pawn in- stead. We are therefore talking about a defence which is conceptually ambitious and ac- tive. However, in practice, the resulting variations tend to lead to symmetrical and quiet positions, and the number of drawn games is unusually high. If Black is looking for a win, other defences would be more suitable. On the other hand, it could be an excellent choice if you are black against a stron- ger player, or one who plays ambi- tiously: indeed, if White plays too ag- gressively he may find that the more tactical variations will backfire on him. The Petroff Defence is one of the most extraordinary examples of opening re- evaluation of all time: you only need to consult a 1 970s opening book to realize how little it was appreciated then.

4.2f3xd4
The Scotch Game picked up its name af- ter its use in a match between the Edin- burgh and London Chess Chibs in 1824. This opening has had many highs and lows over the years. After its employment by Jacques Mieses and Savielly Tartakower at the beginning of the 20th century, the Scotch Game was a rarity until its success- ful adoption by Garry Kasparov from 1990 on. Another extraordinary example of a completely reassessed opening. Today the Scotch Game, along with the Ruy Lopez, is considered to be the only seri- ous attempt for White to gain an advan- tage after 1.e4e5. In acertain sense 3.d4 is the most logical move: as in the Open Sicilian (i.e. the variations with 3.44), White obtains the classic space advantage (4 ranks versus 3) and does not have to worry about an enemy central pawn majority such as is typical of the Sicilian Defence. However, Scotch Game there is a drawback: with the pawn on c7 instead of on e7 the f8-bishop is ready to enter the fray on c5 or on b4, exerting a pressure on White's centre that is rare in the Sicilian. This is the reason why Scotch lines often have great positional tension: if White succeeds in neutraliz- ing Black's active piece play, he can begin to exploit his space advantage and pos- session of the centre. After 4.dxd4, Black can choose from two main lines and three minor ones. We will begin with the three minor variations:

g Swe The Four Knights Opening is one of White's most solid set-ups against
1...e5, and it was very widely played at
the beginning of the 20th century. Then it all but disappeared until the 1980s and '90s, when it made a hesitant comeback, its chief use being to avoid highly theoretical lines. Black has few problems achieving equality if White plays 4.2b5 (sometimes called the Spanish Four Knights Game) or 4.d4, which is in the spirit of the Scotch Game. That fact that Black has few problems is not surprising, as practice has taught us that if White wishes to gain a signifi- cant advantage in the open games he must usually occupy the centre with pawns. However, this is rarely possible without the support of the c3-pawn: in this context the move 4\c3, made purely as a developing move, is too me- chanical to offer concrete prospects. Four Knights Opening If White decides on 4.44, then after
4...exd4 you transpose to an innocuous
variation of the Scotch Game that we have discussed in the previous chapter. If Black is not pleased by the prospect of playing the somewhat sterile positions that ensue, he can try 4...@.b4, but after
5.@xe5, the resulting complications
seem to favour White. It is worth mentioning the minor varia- tion 4.g3. However, by far the most fre- quent continuation is:
4. Nf1-b5
k 2Wee&] ae ak, Now, unlike in the Ruy Lopez, the e4-pawn is defended, and therefore the threat 5.2xc6 and 6.4xeS is real. Black can respond in two completely different ways. A) 4... 2f8-b4 is a solid continuation that indirectly defends eS by attacking e4.

It is worth mentioning the minor varia- tion 4.g3. However, by far the most fre- quent continuation is:

The Four Knights Opening is one of White's most solid set-ups against l...e5, and it was very widely played at the beginning of the 20th century. Then it all but disappeared until the 1980s and '90s, when it made a hesitant comeback, its chief use being to avoid highly theoretical lines. Black has few problems achieving equality if White plays 4.Bb5 (sometimes called the Spanish Four Knights Game) or 4.d4, which is in the spirit of the Scotch Game. That fact that Black has few problems is not surprising, as practice has taught us that if White wishes to gain a signifi- cant advantage in the open games he must usually occupy the centre with pawns. However, this is rarely possible without the support of the c3-pawn: in this context the move 4*3c3, made purely as a developing move, is too me- chanical to offer concrete prospects. Now, unlike in the Ruy Lopez, the e4-pawn is defended, and therefore the threat 5..Nxc6 and 6.4*3xe5 is real. Black can respond in two completely different ways. A) 4. ... Af8-b4 is a solid continuation that indirectly defends e5 by attacking e4.

Dc6-d4 Rubinstein's move (who was usually a very solid player!) is appropriate if Black wants to unbalance the position. It would appear that this move contra- venes the general principles of opening theory, which always advise against moving the same piece twice in the opening. However, in this case the at- tack is specifically aimed at b5 and, above all, the presence of the knight on c3 renders a capture on d4 unwise. Moreover, it prevents the pawn push c2-c3. This gives Black resources that are not present, for example, in the Bird Defence ofthe Ruy Lopez (3...Ad4), a borderline variation in terms of playability.

The development of the c4-bishop on the 3rd move, even if slightly inconsistent with the previous move, was one of the primary moves in the early development of opening theory. The vulnerability of the f7-square and related tactics have at- tracted and delighted players and chess scholars for centuries. Snch is the bril- liant quality of the playing style so closely associated with the Romantic era. But the advent of the Positional School and the realisation that Black has nothing to fear from the most violent lines, di- rected White's attention towards the Ruy Lopez and also towards the Scotch; ope- nings that are configured with a more correct strategic concern in mind: the control of the centre. However, 3.2c4 has not disappeared from practical play and it still has a charm, perhaps because of its associa- tions with a golden past, even though by playing 3...Af6 (Two Knights) or
3...2c5, Black obtains completely play-
able positions with good prospects of equality. OK then. Why play the Hungarian? The answer is simple: the variations to re- member if you play 3...Af6 or 3...2cS are so numerous, that there are many who prefer a quiet position which is slightly inferior to the risks associated with the more violent alternatives.

Invented at the beginning of the 19th century, the Evans Gambit became so immensely popular that it threatened the supremacy of the King's Gambit. It was repeatedly played, even in World Cham- pionship matches, by players of the cali- bre of McDonnell, De la Bourdonnais, Morphy, Anderssen, Zukertort and Chigorin. However, with the develop- ment of more sophisticated defensive techniques at the beginning of the 20th century its popularity waned rapidly. To understand why, just look at the impact made by the Lasker Defence, where Black returns the pawn in exchange for a promising endgame. As a result of this defence many a white player has lost his taste for this romantic style of play. Even if later on a method was devised to avoid the Lasker Defence, the Evans Gam- bit remains chiefly the property of corre- spondence players and is rarely seen in Evans Gambit grandmaster tournament games. An ex- ception was the Italian Sergio Mariotti's victory against the strong grandmaster Svetozar Gligoric (Venice 1971). Later, in the 1990s, Kasparov, the great scholar of opening theory, won a cou- ple of brilliant victories employing the Evans.

The name Giuoco Piano (in Italian: the quiet game) is often wrongly consid- ered synonymous with the Italian Game, but in fact the two openings have game plans with very different strategic characteristics. The reason why this opening is called the Giuoco Piano is clear: White does not seek to ambitiously conquer the centre with c2-c3 and d2-d4. Instead, he contents himself with slow, natural piece development: Nd3, Ac3, O-O, Ng5. In some lines White puts off 4c3, reserving the option of 2-c3 in order to calmly prepare the d2-d4 pawn advance, with slow manoeuv- ring play. Sometimes the name Giuoco Pianis- simo (in Italian: the very quiet game) is used for the lines in which White does not try to push his pawn to d4, even when his development is completed, Giuoco Piano preferring to just get his pieces out in- stead. In the Giuoco Piano both players have equal opportunities. The main line is considered to be Aen Dgs-t6

Next, with the d3-d4 pawn advance White will conquer the centre, but Black's pair of bishops is adequate com- pensation. In these variations, which frequently feature castling on opposite sides, be- ginners will be wise to remember the old maxim: 'Black should never castle before White does'. In other words, if Black wishes to avoid unpleasant as- saults by White, it is advisable to wait and see where the latter castles, so as to castle on the same side! Another common system also features White moving the pawn to c3. It is most often reached by transposition Giuoco Piano Giuoco Piano

1.e2-e4 e7-e5 2.4\91-f3
&\b8-c6 3,.4f1-c4 Nf8-c5 One of the oldest of all openings. Black's best continuation (4...2\f6) was suggested by the Portuguese author Pedro Damiano in 1512! In the Italian Game White plans to rapidly occupy the centre with c2-c3 and d2-d4, with the advantage, compared to the Ponziani Opening, of gaining a tempo by attacking the bishop on cS. Indeed, if Black responds with the passive

\b8-c6 3.4f1-c4 298-6 This defence was noted by the Abruzzian Giulio Cesare Polerio in the 16th century, and discussed again by Giambattista Lolli and Domenico Lorenzo Ponziani two centuries later. In the 19th century it was adopted chiefly as a means of avoiding the much-feared consequences of the then reigning Evans Gambit. Why was it used just as an expedience in the past, given its popularity today?

Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1 Before examining this line, let's look at another surprising move available to Black: 4...S¢5!? which delightfully ignores the attack on f7, so as to counterattack f2. This is the Traxler Variation (or Wilkes-Barre for the Americans), and it dates back to the end of the 19th century. After S.Axf7 Rxfl+!, Black seems to have sufficient counterplay, even if a hundred years of analysis has not fully explored the resulting positions.

It must be said that White, in addition to having an extra pawn, should be able to take advantage of the unhappy position of the black king on e7 if he can play a well-timed c3 and d4. In short, this counterattack is perhaps not 100% sound, but it is dan- gerous and greatly feared.

Ruy Lopez

4\b8-c6 3.saf1-b5 The Ruy Lopez (also called the Spanish Opening) is named after the Spanish clergyman who in 1561 declared 3.2b5 to be White's best 3rd move. In his study he demonstrated that 3...ge7, which at that time was considered forced (!), is in fact unsatisfactory and he recommended that 2...d6 be played instead of 2...7\c6. A conclusion repeated by Philidor two centuries later! Naturally, it was quickly understood that the 'threat' @xc6 fol- lowed by "xe5 is not real because of ...Rd4, or better still ...Rg5, which re- gains the pawn with an advantage. With this information in mind, Black has a wide choice of playable lines. In this light, it has been correctly noted that the Ruy Lopez is quite literally a 'threatening' opening: in the sense that White is continually threatening to ex- change on c6 at the most opportune moment. For this reason, at some point Black will have to defend the e5-pawn by moving Ruy Lopez his d-pawn to d6. However, this puts White in the most favourable position for expanding in the centre with d4. An alternative for Black in modern varia- tions is to free himself of the annoying white bishop with ..a6 and ...b5, which is not without its negative conse- quences. It is important to understand what the negative positional aspects are of this preventive measure to defend the e5-pawn with a queenside expansion.

White has a good space advantage, greater control of the centre and access to the fS-square; giving him good kingside prospects. This is not to say that Black's position is lost, only that it offers no exciting prospects. 4 &

This is one of the oldest re- sponses, which is hardly surprising given how natural it is for Black to play .. Nc5 in open games. However, a natu- ral move is not necessarily also the best. Here the problem is evident. By placing the bishop on this square Black encour- ages White to occupy the centre with c3 followed by d4. An attentive reader may well ask: 'But doesn't the same thing happen in the Italian Game?'. The an- swer is that with the white bishop on c4 instead of b5 there are two differences: one strategic and the other tactical.

4\b8-c6 3.f1-b5 a7-a6 This move is the most popular response to the Ruy Lopez, even though there are other valid options, like the Berlin De- fence. The philosophy behind the Berlin is very hazardous: J will accept doubled pawns, I will give my oppo- nent space and a lead in development, hope is that White's centre will be over- extended. The result is a draw rate which is much higher than average. Black players who want a more ambitious system turn to more active defences such as the Sicil- jan, the Modern/Pirc, the Alekhine, or Ruy Lopez with 3...a6 in some cases the French. Some varia- tions of the Ruy Lopez can also be rec- ommended, such as the Jaenisch Gam- bit, which was examined in the previous section on the Ruy Lopez without 3...a6. In the Ruy Lopez with 3...a6 the most aggressive option is the Marshall At- tack, but the dynamic possibilities of the Archangel and New Archangel variations should not be forgotten. Nei- ther should those of several variations of the Open Spanish. So now we have the most common move, 3...a6. Before continuing with his development, Black prefers to re- serve the option of pushing the pawn to b5, so as to rid himself of the irritating pressure being applied on the c6-knight by White's bishop. The most popular of the various re- sponses to 3...a6 is 4.2a4. This does not mean that the exchange on cé6, which we will discuss in the next sec- tion, is to be underestimated, even though it has been dismissed by many as toothless. Nonetheless, some of the most famous white victories in the Ruy Lopez have been scored with this very variation, such as those of Lasker against Tarrasch and Capablanca, and more recently some brilliant victories with it by the 11th World Champion, the American Bobby Fischer.

White usually retreats the bishop to a4, but 4.2xc6, the Exchange Variation, is also a relatively frequent choice. After decades of stagnation, it became cele- brated again through Fischer's success- ful employment of it during the 1960s. In the new millennium it still has its ad- herents. You may think that White's only winning strategy would be win- ning the pawn endings that the varia- tion produces. However, variations characterized by opposite castling are not rare, and in these cases the predom- inate concern is the attack on the king. 4 d7xc6 Now taking on eS is useless, as after
5...Rd4, Black will regain the pawn

Before, castling had been mistakenly believed to be dubious because of
5.4 (this move is still played, but
has now been overshadowed by the classical 5...f6 and the modern
5... Rd6).
Now, castling is a move that leads to a flexible position. Depending on the cir- cumstances, White keeps the possibility of the d4 pawn advance, with or without a preparatory c2-c3, or the option of simply plonking the pawn solidly on d3. After 5.O-O, Black has many playable re- sponses. If we can trust the statistics, the results with at least five alternative vari- ations are more or less the same. We will ignore the minor lines that appear to be of doubtful merit. The following variations are in ascending order of popularity:

The d4-square is often occupied by the f3-knight. Generally this is done after c3, @.c2, which puts the adver- sary's e4-knight under pressure, and @bd2-b3 in order to be able to recap- ture on d4 with the knight or, alterna- tively, with the c3-pawn, which fixes the weakness on c7. In addition the move 'f3-d4 clears the way for White's kingside pawn majority and the pawn advance f4-f5 can be devastating. Needless to say, Black has his resources. His pieces are active, the e5-pawn is weak, and his counterplay against f2 could become unpleasant, especially af- ter ...f6, which opens the f-file for a rook. At this point White can choose between three main alternatives: 9, Re2, 9.Abd2, and 9.c3. A) 9. Rd1-e2 The Keres Variation.

Ruy Lopez - Open Variotion The strange make-up of the opposing forces is something that you do not see every day: queen and three pawns against rook and two bishops. Who is better off? This line was first played in 1942, and no one is really any the wiser after more than 60 years! There is an interesting story relating to this variation: The theory unt! the move 16...2g3 was well-established as early as 1904 and many noted players (Cohn, Maroczy, Tarrasch, Vidmar) adopted it as Black. However, Isaac Boleslavsky was the first to appreciate the potential of 17.hxg3! (previously considered to be losing) followed by the queen sacrifice: he played this vari- ation against Ragozin in1942 (1-0) as well as Botvinnink in 1943 (%4-%). Two years later in 1945, a radio match was organized as part of the end-of-war celebrations: 10 Soviet players against 10 from the USA in a double-round match. The convincing win by the Soviets came as a great sur- prise: 15%-4%. On second board Vasily Smyslov found himself facing Samuel Reshevsky. In their first game Smyslov had the white pieces, and Reshevsky allowed him to employ this very variation, which was so well known to the Soviet players and com- pletely unknown to the Americans. As a result Smyslov was able to beat his formidable opponent with unusual ease. This demonstrates how slowly news of chess developments spread in the days before the Internet. It is understandable that White would want to seek an advantage without all these fireworks. With this in mind, it may be better to turn to Ruy Lopez - Open Variation and once again Black concedes the bishop in exchange for the initiative .
14. Nb6xd4!
At this point, in the past the critical variation, which contains an incredible hidden Black sacrifice, was 15.cxd4 f4I. The strange make-up of the opposing forces is something that you do not see every day: queen and three pawns against rook and two bishops. Who is better off? This line was first played in 1 942, and no one is really any the wiser after more than 60 years! There is an interesting story relating to this variation: The theory until the move 1 6... g3 was well-established as early as 1904 and many noted players (Cohn, Maroczy, Tarrasch, Vidmar) adopted it as Black. However, Isaac Boleslavsky was the first to appreciate the potential of 17.hxg3! (previously considered to be losing) followed by the queen sacrifice: he played this vari- ation against Ragozin ini 942 (1-0) as well as Botvinnink in 1943 ('/i-'/z). Two years later in 1 945, a radio match was organized as part of the end-of-war celebrations: 10 Soviet players against 10 from the USA in a double-round match. The convincing win by the Soviets came as a great sur- prise: 15'/i-4,/i. On second board Vasily Smyslov found himself facing Samuel Reshevsky. In their first game Smyslov had the white pieces, and Reshevsky allowed him to employ this very variation, which was so well known to the Soviet players and com- pletely unknown to the Americans.

It is understandable that White would want to seek an advantage without all these fireworks. With this in mind, it may be better to turn to B .w Positionally forced: Black, who must play actively, threatens 16...f3. White occupies this square first with 16.f3 $3g3! 1 7.hxg3 fxg3. The question now is: how do you de- fend yourself against the threat of ...Rd8-h4-h2 mate? The answer is 18>d3! Af5 (I8...QW 19.Rxh7+ with an advantage for White) 1 9.Rxf5 HxfS

Almost one hundred years of attempting to refute the Marshall have not borne fruit. Indeed, the results of hundreds of games demonstrate that the Marshall Attack is one of Black's best systems. Certainly the forcing na- ture of the line, in which a good mem- ory is more important than creative play, is not to all black players' tastes. It also does not appeal to some because there are various lines in which White can force an early draw. As a conse- quence, this aggressive gambit is ironi- cally seen by many professional players as a good way to get a draw against players of their own strength, while preferring the Closed Spanish when looking for a win against weaker players. reputation. moves over the board, However, we should take one step back: Ce a be be bt By be jo Di ie eS D> So pe" et ie Ro > o> Ruy Lopez - Marshall Attack Ruy Lopez Marshall Attack

Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1 There are many white players who do not enjoy playing against the Marshall. Among these is Garry Kasparov, who af- ter 7...O-O always chose one of the so-called Anti-Marshall lines: ie. a variation in which White does not play
8.c3, and therefore the ...dS advance is
less appealing. The most traditional Anti-Marshall line begins with 8.a4 (even if in the first years of the new millennium there has been a shift towards 8.h3 @b7 9.43). During the 1990s, the most popular re- sponse to the a4 pawn advance was

Another quick look at some of the sub- tle psychology that occurs in practical modern chess: as already stated, those intending to play the Closed Spanish can play 7...d6 and 8...O-O in any order they like. However, if Black likes the positions that arise by employing Anti-Marshall lines, he can set off a smokescreen by beginning with
7...O-O, reserving the possibility of the
Marshall, and if White plays unsus- pectingly he can continue normally with 8...d6. If instead Black prefers the positions arising from the closed sys- tems and does not like the Anti-Mar- shall systems, he will usually play

Let's stop to look at the real reasons for White's last move, given the worrying fact that so many opening books do not explain the thinking behind it. 8.c2-c3 could seem to be preparation for d2-d4. However, the real reason is highly tacti- cal. The most natural would appear to be the immediate 8.d2-d4, leaving the c3-square for the knight, but this allows an unpleasant tactical intermezzo:
8...2xd4 9.@xd4 exd4 10, Rxd4??
10...c5 followed by 11...c4, and the bishop on
b3 is captured. So as not to lose the bishop, the gambit continuation 10.c3!? becomes neces- sary. It gives some compensation, but probably not enough. Now we can un- derstand in what sense 8.c3 prepares for d4: it makes the c2-square available for the fleeing bishop.

However, the real reason is highly tacti- cal. The most natural would appear to be the immediate 8.d2-d4, leaving the c3-square for the knight, but this allows an unpleasant tactical intermezzo:
8...Nxd4 9.Qxd4 exd4 10.Rxd4??
Thematic. Black already threatens
10...Bxf3, requiring White to recapture
with the g-pawn. However, White has resources with which he can liven up the game. This can be done in two ways: A) 10. Nc1-e3 defends d4 and keeps the position fluid. At this point Black concedes the centre, in order to attack it next with

13.dxc6 Re7 14.Abd2 Wxce6, play is dy-

1980. The English grandmaster was an

1.e2-e4 d7-d5
As with the Petroff Defence, here is an- other case of recent re-evaluation. The move ...d7-d5 is the typical freeing move in many defences; just think of some of the examples from the Sicilian or the Ruy Lopez. Here, however, things are not so simple: after 2.exd5, if Black takes back with the queen he re- mains behind in development. If, on the other hand, he plays 2...Af6 so as to take on d5 with the knight; after 3.4, White gets a nice centre with prospects of further expansion with c2-c4. At least, that is what opening manuals have blindly repeated for years and years. However, recent practice has demon- strated that this assessment is a little su- perficial and that there are structural el- ements present which are favourable for Black: to start with, Black frees himself of the irritating presence of the e4-pawn, which in King's Pawn ope- nings lays the foundation for kingside attacks. In addition, we have a 4:3 kingside pawn majority, which tends to make kingside castling a safer proposi- tion for Black. Mak Hawa

It is still true that advancing his pawn to d4 gives White a certain central pre- dominance, at least in terms of space, with greater piece activity as a conse- quence.

The position is now practically that of a Caro-Kann where Black has lost some tempi, and he will lose another with a further queen move. On the other hand, White's knight is more passive on c3 than on e4. Moreover, by following this virtually forced sequence Black has avoided the dangerous Advance Varia- tion of the Caro-Kann.

This is one of the most theoretically revolutionary openings in the history of the game. First made famous by the later World Champion Alexander Alek- hine in 1921, it is based on a startling concept, which at the time bordered on heresy: to provoke White to advance his pawns in an attempt to prove that these advanced centre pawns are in fact a weakness rather than a strength.

But let's return to 5.f4. How do we eval- uate such a position? Is White, with his imposing centre, ready to start a mating attack? Or is his centre a house of cards that is about to collapse? In practice, both of these events occur, and this is why we are looking at some of the most complex and exciting variations in opening literature.

1.€2-e4 g7-g6
The development of the bishop on g7 and the pawn move to dé, signify that this is a close relative of the Pirc. How- ever, the difference is that in the Mod- ern the knight is absent from f6, or it develops to this square later on. When White pushes his pawn to c4, the game resembles the Queen's Pawn Opening: in other cases it remains more in the realm of the semi-open games. Here we have a very elastic defence. Black almost ignores what White does and develops on his own account with a wide number of plans to choose from. This makes the Modern an ideal de- fence for those among you that don't want a system for which you need to learn a lot of established theory. Black sometimes chooses not to make the classical pawn move ...d6, preferring instead to set up a Modern/Caro-Kann hybrid with pawns on cé6 and d5. However, usually Black does proceed with ...d6 (which can also be played on Modern Defence the first move) and ...2g7. He can push his pawns to e5 or to c5, or otherwise to c6-bS or a6-b5. Black may decide to develop the b8-knight to d7 or to c6, and the g8-knight to f6 or e7. White is not urgently required to defend e4 as in the Pirc, and therefore, he tao has a wide variety of approaches available to him. As a result of all this, it is very difficult to systematically examine this chame- leonic defence.

Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1 Caro-Kann Defence
1.e2-e4 c7-c6
When Nimzowitsch wrote during the 1920s that the Caro-Kann Defence is the refutation of 1.e4, he was either kidding or he just wanted to stir the stagnant waters of a theoretical ap- proach that resisted al] attempts at inno- vation under the banner of Tarrasch's rigid and dogmatic principles. Nimzowitsch knew that if you want to rock the boat you need to exaggerate somewhat. The proof that Nimzowitsch did not fully believe his pronouncement is demonstrated by the fact that he contin- ued playing 1.e4 on a fairly regular ba- sis after making this remark! What he really meant was that it isn't compul- sory to answer 1.e4 with 1...e5 and that there are many potential strategies available besides pure frontal opposition based on simple space control. In this sense 1...c6 is conceptually very ambitious. The e4-pawn, unlike its col- league to the immediate left, is unpro- tected.

With this poisonous move, White gains space on the kingside and threatens to seriously harass the fS -bishop. Indeed, the natural 4...e6?? loses the bishop after g2-g4, f2 f3 and h4-h5. After 4...h6
5.g4, if Black continues with the nor-

If Black dithers, White will have the usual initiative on the queenside.

We have entered an endgame which the old opening manuals declared to be ad- vantageous for White. This opinion held sway in spite of the doubled pawn on £3, because of White's queenside majority and Black's badly coordinated pieces (not to mention the isolated pawns on dS and a7). In reality, hun- dreds of games have demonstrated that Black equalizes easily. The percentage of draws is unusually high: 65% against 35% for the entire Caro-Kann Defence.

Caro-Kann Main Line
After 1.e4 c6 2.d4 dS, White's most usual choice contimies to be defending e4 with the knight, usually with 3.c3. Over the last 20 years the psendo re- finement 3.2d2 is a frequent alterna- tive. Given that nine times out of ten Black continues by taking on e4, this move does not make a big difference. Unless, of course, Black intends to play one of the 3...g6 systems. In that case @d2 proves to be more precise than c3 given that, as in some lines of the Modern Defence, White keeps the op- tion of supporting the centre with c3. However, you need to contemplate the wisdom of discouraging a variation (3...g6) that has a worse performance statistically than other normal varia- tions! Indeed, after 3.2c3 g6, the posi- tion has the characteristics of many du- bions variations of the Pirc-Modern Defence. For White 4.h3!, so as to pre- vent ...@g4, seems best. After 4...2g7
5.@f3 the results tend to be in White's
Caro-Kann - Main Line favour in the positional variations. The aggressive continuation 5...Af6 6.e5 Det 7.Axet dxet 8.0g5 c5 9.204 also seems to be doubtful for Black. Returning to 3.4c3 (3.0d2), and now:
3... d5xe4
4. @c3xe4
fe
ARAM RAR
We have reached the key position of the Classical Variation of the Caro-Kann. Black has three continuations: A) 4...Af6, which is provocative and controversial. Its reputation oscillates from 'dubious' to 'interesting'; B) 4...2d7, the popular Smyslov Vari- ation; C) 4...@-£5, the old main line. A) 4. 4\g8-f6 Black allows the creation of an ugly doubled pawn, which has the virtue of controlling e5, the usual outpost for White's pieces in the Caro-Kann.

Now we have reached one of the most important positions of the Caro-Kann. White can choose from many plans, whereas Black's scope for development is restricted. Usually White continues with 6.h4, but once in a while he also has plans that include Ae2-f4 - with or without Nc4. The advantage of the two Caro-Kann - Main Line bishops after the possible exchange of the f4-knight for the g6-bishop is only academic. This is because in the closed positions that are typical of these varia- tions it is not rare that a knight is more effective than a bishop. The sacrifice of a knight or bishop on e6 in these varia- tions is interesting but not really sound. On the other hand, the idea of advanc- ing the f-pawn is a double-edged sword, because if the subsequent ad- vance to f5 becomes impossible, the pawn on f4 will become a pronounced positional weakness; for starters, just have a look at the poor bishop on cl.

However, fortunately for us, history has demon- strated that this is far from being the case, and that there still exist large areas that have yet to be explored, and much from the past that need to be reassessed in the light of what we know now. Even if one day wc do manage to sift through everything there is to be known about chess, human memory is such that the old saying 'Everything new is some- thing forgotten' will prove itself to be as true as ever. Returning to where we left off, White almost always proceeds with
5. 5Be4-g3
By the way, even if S.ftcS is playable and better than it would appear to be: as is so often the case with David Bronstein's ideas!
5. ... Af5-g6
Now we have reached one of tire most important positions of the Caro-Kann. ii mi White can choose from many plans, whereas Black's scope for development is restricted. Usually White continues with 6.h4, but once in a while he also has plans that include 4be2-f4 - with or without J>.c4. The advantage of the two Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1
10...AdS, White does not gain any-
thing - indeed, the results favour Black)
9... 2xd3 (9... Wixd4?
10.Rxd3 e6.
10.Axf7!)
White seems to have gained a tempo compared to variations of the old main line: the pawn on the h4-square has no influence on the game compared to hS, but the knight's placement on e5 rather than f3 seems to be an advantage. How- ever, the latter may in fact not be the case. In certain variations of the Petroff Defence also, the black knight is better on f6 than on e4, where it facilitates White's development). The resulting positions are typical of the Caro-Kann: solid but cramped, and are variously described as equal or slightly to White's advantage, depending on the taste of the commentator. Let's return to 7...Ad7.

As the pawn has already been played to h4, you may as well advance it one more square before exchanging the bishops. a. 9g6-h7

Now, to stop Nf4, Black usually pro- ceeds with

We have reached another key position of the Caro-Kann (a so-called tabiya, an Arabic term for 'key position' which is derived from the medieval predecessor of the game). Experience gained from thousands of games demonstrates that the best move for White is either of the following two:

This is despite the fact that it seems to contravene the principle that in a cramped position, every exchange favours the defender. However, as you know, the complexity of chess arises Caro-Kann - Main Line from the fact that there are as many ex- ceptions as there are rules: in this spe- cific case the knight on g3 is White's most passive piece and it seems to be a good idea to exchange it for the knight on f6, which is playing an important defensive role. In addition, the move makes g2-g3 possible, with control of £4. Atthis stage, Black almost always plays

MfMO This defence had its successful debut in a 1834 London/Paris correspondence team match (hence the name) and in the following years it was to become the 2nd most popular defence after the reigning 1 ...eS. More than anything, l...e6 is a radical way of avoiding all those f7-square based tactics that give Black headaches in the Open Games. It was only with the boom in the Sicilian's popularity, which started in the middle of the 20th century, that the French became the third most popular choice against 1 ,e4. Many champions have employed the French as one of the main weapons in their repertoire: Botvinnik is an illustri- ous exponent from the past, while Bareev, Yusupov, Dolmatov and Kortchnoi are noteworthy contem- porary users. For many, the French is a defence to ei- ther love or hate: in some it inspires an enthusiasm that borders on the fanatical - again, just think of Uhlmann, who - as often happens - Black is ready to undermine the pawn chain d4-e5 with the ...c7-cS advance in one go, or, more rarely, with the advance ...f7-f6. The price to be paid for this is the pas- sive bishop on c8, which in the Caro-Kann develops without problems. Conceptually speaking, the French is an active defence - contrary to what you would imagine, the percentage of draws in the French is lower than in the Open Games - even if many quiet lines can ensue. The Exchange Variation is a good example. Generally Black concedes space on the kingside in exchange for counterplay against White's centre and good prospects on the queenside, We could simplify things by saying that if Black gets through the middlegame alive, his possession of the c-file and the weakness of the white d4-pawn give him excellent endgame prospects. This is a very general assessment. Clearly there are some specific variations that have different characteristics. Just think of the Tarrasch Variation with 3...c5. Here Black's isolated d5-pawn favours White's endgame chances and Black must play all his cards in the middlegame! Now we will have look at the specifics of the variations. After 1.e4 e6, nine times out of ten White responds with
2.d4. However, various other replies are
possible:

The move 2.d3 introduces the King's Indian Attack, as we have mentioned earlier in the section on the Caro-Kann. The King's Indian Attack is a King's In- dian Defence played with the white pieces. Given that the best plan for White in the King's Indian is to advance his e-pawn to e4, here White profits from the fact that Black has already ad- vanced his e-pawn to e6 to establish the same position with an extra tempo.

However, equality does not mean a drawn game. In fact, Black has a better win rate than White in this variation! The explanation for this lies in compet- itive psychology: sometimes, when facing a stronger opponent, a white player will choose this system, which is famous for it drawish nature, to score a precious half-point.

This is sometimes called the Nimzowitsch Variation - as if there weren't already enough variations with that man's name ~ and it represents one of White's most ambitious options. White gains space on the kingside and he is not afraid to concede Black the initiative. Black will apply pressure to the d4-pawn for several moves, and White will be forced to defend it. This is the heart of the matter. Will this at- tack bring some concrete advantage, or will it come to nothing and will White then be able to exploit his structural advantage? This subject has been a topic of debate since the time when Nimzowitsch dis- puted Dr. Siegbert Tarrasch's claims (i.e. that 3.e5 is strategically wrong) in the pages of his famous book My System. Nowadays, we do not have to rely on the inevitably subjective opinions of commentators on any given variation. Modern players have a resource that was French Defence - Advance Variation unavailable in the greater part of the last century: Statistics. With all its defects, statistical analysis can be very revealing and supply a lot of useful information. If, as in this case, statistics are available for thousands and thousands of games, and White's per- formance is within the standard result range (let's say 52-55%), then the re- sults are normal and harsh judgements are unwarranted. Perhaps the truth lies somewhere be- tween the two conflicting viewpoints:
3.e5 does not give White the net advan-
tage that Nimzowitsch claimed, nor does it give Black as easy a game as Tarrasch would have us believe. Black almost always responds with the natural

5...8d7 with the idea of ...Age7-f5 is

Obviously the double capture on d4 doesn't work because of 9.8.b5+, which wins the queen.

D1) 4. _. Rd8xd5 An increasingly large number of players are choosing this move, which leads to sharp positions that are reminiscent of some Sicilian lines. Even if it is not nec essarily the best move, the capture by the queen is definitely a nuisance for White, who would normally prefer to proceed more quietly. Generally he re- acts with

with strong players; however, it has few adherents at lower levels, where there is an instinctive mistrust of the isolated queen's pawn: that is, if it is black! The point being that when the isolated queen's pawn is white, players seem to be much more aware of its dynamic po- tential. Just think of the Sicilian with

a5 54.b3b5 0-1 French Defence Winawer Variation
1.e4 e6 2.04 d5 3.4\c3 a&b4
At a deep level this is very logical: Black indirectly attacks the e4-pawn without allowing White to gain a tempo with the pawn advance e4-e5, and reserves e7 for his king's knight. The obvious drawback is that the bishop on b¢ very often ends up being exchanged for the knight on c3, with a consequent weakening of the dark squares, which in some variations can result in the black king's safety being put in jeopardy. However, Black enjoys long-term advantages thanks to the dou- bled white pawn on c3 and the excellent play offered on the queenside - at least in the Classical Winawer. Like all the openings, it has virtues which compen- sate for its defects. Nonetheless, the Winawer manages to polarize opinions in a particularly pronounced fashion. This becomes clear when you consider the fact that former World Champion Mikhai] Botvinnik used it for years as his main weapon against 1.e4, while an other World Champion, Bobby Fischer, French Defence - Winawer Variation notwithstanding the poor results he had against the Winawer (or perhaps for that very reason!), considered it to be positionaily unsound!
4.e5 is the move most often chosen by
White. However, before looking at that, we will have a brief look at the minor alternatives. While none of these put the soundness of the Winawer in doubt, they can be most dangerous if Black is not sufficiently prepared. A) 4. a2-a3 The most direct.

There also exists another incredible alternative, which we will look at first: A) 4. 2b4-f81? Compared to the normal Advance Vari- ation, White already has his knight on c3 and it's his turn to move! However, Black will try to prove that the knight is badly placed on c3, where it blocks the c2-pawn.

If White believes these considerations to be valid, he could continue with the even more paradoxical 5.4b1!? return- ing to the 3.e$ variation... But usually White is sceptical and continues with the natural 5.A\f3. Black's tournament results, though not exceptional, are ac- ceptable. Please note that you can often reach this position via the Steinitz Variation(!!) with the move sequence 3...Af6 4.e5 Ags. B) 4.

Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1 Let's look at the interesting position that has arisen, which is very reminiscent of the analogous position in the Classical Winawer. Material is equal (the a5-pawn will disappear soon), but strategically both positions have evident virtues and de- fects. White is behind in development and must defend e5; in compensation he has control of the dark squares, and in the endgame the h-pawn may be a winning trump card. For his part, Black quickly prepares ...O-O-O with ...Re7/aS and ...2d7, if necessary sac- rificing the f7-pawn, and he will acti- vate his pieces - in particular his rooks - on the kingside, and the e7-knight, moving it to £5,or to d5 after ...d5-d4. Returning to concrete variations, White usually defends e5 with the ambitious

Here we have the key position of the Classical Winawer. For the moment White's centre is suffi- ciently solid, and the usual pressure ap- plied by Black to d4, which is typical of many French variations, is less effective here, given that White has a second c-pawn with which to support the cen- tre. Black's trump cards are the weak- nesses of the white a-pawn, the c2-pawn and the c4-square, which can be effectively occupied by a knight. In addition, Black can exert strong pres- sure along the c-file. The position has French Defence - Winawer Variation all the characteristics of a slow ma- noenvring struggle. Naturally, White has his own trumps to play: he will seek to exploit the weak- ness on g7, moving the queen to g4; or develop his pieces more solidly and nat- urally, hoping to put his dark-squared bishop to good use when the game in- evitably opens. Black can castle either kingside or queenside, and attack the head of the white pawn chain by ...f7-f6. In the lines with kingside cas- tling, he can advance the pawn to c4 to prevent the opening of attacking lines for White; White sometimes opens up the game with the 'sacrilegions' dxc5. It is no wonder that the Classical Winawer is considered to be such a strategically complex opening. Now, 6...e7 is the natural move, dem- onstrating that Black is not afraid of the attack on g7 with Rg4.

10...Re3+), after which the strategic
considerations are the same as those al- ready discussed in the Armenian Vari- ation with We¢. White now has two possibilities to deal with Black's threats: C1) = 10. #e1-d1 Rae @ ko AaW Baw

Chess Opening Essentials ~ Volume 1 which of White's many alternatives is the best. He can take on c3 with the queen or the knight, or he can move the cl-bishop to e3 or the rook to b1. Another alterna- tive is to advance the h-pawn. White tries to organize his forces, which at the moment are not harmoniously placed. He hopes to make the most of the extra pawn that he will have, the two bishops, and the passed h-pawn. For his part, Black will castle queenside and seek to activate his pieces by plac- ing one knight on f5 and the other on c4 by way of aS. Sometimes he will play ...f7-f6 to undermine White's centre and activate the d7-bishop, moving it to g6 via e8, and he often pushes ...d5-d4, to break open the white king's position. It is not possible here to examine all of the variations exhaustively. We will therefore present only one of the many possible lines, which is, however, indicative of the strategic and tactical complexity of the system. 13, Ae2xc3!? a7-a6 To stop AbS.

Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1 Sicilian Defence
1.e2-e4 c7-c5
In the Sicilian Defence, Black advances his pawn to cS so as to make it as difficult as possible for White to achieve the ideal pawn centre, which consists of pawns on e4 and d4. Until the end of the 1920s, Black almost always preferred to directly occupy the centre with the classical move
1...e5. However, the Sicilian Defence has a
big advantage over this move: usually White responds to ...c5 by advancing his pawn to d4 and then recaptures with the knight (the Open Sicilian). This gives Black the advantage ofa central pawn ma- jority; an e-pawn and d-pawn against the single white e-pawn. This structure has strategic characteristics that are more complex than those of the Open Games, and Black can end up with a variety of very different pawn formations. White, for his part, can castle kingside or queenside. He can play strategically, or he can violently attack the black king by making use of his space advantage and better piece development, and the in- creased mobility granted by these factors. White directs his forces to the kingside, and Black seeks an initiative on the queenside, exploiting the semi-open c-file. There are, of course, the inevita- ble exceptions: a striking example is the Sveshnikov Variation, in which Black develops a strong kingside initiative against the white king! This complexity is well suited to the taste of modern players, who like to be able to deter- mine the strategy of their own game, and not have it determined too much by the strategic intentions of their op- ponent, even if this relative autonomy entails greater risks. The Sicilian was virtually never played in the 19th cen- tury: it enjoyed a boom in the second half of the 20th century, and it is as vital and popular as ever at the beginning of the new millennium. Kasparov, whom many consider to be the strongest player of all time, played it almost ex- clusively, and his contributions, espe- cially in the Najdorf Variation, have led to the creation of a very large body of theory. However, we are still far from plumbing the depths of this defence. Minor Variations 2,2£3 and 3.d4 leads to the Open Sicil- ian. However, there are quite a few play- ers who, for one reason or another, pre- fer one of the following minor varia- tions. These variations may not be quite as sharp as the main lines, but they should not be underestimated by Black. In particular, the Sicilian with 2.c3 - otherwise known as the Alapin Varia- tion - has become so popular lately that itis only because of convention that it is still classified as a minor system.

Wing Gambit
1. e2-e4
The Wing Gambit has never been popu- lar with elite players, and for the few who do use it at this level it is only brought out as a surprise weapon. White plays 2.b4 with the intention of giving up a pawn, in order to construct a strong pawn centre with 3.d4; or he will acti- vate his pieces with 3.a3. Against correct play, White does not seem to gain suffi- cient compensation for the pawn. How- ever, in practice it is not easy for Black to defend his position. Morra Gambit Here is another gambit for adventure lovers, even if it is more positional by nature than most of the other gambits:
1. e2-e4 c7-c5
2. d2-d4 c5xd4
3. c2-c3 d4xc3
4. Qb1xc3
White gives up a pawn for development, and above all to make the c- and d-files available for occupation by his rooks. Black, denied his usual active play on the queenside, has to operate in a cramped and passive position for many moves. Sicilian Defence tas Roeae An @ "WAK H BWeene White usually develops his pieces very aggressively (usually: @f3, Ac3, Qf4, Nc4, Re2, fai, Hacl) and Black must defend with precision. Black usually es- tablishes a Scheveningen set-up (e6, d6, a6, Af6, Rc6, Be7, 2d7, Re7 or Rb8) and normally delays kingside castling. A modern treatment of the Morra Gambit by Black involves advancing the pawn to e5: a drastic measure to prevent e4-e5 (which in many continuations causes Black serious problems). More rarely Black fianchettoes on the kingside in the style of the Dragon Variation. The Siberian Variation has become a very fashionable choice re- cently:

1.e4 c5 2.c3
This variation deserves special attention because of its noteworthy current pop- ularity. Ina certain sense, 2.c3 is the most logi- cal way to proceed; White seeks to cre- ate the ideal pawn centre, i.e. pawns on the d4- and e4-squares. White wants to play 3.d4: if then 3...cxd4, he recaptures with the c3-pawn. The move 2.c3 also has its disadvan- tages: it is not a developing move, as is the normal 2.3; but the main prob- lem is that it denies the b1-knight the possibility to develop to its natural destination, the c3-square. This is not an esoteric point, as it allows Black ef- fective counterplay against the unde- fended e4-pawn, with the opportunity to reach improved versions of the Alekhine (2...Af6), the Scandinavian (2...d5), or the French (2...e6 and
3...d5).
However, Black can also ignore his ad- versary's 'threat' to conquer the centre if he wants to, and continue with ...d6, M6, ...g6, ...Ng7 and ...O-O. But this allows White to maintain a slight ad- vantage. Here is a more detailed look at these five approaches that Black can use against the Alapin Variation. A) 2 d7-d5 Aiming to exploit the fact that White, having already occupied the c3-square, will not be able to attack the black queen on d5. This variation often leads to positions with an isolated d4-pawn, with the usual strategic considerations for both colours that this entails. Here Black can very actively play ...Ng4, with or without ...Af6; or otherwise, continue more modestly with ...e7-e6, leaving the c8-bishop on its home square.

It is curious that the idea of the f4-f5 sacrifice isn't from the Sicilian but from Closed Sicilian 1,e2-e4 c7-c5 2,.4:b1-c3 %\b8-c6 3.g2-g3 AiR in o i In the past decades, the Closed Sicilian was popular with players like Vasily Smyslov and Boris Spassky. Today, too, it has its admirers at all levels - from be- ginners to grandmasters. By playing 2.c3 before opening the diagonal for the fianchetto, White an- ticipates on ...d7-d5, which liberates Black's game. The most common re- sponse is 2...Ac6, after which White plays 3.g3, with the idea of developing the f1-bishop to g?. Another good plan for Black is 2...e6 (or 3...e6) to prepare ...d7-d5: this is good for players who do not mind play- ing with hanging or isolated pawns, in positions where good piece play com- pensates for static weaknesses. The bishop on g2 exerts further influ- ence on d5, reinforcing central con- trol, and only later will White shift his focus to the kingside. Beginners should note that to attack effectively on the flanks, the centre should be closed, or Closed Sicilian otherwise you must have good control over it. The Closed Sicilian is characterized by White's intention to not open the posi- tion with "f3 and d2-d4, but instead to play a manoeuvring game marked by the development of the bishop to g2 and expansion on the kingside. The price to be paid for this is a certain weakening of the queenside. In the main line Black usually continues with
3...26, to place the dark-squared bishop
on g7, from where it can support counterplay on the queenside (...3b8, ...8b7-b5-b4). This system utilizes ideas from the Eng- lish Opening (with reversed colours): l.ct e5 2.Ac3 Ac6 3.23 g6. However, in the Sicilian, White's extra tempo changes things slightly.

As we will see, the most common plan begins with 6.f4. However, recently the move: 6.-ale 3 has become increasingly popular, especially with players at low to medium levels. Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1 The manoeuvre @e3-Rd2-2h6, with the idea of 2xg7, h4-h5-hxg6 and Whe, is very dangerous if Black responds me- chanically. However, White needs to be careful as well. There is a trap that he can fall into: After 6...c6 7.Rd2 Age7 8.2h6 O-O 9.h4 Qxh6 10.Wxho f6!, if White now continues with the thematic 11.h5??, Black wins the queen with 11...¢5 followed by ..@h8 and ...2g8. On the other hand, if White plays the correct move 1 1.Rd2, he has a small plus. A good plan for Black seems to be to leave the knight on g8 and to begin im- mediate queenside counterplay with
6...2b8, and after 7.Age2 (threatening
d4) 7...2d4 8.O-O e6 9.Rd2 bS or
9...2e7, Black has sufficient counterplay.
However, as we have already said,
6. f2-f4

Black fundamentally has four ap- proaches: - develop the king's knight to the natu- ral f6-square. However, placing the knight here has the defect that it is a lit- tle exposed to the advance of White's pawns; - prepare immediate counterplay on the queenside with ...Nb8 and ...b7-b5-b4, postponing the decision of how to de- velop the kingside. - play the direct ...e7-e5 along the lines of the Botvinnik Variation of the Eng- lish Opening, with reversed colours; - play ...e7-e6 and develop the king's knight to e7. The last two options are the most fre- quently played: A) 6. an e7-e5 An ambitious continuation, which at first glance seems illogical, as it blocks the extended control of the dark-squared diagonal and helps White to open the f-file. However, Black takes possession of the e5-square. Play is more fluid, and it is suitable for players who prefer posi- tions that are more open than those that are produced by 6...e6.

Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1 seeks counterplay by expanding on the queenside with ...b5-b4. Black fundamentally has four ap proaches: - develop the king's knight to the natu- ral f6-square. However, placing the knight here has the defect that it is a lit- tle exposed to the advance of White's pawns; - prepare immediate counterplay on the queenside with ...Ub8 and ...b7-bS-b4, postponing the decision of how to de- velop the kingside. - play the direct ...e7-eS along the lines of the Botvinnik Variation of the Eng- lish Opening, with reversed colours; - play ...e7-e6 and develop the king's knight to e7.

The manoeuvre Q,e3-Rd2-Ah6, with the idea of 3i.xg7, h4-hS-hxg6 and Rh6, is very dangerous if Black responds me- chanically. However, White needs to be careful as well. There is a trap that he can fall into: After 6...e6 7.#d2 4ige7 8..Nh6 O-O 9.h4 Nxh6 10.Rxh6 f61, if White now continues with the thematic H.h5??, Black wins the queen with 11.,.g5 followed by ...<Nh8 and ..fbg8. On the other hand, if White plays the correct move 1 1.Rd2, he has a small plus. A good plan for Black seems to be to leave the knight on g8 and to begin im- mediate queenside counterplay with
6...Hb8, and after 7.4hge2 (threatening
d4) 7... d4 8.O-O e6 9.Rd2 bS or
9...'?Be7. Black has sufficient counterplay

is the most common move, planning a pawn storm on the kingside. Black which is often chosen because of the following traps that can easily ensnare an unsuspecting Black player. White aims for the f4-f5 advance, and there- fore it is best if the knight does not in- terfere with the scope of the rook on the f-file after kingside castling. After natural moves like 7...Age7
8.O-O, Black may play, as so often hap-
pens, the natural-looking 8...O-O?. Now White plays the sacrifice 9.f5! obtaining a very good position. If instead Black plays the more prudent
8...Ad4!, again White can either offer a
sacrifice with 9.f5!? or play the quieter
9.263.
Probably the safest thing for Black to do is to exchange immediately on f4, on the 7th move. yr e5xf4 White cannot recapture with the pawn, because of 8...2xh3 and 9...Rh4+4, gaining a piece. After White recaptures with the knight or the bishop, he will control the d5-square and have pressure on the f-file. However, Black will be left with some trumps: the very active g7-bishop and the d4- and e5-squares for the knights. B) 6... e7-e6 The most common continuation. Black fights against the f4-f5 push more ef- fectively this way, and in the event that White prepares for this advance with g3-g4, Black has the option of taking a radical step to prevent it: ...f5; the g8-knight develops to e7, where it is less exposed to White's pawn storm and exerts influence on the key f5-square.

Black can defend himself, but his task is not easy. This gambit is not White's only option. Interesting alternatives are: 10.2b1 (used by the young Anatoly Karpov),
10.Rd2, or the new idea 10.22, in
order to be able to recapture on d4 with the knight without being forked. In conclusion, the Closed Sicilian, while certainly not the antidote to the Sicilian, has a big plus: it is not necessary to memorize hundreds of variations. It is sufficient just to develop a feel for the typical positions which, because they are strategically complex, tend to favour the stronger player rather than the one who is better prepared.

AW AR
BaAQwWS The Rossolimo Variation is the most important ofthe minor variations avail- able to White in response to 2...Ac6. It is named in honour of the Ukrai- nian-born player who successfully em- ployed it from the 1940s. Its recent popularity would seem to be tied to white players' growing respect for the Sveshnikov Variation. An ever-increas- ing number of them will not 'risk' 3.d4 and would rather steer the game into complex strategic positions, which give the better player good chances of vic- tory. White's position is very flexible: he can push a pawn to c3 and d4; he can ex- change the bishop for the c6-knight, or otherwise bring it back to f! after He!; he can try to establish strategic posi- tions, or choose a violent gambit con- tinuation. In short, it is ideal for players who prefer to 'play' instead of 'remem- ber'.

6...41h6! is the most popular move, and
it is also probably the strongest. The knight does not develop to f6, as this would invite e4-e5. It does not go to e/ either, because the advance ...e7-e6 needed to make this possible would weaken the d6- and f6-squares. After 6...4jh6 Black proceeds with ...f7-f6, always with the idea of pre- venting e4-e5, the knight on h6 repositions to f7 , the d-pawn advances to d6 and his companion will possibly go to eS; and then Black should have reasonable prospects.
C2) 4. O-O
This remains the most common contin- uation.

Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1 Black is now less afraid of e4-e5, as the Nf6 can go to c7 by way of d5, attack- ing the bishop on bS. Now that White has castled kingside, after 2xc6, Black recaptures with the d-pawn and places the c7-knight on e6, aiming for the outpost d4, with a solid position. Therefore White usually chooses

The last move fixes the weakness of the d6-pawn by preventing its liberating ad- vance to d5 for quite some time. How- ever, it concedes control of the d4-square to Black. White often makes the knight manoeuvre "\b5-a3-c2-e3 to reinforce contro] of d5 and thus main- tains a small but persistent advantage. If Black is to compensate for this posi- tional disadvantage, he must guarantee himself active play with the minor pieces, perhaps exchanging his passive king's bishop (with the manoeuvre ...@£8-e7-g5). In addition he needs to try and carry out the ...b7-b5 break, which, by removing the head of the white pawn chain on c4, lays the foun- dations for an advantageous opening of the centre with ...d6-d5. Alternatively, there is ...f7-f5, perhaps after ...g7-g6, to obtain a kingside initiative. Fundamentally, White's best strategy seems to be to prevent the realization of Black's plans, and if he reaches the end- game, to try and make the most of his structural advantage. White can also try to advance the pawns on the queenside with b2-b4-b5. If Black responds with ...axb5, he recap- tures with the c-pawn and can then try to exploit his pawn majority on that wing. Alternatively, White can move his knight to dS, where it is strongly placed, and force Black to exchange it, then recapture with the e4-pawn and prepare c4-cS with b2-b4.

How- ever, it was only towards the end of the 1970s that it became genuinely popular. At the beginning of this new century its reputation is better than ever: practically all the best players - Kramnik, Shirov, Topalov, Lautier, lvanchuk, Leko (and to- wards the end of his career, Kasparov) - use the Sveshnikov relatively frequently! Not bad for a variation that was origi- nally considered to be unsound. This does not mean that assessments based on positional considerations are no longer valid; it is just that today more impor- tance is given to the dynamic features of a position. In the case in question, it is true that the d5-square is weakened, but Black's good piece activity makes it diffi cult, if not impossible, for White to ex- ploit this weakness, This system remains one of the best if Black is playing for a win, even if that entails taking greater risks. In addition, with the proliferation of open tournaments, it is common to encounter players of all levels.

as it was discovered that the 'classical' 8-.fi.xf6 gxf6 9.5)a3 gives Black good play after 9...fS!. In the past players now continued with
8....fi.e6, however, from the 1970s on-

8. ... b7-b5!
This followed a more modern inter- pretation of the position by the Rus- sian grandmasters Evgeny Sveshnikov and Gennady Timoschenko. It is often called the Cheliabinsk Variation, to dif- ferentiate it from the older 8...fi.e6 variation.

The Accelerated Dragon is one of the oldest of the Sicilian variations. It made its distant debut in 1851 in London.

Frustrated by the difficulties presented by the Maréczy formation, players started to experiment with 2...d6.

White, for his part, can seek aggressive counterplay on the kingside with f4-f5. He can also de- velop his queen's bishop to e3 (or to g5), retreat the queen to d2 and then play a timely Ad5 (without castling, so the king can recapture on d2). If this is followed by an exchange of queens, an endgame, or better still, a queenless middlegame ensues that is often favour- able for White. After the likely exchange on d5, White can choose e4xd5, which means he will then exert a certain amount of pressure on the e7-pawn by means of the semi-open e-file. Alternatively, he can play c4xd5, hoping to control or exploit the open c-file. When this file is open, it is common for the major pieces to be exchanged on this file.

HAGWeS 8 After 2...e6, White can decide not to advance the pawn to d4, to avoid some of the better-known theory. With 3.d3 or 3.Re2, you generally transpose into variations of the King's Indian Attack, which is arrived at with the following moves: Af3, g3, 2g2, O-O, d3, Abd2 and e4. The precise or- der of the moves is usually not so im- portant. It is so named because White is playing a King's Indian Defence with colours reversed. White can also open the diagonal for his queen's bishop with 3.b3 or seek to wanspose to the Alapin with 3.c3 or, with the non-committal moves 3.4\c3 or 3.c4, to an Open Sicilian on the next move.

After 2...e6, White can decide not to advance the pawn to d4. to avoid some of the better-known theory. With 3.d3 or 3.Wei, you generally transpose into variations of the King's Indian Attack, which is arrived at with the following moves: £113, g3, Ag2. O-O, d3, Nbd2 and e4. The precise or- der of the moves is usually not so im- portant. It is so named because White is playing a King's Indian Defence with colours reversed.

This is a direct, but not completely sound attempt to immediately attack the e4-pawn. Played by Owen and Bird as far back as the second half of the 19th century, this variation has always been viewed with a certain suspicion. It had a brief revival in the 1970s, when it was played with a new idea: an exchange sacrifice. However, it was soon discovered that White gains a concrete advantage with correct play, and the variation returned to obscurity.

The move sequence 1.e4 c5 2.2\f3 e6
3.d4 cxd4 4.0xd4 a6 leads to one of
the oldest positions in the Sicilian De- fence. It was used in several of Adolf Anderssen's games in the middle part of the 19th century, and by Louis Paulsen towards the end of the same century. However, it only started to become popular from the beginning of the 1950s onwards, due to good results achieved by the Soviet player Ilya Kan. It is statistically one of the best lines for Black in the Sicilian. Though this is in part a comment on its objective worth, it also reflects the fact that the Kan is greatly appreciated by strong players, who find its flexibility attractive. There is sometimes a little confusion about the nomenclature of the 'sister' Taimanov and Paulsen variations, in part because of possible transpositions. Both Kan and Mark Taimanov were more recent players than Paulsen, and Sicilian Defence- Kan Variation so it was natural that until the 1960s opening theory would include their contributions within the Paulsen Varia- tion. However, as theory developed each variation acquired its own name, even if this is not consistently observed by opening manuals. After 1.e4 5 2.063 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.0xd4, we will use the following names:
4...a6 - Kan Variation;
4...Ac6 - Paulsen-Taimanov;
4.06 S.Ac3 a6 6.Re2 Age7 -
Taimanov (in the strict sense);
4..Ac6 5.0c3 a6 6.2e2 Re7 -
Paulsen (in the strict sense). From what we have said so far, you will now realize how subtle the distinctions are. For example, when playing the Kan, Black only needs to play ...Ac6 and he will suddenly find himself in the Paulsen-Taimanov variation. It is interesting to know that in the past the Paulsen Variation used to be reached almost exclusively via the Kan (4...a6). Nowadays, black players more com- monly prefer to reach the Paulsen through 4...2c6. This trend is also be- cause modern players, who are well- versed in the intricacies of the Kan, like to develop the b8-knight to c6. Other- wise, its placement there is delayed. To make matters even more confusing, it should be remembered that when Black plays ...d6 (either after 4...a6 or after 4...Ac6 5.43) and develops the bishop to e7, he transposes to the Scheveningen Variation. This is some- thing that happens often, as in this way Black avoids the dangers associated with the Keres Attack. Sicilian Defence - Kon Variation Sicilian Defence Kan Variation

This is not such a natural-looking move; generally we are advised to place the bishops on open diagonals. However, in this case there are many advantages that come with this move. Substantially, it is a question of tim- ing: by defending the e4-pawn with the bishop, White postpones the de- velopment of the knight to 3, to re- serve the option of c2-c4 for a more opportune moment than the 5th move. Nonetheless, this flexible developing move allows White, if he wants, to still develop the knight to c3, transposing to common variations of the Scheve- ningen in which the d3-bishop can be- come a threat after pawn advances to f4 and e5. Moreover, in some variations the white queen - unobstructed by a bishop on e2 - can relocate directly to the kingside. After 5.2d3, Black has an ample choice of moves besides 5...d6, which is one of many ways to transpose to the Scheveningen Variation. Some of the available moves are: 5...b5, 5...b6,
5...Be7 or even 5...d5, which until not

Afi W BA A Bringing about the classic Maroczy Bind pawn formation (pawns on e4 and c4) and Black responds by taking up the Hedgehog Defence pawn formation. It is true that White loses time with the manoeuvre "d4-b5-c3 (or a3) in com- parison to sister systems that are brought about by the English Opening, the Sicilian Kan Variation, or the Queen's Indian Defence. However, it is not uncommon for Black to move the knight from cé to d7 by way of b8! As you will have noted, the slow ma- noeuvring style of play which is typical of these variations, is the appropriate way to handle all Hedgehog-like forma- tions, even if they are produced by dif- ferent openings. It is only when White attacks b6 with @Ne3 and Rb3 that the variations have their own specific fea- tures. The importance of White's space ad- vantage was overestimated in the past. In practice, Black's position has proved to be difficult to attack; either with gradual manoeuvres, where White maintains his space advantage; or with aggressive attempts in which White tries to attack Black's king with his f and g-pawns. In response to the latter ap- proach, Black's usual counter-measure is an opportune pawn advance ...d5. If White plays g2-g4, the manoeuvre .-h6, ...Ah7 and ...g5 is also effective. When White plays the more solid f2-f3 and takes counter-measures against Black's ...d5 pawn break with Nh1 and £1, Black has the interesting sequence ...e7-d8-c7; or, alternatively, ...Nh8, ..Hg8 and then ...g5-g4 to undermine the white pawn chain.

12. Dc3-e2
we have a position which is different to the classic isolated d-pawn positions. Here the pawn has advanced to d4. Black has gained a good space advan- tage and control of the d5-square. White maintains a minimal plus, but it is difficult to gain anything concrete, as is apparent from the unusually high draw rate. Sicilian Defence - Four Knights Variation Therefore, on the whole, this variation is good for a Black player who is happy to draw. If Black wants to fight for the full point, then the percentage of victories for Black (10%) is certainly not encourag- ing. This is particularly clear when it is compared to the overall win rate of 29 % for the Sicilian, higher than for any other of Black's defences, and testimony to the Sicilian's combative nature.

It is true that Black has a weak pawn on d5 and is without his dark squared bishop. However, after the usual se- quence
10. Af1-d3 O-O
11. O-O d5-d4
12. Cx3-e2
we have a position which is different to the classic isolated d pawn positions. Here the pawn has advanced to d4. Black has gained a good space advan- tage and control of the dS -square. White maintains a minimal plus, but it is difficult to gain anything concrete, as is apparent from the unusually high draw rate. Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1 g5 28.2xc8 Hhxc8 29.3b5 bé

pra The most popular minor variation in response to 2...d6 is 3.2b5+. White reaches quiet positions, which are com- paratively unexplored. However, it is important to have a positional under- standing of the various pawn structures that can occur, White's percentage of wins is not ex- traordinary, and the high number of draws is an indication of the line's so- lidity. The following three are all plansible continuations: 3...2d7, 3...0c6 and

Sicilian Defence - Four Knights Variation Setting up the Maréczy Bind pawn for- mation (pawns on c4 and e4) either im- mediately or after 5.O-O, is even more justifiable here than usual, as there is no light-squared bishop that can become bad. However, Black can get perfectly playable positions by fianchettoing along the lines of an Accelerated Dragon, or advancing the pawn to e6 and establish- ing a Hedgehog Defence. For example, Black has no problems after

On d7 the bishop supports the knight on c6 and it is ready to go to cé6 after the exchange of the enemy's knight in the centre, which is a move that always makes Black's po- sition less cramped. This variation en- joys particularly good results, perhaps because of its surprise effect. An excel- lent idea for White is to use an English Attack set-up (f3, g4, h4, 2e3, O-O-O), in which the d7 bishop is less useful than in other Sicilian variations. Sicilian Defence - Minor Variations is another rare variation which has a surprisingly high win rate. It was used a few times by Bent Larsen. However, it should come as no surprise that it does well, given that ...@bd7 is a natural de- veloping move in the Sicilian, and therefore should be perfectly playable.

Black has the two bishops, usu- ally he castles queenside and grabs space on that flank. In conclusion, the Richter-Rauzer is a variation that does not involve forced tactical lines, which are common in the Dragon, the Najdorf and the Sozin. It is strategically subtle and complex, and it is thus well suited to players who ex- pect to win by virtue of their better general understanding of the game.

producing a pawn structure which is common in these variations. White seeks to put the c6-pawn under pres- sure with the advance g2-g3, .&fl-h3 and the manoeuvre #Jc3-e2-f4), in order to force Black to play ...c6-eS with a resulting weakness on dS. Black has the two bishops, usu- ally he castles queenside and grabs space on that flank. In conclusion, the Richter-Rauzer is a variation that does not involve forced tactical lines, which are common in the Dragon, the Najdorf and the Sorin. It is strategically subtle and complex, and it is thus well suited to players who ex- pect to win by virtue of their better general understanding of the game.

fte6 54.*c3 d4 Sicilian Defence Dragon Variation
1.64 c5 2.213 d6 3.d4 cxd4
4.2:xd4 D6 5.23 g6
The name Dragon came about at the be- ginning of the 20th century and it was the happy brainchild of the Ukrainian master Fedor Duz-Khotimirsky. He was crazy about astronomy, and he noted that there was an analogy between the form of the pawn structure d6-e7-f7-g6-h7 and the dragon-shaped Draco Constella- tion; as a result, the fire-breathing beast of Greek mythology finds itself back in chess opening theory. As mentioned before, the modern ver- sion of the Dragon with the move order
2...d6 and 5...g6 did not make its debut
until 1924, when it was employed in a Réti-Tartakower game played in New York. It was created as a means of preventing the Mardczy Bind (5.c4), which White can use against the Accel- erated Dragon (2...@cé6 and 4...g6).

meant, that this move sequence was not very attractive for black players wishing to fianchetto on the kingside. The name Dragon came about at the be- ginning of the 20th century and it was the happy brainchild of the Ukrainian master Fedor Duz-Khotimirsky. He was crazy about astronomy, and he noted that there was an analogy between the form of the pawn structure d6-e7-f7-g6-h7 and the dragon-shaped Draco Constella- tion; as a result, the fire-breathing beast of Greek mythology finds itself back in chess opening theory. As mentioned before, the modern ver- sion of the Dragon with the move order

until 1924, when it was employed in a Reti-Tartakower game played in New York.

This variation, characterized by black pawns on e6 and dé, which control many squares on the Sth rank, can also be reached by playing Black's 2nd and Sth moves in reverse order; in particu- lar, if Black dislikes the possible simpli- fication with 3.2b5+. It is currently very popular, especially with top level players. It had its official debut in 1923, when Euwe used it against Mardéczy in the Dutch town of Scheveningen, which is how it got its name. As with other variations of the Open Sicilian (when White advances his pawn to d4), Black is left with an extra centre pawn. The e6 and dé-pawns perform a defen- sive role and Black's counterplay is fo- cused on the queenside along the c-file; and the use of the a- and b-pawns, which are generally played to a6 and bS, but sometimes the a-pawn goes di- rectly to aS. For his part, White has a good space advantage and this allows him to implement a number of strate- gies, marked by their varying degrees of aggressiveness. However, most of the time, White concentrates on kingside play and he usually limits himself to preventive measures on the queenside (such as a2-a4, to stop ...b7- bS). All of this means that the Scheveningen produces positions which are strategi- cally highly complex. They are also more flexible than, for example, the comparatively rigid Dragon Variation, even if in some variations of the Scheveningen - such as the Velimirovic Attack - there are also long sequences of forced moves that leave little space for personal interpretation. Another ex- ample of the Scheveningen's greater flexibility is evident when you compare it with its sister variation, the Najdorf, to which there are many transpositions. The fact that ...a7-a6 has not yet been played allows for more options in some lines. For example, it is not uncommon to develop the bishop to cé via d7, after the exchange of knights on d4. Black also has an advantage compared to the Najdorf in the lines where White develops his king's bishop to c4, as Black can immediately put White's cen- tre under pressure; for example, with the manoeuvre @b8-a6-c5, from where the knight can defend e6 and possibly be exchanged for the bishop on b3.

In reality, most of the time you will reach it via the Najdorf when nA is the most popular move for Black. It has its advantages and disadvantages. White's initiative is slowed down, in the sense that if he wants to play h2-h4 and g4-g5 he must first defend the rook on hl, and when the pawn advance takes place, the h8-rook can play a more active role. In addition, the extra tempo that is gained allows Black to make the thematic pawn ad- vance ...d6-d5.

Alternatively, Black can push his pawn to eS, which simplifies, and gives Black a playable position, even if there are fewer prospects of winning. Another modern set-up, which in the past was underestimated, is for Black to develop his knight to d7 instead of cé. It is certainly more passively placed here and has less influence on the centre. However, if Black manages to success- fully complete his development, he can then relocate it actively on c5, or on the c4-square via b6. Of the many plans and strategies avail- able, we will look at the main line, by which we mean the line that is most of- ten played in tournaments:

Le 2Wen & In this section we will discuss the varia- tions in which White plays Nc4 on the 6th move against the Scheveningen, the Najdorf, or the Classical Sicilian. It is evident that there are many strategic similarities and transpositions, and thus it seemed logical to look at them to- gether rather than in the respective sec- tions for each variation. The develop- ment of the bishop to c4 gives a clear strategic quality to each variation. The Russian master Veniamin Sozin (1896-1956), whose name has become attached to this system, was not the first to play 6,.2c4. You can see examples of it being played occasionally in some 19th century games. However, Sozin was the first to show what White's best plan is in some games that were played in the 1930s. This plan is to combine 2c4 with the advance f2-f4 and a pos- sible further advance to f5, in order to rapidly apply pressure on e6, and thus add some sense to the development of the bishop to the a2-g8 diagonal, where it would otherwise be less influential. It is not without reason that the game plan of the highly popular English At- tack, ie. the pawn advances f2-f3, g2-g4 and h2-h4, does not include the development of the bishop to c4, and indeed in the Sozin this pawn configu- ration proves to be largely ineffective. The only exception, in this sense, is the main line of the Dragon, in which this set-up does include Nc4. However, in this case the bishop only has the pro- phylactic role of preventing ...d6-d5. Another great advocate of the deploy- ment of the fI-bishop to c4 during the 1960s was the future 11th World Champion, Bobby Fischer, who came up with many new ideas for White - and for Black! In recognition of his many contributions, some experts at- tach his name to Sozin's when denoting the whole system. However, we will call it by its usual name. Fischer Attack

Sicilian Defence - Sozin-Velimirovic Attack White's idea is to prepare queenside castling while keeping control of g4, to be able to push the g-pawn without the need to play f2-f3. It became pop- ular in 1965, following some brilliant victories by its creator, the Yugoslav GM Dragoljub Velimirovic. It was sometimes played by Fischer; he used this variation in a famous game with Larsen in 1970, which he lost. This aggressive line has never achieved the popularity of the Richter-Rauzer: probably because most players prefer not to play such a one-dimensional line, and instead would rather play something strategically more com- plex. Black generally continues with

This is a prophylactic move, which is necessary to be able to play g2-g4. Now Black must choose. He can leave the king in the middle and play on the queenside with 10...a5, exchanging it for the bishop on b3, but this leaves White with the strong knight on d4. Instead, Black can immediately play
10...O-O. In the latter case, White's plan
is the brutal manoeuvre g2-g4, Ehi-gi-g3-h3 and, then g4-g5, Re2-h5-h7 checkmate! However, Black will not just sit there twiddling his thumbs, and in practice it is difficult to pull this off. A) 11. g2-94 This is best met by

Sicilian Defence Najdorf Variation
1.e4 c5 2.4f3 d6 3.d4 cxd4
4.2\xd4 Q 6 5.2.c3 a6
The advance ...a7-a6 on the 5th move is the move that defines the Najdorf Vari- ation. It has become the most popular of all Sicilian variations. This is hardly a surprise, as it was the mythical cham- pion Bobby Fischer's favourite choice during the 1960s and 1970s. In addi- tion, from the 1980s on, Gary Kasparov used it almost exclusively. Champion players have always dictated chess open- ing fashion. We may not be able to play like these guys, but we can at least play their openings! Played by Esteban Canal as far back as 1929 (1), 5...a6 was also used by the Czechoslovakian Karel Opocensky in the 1930s. It became popular in the 1940s and acquired its name in honour of the Polish-Argentinian player Miguel Najdorf (1910-1997), one of the stron- gest non-Soviet players after the Second World War. Sicilian Defence - Najdorf Variation We are dealing with a very flexible con- cept: Black plays the move ...a6, which is always useful in the Sicilian; he main- tains the option to advance the pawn to e6 (transposing to the Scheveningen) or to eS, depending on the circumstances and the personal taste of the player. This is Kasparov's approach, and he generally opted for ...e6 when White chose posi- tional continuations such as 6.2e2. Fischer, on the other hand, preferred to remain in the spirit of Najdorf with the thematic pawn advance to e5. You should note that the move 5...a6 is played to make ...e7-e5 possible with- out receiving check on bS: if 5...eS is played immediately, it gives the white knight advantageous access to the fS-square, as explained in the section on minor variations after 2...d6. A reader may well ask why a move like ..e5 is so important in the Najdorf, given the hole it creates on d5? The answer lies in the fact that the Najdorf is at heart an ambitious line that aims to put the e4-pawn under pressure! In the Open Sicilian, with the white d-pawn gone, and the f-pawn on f4, the 'poor' e-pawn is subject to attack by the adversary's pieces. When the hypermodernists provocatively claimed that
1.e4 was an error, they may have been par-
tially correct! Black blocks the path of the e4-pawn with ...e5, preventing that extra step forward that is so dangerous in the standard variations: he then exchanges on f4 and begins to attack it with ...b5 to develop the bishop to b7, with ..@d7-cS and sometimes with ...He8. in some exemplary games by Fischer and other Najdorf experts this plan is carried out brilliantly.

Chess Opening Essentials - Volume 1 Naturally, the ...e5 push does not always work in Black's favour. It does not take much to find yourself in strategically lost positions, as some of the young Karpov's adversaries discovered the hard way. That said, it is understandable that 6.2g5 was the first and most pop- ular anti-Najdorf continuation, since with the f6-knight already pinned, the move 6...e5 creates a weakness on d5 which is more easily exploitable by White than in the other variations.

xaswee & This Classical Variation is becoming more and more popular. White simply wants to develop naturally before start- ing to play actively. The ensuing lines are of a positional nature, but this does not necessarily mean that they are easier to handle: as in its sister variation in the Scheveningen, tactical play usually starts after the opening phase. Yet again, Black has basically two choices: A) to play e6, transposing to the Scheveningen (see the Scheveningen section for a detailed examination); B) to continue with the thematic
6...e5. We have already elaborated on
the advantages and disadvantages of this pawn advance.

Each ofthese produces complicated po- sitions that contain plenty of possibili- ties for both players. Generally, White seeks to exploit the weakness of the d5-square, and is careful to limit Black's counterplay. He then aims to create a kingside initiative with the pawn ad- vance f2-f4. Sometimes, an alternative strategy is to occupy the d5-square with the knight, to recapture with the e4-pawn and then to make the most of his queenside pawn majority with the pawn advances b2-b4 and c2-c4-c5.

xaswea x This move was barely dealt with, if at all, in the old opening tomes. It underwent a sudden boom in the 1990s, and is now one of the most commonly played moves. As it was introduced by Murray Chan- dler, Nigel Short and John Nunn in the 1980s, it was to become known as the English Attack. White prepares for Rd2 and O-O-O fol- lowed by f2-f3 (more rarely by f2-f4) and g2-g4, with an initiative on the kingside. Black has fundamentally three continu- ations at his disposal: 6...e6, 6...e5 and
6... Dg4.
A) 6. e7-e6 is the most popular, but leads into the realms of the Scheveningen Variation (see that section). Sicilian Defence - Najdorf 6.2.3 B) 6. e7-e5 A response in pure Najdorf style. Now White can retreat the knight to a solid position on f3, with the plan to castle kingside and limit Black's queenside counterplay with a2-a4-a5, or White may choose the more aggressive and more frequently played

rasBen &x Now we have a position that is difficult to evaluate. It is easy to see why people have such differing views about this line: Black has lost a tempo to move the knight toa fairly unstable position on g4. On the other hand, White has moved his bishop four times to put it on g3, whereas his adversary's bishop has already taken control of the long dark-squared diagonal. Naturally, the price Black pays for his piece activity is the strategically doubtful advance of his g- and h-pawns, which denies the black king a quiet refuge on the kingside. However, this assessment is academic and should not be seen as immutable: it is not rare in practice that Black, having taken control of the centre, will use his g- and h-pawns to apply pressure on White's castled king's position!

z ree x The last of the alternatives is the old main line 6.@g5. Though it is not so commonly played now, its appeal re- mains unaltered. The move was very popular from the 1950s until the 1980s - or more pre- cisely, the line that continues with 7.f4 was by far the most common variation. With the advent of a burgeoning amount of theory, creative players started to look for alternatives in unex- plored areas, as they had become tired of the fact that memory was becoming as important a factor as understanding. For this reason, the move 6.2g5 was to become a rarity in the 1990s, at least at the higher levels. However, lower-level players have always continued to show a marked preference for this historically important and fascinating variation. Their choice is probably inspired by the hope of a quick checkmate or of en- Sicilian Defence - Najdorf 6.295 countering an unprepared adversary. In the first years of the new millennium there has been a return of interest at the higher levels. This is perhaps because the quantity of theory for the so-called minor variations has now also reached disturbing proportions. After

After 7.f4 there is a major crossroads: Black has a healthy choice from six major continuations which are all perfectly playable, plus two minor lines (7...2d7 and 7...h6). All of these have a lot of related theory and they are strategically very divergent as well; small wonder that 6.2g5 is a daunting prospect for the lazy player! A) 7. Ab8-c6 The most recent of the alternatives is now part of established theory.

& W a. The last of the alternatives is the old main line 6.Ag5. Though it is not so commonly played now, its appeal re- mains unaltered. The move was very popular from the 1950s until the 1980s - or more pre- cisely, the line that continues with 7.f4 was by far the most common variation. With the advent of a burgeoning amount of theory, creative players started to look for alternatives in unex- plored areas, as they had become tired of the fact that memory was becoming as important a factor as understanding. For this reason, the move 6.JLg.5 was to become a rarity in the 1990s, at least at the higher levels. However, lower-level players have always continued to show a marked preference for this historically important and fascinating variation.

The Poisoned Pawn Variation first ap- peared in tournament play in the 1950s and it was at first underestimated, in part due to the brilliant victories with the white pieces obtained by Keres and Tal.

We have already seen this manoeuvre in the Richter-Rauzer, and we will see it again in Variation F2 1 with 1 O.fi.d3 - see below. F2) 8. ... Rd8-c7 The most frequent response. It prevents

Now White can continue with Velimirovic's sacrifice 12.4kl5!?, which is interesting but probably unsound: (please go to the appendix to look at the brilliant victory by Velimirovic when he first uncorked his sacrifice). However, White is not forced to play this sacrifice and he can play the quieter 1 2 ,Rg3

We find ourselves confronted with an- other big dilemma for White: 10.-fi.d3 or 10.g4? F21) 10. fif1-d3 Moving the last undeveloped piece to a natural square and inaugurating a strat- egy of central play.

(12 .O-O-O had its trial by fire in the first Spassky-Fischer match, in Reykjavik 1972), the sacrifice on dS becomes even more dangerous. However, it should not worry Black too much; pro- vided that he is well prepared! F22) 10. g2-g4 A standard attacking move in the Sicil- jan. In this situation, there are two prob- lems: the bishop on g5 obstructs g4-g5 and Black can still castle queenside, thwarting, at least partly, White's pawn storm. Therefore White is required to take en- ergetic measures before Black can qui- etly complete his development.
